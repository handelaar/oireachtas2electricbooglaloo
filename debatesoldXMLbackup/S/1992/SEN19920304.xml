      <P>On behalf of the members of the House I would like to extend a warm welcome to the members of the parliamentary delegation from France who have joined us here this afternoon. We are indeed very glad to have them in the Seanad.  I would like on your behalf to wish them every success and an enjoyable trip for the rest of their stay in Ireland as they move on tomorrow to Counties Tipperary and Clare and on Friday to County Galway.</P>

      <P>I have notice from Senator Fitzgerald that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Health to provide extra funding to the Southern Health Board for the staffing of a dialysis unit in Tralee General Hospital.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to recognise and deal with the urban deprivation and absence of opportunity in life which is contributing to <Col N="994" /> the high levels of urban crime in sections of our cities and towns.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Doyle of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health to provide funds for the provision of permanent residential accommodation for the old and infirm of Wexford town and surrounding area.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Brendan Ryan of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Social Welfare to clarify, in the light of recent reports, the interpretation by his Department of the requirement that recipients of unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit be genuinely seeking work.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Fitzgerald, Neville, Doyle and Ryan as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected Senator Fitzgerald's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Neville, Doyle and Ryan may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business for today is as follows.  From now until 6 p.m. all Stages of the Merchant Shipping Bill. There will be a sos from 6 p.m. to 6.30 p.m.  From 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m. we will take Item No. 20, Motion No. 49, which is the Indepenent motion.  From 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. we take the Electoral (No.2) Bill, Second Stage, to conclude.</P>

      <P>Before I call Senators on the Order of Business, I want to clarify one point in relation to Item No. 20, Motion No. 49.  Since my ruling last Thursday on the Order of Business there have been doubts about whether the motion is <i>sub judice.</i>  In the interim I have given careful consideration to the <i>sub judice</i> aspect of the subject matter of this motion and indeed I have had informal consultation with legal experts. I have now decided that, as the matter <Col N="995" /> rests, the motion as it appears on the Order Paper is in order for debate today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>May I thank you, a Chathaoirligh.  I think it is most gracious of you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>May I join with you, a Chathaoirligh, in welcoming our French colleagues to the Upper Chamber of the Irish Parliament today.  They are indeed welcome.  I thank you also for the clarification you have just given the House in relation to the Private Members' Business tonight.  May I make a plea that we all spend a full day discussing this important issue as soon as we have the Supreme Court judgement?  I think it would be far more constructive.  I would hope that, even at this stage, we could have an indication from the Leader of the House of his willingness to allow us a full day to put our views on the record and, hopefully, get a ministerial response to this most important issue that has been with us now for some weeks.</P>
      <P>May I also ask tht we be allowed time in the immediate future to discuss the discrepancies in the two reports in Greencore? Some £1.5 million of taxpayers' money later, all we have is confusion.  It is most important that this House gives as much time as is needed to clarify this matter and that we get the Minister for Industry and Commerce to come to the House to respond to our many concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past number of weeks I have raised with the Leader of the House on a number of occasions &mdash; and it has been raised on all sides &mdash; the need to have a debate on the situation in Northern Ireland.  I have calculated that since we began asking for this debate almost 20 people have been killed &mdash; assassinated, murdered &mdash; in the North. Again, in the last number of hours a man going about his work, a worker doing his business either because he was working or because he was of a particular religion, has been blown to pieces.  We need to address this matter, not just as a sterile debate but in an attempt to see how this <Col N="996" /> House could contribute to the process of peace.  I put it to the Leader that it is an urgent matter and is something we should address quickly.</P>
      <P>I would also put it to you, a Chathaoirligh, that we had a fairly detailed debate on the Maastricht proposals, but that was a debate that took place almost too late to have any serious imput to the Government position.  I now suggest that the import of the decisions taken at Maastricht are worthy of consideration and that we need to open the discussion on it.  That discussion should begin in this House.  Therefore, we should ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs &mdash; it is a new Minister now &mdash; for a return visit to go through in detail and respond on the implications of the amendments to the Treaty of Rome which we accepted and agreed at Maastricht.  That is critical.</P>
      <P>The final issue I want to raise is something, the Leader himself referred to during the course of his response last week, namely, the decisions, the proposals or the agreements &mdash; whichever is the appropriate word &mdash; on changes to the procedures of the House.  I hesitate to use the word &ldquo;reform&rdquo; of the Seanad because it implies something like the debate we had.  We need to begin at the beginning and we should now look to implementing &mdash; at a slow rate if necessary, but certainly at some rate &mdash; the valid proposals that were put to us during the course of the debate on reform of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for time to be made available for a debate on the various Greencore reports.  I am making this call so that we can debate the discrepancies in these reports and, in particular, so that we can consider the implications of these reports for the food industry and the ways in which the damage this kind of report can do to the food industry can be limited.  In addition, may I also ask whether at some stage it might be possible to have a debate on communications in Ireland and in particular a debate on the manner in which Telecom Éireann deal with their customers who run into difficulties in <Col N="997" /> relation to their capacity to pay their bills?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with you and others in extending <i>bienvenu en Irlande a nos amis francais</i></P>
      <P>I join with others in asking that we debate the matter of Greencore and in particular the report of the High Court inspectors and indeed the other reports? As you are aware, we gave Greencore very serious consideration when we debated the Bill in this House and I think it is now appropriate that we should return to the matter in the light of all the things which have been said in recent days.</P>
      <P>My other request to the Leader is: when does he intend to take Item No. 8, the one which refers to the Industrial Policy Review Group, the so-called Culliton report?  We have asked for a debate on this on several occasions in the past few weeks and perhaps the Leader would indicate when it is intended to take it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he could facilitate an early debate on the Culliton report and encompassing in that the whole question of unemployment.  I would like the Leader, pending that debate, to convey my concern to the new Minister for Labour about the suggestion to set up agencies abroad to take young people to the Continent of Europe.  I am concerned that through that scheme we might be exporting the very people with the potential to create jobs here and I ask the Leader of the House to say to the Minister that he should be cautions about this. We should have a debate on unemployment in the Seanad and the Dáil and this should deal with the jobs forum before a decision is taken that could drain the country of the young people who could create jobs for us in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Leader of the House if he could ensure that the State Guarantees Act, 1954 (Amendment of Schedule) Order, 1992, which is being debated in the other Houses, could be brought to this House as a matter <Col N="998" /> of urgency next week?  As the House is probably aware, there is a major £20 million port development being held up for a location in Waterford.  The need for the passing of this measure is extremely urgent indeed and I ask the Leader to ensure that this Bill is brought to the House as a matter of urgency next week.</P>
      <P>I also join with my colleagues in welcoming our French colleagues here this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business on Wednesday, 26 February, I referred to newspaper reports that the chairman of the Irish Wheelchair Association could not gain access to Kildare House for a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies.  It has since emerged that the chairman was given facilities to enter the House via the elevator in the underground car park in that building. The chairman has since written to the committee apologising for his remarks in that regard and I am delighted to set the record straight in Seanad Éireann today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesHanafin" hpid="Mr. Hanafin Mr. Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I request the Leader of the House to agree with the proposal of Senator Doyle, and hopefully with the approval of Senator Brendan Ryan and Senator Norris, that this motion will not be taken until such time as we have available the findings of the Supreme Court.  I hope the Independent Senators will agree with that.  I think it would lend itself to a better debate.</P>
      <P>There was also a request for a debate on the Greencore matter.  I would suggest that as it is likely that there will be court proceedings no such debate would take place until the court proceedings.  At the moment all that is involved are allegations. When we are taking the debate I would suggest to the Leader of the House that we might give some time also to deal with the amount of money being sought by the investigators and the time they took to complete the investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>Today is Ash Wednesday and, in response to the call from Trócaire for an increased percentage <Col N="999" /> of our GNP to be given towards alleviation of poverty in Third World countries, I ask the Leader to convey to the Government our wish that a higher percentage of our GNP be given for that purpose as we are the lowest donor among the OECD countries in this connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>You very kindly ruled, Sir, that the motion in my name and that of Senator Norris is in order.  May I ask you to confirm that you have also concluded the amendment is in order?  I cannot make head or tail of the amendment. It seems to me the House is perfectly free not to discuss our motion if it wishes, instead of putting down a meaningless amendment to say we should not have a discussion about what we are going to discuss for three hours.  That is my answer to Senator Hanafin.  If the House does not want to discuss our motion it is perfectly entitled to decide not to.  I have no intention of withdrawing the motion.  What I believe now, I believed ten years ago.  The Supreme Court will not deal with the substantial issue but with the specific issue.</P>
      <P>I would like, as I have often done, to remind the House yet again that we need to talk about what we are doing to the unemployed &mdash; not what we are going to do for them if we change all the things we are going to change but what happens to them every day, including the now daft provision that if you live in the wrong part of the country and you are too well qualified, you are disqualified from social welfare.  By this process we will end up with larger urban ghettoes than we have already.  We need a specific and detailed debate on the way the social welfare systems treats 250,000 people.  It deserves our consideration.  I repeat that is not the same as a debate on industrial policy, job creation or anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with other speakers in asking the Leader of the House to agree to an early debate on the problems in the North of Ireland. In so doing I ask the House to compliment <Col N="1000" /> the Church leaders on the initiative taken by them.  I only can see good coming from the subject being discussed in this House.  If we have a forum and we do not use it, then we leave a vacuum for people who believe they have the support to continue the struggle by murder and other foul deeds.  I totally agree with other speakers and ask the Leader of the House to arrange as soon as possible a debate in which all the Members of the House will have an opportunity to condemn the men of violence who have given this island a bad name by continuing a campaign which is not acceptable to the large majority of the people on the island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to compliment the new Minister for Foreign Affairs on his announcment that he was agreeable to the setting up of a joint committee on foreign affairs.  It is one that many Members have advocated over the past couple of years and I look forward to a strong delegation from the House taking part in it.  I would like to express the hope that the Leader of the House will provide an early opportunity for a discussion on the Culliton report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator McGowan in calling for a debate on the North.  I would also like to pay a tribute to the clergymen in the North who through their spiritual direction and pastoral care are talking to the paramilitaries and the subversives.  I advocated that some time ago in the Seanad but I was frowned on by some people.  I said that until somebody speaks to subversives and gets them to see sense, we will never have peace.  These clergymen deserve all our praise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Merchant Shipping Bill, I think I heard the Leader of the House say that all Stages will be taken today.  I hope there will not be a guillotine imposed on that legislation. It has been already indicated that taking all Stages on one day is a very unsatisfactory way of doing business.  I would like some clarification on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Independents' <Col N="1001" /> motion, I agree with your decision in relation to the <i>sub judice</i> rule.  The Supreme Court has already ruled on he matter and all we are waiting for are the arguments.  The question is whether we want to go ahead with a debate at this time or wait for those arguments.  That is for the movers of the motion to decide. If they wish to wait, there is no problem about debating this issue as far as I can understand.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer the Leader to Motion No. 46, which I raised over the last number of weeks, in relation to a pardon for Nicky Kelly.  I am still waiting for a reply.  I specifically asked the Leader to approach the Minister for Justice. More than four months ago the previous Minister for Justice asked the Attorney General to make a recommendation on whether a pardon should be granted to Nicky Kelly.  In view of the remarks made by the Taoiseach and by the junior Minister in the Department of Justice last week and over the weekend, I feel it would be appropriate since this matter was raised in this forum &mdash; indeed it was in this forum that the Minister for Justice indicated that he would be approaching the Attorney General &mdash; that the Minister for Justice would state where he stands on the issue.  I would be delighted if the Leader of the House could now make a statement on the matter.</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation to unemployment and job creation and Item No. 8 on the Order Paper dealing with the Culliton report, it is high time we had a debate on these issues.  We saw in the opinion poll yesterday that 100 per cent of supporters of virtually every party in the country regard unemployment as the priority issue.</P>

      <P>Speech, Senator.  A question to the Leader, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of that opinion poll in view of the statement made by the Minister for Labour in the context of setting up FÁS centres abroad and since our young people are no longer emigrating voluntarily, can we have a full discussion on some of the issues that have <Col N="1002" /> been raised?  For the last six months at least we have been asking for a major discussion of his tissue.  So far the Leader of the House has indicated that he is in favour of such a discussion but we have not got any firm dates yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the breakdown of the talks on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy in Brussels yesterday may I ask the Leader of the House if an opportunity will be given to this House to debate the Common Agricultural Policy reform because of the serious national consequences if agreement is not reached on these reforms?  I say this because of statements being made by some of the farming organisations. I am not so sure that the representation of the family farmer, particularly in the west of Ireland, is coming through at this stage.  I believe that this House can play a part explaining the opportunities and disadvantages of the reform.  Therefore, such a debate here would be very opportune, seeing that eight nations are prepared to take on board at least the reform programme if not the details of it, but I am a bit taken aback that our farming organisations seem to be going in on the coat tails of the British and the Dutch in this matter. I believe that a debate here on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy would be very productive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with my colleagues who welcomed the French delegation here today, and whether they are gone or not it does not stop me welcoming them.  I was in their National Assembly on a number of occasions. When they get to Galway they will be following in the footsteps of the famous General de Gaulle who paid a much publicised visit there.  As we are talking about people coming here from abroad, may I also extend a welcome to Fr. Donal Doyle, who is here with a large contingent of university students from Sophia University in Tokyo?  Groups of these students have come here to Ireland for a number of years and I have pleasure <Col N="1003" /> in formally welcoming them to the Seanad.</P>
      <P>In relation to motion before the House on Article 43.3.3º I feel very strongly, given the volatility of this issue, that it would be much better if this debate took place when the Supreme Court judgment is available.  We cannot argue that the Supreme Court judgment is irrelevant to this issue.  That is an absurd statement. It is most relevant, and obviously the debate would be much more informed. Consequently, I think we should build up consensus here of agreeing to this debate when at least seven days have passed after that Supreme Court judgment is available so that Members could give adequate weight to this important document.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Doyle in seeking a debate on the Greencore issue.  I ask the Leader of the House to give serious consideration to this and &mdash; the reverse of the situation in this case &mdash; I would welcome an immediate debate.  I do not think we need to look to whether the courts decide to look into this matter, because if the courts decide to look into it the issue will be ruled as <i>sub judice</i> and we may be waiting some months before a debate can take place.  I think we should have that debate soon.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would like to point out the Leader of the House that in recent months meetings have taken place throughout the west of Ireland, arranged by bishops in the west, who are extremely concerned about the appalling problems that exist west of the Shannon.  These meetings have been attended by large numbers of people who are very concerned about policies or lack of policies for that region.  I asked the Leader of the House previously if he would arrange a debate in this House on this question of regional development in the west of Ireland and I would press him in the interest of that part of our country to so arrange that debate.</P>

      <P>I also join with the other speakers in calling at this time for a debate on Northern Ireland.  It is extremely important that that debate should take place at this time particularly in view of the stated decision of the IRA to increase the bombing campaign in England in the run-up to the general election there.  I think any right-minded Irish person&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I also reiterate the call of my colleague, Senator Finneron, last week in asking the Leader of the House to convey to the Minister for Energy the concern of this House and ask for a debate in relation to our energy policy? It appears to be the policy now that Bord na Móna are leaving unprocessed large tracts of land.  In that connection also, I wish to express the concern felt by many people in relation to what would appear to be a very definite decision by the British Nuclear Energy Board&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will decline the Chair's invitation because I have three matters I wish to raise.</P>
      <P>With regard to a group of houses across the road in Merrion Street, would the Leader of the House express concern to the Government about the fate of these very important listed buildings, particularly their interiors, which houses for many years were in possession of the Government?</P>
      <P>I also ask him to convey to the Minister for Foreign Affairs the concern of the House at his visit to Iran.  I do this quite in line with the Order of Business because I have an item on the Supplementary Order Paper dealing specifically with information that has been disclosed to me by Amnesty International who are concerned at continuing human rights abuses in that country.  I would like the Leader of the House to convey that matter to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>On a parallel note, will the Leader confirm there will be no official representation from this House at the St. Patrick's Day parade in New York because the then Cathaoirleach attended the St. Patrick's Day parade there last year where there was a notorious example of discrimination and bigotry.  I hope this appalling insult to human rights will not be repeated by any Member of this House in future&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Tomnafinogue Wood is the last remaining part of these oak woods.  It is a spectacular part of the country.  It is a great shame, if we are serious about out environment, that these woods will be totally felled.  Replanting of the woods that were cut has not worked very well.

      <P>As soon as the Supreme Court judges make their judgment known, we will have a full debate in this <Col N="1008" /> House.  We are well aware that it is one of the few issues in politics on which there has been a very real consensus.  We would like to see that continue.</P>
      <P>I would have to take advice on the Greencore issue.  I understand that a statement may be made in the Dáil this evening that would be relevant to the comments made here today.  Northern Ireland was mentioned by many Senators.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs in his comments last week on the setting up of a committee on foreign affairs has shown he may take a different position on debates in the Houses.  We will continue our efforts to have such a debate with the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Maastricht issue was mentioned by Senator O'Toole.  My understanding is that in the coming week a White Paper will be published and, subject to the Whips agreement, I hope we will be able to have a debate on that very important issue.  From listening to the Order of Business today, it is important that some of the Standing Order changes that have been accepted by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges should be adopted in this House immediately.  It is very difficult for all concerned for the Order of Business to go on the way it is at the moment.  There is a genuine need for change.  I hope that, with all-party agreement, by the end of this month we will have brought in some changes that will be in the interests of the House.</P>
      <P>With regard to employment and industrial policy, I hope that in two weeks time we will be in a position to have a debate on that issue and that the wisdom of this House will be brought to bear on that matter in a positive fashion.</P>

    <P>The Social Welfare Bill will be published in the next week or two and that will afford a chance to this House to discuss some of the issues mentioned. Senator Costello mentioned the Nicky Kelly case.  I assure him I made contact with the Minister in question.  Senator Finneran mentioned the Common Agricultural Policy reforms.  In the next week, subject to the Whips, I hope we will get a chance to discuss that matter.  Insurance costs will be debated.

    <Title>Merchant Shipping Bill, 1991: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to enhance maritime safety by updating existing legislation and introducing new safety measures for vessels.  The Bill will bring the licensing of vessels carrying not more than 12 passengers for reward within the scope of the Merchant Shipping Acts for the first time.  It is a major change in the provisions for safety.  It will also update the level of penalties for offences under existing legislation for vessels carrying more than 12 passengers and enable me to make regulations governing the safety of fishing vessels and pleasure craft.</P>
      <P>Senators will be interested in the background to the Bill.  The Merchant Shipping Acts, which are administered by my Department, apply to vessels which carry more than 12 passengers to sea or on rivers, canals, lakes or estuaries.  They are required to hold a valid passenger certificate and they are subject to annual surveys which are conducted by the marine surveyors of my Department.  The Acts and the rules and regulations made thereunder lay down detailed requirements in respect of safety on board such vessels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Vessels may be inspected at any time by marine surveyors of my Department. Sixty vessels now hold valid passenger certificates.  Many of the certificates apply to vessel operation in smooth or partially smooth waters and are valid for the summer months only.  Improved liaison with the Garda Síochána and the institution <Col N="1010" /> of proceedings against illegal operators have reduced reported cases of overloading.  Publicity campaigns advising persons wishing to take trips on vessels to check that such vessels hold valid passenger certificates and comply with the requirements of those certificates have also served to reduce reported irregularities.</P>
    <P>The major remaining difficulty is the low level of fines being imposed by the courts on the owners or masters of vessels operating illegally.  The fines are not an adequate financial deterrent to the illegal operator and I propose in this Bill to raise these fines substantially.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I propose to introduce a new provision enabling me to make regulations providing for on-the-spot fines for certain offences relating to pleasure craft.  The pleasure craft safety working group will advise me on codes of practice in relation to safety but I see a need for the additional power to provide for on-the-spot fines in certain circumstances.  This I would provide for in a new section 27.</P>
    <P>Vessels which carry 12 passengers or fewer are currently outside the scope of the Merchant Shipping Acts.  These vessels may be licensed by local authorities under the Public Health Acts.  Boatmen's licences may also be issued by local authorities under the same legislation. However, there are no statutory requirements laying down safety standards for these vessels and, therefore, there are no criteria by which local authorities can assess applications for licences.  The token level of fees and fines under the Public Health Acts and the discretionary nature of the licensing powers have resulted in the legislation being less than effective, and moribund in the case of many local authorities.  In this Bill, I propose to bring vessels carrying 12 passengers or fewer within the scope of the Merchant Shipping Acts.</P>
    <P>In relation to the larger passenger ferries, a review of the safety aspects of ferry transport has been ongoing since 1987 when the then Minister established the National Ferry Safety Committee.  This standing committee is chaired by my <Col N="1011" /> Department's chief surveyor and includes representatives from the ferry companies.  The committee reviewed safety procedures and standards on board Irish-registered ferries.  It considers any measures necessary to improve safety and makes recommendations, as appropriate, to the ferry operators and to myself.  Non-Irish-registered ferries calling to Irish ports are subject to periodic inspections carried out in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control to which Ireland is a contracting party.</P>
    <P>A recent Royal National Lifeboat Institution report indicates that the greatest number of accidents around the Irish coast last year were in the pleasure craft and commercial fishing categories, hence the need for improved safety precautions in these sectors.  In the pleasure craft sector my attention has also been drawn to the hazards and the noise posed by jet-skis. I have received complaints that their operators are encroaching on waters used extensively by bathers and children in small craft and thus posing a threat to them and a nuisance to others.  This Bill represents a consolidation and improvement of passenger safety legislation.  It is long overdue and I am sure that Senators will welcome its contents.</P>
    <P>The increasing use of our seas and coastal waters for boating, sailing and other leisure activities is an indication of the potential for development in this area.  We need to develop facilities for pleasure craft, including marinas, if Ireland is to attract its fair share of sailing visitors from overseas and market itself as a centre for major ocean races. However, it saddens me to see the extent to which tragedies occur because of failure to take basic safety precautions.  The unpredictability of Irish weather and the vast power of the sea itself make seafaring hazardous, despite advances in vessel design.  My Department strive to create an awareness of the importance of safety on our waters.  Information, marine notices, booklets and pamphlets on particular aspects of safety are regularly <Col N="1012" /> brought to the attention of those involved.</P>
    <P>While I am extremely pleased with the enhanced public awareness generated by campaigns already undertaken, the updating of the law in this area is necessary if tragic loss of life is to be prevented.  In this connection, the Bill will allow me to make regulations governing the safety of pleasure craft covering, for example, the carriage of life-saving, radio and navigation equipment.  Consultants with the various interest groups in pleasure craft activity by way of a pleasure craft safety working group have already begun as to the type of control needed in this area.</P>
    <P>The expansion of the Irish fishing industry in recent years has been spectacular. While commercial fishing can be a profitable activity it can also be a very hazardous occupation.  My Department have been involved in preparing educational material relating to the safety and operation of fishing vessels. However, as in the case of pleasure craft, I believe that the law in this area needs to be enhanced to ensure as far as possible the protection of the crews of fishing vessels.  This Bill will enable me to make regulations governing the safety of fishing vessels and their crews.  I have by means of a fishing vessel safety working group begun a process of consultation with representatives of the various interest groups involved in the fishing industry.  I will be guided by the views of how working group on the need for and content of the secondary legislation or other measures needed in this area.</P>
    <P>The State's commitment to the rescue of persons in distress at sea has been considerably boosted in the past year. Following the Government's acceptance of most of the recommendations of the Doherty report on Air/Sea Rescue Services a new marine emergency service was established within my Department last May.  The service &mdash; Slánú &mdash; The Irish Marine Emergency Service has assumed responsibility for the operational aspects of maritime safety, rescue, shipwreck and sea and coastal pollution.  A director and chief of operations have been recruited and arrangements <Col N="1013" /> are currently in progress for the integration into the service of the coast radio stations at Valentia and Malin Head, the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre at Shannon and the cliff and coast rescue stations throughout the country. The marine pollution response team, to whom great credit is due for their handling of recent marine incidents where there was a threat of pollution, also comes under the aegis of Slánú.</P>
    <P>In July 1991 an interim medium-range search and rescue helicopter commenced operations out of Shannon on a 24-hour basis.  That helicopter was recently replaced by one specifically equipped to carry out rescues in conditions of very poor visibility.  Since the service came into operation on 15 July 1991 80 rescue missions were carried out resulting in 57 lives being saved.  Many of these missions have been undertaken in atrocious weather conditions around the south, south east and west coasts.  With effect from last July, the Air Corps Dauphin helicopter which had been located at Shannon has been transferred to Finner Camp, County Donegal on a 24-hour response basis.</P>
    <P>The Doherty report also recommended the setting up of a Maritime Safety Consultative Committee and working groups covering safety on fishing vessels, pleasure craft and other vessel types to come under the aegis of the committee.  The main objective of the committee and its working groups is to keep me aware at all times of the concerns of the maritime community.  The membership of the four safety working groups, that is, in addition to the National Ferry Safety Committee of which I spoke earlier, comprise maritime industry and interest group representatives.</P>
    <P>The role of each working group is &ldquo;to review safety procedures and standards on Irish vessels in its sector; to consider measures necessary to improve safety in these areas and to make recommendations to the Maritime Safety Consultative Committee; to consider legislative or other proposals, for example non-statutory codes of practice to improve standards or conditions in the <Col N="1014" /> sector; to consider safety matters referred to the Working Group by the Minister or his officials for observations; to consider complaints or proposals for improvement made by interest groups or other persons operating in the sector and where appropriate, to submit them to the Maritime Safety Consultative Committee; to submit an annual report to the Committee.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The fishing vessel and pleasure craft safety working groups are paying particular attention to the Bill before the House and will advise me, on an ongoing basis, through the Maritime Safety Consultative Committee of the measures to be regulated.  This accounts for the Bill providing me with enabling powers to make regulations in relation to fishing vessels and pleasure craft.  The preliminary meetings of the fishing vessel and pleasure craft safety working groups have already been held: those relating to public service vessels and merchant vessels will be held at an early date.  This Bill provides me with the powers to make regulations and the committees will advise on the appropriate regulations.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned at the dangers posed by submarine movements in the fishing grounds around our coast.  My Department's chief surveyor at the most recent meeting of the International Maritime Organisation's General Assembly, proposed a resolution on the avoidance by submerged submarines of fishing vessels and their crews.  The purpose of the Irish resolution, which was passed unanimously, is two-fold: first, to ensure that submarines navigating through areas where vessels are known to fish, use all available means for determining the presence of such vessels and their fishing gear, and second, to ensure that a submerged submarine, if information on the presence of a fishing vessel and its fishing gear is available, will avoid that fishing vessel and any fishing gear connected with it.</P>
    <P>The International Maritime Organisation is asking its members to bring these recommendations to the attention of submarine commanders and to develop local arrangements to promote safety in areas used by submarines and <Col N="1015" /> fishing vessels.  By raising this issue at the highest level in the International Maritime Organisation my intention is to focus the attention of the international maritime community on the problem and to stress the need for constant vigilance if a major tragedy is to be avoided.</P>
    <P>I should now like to say a few words about the principal provisions of the Bill. Part I deals with the standard provisions of a Bill.  Part II deals with vessels carrying more than 12 passengers and which are defined as &ldquo;passengers ships&rdquo;.  Section 6 provides that passenger ships shall be surveyed at least once each year.  Section 7 provides that this survey shall be carried out by a duly appointed surveyor of ships and also by a radio surveyor if the ship is required to be provided with a radiotelegraph or radiotelephone installation who shall provide the owner of the vessel with a declaration of survey, if satisfied that it is in order to do so.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that the Minister for the Marine, on receipt of the declaration of survey, shall issue a passenger ship's certificate to the owner, stating the limits, if any, beyond which the vessel shall not ply and the maximum number of passengers that the vessel shall carry.  The certificate shall be subject to such conditions and restrictions as the Minister may impose.  A certificate shall remain in force for a maximum period of one year. The Minister may refuse to grant a certificate where the owner has been previously convicted of a safety related offence.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides that the Minister for the Marine may revoke a certificate in cases where there has been an error in the declaration of survey, where false or misleading information has been given or where the condition of the vessel has changed since its survey.  The Minister may revoke or suspend a certificate if its terms have not been fulfilled.</P>
    <P>Section 10 requries the passenger certificate, or a copy thereof, to be displayed in a position in the vessel so that it is both visible and legible to all on board.  Section 11 provides that a person shall not make a false or fraudulent declaration of survey <Col N="1016" /> or certificate nor alter such declaration or certificate.  Section 12 provides that a vessel shall not operate as a passenger ship unless there is a certificate in force in relation to that vessel.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides that a vessel shall not operate as a passenger ship without insurance and that the owner shall provide a copy of the certificate of insurance to the Minister for the Marine.  The certificate of insurance, or a copy thereof, shall also be clearly displayed on the vessel.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with vessels carrying not more than 12 passengers for reward, and defined as &ldquo;passenger boats&rdquo;.  Section 14 provides that a vessel shall not be used as a passenger boat unless there is a licence in force in relation to that vessel.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides that the Minister for the Marine, on the application of the owner of a vessel, shall grant a passenger boat licence to the owner if an authorised person has inspected the boat not more than two months prior to date of the application and has furnished a report to the Minister of the boat's suitability.  The licence shall contain requirements as to the limits, if any, beyond which the vessel shall not ply and the maximum number of persons that the vessel is fit to carry. The licence shall be subject to such conditions and restrictions as the Minister may impose.  The licence shall remain in force for a maximum of two years.  The Minister may refuse to grant a licence where the owner has been previously convicted of a safety related offence.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides that the Minister for the Marine may revoke a licence in cases where there has been an error in the report of inspection of the vessel, where false or misleading information has been given, or where the condition of the vessel has changed since its inspection. The Minister may revoke or suspend a licence if its terms have not been met.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides that the master of a passenger boat must produce for inspection by an authorised officer his licence and/or proof of the boat's compliance with regulations, if any, with <Col N="1017" /> regard to insurance cover.  This section also requires that the owner's name, licence serial number and maximum number of passengers licensed for carriage be painted on the outside of the vessel above the waterline.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides that the Minister for the Marine may make regulations to ensure the safety of passenger boats, their passengers and crews.  The regulations may cover seaworthiness, construction and maintenance of vessel, life-saving, fire-fighting, radio and navigation equipment, insurance cover, crew competence and such other matters including the charging of fees as the Minister considers necessary or expedient.  Different provisions may be made in the regulations for different classes of passenger boats.  The section provides for stiff penalties for convictions for breaches of the regulations.</P>
    <P>Part IV contains miscellaneous provisions, the most important of which I wish to mention.  Section 19 provides that the Minister for the Marine may make regulations to ensure the safety of fishing vessels and their crews.  The regulations may cover seaworthiness, construction and maintenance of vessel, life-saving, fire-fighting, radio and navigation equipment, periodic survey, crew competence and such other matters including the charging of fees as the Minister considers necessary or expedient.  Different provisions may be made in the regulations for different classes of fishing vessels. There is provision in the section for substantial penalties for convictions for breach of these regulations.</P>
    <P>Section 20 provides that the Minister for the Marine may make regulations to ensure the safety of pleasure craft and their occupants.  The regulations may cover seaworthiness, construction and maintenance of vessel, life-saving, fire-fighting, radio and navigation equipment, periodic survey, and such other matters including the charging of fees as the Minister considers necessary or expedient.  Different provisions may be made in the regulations for different classes of pleasure craft.  There is provision in the section for substantial penalties <Col N="1018" /> for convictions for breach of these regulations.  That section deals particularly with the safety of pleasure craft and of the people who occupy them.</P>
    <P>Section 23 provides that where a master of, or a seaman employed in an Irish-registered vessel or on any vessel while it is in Irish territorial waters, engages in conduct which endangers his vessel or any other vessel, structure, equipment, or any person, he shall be guilty of an offence.  Likewise, if his actions are proved to amount to neglect of duty due to being under the influence of alcohol or any drug, he shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>Section 24 provides that the master of a vessel the subject of a certificate or licence may refuse to permit on board a person under the influence of alcohol or any other drug.  The section also provides that it shall be an offence for a member of a vessel's crew to be on duty under the influence of aclohol or any other drug to such an extent that his ability to discharge his duties is imparied.</P>
    <P>Section 25 provides that an authorised officer may board or stop a vessel, inspect and examine such vessel and documents or records thereon.  A person who obstructs an authorised officer in the exercise of his functions shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>Section 27 amends the Merchant Shipping Act, 1947, to provide for the recognition, by order of the Minister for the Marine, of maritime qualifications granted by foreign Governments, where the Minister is satisfied that these are adequate qualifications for service on Irish-registered vessels.</P>
    <P>Section 29 provides that the owner of a vessel who applies to the Minister for the Marine for a licence or certificate shall furnish the Minister with such information as he may reasonably require for the purpose of his functions under the Bill, when enacted.  A person who furnishes false or misleading information shall be guilty of an offence and the Minister may refuse to issue a certificate or grant a licence.</P>
    <P>Section 30 provides for the payment of fees by the owners of vessels for survey, <Col N="1019" /> inspection and the issue of a certificate or grant of a licence.</P>
    <P>Failure to meet the requirements of the Bill, when enacted, or of regulations made thereunder constitutes an offence. The Bill provides for a range of penalties for offences depending on their gravity. Penalties range from a fine not exceeding £200 on summary conviction for failure to produce a passenger boat licence to an authorised officer to a fine not exceeding £100,000 and/or up to two years' imprisonment for failure or refusal to comply with a requirement specified in a passenger certificate.</P>
    <P>A variety of concerned organisations have been consulted in the preparation of this Bill.  The National Safety Council see the Bill as complementing their efforts to promote water safety.  Bord Fáilte in seeking to attract tourists place special emphasis on our relatively unpolluted waters and our water based leisure activities. For them safety is of paramount importance.</P>
    <P>This Bill will provide a statutory basis for the safe operation of the different water based activities.  It will enable recommendations along the lines made by the West Coast Search and Rescue Action Committee in their report, e.g. the introduction of annual safety equipment surveys for all Irish-registered fishing vessels and the fitting of EPIRBs &mdash; Emergency Position-Indicating Radio Beacons &mdash; in all commercial seagoing vessels and pleasure craft above a certain size, to be given statutory backing.</P>
    <P>This Bill, by improving safety standards on passenger vessels and enabling me to introduce regulatory measures for other vessels, will go a long way towards preventing future tragedies in Irish waters.  Through this Bill, we will ensure the safety of many lives from the point of view of fishing vessels, pleasure craft and major ferries.  The Bill received wide support in Dáil Éireann and I trust that there will also be general agreement on its content in Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I believe he was already <Col N="1020" /> here for an Adjournment motion, but I welcome him today in his official capacity as Minister for the Marine and wish him luck with his new porfolio.</P>
      <P>Like the Members of Dáil Éireann I welcome this Bill.  It has the commendable objective of updating legislation and introducing further safety measures, particularly in the light of the current modernisation of fishing and pleasure vessels throughout the world.  It is essential that vessels carrying less than 12 people be licensed.  I was surprised that only 60 vessels in the category of passenger ships carried licences and only during the summer months.  Does that period include the three summer months only, and what happens during the more extended tourist season we try to encourage, starting at St. Patrick's Day and going right into October?  In the light of the proposed changes will the Minister introduce a summer certificate for pleasure boats whose season, we hope, will continue to extend itself?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the last few years we have become increasingly aware of the potential of our waters, economically, in relation to fishing and even more so, particularly with the advent of moneys from Europe, in relation to the development of tourist and leisure facilities.  As an island nation it is strange that for many generations we turned our backs to the sea.  I know the Leas-Chathaoirleach is in a different category, coming from a maritime county but coming from an inland county the sea to me was an occasion for a one day visit if one was lucky as a child and during school time we relished the experience of the sea through books like <i>An tOileánach, Fiche Bliain ag Fás or Peig.</i>  Apart from such experiences, the sea was a weird and wonderful thing to be appreciated on rare occasions, which surprises me because the sea permeates so many of our legends and so much of our poetry and drama; when one remembers <i>Riders to the Sea</i> and other sea based fictions, it is surprising we have not become more involved with the sea surrounding us.  On Ash Wednesday we are reminded of past <Col N="1021" /> penitential associations with fish then and on Good Friday.</P>
    <P>Bord Iascaigh Mhara have spent a considerable amount of money promoting the eating of fish in recent years.  I am glad that we now realise how valuable the sea can be, economically, for commercial fishing and leisure pursuits.  Historically, towns like Clonmel, for instance, which were built on waterways neglected their river's potential until recently when tourism and recreation possibilities were identified there.  In Limerick it is only in the last few years with the designated area extending seawards rather than away from it that we have come to realise the potential of our estuary.  It is timely that the safety of pleasure craft carrying fewer than 12 passengers should be looked at; their tourist potential is only now being realised.  During the past few years information leaflets, brochures, etc, warning us of the dangers of the sea have been made available and liaison with the Garda has improved.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned increased reporting of overloading.  I am mindful of what can happen in a place like Doolin, County Clare where there is a demand from tourists, mainly, to get to Inis Oirr, Inis Meáin and Inis Mór.  Some days there is no hope of taking out a boat.  Sometimes when demand is great for a trip to the Aran Islands one does not consider whether there are 12 or more on board; one gets on and hopes for the best.  I am glad that appropriate regulations now exist and increased vigilance should make people aware of the numbers permitted in certain types of crafts and the requirement for certificates.</P>
    <P>When the Channel Tunnel opens we will be the only true island nation in the EC and the desire to avoid overcrowded, over-exploited tourist areas in Germany, Spain, Portugal and Greece will be our opportunity to exploit the isolation of islands off our coast.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has improved the Bill by the addition of another section and I will be interested to hear what section 27 provides in relation to on-the-spot fines.  I am a little sceptical about the implementation of such fines thinking of <Col N="1022" /> the failure of on-the-spot litter fines. Coming from a city like Limerick, I have yet to meet anyone who has been fined for littering.  I hope the same negligent approach will not apply to on-the-spot fines for overcrowded pleasure boats.</P>
    <P>As a member of a local authority I am aware of the lack of statutory requirements laying down safety standards for the issue of boatmen's licences by local authorities.  It seems extraordinary that local authorities have no criteria for assessing applications and I am glad that matter is being attended to.  The Royal National Lifeboat Institution say that the greatest number of accidents, not surprisingly, occur in the areas of pleasure and commercial boating.  I am glad of the Minister's intervention in relation to jet skis which are becoming extremely popular and pose a danger to bathers in shallow waters.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about the development of tourism here we must examine the case of private boat operators, and people who own sailing boats.  Surveillance to ensure the safety of individual operators will be important particularly regarding the development of marinas.  A small scale marina has been proposed by Glin, County Limerick and a larger marina is creating a tremendous amount of publicity at Kilrush.  We are coming to this Bill at a time of increased emphasis on the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>Reading <i>Peig</i> and <i>An tOileánach</i> we recall the tragedies that beset our fishermen who depend for their livelihood on the sea.  They must weigh up the pros and cons whether they should go to sea on a particularly dangerous day.  I know modern weather forecasting equipment is available to aid them but people will take chances and in this country, a day can change rapidly from quiet, peaceful morning to a dangerous evening with hazardous weather.  There is a distance of some 2,000 miles between ourselves and our nearest neighbour, the east coast of North America.  As we develop our fishing and tourist industry we must be vigilant in relation to the acts of God which will invariably happen.  Monitoring equipment, a modern communications <Col N="1023" /> network and high-tech equipment are essential for all craft to ensure they are not placed at the mercy of the waves.</P>
    <P>In relation to the emergency service, the Doherty report and reports of various committees such as the Marine Safety Consultative Committee, recommend ongoing monitoring of the situation.  I welcome these reports and the fact that committees are liasing with other interest groups to ensure the maximum safety for fishermen.</P>
    <P>Submarines have been discussed at length in other debates.  I am glad that in the International Maritime Organisation the Minister has a mechanism for consultation to ensure that submarines avoid fishing vessels and pleasure craft.  The former penalties, as the Minister said, were not a deterrent because they were so small and I am glad they have been increased.  People will take chances if the fines are insignificant.  The new fine of £200 is to be welcomed together with the maximum fine of £50,000 and two years' imprisonment for refusing to comply with the regulations.</P>
    <P>Canals were referred to in the Dáil debate and the Ballinamore &mdash; Ballyconnell Canal and the tourism potential of the Slieve Russell Hotel in that area were also mentioned.  Coming from Limerick I am aware of the development potential of inland waterways; Lough Derg is being increasingly used by people particularly Germans and Italians who have been going there for many years and now by Irish people for a holiday at home.  I hope that pleasure crafts that operate off-season as well as in season will be monitored.</P>
    <P>I have reservations about the implementation and enforcement of this legislation; in this country every Bill contains a rider about availability of resources.  Will there be sufficient man or woman power employed to carry out inspections?  This is a model Bill.  It has received wide acclaim in the other House and will also be welcomed by Senators. It will be a shame if resources to ensure enforcement of the provisions are not put in place.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1024" /> A section of the Bill provides, that a master or seaman employed in an Irish registered vessel or in any vessel in Irish territorial waters who engages in conduct endangers his vessel or any other vessel shall be guilty of an offence.  What happens the crew in this case?  The master is responsible obviously for his own conduct if it is in relation to alcohol or drug abuse.  If a seaman in his employment offends, is the master responsible or is the seaman directly responsible to the Minister?  Does the master have responsibility for his crew?  I presume he does but I wonder about that instance which is not adequately spelled out.</P>
    <P>Basically I welcome this important Bill.  I will not go through the various sections, which are self-explanatory, and line by line, section by section with matters such as licence and licence display, the revoking of a licence and associated penalties.  The Bill deals also with radiotelephone installation and other equipment. Regulations cover seaworthiness and the construction and maintenance of vessels.  In this country, few people can afford to acquire a new fishing vessel; I do not know the average age of our fishing vessels.  Pleasure craft are possibly, more modern.  The construction and maintenance of vessels is going to be a big issue.  Life saving equipment, fire fighting equipment, radio navigation equipment, insurance cover and crew confidence are important matters and the regulations should cover them.</P>
    <P>I am pleased with the penalties for convictions.  We need to approach maritime safety both from an economic viewpoint and with consideration for the livelihood of fishermen who have done so much to develop the fishing industry and it is only now that the fishing and tourist industries are realising their potential within an expanded EC.</P>
    <P>There is a reference towards the end of the Bill to Bord Fáilte's special emphasis on our relatively unpolluted waters and water based leisure activities.  Safety must be paramount.  I would be interested in knowing what research the Department have done into leisure resource management in other EC countries; <Col N="1025" /> the Dutch have so little land space that most of their leisure activities take place on canals and inland waters and I am sure we could learn a lot from them. Perhaps the Irish are a little ambivalent about safety precautions.  This is true especially of road safety.  A tremendous emphasis is now being placed on the necessity for road worthy vehicles and regular tyre checks.  We must look at safety precautions at sea also; the sea will claim its victims, regardless; we can never understimate it.  Poets have reminded us repeatedly about the dangers and power of the sea.  It is only when one stands on the seashore that one realises how vulnerable, fragile and delicate is the human species compared to the power of the sea.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on this extremely good Bill.  Our party are pleased with the conditions outlined in it and we hope the resources and moneys necessary to ensure its implementation, will be provided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the new Minister for the Marine, Deputy Woods. I am glad he has been placed in charge of marine services given his experience in Government and his commitment and dedication as a Minister.  I am also pleased that this lieutenant, the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine is a Donegal man, my colleague and friend, Deputy Pat the Cope Gallagher. The Minister and the Minister of State have the capacity and ability necessary to accomplish much in that Department.</P>
      <P>I join with other speakers in the Seanad today in welcoming this Bill, which is of major significance and importance. Together with the Sea Pollution Bill recently introduced by the Government, this Bill is necessary to control and prevent the continued loss of life at sea. Irish people whether living inland or on the coast would be appalled to know the number of drownings and maritime tragedies that have taken place recently. As I read the Bill and the Minister's speech I thought of the categories of people that tend to lose their life and the types of boat in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1026" /> Large numbers of people lose their lives when they fall out of two man crafts, small craft used to examine lobster pots or to go fishing in.  People may misjudge the weather, or be badly equippped, an engine may break down or 101 different things go wrong.  This Bill attempts to set down new standards for types of boat, condition of boats, requirements for crew etc., is long overdue.</P>
    <P>I have been on the pier at islands, at Burtonport, Killibegs and at many other small ports around the country where I observed holidaymakers using boats. Sometimes I questioned the condition of the boat and other times the number of people permitted in a boat.  In a holiday atmosphere it would not be unusual to take 40 or 50 people on a small fishing boat, a half decker as we know them.  I have felt insecure and unsafe travelling on one of those boats between Aranmore Island and Donegal, especially in rough water.</P>
    <P>Many good intentions are spelt out in the Bill.  I hope the Minister will succeed in the drafting and implementation of this legislation.  A garda can stop a car tomorrow and enter in a notebook that the tyres are bald, the brakes faulty and then impound the car.  A boat may be in bad condition but it is hard to police the condition of that boat.  While the legislation now states that a boat must be inspected two months prior to the issue of the licence I question if that is sufficient because a boat may sustain damage by hitting the pier too hard or against rocks during the holiday season and the owner may decide to continue to carry passengers. I realise that it is a major undertaking to say that we will police the provisions of this Bill closely.  The Minister and his Department will have to rely to a great extent on the integrity of owners and operators.</P>
    <P>The proposal to erect notices on the boat is good and I strongly support that provision.  Conditions for licensing of boats and information as to whether an insurance certificate is in order should be displayed on the boat as in the case of a motor car.  A boat should have a number plate; we should insist on the same level <Col N="1027" /> of control of boats.  We must convince boat operators and passengers of the importance of meeting the necessary safety standards.</P>
    <P>I have known people who have spent their lifetime at sea and who would not travel on a small passenger boat without making sure it had life jackets.  I would strongly advocate that every boat licensed to carry passengers must have a life jacket for every passenger, and that life jacket must be inspected and be in good condition.  I strongly urge the Minister to add such a provision to the Bill. While that would be an added expense on those operating passenger or pleasure craft, it is of vital importance.  Families with children on holidays enjoy boating, but somethimes they do not fully realise the dangers.  I have been on boats when the weather turned bad and some of the passengers have been sick.  They had not calculated the danger at sea.  The Minister would need co-operation from people who operate small boats, as our coasts can be very treacherous because conditions change so quickly.</P>
    <P>I welcome the new controls on fishing boats.  A fishing boat can be anything from a huge craft to a 30 foot boat.  Many of them operate without the necessary safety equipment.  This Bill will encourage boat owners to accept that they have a responsibility in this area.</P>
    <P>Those of us who have the opportunity and pleasure of living near the coast know that many of the boats in operation at present are old, and were built without detailed specifications.  They may be clinker-built boats, built by tradesmen who did a first class job.  When this legislation comes into operation, the Minister will have the responsibility to ensure that all boats, including those which ferry passengers to and from our islands and around our coast, meet a certain standard. This is a major undertaking.  He will also have the major task of immediately asking all skippers and boatowners to cooperate and live within the new rules and regulations in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the section which deals with the new life-saving equipment.  I also welcome <Col N="1028" /> the fact that the Dauphin helicopter will be located at Finner Camp; there was a major campaign for such a facility for some time.  It has now been recognized that the terrain and the Donegal coastline are treacherous and quite a number of people have been lost at sea over the years.  Everyone in the west of Ireland recognises that the Government have done a first class job providing this service. I compliment the committee who made the decision to locate that equipment at Finner Camp.  We all feel a little more comfortable now that the provision has been made.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment the Minister and wish him success.  He will have his hands full when the necessary and long overdue legislation is passed.  I am glad it is getting a good reception from all sides of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill on my own behalf and on behalf of the Labour Party.  I am sure most Senators will feel the same way about it.  Although there may be criticism of some sections, its general intent and purpose will be welcomed. When the Bill is passed the most important thing is that the new procedures be carried out by ships' crews. Given the encouragement the Bill provides, I have no doubt they will go about their business very conscientiously because, in the final analysis, the officers and crew fully understand the risks involved.  They know what is in the Bill and they will be aware of the safety standards and the criteria that must be followed on passenger and other vessels. The Bill will facilitate water-based tourist activities.  I trust that the inland waterways, including the canals, will take advantage of this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The annual marine survey of vessels is most welcome.  I would like to mention the gear ships carry, whether merchant ships or seagoing ships.  Under the old system an annual report was made in respect of all the gear, even that used only for unloading.  I have represented people who loaded boats &mdash; I, too, was involved in this work &mdash; and I have heard about many accidents.  When we found <Col N="1029" /> out how an accident occurred &mdash; such as a jib collapsing &mdash; it usually emerged that the survey findings were falsified or misrepresented in some way.  For that reason I am very pleased that the marine surveys put great emphasis on safety. While what I am saying may not be of direct relevance to this debate, nevertheless it is something to bear in mind.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill, the annual safety equipment surveys, which are of paramount importance, will also be compulsory. Credit must go to the Minister and his Department for their excellent publicity campaign.  This is a very serious matter and more publicity is needed.  I am glad the Minister appreciated that point.  In order to create a real awareness in the public mind, one has to publicise this legislation, its values and effects. Because of the dangers of the unpredictable seas around our coast, constant review is essential.  This provision is also welcome.  I am pleased the Bill places so much emphasis on safety.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the licensing of vessels carrying not more than 12 persons.  We have all heard tragic stories of overloading or overcrowding, particularly where users of ferries and other beach craft are under the influence of drink. This is very serious.  Senator McGowan made some reference to it when he said people do not understand the gravity of the situations and, consequently, accidents happen or are caused.  I am very pleased about the efforts to deal with overcrowding.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that, according to a survey published in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i>, up-to-date lifesaving equipment is not our strong point and in this respect we fall behind France and England, our competitors. I trust the Bill will lead to mandatory provisions on all passenger ferries to provide escape chutes similar to those on aircraft.</P>
    <P>I have another slight criticism of the Bill.  Senator McGowan mentioned the problem.  There is nothing to stop anyone with the means to do so from purchasing a cabin cruiser and using it, without restraint, without any registration and even without competence.  The waters of <Col N="1030" /> the Shannon can be very dangerous and somebody who is not competent to negotiate those waters can still take out a boat. I do not say there are no restraints but they should be more severe.  Also, people who handle boats incompetently may go into areas where people are swimming or water skiing, where they are liable to cause problems, do damage and maybe even kill people.  Yachts and other privately owned crafts can be a danger if handled by incompetent people.  Some criteria must be laid down for handling craft and operators must be responsible to some authority.  The Minister may have considered this, but perhaps he would have another look at it.</P>
    <P>We are delighted with the intent and purpose of the Bill as regard safety; we would wish to make the provisions on safety even more effective.  I enjoy watching people who go out in cabin cruisers, yachts or other craft.  I love the whole scene, but if private owners are given privileges they must have obligations as well.  For example, if they run into difficulties by straying too far, the search and rescue people have to go out and look for them and put their own lives at risk.  The owners are under an obligation to those services and some further pressure can be put on them in this respect.</P>
    <P>On the question of safety measures for smaller commercial fishing crafts, with the exceptions of a few basic rules it seems the only rules laid down are those governing the use of life belts.  I am talking about craft less than 40 ft.  There are over 2,000 such crafts in operation and it is important to consider the safety aspect of that class of vessel.  The question of regulations governing launches, speed boats, motor cruisers and yachts does not seem to have been dealt with adequately. There are, as far as I know, no competency certificates issued for boat owners, unlike the position on the Continent.</P>
    <P>We all have great admiration for the tenacity and endurance of those people who have to go out in very adverse weather conditions in order to harvest the seas.  That is why I wish to stress <Col N="1031" /> safety in all its aspects.  The provision in the Bill for the safety of fishing vessels and their crews is of tremendous importance. The Minister has gone a long way with that but I would like a little more emphasis to be given to safety.  The Minister, in his speech, mentioned developments in that area.</P>
    <P>We are heavily dependent on sea transport to ferry people and goods to and from the country.  The car ferries carry large numbers of people.  There is great potential for tragedy on the Irish seas, which is very worrying.  In a report in a French consumer magazine Irish Ferries were rated at the bottom of the list of 33 international ferry companies in relation to safety and to the evacuation of passengers. That is a very worrying situation. The Minister's predecessor got notice of this and referred it to some other authority. I am delighted that point has been noticed and that something will be done about it.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Bill and the efforts that have been put into it.  I would just say that it is nice to know the Minister for the Marine may revoke a certificate in cases where there has been an error in the declaration of the survey.  I am very pleased with the Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome the new Minister for the Marine to the House, and congratulate him on his promotion to that Department. I have a particular interest in the Department and I am delighted Deputy Woods is the Minister for the Marine. I assure him of all the support we can possibly give him in that onerous task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is worthwhile and introduces new legislative measures and brings in stricter controls.  We need these regulations and stricter controls. This is also an enabling Bill.  The Minister, the Department and the bodies which will be working closely with him, <Col N="1032" /> will ensure that, at all times, there are proper regulations and safety in force. From time to time, as the need arises, different regulations can be added to the Bill.</P>
    <P>With reference to passenger ferry boats, we are extremely lucky and I hope that continues.  Thankfully we have had none of the major disasters we read about in other countries where ferry passenger boats collide and, because they are overloaded, there is a great loss of life.  We must have laws and regulations and we must enforce them.  It is most important that we make sure they are properly enforced.  If I were to find any fault with this Bill &mdash; and, indeed, other Bills going through the House &mdash; it is that even on summary conviction the fines are too small.  The Bill provides for fines as low as £200 for major irregularities or actions. I would recommend that the fines be increased.</P>
    <P>At certain times of the year people approach owners of fishing boats that do not normally ferry passengers and have no licence to do so, to take them out to sea.  For example, on Sundays in summer in Kerry there are angling competitions for which these boats are used.  I would hate to see their use being restricted.  The owners' normal occupation is fishing &mdash; maybe lobster pot fishing &mdash; but they get good insurance cover for their Sunday trips.  Insurance companies are only too willing to extend cover on the weekends for fishing boats owners who provide this great service for anglers.  Could the Minister or his officials ensure that these boat owners would not be restricted from providing this service on the weekends provided they have the necessary safety equipment on board and proper insurance cover.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that there will be on-the-spot fines.  There are grave breaches of the law from time to time and the only way to overcome that is to confront the skipper or whoever has broken the law and impose an on-the-spot fine.  Who will make decisions relating to on-the-spot fines?  Will it be the person referred to in the Bill as &ldquo;an authorised person&rdquo;?  That would mean a <Col N="1033" /> harbourmaster within the confines of a harbour under his jurisdiction, a naval officer in full uniform, a Garda in full uniform or any person authorised by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Under section 53 of the 1946 Harbour Act, will harbour authorities still have power to issue licences to boats plying for hire within their jurisdiction?  I am the chairman of the Harbour Commissioners in Dingle and we discussed this issue.  In a small harbour like Dingle, local knowledge is very important.  We would be of the opinion that, if the Minister decided to grant licences to everybody who applied for them in our harbour, as a harbour commission, we would probably disagree.  I am referring to plying for hire, for instance, for trips to see the dolphin.  In the interest of safety we would like to see a limit to the number of licences being granted.</P>
    <P>Most of the licences in Dingle are granted by Kerry County Council, and I must pay a special tribute to them and to the officers in charge.  They did not grant the licences to everybody who applied but got their surveyor to survey the boats and make sure they all had the proper safety equipment on board.  They are probably one of the few county councils to have done that.  We sent a recommendation to Kerry County Council that, if possible, they should not issue more than 12 licences to ply for hire to take people out to see the dolphin in Dingle. We thought it would be unsafe to issue more licences.</P>
    <P>I would like to know if, in future, the harbour commissioners will have the same power to recommend that the Minister and his Department limit the number of licences to be granted in a particular area.  If a person is granted a licence to operate from a particular harbour, will that licence define exactly where he is to operate?  For example, can a person who is granted a licence to operate out of Caherciveen operate out of Dingle, or can somebody who is granted a licence to operate from Kinsale operate from Bantry?  Each harbour authority may apply their own restrictions.  Will the harbour commissioners have the same <Col N="1034" /> powers they had under the Harbours Act, 1946, and will there be consultation with harbour commissioners?</P>
    <P>Ireland has one of the longest coastlines in Europe but we we were never a seagoing nation.  Boats and ships from foreign nations operate around our coast, but we do not have the same love for the sea.  However, that is changing.  Over the past five or six years there has been an increase in the number of yachts sailing around our coast.  Bord Fáilte believe that if we promote our coastline we will attract many yachts to our shores.</P>

      <P>I am not, I know all about it.  The proposed marina for Dingle is welcome.  I would like to see more marinas.  We cannot promote yachting holidays if we do not have well developed facilities like marinas, accommodation, showers, etc.  I hope both sides will come together and reach agreement about the marina in Dingle.</P>
      <P>Section 17 states that an authorised officer may request the master of a passenger boat to produce the licence in respect of the boat or a copy thereof.  The Bill defines a boat as a vessel carrying up to 12 people and a ship as a vessel carrying 12 or more people.  Has the authorised officer any powers in relation to the passenger ship?  The Bill states that the &ldquo;officer may request the master of a passenger boat&rdquo; but it does not deal with a passenger ship.</P>
      <P>How can we define who is the skipper or master of a boat or yacht?  We have no way of positively identifying him.  If one goes on board a boat and asks for the skipper anyone on board could say he is the skipper.  There should be some means by which the skipper can be identified, and this should apply to both hired yachts and those that are privately owned.  In regard to licensed boats, the skipper's name should be on the licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Severe penalties should be imposed on skippers and boat owners who overload their boats.  If one has a licence to carry 12 people, one is bound to have life jackets <Col N="1035" /> and safety facilities for those 12 people.  However, if the boat is overloaded, there will not be the necessary safety equipment to cater for these extra people.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that all pleasure craft are covered in this Bill because for too long pleasure craft have not been included.  They should be registered in the same way as any other sea craft. Fishermen respect the sea, but a person who decides to go sailing on a nice day may not realise that when they leave the harbour they may be in very rough seas. Some years ago approximately £750,000 was wasted over two days searching for two people who were so careless that they did not even say where they were going or what time they would be back; they did not even have a radio on board. Thankfully, they were found.  What would happen if the Corvette, helicopters and lifeboats were out searching for those two careless people and there was a major accident somewhere else?  All around the coast in the summer careless people do not think before they go to sea.  I am glad pleasure craft have been covered in this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he would be looking at jet-skis.  They are very dangerous especially in restricted areas.  Fun-loving people use them and it is great sport, but in a confined harbour &mdash; when I say a confined harbour I mean anything within one square mile &mdash; they zigzag all over the place, ignore channels for approaching fishing vessels and so on.  They too should be included in the Bill.</P>

      <P>This legislation and everthing the Minister is doing is welcome. However, there are not enough surveyors in the Department.  People have been waiting for as long as six months to have their boats surveyed. That is unfair because they could miss the summer season waiting for their boat to be surveyed.  While the surveyors are excellent, extra staff will be needed when this Bill is enacted to ensure that boats are surveyed quickly and that nobody breaks the law.  Safety is the essence of this Bill.</P>
      <P>While on safety, I wish to compliment the rescue services.  I have been at sea for most of my life &mdash; Senator O'Toole would probably say that I am still at sea.  On two occasions, I had reason to look for help from the lifeboat services.  I asked them to stand by until I could get out of my difficulties, which I did.  There is a new rescue centre at Shannon and as the Minister said 87 rescue missions, resulting in 57 lives being saved, were carried out in a very short time.  That is remarkable. Most of the time when these people are on rescue missions the rest of us are in our beds.  Anyone who has been at sea on a dark night will know how green and cold it can be; there are huge waves, and it is difficult to know where you are. People who go on rescue missions in those conditions must be commended. We must thank all who take part in rescue missions, including the helicopter crew based at Finner Camp.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, there are more than helicopters involved in the rescue services. The lifeboat crews must also be commended. It is unfortunate that most of our lighthouse have gone automatic because lighthouse keepers were great watchdogs for anybody in trouble around our coast.  Those who run the radio services and local voluntary groups do a <Col N="1037" /> great job.  All these people deserve our thanks.</P>
    <P>Finally, why are boats, unlike ships, not required to display insurance discs? Most licences granted by the Department of the Marine in respect of boats carrying over 12 passengers are restricted to the summer months.  In the Dingle area boats that have a licence to carry 40 or 50 passengers may only operate from May until the end of August.  That system is working well at the moment because not alone do those people have a licence from the Department of the Marine to carry 40 or 50 people during the summer months, but they also have a licence issued by Kerry County Council, to carry not more than 12 people during the winter months.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and wish him every success in his Department. I also commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>Go raibh maith agat as ucht an seans a bheith agam cúpla focal a rá ar an mBille seo.  Gan dabht, no one can take from the previous speaker's extraordinary knowledge of the sea and fishing.  Senator Fitzgerald has a long record in that area.  We have a great interest in the sea having been born and raised in the same parish.  I am sure he will agree that there is nothing as sad as the tragedy of a boat lost at sea or unaccounted for in a sudden storm. People wait for the rescue services, they tune onto crackling radios to hear if contact has been made.  I welcome any moves to improve safety standards.  We have been lucky that there has not been a major sea disaster, although there are tragic drownings here every year, particularly during the summer months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have raised a number of issues in regard to pleasure craft on many occasions.  I am appalled at the lack of safety measures in places like Inishbofin, seaworthy vessels travel from the quay to the island, but if the tide is out when they reach the island it is not possible to moor at the pier to enable people to disembark. This happened regularly before the new jetty was built but even now, I understand <Col N="1038" /> they still face that difficulty during very low tides.  I saw 12 people being transferred from a boat which brought the passengers from the quay to a punt which should not carry more than four people.  People, especially from city areas, are inclined to think that when one is near the harbour or shore one is safe. Those who live beside the sea know, that the depth of the water is the least important matter.</P>
    <P>This is very welcome legislation. Senator Fitzgerald said the Minister referred to the Dingle marina in his speech but I do not see any reference to it.  Senator Fitzgerald and I are in agreement on about 90 per cent of the developments in Dingle Harbour.  First, the approval of construction for a second marina will lead to an overcrowded harbour and, second, it is totally unnecessary. It will threaten the viability of the first marina and reduce tourism in the town.  The fact that it is being opposed by the majority of the people of the town should be taken into consideration by the Minister.  I appeal to him to ensure that there is no development in that area.</P>
    <P>That is looking at it from an objective point of view, but to be subjective, if the Office of Public Works decided to give 35 acres of the Phoenix Park to developers, the people of Dublin would be outraged.  For those of us who live beside the sea, giving away 27 or 30 acres of foreshore has the same effect.  It is unsustainable, unacceptable and unforgivable. It will mean giving away part of our heritage, something we have no right to do.  I could not be more vehement on this issue.  This is perhaps, outside the scope of the Bill but I would like to put it on the record.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that pleasure boats have been dealt with in this legislation.  There have probably been more drownings and tragedies involving pleasure boats than any other vessel.  I can hardly recall a winter when I was growing up when a French trawler or some other vessel did not get into trouble around the cliffs of west Kerry.  Professional seamen are very concerned about their safety.  They no longer dwell on the piseóga of sea travel. <Col N="1039" /> There have been drownings because of a lack of education in safety standards.</P>
    <P>Over the centuries many Blasket Islanders have been drowned because they believed that if a person's hat turned in a certain direction when they fall into the water they were fated to drown and no effort was made to save him.  Fishermen believed they should not learn to swim because that skill was a challenge to the Lord and he would decide when a person's time was up.  I know of fishermen who, when they had seen a red-haired woman or a furry animal particularly a fox refused to go fishing and that belief was held not so long ago.</P>
    <P>People involved in any occupation which has an in-built risk to life are full of piseóga which are handed down from generation to generation.  For that reason, a pro-active health and safety provision should be included in the legislation. The importance of safety at sea should be instilled in people's minds at every opportunity, perhaps through sporting clubs.  A small investment at that level would make people more aware of the risks they face at sea.  On a nice calm day people often take out their boat but do not realise that once they go outside the harbour there could be a 12 or 16 foot swirl and that they could lose control. This happens regularly.  Knowledge of a harbour and its layout is very important.</P>
    <P>Section 23 covers conduct endangering vessels, structures or individuals.  Does this Bill allow action to be taken against people who allow a wreck to sink in a fishing channel?  I am not talking about a recent case; I am talking about fishing boats or pleasure craft which sink or are dumped near fishing channels and which can cause great difficulty.  Section 19 (2) (a) states that the Minister may require fishing vessels or specified classes of fishing vessels to comply with specified standards of seaworthiness, including stability.  On the west Kerry area tá na naomhóga ansin ag iascaireacht go mór mhór in aice le Dún Chaoin, sna Blascaoidí, agus i gCiarraí Thiar agus i gConamara tá an currach go forleathan.  Is deacair na focail &ldquo;stability&rdquo; agus &ldquo;curracha&rdquo;<Col N="1040" /> and &ldquo;naomhóga&rdquo; a chur san abairt chéanna ach they are the traditional methods and for the people who use them, they are the safest way to pot lobsters and get close to rocks.</P>
    <P>I would not wish any regulations to deter the use of naomhóga or currachs which are canoes.  I am sure the Minister has given this some consideration and I would like his reassurance.  In general the move to involve pleasure craft is welcome.</P>
    <P>I compliment the public servants who drafted this legislation and those who work quietly in the background.  This is very necessary legislation.  I say to those people who have worked on drafting it that they can be satisfied that lives will be saved.  There is no doubt that implementation of this legislation will save lives, it will reduce hardship on many families and it will also bring us forward into Europe.  I ask the Minister to develop this point in his response.</P>
    <P>There is a general belief in Ireland that we are always behind Europe in terms of regulations and so on.  My experience has been to the contrary.  Safety regulations in holiday areas on the Continent are abysmal.  The way people can drive around by the tops of castles in France, Germany, Italy and Spain, an action that would not be allowed in this country.  It is the same with the kind of boats they use in many cases.  I ask the Minister to ensure that European regulations are equally as strict as ours and, more importantly, that they are enforced.</P>
    <P>In a peripheral but related area it is my belief that market farming and vegetable farming here has been decimated by the fact that our farmers are the only farmers in Europe who comply with proper sorting, grading and quality regulations.  I have walked into vegetable shops in France, in particular in the Provence area which is noted for its vegetables, and you see beautiful green peppers, cucumbers and mushrooms.  I guarantee you that they would not get in the door of the Dublin market, they would not be put on the shelves in a Dublin supermarket.</P>
    <P>As far as I know this is the Minister's first visit to this House in his new Ministry. <Col N="1041" /> I certainly hope every visit he makes to us is as progressive and as positive as this.  He will be thanked for this legislation and I welcome it very much.</P>
    <P>I had a number of other points to make on sections of the Bill but I recognise that time is running out and there are four or five others who wish to speak.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's closing speech and to implementation of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Minister to this House and also to support this Bill.  I intend to be quite brief on this, but there are a number of matters I would like to debate.</P>
      <P>First, it is vitaly important that we as an island off the west coast of Europe &mdash; and in a short time we will be the only island in the EC when the Channel Tunnel is opened &mdash; should at all times try to ensure that merchant shipping can be made safer and that stricter regulations apply.  As previous speakers have mentioned, the south-west coast, where I come from, is near some of the busiest shipping lanes.  I welcome the decision to increase the penalties in relation to larger vessels carrying 12 or more passengers and also to bring in further and stricter regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of the Marine &mdash; and I give an example which is I think appropriate &mdash; should be complimented on their action about two years ago when the <i>Tribulus</i>, a large oil tanker owned by Shell, was detained in Bantry Bay by Department officials under existing legislation and would not be let sail until such time as major repairs were carried out to it.  This is the kind of operation for which we must provide regulations.  Another example is the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i>, which, regrettably, sank off our coastline and caused great concern, I would like to cite by way of example also the regrettable situation, probably the single biggest maritime tragedy in recent years, when the <i>Betelgeuse</i> blew up off Widdy Island. That was in 1979, some 13 years ago.  If the strict regulations envisaged under this Bill applied at that time, I am quite sure that vessel would not be allowed to dock. This vessel tried to dock in a port in Spain <Col N="1042" /> and was refused entry; yet, it came to our shores and the accident cost 50 lives.  We must at all times endeavour to strenuously apply such regulations.</P>
    <P>In this Bill the Minister broadens the existing legislation to cover small boats, including pleasure craft or ferry vessels which carry fewer than 12 people.  I come from the south-west where we have the 100 isles of Carbery.  In my locality, Bantry Bay, there is the beautiful Garnish Island.  There are a number of pleasure craft and ferry crafts, varying from the 30-40 seaters to much smaller craft carrying eight or ten passengers, or perhaps fewer passengers, operating to and from this island.  It is a major industry.  It is a fundamental issue to ensure that all safety regulations are properly enforced in the interest of those travelling.  Whiddy Island is famous for other reasons and we have Bere Island and many other islands around our coastline.  Small craft take people to and from the islands as well as stock and various other commodities.</P>
    <P>The third major emphasis in the Bill is that the Minister has included strict penalties and fines particularly in relation to the bigger seagoing vessels.  This must be encouraged and I welcome it.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the proposed new amendment whereby small pleasure craft will be dealt with by on-the-spot fines.  In other words, if a family go to sea &mdash; mother, father and two or three children &mdash; and if they breach the safety regulations, rather than dragging these people through the courts it is envisaged in this Bill that there can be on-the-spot fines to deal with the matter there and then. However, I do not think it is the intention of this Bill to discourage pleasure craft activities or indeed small fishing craft along our shoreline.</P>
    <P>I would envisage off our coastline and on our lakes or on the Shannon, where there is considerable navigation and many pleasure craft that a sort of &ldquo;Baywatch&rdquo; could be set up, where there would possibly be a guard on duty on the beach or in an area where there is a lot of activity to ensure there is proper respect for the sea by those operating vessels and that the safety of people bathing <Col N="1043" /> or swimming is also protected.  This is something that would be envisaged under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I concur with some of the previous speakers in relation to the manpower to cover all these situations.  This is something that should be gradually introduced so that over the next four, five or six years the Department and their officials would educate the people living on our coastline and those who come here on holidays or who visit here for commercial reasons so that in the future we will have a much safer coastline.</P>
    <P>I agree with the compliments paid to the safety and rescue services.  Indeed, I would also compliment the RAF who from time to time have carried out rescues off our coastline.  In my own area they were responsible for several meritorious acts of life-saving &mdash; for example, the case of the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> where 15 or 16 crewmen were airlifted off this vessel some 50 or 60 miles off the Mizen Head lighthouse in atrocious weather conditions.  I would like to compliment the Minister and wish him success.  I commend the Bill to this House as a very appropriate piece of legislation, which in conjunction with existing legislation, will make our shoreline a safer place for people whether for pleasure or commercial activities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to welcome the Minister to the House and welcome his decision to introduce the Bill here.  It is a progressive and positive measure.  Like some other Bills we have had recently coming through the House, it tidies up old legislation and deals with developments in the growth of smaller vessels and pleasure vessels and the dangers that arise as a result of such growth and such increased activity.  It is important that the operators of such vessels are subject to full regulatory requirements and it is also important that there are guidelines for safety.  We go to great lengths to ensure that our roadways are in a satisfactory state and that vehicles on the road are mechanically in order. However, we do not have the same concentration <Col N="1044" /> on our pleasure cruisers or smaller vessels, those carrying fewer than 12 passengers.  Therefore, I welcome this decision to introduce the Bill to regulate the situation.</P>
      <P>For success of any regulation it is important that there is a proper policing policy.  There is no point in having regulations and so on if you do not have a proper policing mechanism to ensure that the spirit and details of the legislation are implemented.  I believe that our waterways, like our roads, have many dangers and hazards.  It is important, therefore, that the regulations that control these hazards are properly policed.  I welcome the fact that marine surveyors from the Department of the Marine will carry out annual surveys of vessels.  This is a very importat check, because, like cars &mdash; and it a fair comparison &mdash; it is important that vessels are checked for their mechanical condition to ensure they are of a proper standard and that they comply with the regulations as required by the legislation here.</P>
      <P>There is a welcome increase in our tourist business and from that a welcome increase in the level of activity on our rivers and off our coast.  In my own area we are looking forward to further growth in activity along the Shannon, expecially at the estuary of the Shannon.  There is great potential in that area.  That has been recognised and some investment has gone to improving that facility and developing it.  We would have criticism about the pace of the development, and some of the actual development, but there is a great opportunity there and the Government should not neglect it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a consequence of such development we have an increase in smaller vessels, those carrying fewer than 12 passengers; this Bill covers the safety aspects in these cases.  It is important that the monitoring and enforcement of the legislation should be carefully recorded and evaluated.  It is very important also that the public should be aware of what is in the Bill, aware of the standards required for such vessels, because thre is no better watcghdog than the general public when they become aware of the safety standards required. <Col N="1045" /> Many people who travel in such vessels are unlikely to be marine-orientated, although some will.  Many will be on pleasure trips or, as somebody already mentioned, visiting the many islands. They will not be very conscious of the marine environment.  However it is important that they be aware of the safety requirements and of the dangers if such requirements are not fully complied with.</P>
    <P>As well as the officials of the Department of the Marine, those people also will be watchdogs for the enforcement of this legislation.  It is important, therefore, that the Minister and his Department organise and maintain a proper publicity campaign to ensure that the public are aware of what is required.  A once-off campaign at the introduction of the Bill would not be adequate.  While the placing of notices at ports and marinas is very important, it is not sufficient to educate the public into what they should expect from people operating such vessels.  The Minister should embark on a full publicity campaign especially during the tourist season, say, from May to September. A campaign of awareness should be carried out by the Department to ensure that the public are aware of what is required of the people who give them such service.</P>
    <P>There are just a few points I would like to ask the Minister with regard to the standards themselves.  How will the procedures and the standards outlined in the Bill be enforced?  What are the penalties if such requirements are not enforced and what is the procedure to introduce such sanctions?  How will a crew be sanctioned if they do not comply with the regulations in the Bill?  What power has the captain of the vessel to ensure that his crew comply with the regulations in the Bill?</P>
    <P>At this stage I would like to congratulate those involved in pollution control. Pollution obviously takes place as a result of accidents and sometimes because of less than proper care being taken by large or small vessels.  I would like to pay tribute to the work done by people dealing with pollution control. This was highlighted recently by the tragic collision of the <i>mv Kilkenny</i> in <Col N="1046" /> Dublin Bay.  An excellent job was done to control the pollutant aspect as a result of that unfortunate accident.</P>
    <P>Over the years there has been a growing concern about the collision of fishing vessels with submarines just under the surface and there is a case for looking at that situation.  There is a case for an international discussion between ourselves and our partners in the EC, and countries outside the EC, who may be involved.  As a result of recent political developments in Europe and internationally I do not know what purpose these vessels serve in our waters at all other than as part of some naval exercises. I fail to understand the defensive role they might have in present political circumstances in Europe and in the broader world context.  There is a case for obtaining an agreement on banning and removing such vessels completely from our fishing grounds.  The Government should initiate discussions with those who are involved in such activities.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that fishing vessels are included in the regulations.  Nobody knows better than fishermen the dangers and hazards involved in their work.  I also welcome the fact that legislation allows the master of the crew the right to refuse a person under the influence of drugs or alcohol to go on board such a vessel.  That is self-explanatory; it is not necessary to spell it out.  It highlights the hazardous nature of the type of operation we are talking about.  It highlights the need for caution, safety and a sensible approach to this.</P>
    <P>There are a few bodies to which I would like to pay tribute.  They are often forgotten, because perhaps this type of legislation does not often come up where we have the opportunity to name some of the organisations who, year in and year out, are available to people in distress, to people who have accidents on board ships and whose members often risk their own lives to ensure the safety of others. I think we should commend our own Air Corps rescue service, who have an excellent record in this respect.  We should also compliment the Air Corps and the RAF for the co-operation <Col N="1047" /> between them in rescue operations around our shores.  It is an excellent headline in co-operation between two bodies who are above reproach in their dedication to duty.  We should also welcome the inshore rescue service, the beach lifeguards around our coasts, who do an excellent job during the summer months, the Garda Sub-aqua club, the fire brigades and all others involved in marine safety and rescue activity.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to congratulate the Minister.  I welcome the legislation and wish it well through its final Stages in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Minister to the House.  Marine resources are of great benefit to all our people and much greater benefits could be gained from it if properly utilised. Major steps have been taken in the last number of years to develop our inland waterways and coastal waters.  The creation of the Department of the Marine in 1987 provided a much needed boost for the development of marine and has proved very successful, ending wasteful duplication and unsatisfactory deployment of resources.  This Merchant Shipping Bill is very welcome as it improves safety standards, laying down strict criteria to be followed by all passenger vessels at a time when many opportunities for expanding water-based tourist activities exist.  The Bill enables the Minister to make regulations governing the safety of fishing vessels and their crew, who contribute so much to the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal to bring the licensing of vessels carrying fewer than 12 passengers under the Merchant Shipping Act is very welcome in respect of passengers on rivers, canals and estuaries.  I believe that the development of our inland waterways, in particular our canals, for navigation would be of tremendous benefit to many parts of this country; but tourists will only use these facilities if they feel safe.  This legislation provides this safety, with annual surveys of vessels being carried out by Department of the Marine surveyors.  The recruitment by the Civil <Col N="1048" /> Service Commission at present for the survey section of the Department of the Marine will ensure that the manpower is available to carry out these checks.</P>
    <P>There is a duty on all of us to ensure that this legislation is strictly enforced and that the public are aware of its provisions. I believe the greatest monitoring would come through an aware public who are conscious that legislation provides for no risk whatsoever to be taken by them in regard to travelling on our waters inside or outside the island.  This will only come about by an effective advertising campaign and effective enforcement.</P>
    <P>We are all full of admiration for our fishermen, who operate in very difficult weather conditions.  The working conditions of deck crews can be very dangerous.  Sheltered decks would make fishing vessels much safer but bring about unacceptable problems with regard to added tonnage.  However, these people who harvest our seas must always consider safety first and this Bill legislates for that.</P>
    <P>I commend the introduction of legislation to allow the masters or crew of any vessels to deal with passengers or crew members under the influence of alcohol or drugs.  This is very welcome for the comfort and safety of these individuals and others.</P>
    <P>Safety at sea requires constant review as the weather is entirely unpredictable. However, those who work at sea must live with the danger and for them it becomes a way of life.  From time to time accidents occur and in this country the emergency services are excellent.  The lifeboat crews around the coast often will voluntarily go to sea to save lives in atrocious conditions.  The Air Corps Rescue Service has an excellent record.  The RAF rescue tesms have assisted on many occasions in rescue missions off our coasts in stormy conditions.  Indeed, they have given great co-operation to the Air Corps.  The inshore rescue service has a brilliant record of bravery.  The beach lifeguards, the Garda Sub-aqua club, the fire brigades and many more are involved in these admirable activities.  It is <Col N="1049" /> important that in this debate we record our appreciation of them.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a good and positive piece of legislation to update the law in a practical way and make it more relevant in this decade and in the next century.  I compliment the Government on introducing this Bill to modernise the law and make people use our waterways more safely. Once again I would like to compliment the Minister on this very welcome Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in welcoming the Minister to the Seanad, his first time here in his new capacity as the Minister for the Marine.  If he brings the quality of caring and intelligent concern that he brought to his previous ministries, I am sure he will be equally successful in discharging this function.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and the various provisions it makes for bringing the licensing of vessels carrying not more than 12 people under the scope of the Merchant Shipping Act for the first time, updating the level of penalties and in particular, dealing with the very vexed question of submarine traffic and the dangers posed to our shipping fleet by this.  There have been a number of casualties, not only of Irish fishermen but also of United Kingdom fishermen.  It is extremely welcome and I congratulate the Minister for it.</P>
      <P>However, the principal point that I wish to address today is what I see as a significant and serious moral defect in the Bill.  Despite the fact that the title of the Bill is Merchant Shipping Bill, 1991, it does not anywhere, nor did the Minister, address an appalling problem that exists, that is, the responsibility of this State to the former employees of Irish Shipping. I say this because we have heard a good deal of reasonable and emotive argument about those in peril on the sea, etc.  An opportunity has not been provided to have this matter discussed and I would like to put a few points on the record and perhaps the Minister would see his way to addressing it.  It would have been perfectly appropriate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Minister reassured us on 24 November that he would do his best to have the matter brought to conclusion as quickly as possible.  On 3 May 1988 it was going to be shortly brought before the House.  On 30 May 1990 they were still awaiting a report, and they are still awaiting it.  I accept the ruling of the Chair.</P>

The importance and value of safety, the lives that can be saved and the lives that have been saved already is an important area. I am very happy that Senators recognised the importance of the measures which we are introducing in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very happy that Senator Jackman welcomed what I am doing in relation to on-the-spot fines for pleasure boats.  A number of Senators mentioned the question of fines generally.  I would like to stress that for the different sectors in the Bill we have some very heavy fines.  For failure or refusal to have a survey the fine is £1,000 on summary conviction or £10,000 on indictment.  Failure or refusal to comply with the conditions of a certificate could incur a fine of up to £100,000.  That is an enormous fine.  I undertook to re-examine the penalties and we strengthened some of them considerably. The contravention of licence conditions incurs a fine of up to £50,000. <Col N="1052" /> One Senator mentioned that £200 was a fairly small fine but that only applies in cases of failure to produce a licence within ten days.  If one does not have a licence one incurs a higher fine in addition to that.</P>
    <P>The fines are very stiff.  There has been a substantial increase in the fines.  They are realistic and I think Senators will be very happy with the package of fines.  I am particularly happy that Senators have welcomed in relation to pleasure craft, the power which this extra amendment will give me to bring in by regulation additional on-the-spot fines.  Following the advice and recommendations of the safety committee, which is already sitting and examining that whole question, the regulations will be introduced.  I intend to move ahead with that fairly urgent.</P>
    <P>I would like to make clear to Senators that my whole approach will be a very urgent one.  I have made that clear.  I thank Senators for giving me the support that I asked for in ensuring a speedy passage of the Bill through the House.  It will help me to have part of the Bill in operation for the summer and that is important.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman questioned whether the crewmen were responsible or whether the captain only was responsible for conduct.  They are both responsible. The crew persons and the captain are responsible for their actions or their conduct.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan stressed the importance of providing safety measures for holidaymakers particularly.  He questioned the condition of some of the boats and the number of people who were carried in them.  Smaller boats carrying people to and from the islands must comply with the conditions of the Bill so that the safety of holidaymakers is assured.  He also raised the question of the certificate two months prior.  There can, as he said, be damage in the last week.  The boat would still have to be seaworthy under a separate section.  That would be a requirement all the time.  The Senator also wanted to be sure that a number would be seen.  The requirement is that a licence number be displayed on <Col N="1053" /> the side of the vessel and also the number of passengers that can be carried.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte stressed the need for publicity.  It is my intention to ensure that people are made aware of the requirements of the Bill.  I recognise the need for that and welcome the fact that it has been stressed here today.</P>
    <P>I recognise the need for life saving equipment.  I have had experience both on the sea and on rivers, the Shannon particularly and even in swimming pools, of people drowning.  I have been involved in a number of these incidents myself. Even in large swimming pools it is possible for people to drown.  I am very conscious of the need for safety.  Senator McGowan talked about the need to have a life belt for every individual on a boat. I will take that idea on board.  It is an excellent suggestion.</P>
    <P>The question of competence on pleasure craft and yachts was raised by Senator Harte.  I want to assure him that we have powers to provide for that. These committees will look at that to see what would be the best approach.  We have the power to make regulations where necessary.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald suggested that I should not be too hard on anglers but I must stress that the definition of a fishing vessel is a vessel other than a vessel registered outside the State used for sea fishing or for angling in the sea or in fresh water other than such a vessel so used otherwise than for profit &mdash; and that includes vessels used for angling.  I am conscious of the Senator's concerns and I will keep them in mind.  He also mentioned harbour authorities.  I can assure him that their powers will be increased under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The need for surveyors was stressed. A programme of recruitment for surveyors to carry out all the functions of the Marine Survey Office of the Department of the Marine is in place.  The posts were advertised in the newspapers and the applications are currently being processed by the Civil Service Commission. We will have more surveyors and, as a result, should get through the inspections of pleasure craft quickly.</P>

      <P>We try to think as much as possible.  The points made by Senators were very helpful.  I mentioned to my officials on a few occasions that we must remember a certain point and deal with it in a different and novel way.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole talked about wrecks. A wreck and salvage Bill will be introduced soon which will deal with this issue. Section 19 of this Bill deals with the safety of fishing vessels and their crews.  Senator O'Toole is concerned about currachs in this connection.  The safety committee will advise me about that.  Senator O'Donovan stressed the importance of safety for those travelling to and from islands.  That is an area about which we are particularly concerned.  He welcomed on-the-spot fines for pleasure craft and stressed the &ldquo;Baywatch&rdquo; approach.  We must take the tourist business seriously. That point has been stressed by a number of Senators and I intend to do that.  Not only must we do our homework and enact legislation but we must make sure that people appreciate what we are doing and its importance.  As Senator O'Donovan said, we must educate people about safety.</P>
      <P>Senator Neville mentioned publicity and the need for proper policing.  These aspects will be taken on board.  The Department of the Marine co-ordinate the different activities which enable us to meet the needs of the marine sector.</P>
      <P>I welcome what Senator O'Brien said about the positive nature of this legislation. The people who harvest the sea must be safeguarded.  This is something we are all very anxious about, but sometimes people can be a little slip-shod. Mention was made of section 9 (c) which allows for the revoking or suspension of a certificate where the vessel may have been damaged.  This arises when damage may have occured between inspections.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann, recognising that Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution has served no useful purpose, mindful of the uncertainty of interpretation which resulted in such unnecessary trauma for a young girl and her parents, aware that the ban on certain types of information which has resulted from this Article may endanger the lives of some Irish women, calls on the Government &mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  to seek all-party support for a referendum to delete Article 40.3.3º from the Constitution, and</P>
      <P>(2)  to provide a comprehensive counselling, advice and support service for all women in crisis pregnancy situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people may think that personal publicity for me or Senator Norris is our motive with this motion.  The stance I have taken on this issue is of no great benefit to the people I represent and may <Col N="1058" /> well harm me electorally; my reasons for moving this motion are not electoral.</P>
    <P>We should remember what this discussion is about; I will talk about the amendment later.  The discussion is not about abortion <i>per se</i>, though it is related to it.  Nor is it about the events of recent weeks, though obviously connected with those, too.  Notwithstanding what many of my colleagues in this House, whom I respect, have suggested to me, neither is it about the precise reasons behind the Supreme Court's judgment.  We know the decision of the Supreme Court; we are not waiting for it but for the reasons for that decision.</P>
    <P>One could discuss the weight in law of the opinions of individual judges on a constitutional matter and whether these opinions are as fundamental as their decision.  The reasons for that judgment are a matter of some dispute, but it is not true to say that discussion on this issue is in any way contingent on the reasons behind the Supreme Court decision.  Such an allegation would ignore the history of this particular Constitutional provision, its subsequent history, and would be a denial of reality.  We are talking about an amendment which since I was elected to this House I have described as wrong, ill-considered and, now as we begin to confront ourselves, self-deceptive.  That conclusion is based on accepting the bona fides of the amendment's proponents.  If one were less generous to those proponents one could suggest that this amendment has sinister overtones and suggests a position for Irish women which is hurtful to many and not only to women who take a different view to that of many Members of this House on the issue of abortion.  The amendment legislates for women's behaviour under a certain set of circumstances which the vast majority of Members of both Houses will never have to experience.</P>
    <P>What we could have discussed &mdash; and I would have liked views on this &mdash; is the process by which a form of words was inserted into our Constitution which was grossly offensive to the Protestant Churches. The debate ten years ago was characterised by a kind of scrabbling <Col N="1059" /> around by some people for stray references and quotations from individual members of those Churches as if to deny the evidence.  Without wanting to trouble the House too much but in pursuit of my argument, which is that this debate is about something that is wrong with our Constitution, I would like to remind the House what the Church of Ireland said then.  I quote from a letter sent on 17 June 1982 to the then Taoiseach and recorded at column 545 of the Seanad Official Report for 4 May 1983:</P>
    <P>In our opinion a proposed amendment to the Constitution and a referendum will not alter the human situation as it exists in the country, contribute to its amelioration or promote a responsible and informed attitude to the issue of abortion.  We gravely doubt the wisdom of using constitutional prohibitions as a means of dealing with complex moral and social problems.</P>
    <P>That was the view of the Church of Ireland.  The view of the Council of Social Welfare of the Methodist Church in Ireland was even more explicit.  In a statement of 21 January 1983 &mdash; and again I quote from the Seanad Official Report, column 547, of 4 May 1983 &mdash; they said:</P>
    <P>The Methodist Church in Ireland is opposed, (1) to any constitutional amendment on abortion, (2) to this particular amendment and (3) to the holding of a referendum on the matter.</P>
    <P>Both spokespeople went on to elaborate. I will quote one brief extract from the statement of the Methodist Church.  I am quoting from column 548 of the Seanad Official Report:</P>
    <P>It would be especially unfortunate when we seek a society of open understanding for all of Ireland that one part of Ireland should be asked to define itself in this respect as a closed society on conservative, Roman Catholic lines.</P>
    <P>One does not have to agree with the Protestant Church or with the non-Roman <Col N="1060" /> Churches.  I am aware of the sensitivities of many members of the Church of Ireland at being rigidly categorised as Protestant.  One does not have to agree with them to realise that this disagreement about a fundamental matter was made on denominational lines.  That is the issue, not whether individual Protestants or non-Roman Catholics took different views, but that two Churches &mdash; and also the Irish Council of Churches &mdash; thought the legislative proposal wrong. If it was wrong then, nothing that has happened since has made it any less wrong.</P>
    <P>It is also important to remember that during that debate the practical legal implications of the amendment were teased out and nobody could give precise meanings to certain provisions in the English language but especially in the Irish language.  The phrase &ldquo;na mbeo gan bhreith&rdquo; was never translated adequately into English.  The Irish language is still, theoretically, the dominant language.  The Constitution is written in Irish and translated into English and it adds perhaps to our sense of confusion and non-reality that the opposite is usually the case.  Nevertheless, the Irish language version is, if anything, more ambiguous and more confusing than the English.  That was the situation then and nothing has changed since.</P>
    <P>At the risk of offending some of my colleagues here and as one who has more than a passing affection for Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution and the implied suggestion that the Constitution in some way applies to the whole of this island, it is particularly offensive &mdash; and I would address this remark to my colleagues opposite &mdash; if one believes in the validity of Articles 2 and 3 to include in the Constitution a section which is, and was, resolutely opposed by the Protestant churches.</P>
    <P>As well as being undesirable for all those reasons this amendment has achieved no practical purpose.  The numbers of women travelling from this State to Britain for abortions have not declined, while the female population of child-bearing age has manifestly <Col N="1061" /> declined.  Between 125,000 and 150,000 women of child-bearing age emigrated from this country during the last decade, a large section of the population.  A minimum of 4,000 and a possible maximum of 8,000 Irish woman travel to Britain each year for abortions and this amendment did not stop that.  It presumably prevented those who could not afford £400 or £500 from travelling.  It is an extraordinary country that imposes a morality on the poor while closing its eyes to the actions of those who can afford to escape that censorious morality.  Effectively, we placed a ban on abortion for the poor as travel between these islands became increasingly easier for the rich.</P>
    <P>The information debacle began the attempt to enforce this amendment in practical terms.  It did not prevent people from travelling to Britain but ensured they had less information about where they were going, what would happen to them there and the sort of support services available to them.  Consequently, many people delayed taking the decision to travel, the knowledge about who to contact when they got there was limited and many people have argued that the risk to the mother's life was increased while the safety of the unborn child was not affected.  Those were some of the effects of the ban on information, together with ridiculous incidents such as books being withdrawn from public libraries and magazines, enforcing something close to self-censorship to no good purpose.  The amendment did not stop people travelling to Britain.</P>
    <P>The final <i>dénouement</i> took place during the past three weeks.  Suffice to say that everyone was horrified at the circumstances and the Supreme Courts' decision got us off a very unpleasant hook.  Now we are in the extraordinary situation that the Supreme Court has ruled that a person has the right to travel to Britain in full knowledge of the State to do something the Supreme Court has ruled no person has the right to receive information about in this State.  I find the situation peculiar and contradictory. Apparently it is all right to travel in ignorance <Col N="1062" /> but unconstitutional to travel with adequate information.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks those who used to scream the word &ldquo;murder&rdquo; loudest when the question of abortion was raised are among those who have screamed loudest that people should be allowed the right to travel.  To travel to do what?  To go on holidays?  We know what they meant; they have signalled it to us.</P>
    <P>I will not give lectures about sincerity; my own sincerity is so open to question after ten years in national politics that I would not lecture anybody about it.  Yet, it is a less than comprehensive response to a difficult situation to say one believes in this case that people have the right to travel while declaring, at the same time that abortion is murder.  People must pursue the logic of their own position. Fintan O'Toole said in <i>The Irish Times</i> today that if one insists that there is no difference between an abortion and putting someone against a wall to shoot them, then it is consistent to stop people travelling for abortion; otherwise we engage in a classic situation of nods and winks and avoiding reality.</P>
    <P>I suspect we are trying to make ourselves feel better in the knowledge that we do not do &ldquo;it&rdquo; here, whether &ldquo;it&rdquo; is rape, incest, family violence or divorce, all of which we pretended until recently did not occur here.  Now we are faced with a difficult and painful area of life and we are trying to convince ourselves yet again that somehow we are better because we do not do &ldquo;it&rdquo; here.  We are all apparently queueing up to insist that we are not going to impede anybody's right to go elsewhere to do &ldquo;it&rdquo; but we will make sure that &ldquo;it&rdquo; is never done here.  That reaction might be understandable but is no basis for a Constitution.</P>
    <P>Abortion is perhaps the most hideously emotive issue.  For women, no matter what their views are on it and for all parents, it is a difficult issue.  Some describe it as murder and others as a human right.  People feel deeply about its availability.  The divisive feelings which abortion arouses do not give us any right to walk away from it.  We must confront <Col N="1063" /> all of our ambivalent attitudes, whatever our views on the issue of this amendment. In today's issue of <i>The Irish Times</i> there is a letter which reads:</P>
    <P>In 1988 our twin sons Evin and Oisin were stillborn at eight and a half months.  This Irish State could not recognise their existence in any way &mdash; no naming, no birth or death certs.  The Catholic church would not name them, baptise them or bury with the dignity of a funeral Mass or a funeral rite.  I had to fight even to get their names carved on the gravestone.</P>
    <P>That was in 1988.  Could we please begin to confront the inconsistencies in our thinking, in our laws, in the way we avoid hard issues?  We tell suffering bereaved parents that an eight and a half month old stillborn baby is not a human being and, at the same time, we strike moral and self-righteous poses about what we will not allow to be done in this country.</P>
    <P>I am not here to point a finger at the Irish people and say, &ldquo;You are worse than me, you are less honest than me&rdquo;. We are all involved in this situation.  It is time we confronted ourselves in honesty and humility.  I honestly do not know what to do or say about the fact that at least 40,000 women from this part of Ireland travelled to Britain in the past ten years to have an abortion.  The real figure is perhaps twice that number.  If one takes a middle figure of 60,000 one is perhaps talking about one in 15 women of childbearing age on this island having had an abortion during the past ten years. If we assume that a number of women have more than one abortion the number if one in 20 or 25, still a large number of women who travelled for an abortion in spite of a constitutional ban, in spite of Church denunciation, in spite of a ban on information.  I do not know the solution to the problem but ignoring it is no solution.</P>
    <P>This amendment needs to be confronted because it has not worked.  It resulted only in a ban on information and in the strange and awful case revealed to us recently.  Nobody now says they want <Col N="1064" /> to stop people travelling.  All the amendment amounts to is a constitutional attempt to prevent abortion being carried out here while we apparently believe people should be free to have it done elsewhere.  We should be done with this amendment.  The Supreme Court is not going to amend or abolish it.  It may interpret some aspects of it but that will not clear up all the questions raised.  It will not do anything about freedom of information because it cannot.  It has already made up its mind on that aspect.  It may clarify some parts of this amendment but it most assuredly will not get rid of it.</P>
    <P>We need a fresh start that recognises the divergence of views on this island held by churches, all of whom proclaim the sanctity of unborn life, but taking different positions.  We cannot scream that good conscientious Christian men and women of a different tradition support murder; that is grossly offensive to them.  We may think they are wrong but it is a travesty of Christianity and a gross offence to those equally good Christians to say to them that what they believe in is murder.  It is not as simple as that; it would be lovely if it were.</P>
    <P>Neither is it as simple as saying that women are being misled.  When you consider the efforts and the trauma women have to undergo to travel to Britain you realise immediately that they do not do so easily or lightly.  Even ten year ago, 25 per cent of the women travelling to Britain from Ireland for abortions were married women.  Consider the strain, the stress and the pain they felt.  Many of them travelled without their husband's knowledge.  It is rarely a simple or an easy decision.  We should not pretend it does not happen and that this decision is not taken by thousands of Irishwomen every week.  Because it has not worked, it has produced a ban on information and amounts to no more than wrapping of a green flag sense of superiority around ourselves, we should get rid of it and face our realities <i>in toto.</i></P>
    <P>I keep on reading over the amendment to the motion and I am more astonished each time.  Apparently Fine Gael do not <Col N="1065" /> believe we should talk about a comprehensive counselling advice and support service for all women in a crisis pregnancy situation until after the Supreme Court makes its judgment. Their amendment proposes to delete everything in my motion, including the recommendation to the Government to provide proper services for women in crisis pregnancy situations.  I can only conclude that they did not read the motion carefully, or that they decided to run for cover.  That is not right, any more than it was right ten years ago, in this House, when every Member of Fine Gael, except one, abstained on the constitutional amendment and by doing so let it through this House.  Incidentally, few enough of those who voted against it are left.  Only Senators Jack Harte, Shane Ross and myself of the gang of 14 or 15 who voted against the amendment in 1983 remain.  Just in case anybody thinks the wrath of God has descended on us for voting against it, most of them have departed to the other House rather than to another place.  So nobody has punished us for it.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael amendment, as it stands, says that we should &ldquo;defer detailed discussion of Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution until Members have had an opportunity of studying the full text of the Supreme Court Judgment&rdquo;.  If that is what Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil think, they should have stopped this debate.  It would have been more consistent.  That is the most peculiar amendment to a motion that I have ever seen.  It actually proposes to amend the motion to say it should not discuss what it wants to discuss.  I have seen amendments which said the opposite to motions, for example, praising instead of condemning the Government, amendments which said that the arguments were wrong, which suggested that people were getting it wrong. However, this is the first time I have seen an amendment to a motion which says we should not be discussing this at all.</P>
    <P>Will we have a vote next week, after three hours of debate, to pass an amendment saying we should not have had three hours of debate?  Will we attempt to <Col N="1066" /> rewrite three hours of our history to pretend we never had this debate in order to leave ourselves free to have a detailed discussion when their Lordships of the Supreme Court issue their judgment? That is what the amendment amounts to. Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil are perfectly free to object to this motion and to use the arguments about the Supreme Court's decision to say so; but to put down this amendment is to attempt to rewrite history.  Even if Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil do not agree, those of us who want to do so will have a detailed discussion on Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution. The amendment to the motion will say we did not have that discussion. That is a good example of the problems we have facing reality in Irish life, when we endeavour to rewrite the Constitution to suit ourselves.</P>
    <P>I wish that Fine Gael were as explicit in their views as Deputy Fennell, who is reported in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> as praising people for their courage and honesty in speaking out on abortion. People did not have to speak out on abortion here; they had only to speak out on an amendment to the Constitution which many of them &mdash; publicly at the time and privately subsequently &mdash; knew was wrong.  This is not the way to deal with the issue.  I do not wish to be confrontational. My view is that we would be as well off without this amendment, but that it would be difficult, divisive and bitter if we did not establish a consensus among ourselves about it, not a consensus on a minimalist approach based on the most minimalist interpretation of what their Lordships in the Supreme Court say.  If they give five different reasons for coming to the same conclusion we will have real problems.</P>
    <P>We need consensus on getting rid of something that has not worked, has not stopped anything, has not prevented anything and has not advanced any positive call.  This constitutional amendment has enabled us to deceive ourselves for ten years.  It has caused enormous suffering to large numbers of women, who quite clearly are and will continue to be determined to pursue the termination of their <Col N="1067" /> pregnancy when they believe that most suits their condition.  It is not for me and for us at this stage to get involved in a long harangue about murder.  If we believed it was murder we would stop them.  Whatever we believe about abortion &mdash; and many people hold very different views &mdash; the argument that it is equivalent putting another human being up against a wall and shooting that human being falls flat on its face in the light of everyone's assertion that people should be free to travel.</P>
    <P>I am doing myself no good by raising this issue.  It is not an issue that will do anybody any good, according to my experience of such difficult issues.  It invites the worst kind of prejudice and the lowest kind of argument, although I know that will not happen in this House. It also invites many people to misrepresent one's position.  Ten years ago in this House I said I was against this amendment.  I watched as, first of all, it faded into obscurity.  Then it surfaced to impose a blanket ban on information.  It surfaced again in its most horrific manifestation in the last few weeks.  I concluded that it was time we dealt with it once and for all.</P>
    <P>We must get rid of it before it does us as a community more harm, before it does some women more harm and before we are forced to indulge ourselves deeper and deeper in a morass of self-deception. We would be a better country without this amendment.  We could make a case for positive support for women in crisis pregnancies.  We could create an environment, as other countries have done, where fewer crisis pregnancies could happen, by a combination of an emphasis on responsible sexuality and on understanding of sexuality, an emphasis on access to contraceptives by people who are responsible about their sexual activity and on other such issues.  Other countries, like The Netherlands, for instance, have done so.  We will not do it by pretending we have abolished something, just because it does not happen here.</P>
    <P>It is time, after ten years of self-deception, to end it all and start by getting rid <Col N="1068" /> of this amendment, which has done us no good and has done many women a considerable amount of harm.  In the long term, no matter what their Lordships in the Supreme Court say, this amendment will be there next week and the week after unless we as legislators collectively decide to say to the Irish people &ldquo;There is a better way of dealing with this problem. The Constitution is not the way to deal with it.  Let us get rid of it and let us start again and deal with an Irish problem in a humane and intelligent way.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am very glad to have the opportunity to second this motion.  As I was not a Member of this House in 1983, I did not have an opportunity to be part of what Senator Ryan has described as the gang of 15.  Had I been in the House I most certainly would have voted against it.  I spoke in public during the referendum debate and I made clear my opposition to the inclusion of this amendment and the reasons for it.  In so doing I instanced the kind of case that has recently been before the courts and, for my trouble, I was described as hysterical</P>

We were told during the past few weeks that we must not discuss this issue.  Why not?  It is a matter of burning public interest.  I know that a number of <Col N="1069" /> the people on both sides of the House who are against this proposal are anxious this evening.  They are anxious that the debate should not collapse.  I understand the Minister will not speak, there will not be a statement from the Government and so there is a possibility that the debate will collapse.  If that is the case, then so be it.

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>In terms of this motion the judgment of the Supreme Court is completely irrelevant.  What we are talking about is the removal of Article 40.3.3º.  Whatever judgment is arrived at in the Supreme Court, whatever reasons are produced to determine the source of that judgment and to bolster up the case of the learned judges, the situation will not change.  Those of us proposing this motion believe that Article 40.3.3º is an inappropriate and sectarian instrument. I was very glad to hear Senator Ryan refer to the fact that the various Churches, the Anglican Church of Ireland, the Church of Ireland, the Methodist Church and the Presbyterian Church, made quite clear at the time, in 1983, their strong opposition to the holding of a referendum and to the wording of the referendum.  I am astonished to be told that we are all cherished equally.  I have seen situation after situation in which, certainly, members of the Protestant Churches and members of the various Reformed Churches are allowed to speak.  We are allowed to speak, but we are not listened to and we are certainly not heard.  I can speak as a practising member of the Church of Ireland, a church-going member.  I heard in St. Patrick's Cathedral sermons which made this point quite clear.  I heard Victor Griffin, the Dean of St. Patrick's, say, quite specifically that in theological terms a pregnancy resulting from rape was precisely a situation in which the Church to which <Col N="1070" /> I belong believed that, however regrettable, abortion was morally justifiable. Yet, this viewpoint was trampled over by the amendment.</P>
      <P>May I say I find it patronising in the extreme to be told what the Protestant Churches think?  I had this experience on the radio just the other day when a well-known Roman Catholic priest explained to me what the attitude of the Church of Ireland was.  I know what it is.  I do not need it explained.  He was, actually, quite categorically wrong.  It is very patronisinig to try to explain to somebody who is a member of the Church what that Church actually teaches.</P>
      <P>With regard to Article 40.3.3º, it is an inappropriate instrument.  The proper place to deal with this question of abortion is in the criminal law and not in the Constitution.  It is divisive and dangerous. All political parties are implicated in this mess.  It was actually Fine Gael who opened the door to this.  I am sure they did it mistakenly, not maliciously, perhaps in a good hearted way; but they opened the door and, lamentably, Fianna Fáil played political football with the welfare of the Irish people.  We have recently had a tragic example of where that callous insistence on playing always for your own party and sectoral advantage gets us.</P>
      <P>The motion suggests that one should seek all-party support for such a referendum. I do not want to be bitter or divisive this evening because I think it is highly important that all-party consensus is agreed between the major political parties. I hope that nothing I say here this evening will prejudice that.  I do not overvalue myself to the extent of believing anythink I could say here would prejudice realistic political discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1983 Referendum in which the amendment was carried in its present particularly unfortunate wording, happened because the political parties allowed themselves to be divided by sectional interests I hope that this will not happen again.  I believe that a referendum is necessary and could be sold to the Irish people if there was agreement between the political parties, if they consistently approached the situation in a <Col N="1071" /> harmonious way and explained to the Irish people the reasons for the necessity of holding such a referendum.  I regret that this is necessary.  I have no doubt that there will be divisive elements in it. I think, paradoxically, that by forcing this alien instrument into the Irish Constitution, its proponents back in 1983, ironically, helped to open the doors to abortion by placing it on the Irish agenda when it was not in fact ever a realistic political item at all.</P>
    <P>May I comment also on the language in which this debate is conducted, because again I find something rather offensive about it, in particular the colonisation of language that has occurred.  It is accepted generally that there are two major camps in this debate; one is described as pro life and the other is described as pro abortion.  I absolutely and categorically reject this categorisation.  I would describe myself as pro life.  I do not know of any rational person who would not claim to be pro life.  I have yet to meet anybody who claims to be pro abortion.  Nobody in their right mind regards abortion as a positive blessing, something without which a human being is incomplete or anything like that.  So it is a completely dishonest tactic to divide people into pro life on the one hand and pro abortion on the other.</P>
    <P>I have had some experience in this area.  For ten years I was a tutor in the University of Dublin, Trinity College, and I dealt in my capacity as tutor, <i>in loco parentis</i>, with the difficulties which students encountered during their undergraduate years.  Perhaps because my own private life had been disclosed fairly comprehensively in the Irish newspapers during a court case which I took and because I was not prepared to be either driven out of this country or made feel ashamed of myself, a number of young women approached me in great distress because of a pregnancy they had not anticipated and which was unwelcome for one reason or another.  I think there were probably about a dozen.  The first thing I did was to attempt to take down the temperature.  This is why I welcome <Col N="1072" /> the sensitive wording of Senator Ryan's proposal.</P>
    <P>The Senator talks about crisis pregnancy situations and that is exactly what I remember.  I remember feeling compassion for these young women who were clearly in a crisis in their personal and emotional lives.  They were sometimes hysterical with grief, confusion and unhappiness.  The first thing I tried to do was to comfort them and to reduce the emotional pressure under which they were suffering so that they could make a rational decision.  I hope that in most cases I was successful.</P>
    <P>At that time I could send them to a non-directive counselling agency, of which there were a number in this city.  In those agencies, which were professional, caring and decent groups but who were subsequently horribly maligned by people opposed to what they were doing, they were given information.  Both sides of the question were clearly laid out for them, on the one hand, the consequences of going ahead and seeking a termination of the pregnancy, with a possible emotional setback, and the physical consequences and, on the other hand, the inevitable consequences of keeping the child, in practical terms, economically, domestically, emotionally and in terms of their lifestyle.  Of those young women, one, to my knowledge, had an abortion and remained content, as far as I could see but the other ten or 11 did not.  Had I not been in a position to reduce the tension, to take the hysteria out of the situation, and assist them to make a calm and rational decision, I am certain, as an experienced tutor, that a majority of those young women would have got on a boat in misery, distress and confusion; they would have gone to a telephone box in central London, looked up a telephone directory and telephoned whatever abortion agency was available, which, even from a medical point of view, might not have been the best.</P>
    <P>I think it is positively wicked not to allow people access to information.  To deny any person the right to information is a violation of the fundamental human rights that are referred to in every human <Col N="1073" /> rights code and convention.  Here we have a laughably absurd situation which it would require the talent of Jonathan Swift to deal with.  A young child, which is basically what she is, is permitted to go to England but she is not permitted to have information about the address to which she is travelling.  Could anything be more absurd?  Are we determined to make a laughing stock of ourselves?  I am almost ashamed to say &ldquo;laughing stock&rdquo; because there is nothing laughable in this. It is a pitiable and tragic situation.  When I listen to people who speak from a Christian position I wonder what kind of morality they have.  I wonder about it, for example, when I hear of a priest suspecting collusion or suggesting that parents should have lied.  I wonder what kind of morality that is.  I know of many wonderful priests, nuns and bishops in the Roman Catholic Church and I do not want to be offensive to my Roman Catholic friends and fellow country people, but I was concerned when I heard Bishop Smith of Meath, for example, saying, the other day, that he wondered whether it was going to be possible for a husband to injunct a sick wife.  It seemed to me, from the way he said it, that he was hoping it was.  I wonder about the kind of relationship a family like that would have.</P>
    <P>With regard to abuse, I am told that some abusive letters and materials have been directed to people who take a different view to myself.  I condemn that unreservedly. I have received some rather unpleasant squalid material through the post.  I know exactly what to do with it. It goes directly into the bin.  I assume that every other balanced, reasonable person does exactly the same.  I deplore anything sent that is of an obnoxious nature.  I do not intend to refer to this in any detail, nor do I intend to make it public, because if the young child at the centre of this case became aware of it, she would find it exceedingly distressing.</P>
    <P>With regard to the political repercussions of this and the Maastricht meeting, the Irish Foreign Minister went to Maastricht and sought a derogation with regard to abortion.  Could anything be <Col N="1074" /> more foolish and more awkward in a political sense?  We never sought a derogation with regard to Articles 2 and 3, of which Senator Brendan Ryan spoke.  Are we more concerned about snooping into the private lives of citizens violating the constitutional rights of the family with this kind of noxious injunction, than we are about Articles 2 and 3, which are seriously and clearly compromised by both the Treaty of Rome and Maastricht? I think that is most extraordinary and regrettable.</P>
    <P>I cannot say I have pleasure in seconding this motion.  I do not think anybody takes pleasure in this particular situation, but I formally second the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy O'Dea, to this House and wish him luck in his new portfolio.</P>
      <P>All the major parties in the House were more or less in agreement that this debate could be deferred until such time as the Supreme Court decision was available.  I spoke on this matter two weeks ago. Many people were then under the impression that the High Court decision could not be reversed.  As it has transpired, the Supreme Court has, to a large extent, reversed the decision of the High Court.  I was one of those who advocated that this avenue should be explored, given that the Supreme Court is the highest court in this country and a guardian of our Constitution.  Senator Brendan Ryan, as the mover of this motion, was asked by the Whips to defer it, possibly for a few days.  I want to make it clear that it was never the intention of the Government side to force the withdrawal of the motion, by way of vote on the Order of Business today.  The proposers had the option, and they decided to go ahead.  We respect their decision, they were entitled to do so, and I would like to make it clear that no pressure was put on them.  We, on this side of the House, asked for a consensus approach on this very sensitive issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan, said he did not want a divisive debate.  Most people, from all sides of the House, see this as a very <Col N="1075" /> sensitive issue and would wish to explore all avenues without rushing into a referendum. Senator Ryan, and to a lesser extent Senator Norris, should realise that the very essence of their motion creates divisiveness.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris accused the Government side, and possibly also our colleagues in Fine Gael, the Progressive Democrats and Labour, of kicking for touch.  I totally disagree.  As far as I am concerned, nobody is kicking for touch. We are saying the matter should be deferred until the full text of the Supreme Court decision is available.  We are not saying that we are looking for a referendum, nor are we denying that, when the full text of the Supreme Court comes to hand, a referendum may be necessary. We are keeping an open mind.  We, on the Government side, support the amendment put down by Fine Gael as we feel that the motion is premature.  It is dangerous and foolhardy to speculate on the likely outcome of the Supreme Court decision as the motion appears to do.  The <i>res judicata</i> has been given to a certain extent, in so far as the Supreme Court has overturned the High Court injunction preventing the girl travelling from this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The reasoning for the Supreme Court decision has not yet been made public, although I understand the full text of the judgment by the highest court in our land will soon be made available, hopefully, this week.  We do not know the reasons the Supreme Court may give.  We do not know how complex such a judgment will be until we know the full content of the judgment, including all the <i>obiter dicta</i>, etc.  I feel we should not comment further or embark on an avenue of speculation which might be damaging.  The Government side are committed &mdash; I would like this to be emphasised again &mdash; to allow a debate on this most important issue.  In our view &mdash; and I think this is the view of all the major parties &mdash; when the text of the Supreme Court decision comes to hand, and having had a chance to study the text, we will then have a full debate on it.  It may be at that stage that we, on <Col N="1076" /> this side of the House, might differ from Fine Gael, the Progressive Democrats or Labour on certain aspects of this decision, but that remains to be seen.</P>
    <P>I compliment the expeditious manner in which the Supreme Court dealt with this sensitive issue.  Sometimes the courts are criticised for delays and so, but the Surpreme Court took this appeal on board and in a matter of hours rather than days were able to come up with a decision.  Hopefully, the full text will be made available to us in the very near future and a full debate will possibly come before this House next week or as soon as is practicable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel like starting off by asking the last speaker to define &ldquo;as soon as is practicable&rdquo; because it is quite relevant.</P>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;resolves to defer detailed discussion of Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution until Members have had an opportunity of studying the full text of the Supreme Court judgment interpreting its application in the recent case of a 14 year old rape victim.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I find myself in little disagreement with both the mover and seconder of the motion, as I feel many in this House would tonight.  I regret that divisiveness has to creep into this House in our debate on such a difficult and sensitive issue.  I had hoped that all parties, including the Independents, could contribute to a considered and lengthy debate on the issues that have convulsed the nation in the last few weeks on what many may consider the stupidity of what was done in 1983 and the detailed judgment we await from the Supreme Court on the specific case that has been brought to our attention in recent weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am one who spoke two weeks ago in this House, so my views on the general issue before us are on record.  I will repeat a couple of sentences of what I said then. I stated there must never be another case <Col N="1077" /> like this, referring to the 14 year old. What we as legislators must do must be done now to ensure that no victim of rape or sexual abuse, nor the victim's family, will in future be confronted by the trauma of the appalling court proceedings we recently witnessed.  I was referring to the High Court proceedings at that stage.  I went on to say that we needed broad political agreement on the necessary steps to be taken, even if that involves a referendum.  Regrettably, I believe it will involve a referendum, I said on that occasion &mdash; and I still believe it will involve a referendum &mdash; then that must be faced up to.  Those are my views, as of two weeks ago, on the record and the views of most of my colleagues in this party.</P>
    <P>I feel that bashing certain political parties because you do not like the wording of our amendment or because of the logistics of the amendment, if you like, is in many ways distracting from the real issue before the House.  I regret the tone taken by the mover and the seconder of the motion.  In fact, I am surprised by the tone taken by them in relation to the amendment.  I have no difficulty in discussing it.  If they wish to talk for the rest of this evening and all of next week, we will vote and then decide.  Hopefully, Sir, once we have the judgment of the Supreme Court &mdash; we expect it either late tonight, tomorrow or in the next day or two &mdash; we will then have the all-day debate that was promised by the Leader today &mdash; an all-day debate, not a few hours here and there, as Private Members' debates are structured at this moment, but an all-day debate on this critical issue.</P>
    <P>Ironically it is my view, for what it is worth and the little time we have here tonight to discuss it, that the amendment 40.3.3º allows for conditional abortion in this country whereas the situation pre-1983 prohibited abortion under any circumstances. By introducing the expressions &ldquo;with due regard to the equal right of life of the mother&rdquo; and &ldquo;as far as is practicable&rdquo; they are allowing abortions in certain cases.  In fact, the amendment merely weakened the position in <Col N="1078" /> this country from the perspective of those who were trying to tighten it up relative to the position pre-1983.</P>
    <P>There is a lot to be talked about and above all we need light and not heat in debating this issue.  It is very hard to be emotional, but as far as possible we must try to analyse the situation.  I accept what Senator Brendan Ryan said, that we must confront ourselves, analyse what we are at, where we are coming from and, more importantly, where we are going to as a nation.  A lot of good may come from this child's trauma if we face up to the situation and become realistic and not always be offering Irish solutions to Irish problems.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael in 1983 did not approve of the wording that was being promoted for the amendment.  We did foolishly, as did Fianna Fáil and others, get caught up in pre-election promises to put a referendum before the people on the issue. Even though Fine Gael did not approve the wording that was finally voted through this House &mdash; we had been advised by the Attorney General at the time, Peter Sutherland, that it did not make sense, that it was a legal minefield and he has been proven right subsequently &mdash; we must take the consequences because we were in Government at the time and we must face up to whatever resolutions are needed.  I think another time rather than Private Members' Time must be used for a considered and informed debate on this most important of issues.</P>
    <P>I would urge support all round for the amendment.  I take the point Senator Ryan made that the debate will have happened and the amendment might seem to be saying that we should not have had it, or that we should not have it, but there is a very clear message in the amendment which I hoped the movers of the motion would have got.  The motion appeals for all party support in terms of attacking this issue.  There is divisiveness already in the very fact that we cannot agree the structures in which we debate it.</P>
    <P>I must compliment the Leader for allowing a discussion on this issue in the <Col N="1079" /> Seanad two weeks ago, even though a similar debate has yet to take place in Dáil Éireann.  Let us be fair, it has yet to take place in Dáil Éireann and we have already had one discussion.  We are having a sort of a discussion here tonight even though most of us feel it should be left for the all-day debate.  We will have both now, as it transpires, and so be it.</P>
    <P>I urge that we do not introduce contention or divisiveness even in Private Members' time.  This issue is more important than any of our personal views. The collective wisdom of this House and further afield will have enormous difficulty in resolving it.  There are far wiser men and women than ourselves trying to solve this problem, who have been trying to solve it for a long time, and have yet to come up with a solution.  I do not think we should overrate our importance except that this is a Parliamentary Chamber and we must do our duty by debating an issue that is of urgent concern, an issue that has convulsed this nation.  One of the few benefits of the Seanad over the Dáil is that we can respond more immediately to the issues of the day rather than go through very protracted procedures before we can get on the Order Paper topics we would like to discuss.  That is an enormous benefit of the Seanad, and we must never deny it.</P>
    <P>I urge unity in our approach to this issue.  I have no difficulty with a lot of what is in the motion &ldquo;...the uncertainty of interpretation which resulted in such unnecessary trauna&rdquo;; nobody disagrees with that; ...the ban on certain types of information&rdquo;, nobody disagrees with the difficulties that has caused; providing &ldquo;comprehensive counselling, advice and support services&rdquo;, nobody disagrees with that.</P>

I will conclude by saying that I welcome the opportunity, which I hope maybe next Thursday, as has been indicated provisionally by the Leader of the House &mdash; assuming of course that we have the Supreme Court judgment, which I think we should have any day &mdash; for a full and comprehensive debate on this most difficult of issues.  I hope it will not be divisive and will allow those of all views, and differing views on this issue, and of none, regardless of their party affiliations to say their piece and to put on the record their personal views on what for many people is a very difficult topic to discuss and to decide on where they should come down.</P>
      <P>I personally feel that a referendum will be the only ultimate solution to the problem. I know there are many people who have no stomach for it.  We need only look back to 1983 and understand why they feel like that.  Let us put our heads together and do what we can and hopefully add something, to resolving the issue that has been before us now for so long and ensure that never again will we witness this spectacle of a 14-year-old, or indeed any other woman being hauled before the courts in Ireland to answer for her personal decision in relation to a matter as difficult as this.</P>

      <P>I have a lot of support and sympathy for the view put forward here both by Government and the main Opposition party.  For the record I do not believe that it is kicking to touch on their part.  I accept their sincerity in this matter. Unless we make the generous gestures of accepting the sincerity of others in this matter we are not going to get very far towards an all-party consensus, which is important not only on this matter but on other difficult decisions being made in amending the Constitution.  I speak, for example, of a possible divorce amendment, not to speak of constitutional change in the Northern context.  Whatever past we have all had and whatever we could draw up about people's stupidity in accepting unnecessary amendments and so on, we are now into a new chapter and I think we should behave accordingly.</P>

    <P>However, I am still mystified by the Fine Gael amendment, because whatever about the Government approach today on the Order of Business &mdash; after all, I suppose they had to accept that this was in Independent Member's time &mdash; certainly if Fine Gael did not agree with it they should have opposed the Order of Business instead of having this inexplicable amendment.  I do not intend to speak at length because we had an opportunity two weeks ago and I accept that we are going to have quite a long debate again very soon.  I also accept that the reasons the Supreme Court will give will <Col N="1082" /> make no essential difference to the situation. Senator Ryan made that point today to me in conversation.  Nonetheless, I think all of us will be more fully informed in approaching this topic when we have the reasons for the judgment.</P>
    <P>I was not involved in the 1983 referendum because I was not in the House at that time &mdash; due to a regrettable electoral oversight, on the part of graduates &mdash; but I felt in 1983 that the amendment was unnecessary and ever since then, long before this tragic case came up, I felt that it has been increasingly disastrous.  It is undeniably denominational, because if you have a section in the Constitution like the absolute prohibition on divorce which is the teaching of one, and only one, Church in the State, then that inescapably marks the Constitution in these clauses as denominational.  For that reason alone it is suspect.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle and others have pointed out how very difficult this issue is and Senator Norris has said that nobody really in their right mind is pro abortion. Even those who are very liberal in their attitude to contraception, who have no difficulty about the universal availability of contraceptives, are really uneasy about abortion.  It is for that reason that the feminist principle of women's right to choose and women having the absolute right over their own bodies obviously is unacceptable to our society at least, because in the ultimate it involves abortion for any reason.  That absolute feminist principle, to me at any rate, is unacceptable.  On the other hand, where life begins is a mystery even to the physiologists and I certainly could not possibly accept that a fertilised speck has the same rights as a adult.</P>
    <P>But let us not go into that at the moment.  It is enough to say that the Article 4.3.3º is an unsuitable vehicle for conveying this kind of belief or legislation. As has been pointed out by Dr. Margaret Fine-Davis &mdash; and I quoted her in my contribution two weeks ago &mdash; it is quite obvious from the way people make reservations and exceptions when they are asked if they would allow abortion in certain cases that a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; crudity <Col N="1083" /> is not an adequate vehicle to convey what should be the rule of the country about such a complicated matter.</P>
    <P>I thought the High Court judgment followed logically from the rigour of Article 40.3.3º and I thought the ban on information followed logically from Article 40.3.3º.  That ban on information is stupid and infantile.  It leads to such absurdities as the blotting out of an abortion number from an <i>Irish Times</i> photograph. That kind of pretence really recalls what Friedrich Engels said in the famous observation to Marx: he was fond of Ireland, but Ireland exasperated him; and one of the things that exasperated him was how the people of Ireland feel that their concerns, the concerns of this <i>insula sancta</i>, must on no account be mixed up with the concerns of the central world outside of Ireland.  There is still much of that hypocrisy and self-deception evident, particularly on what I would call the logical consequences of the constitutional amendment.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris's observations on his experience as a tutor makes me wonder what would be the consequences if there were everywhere a more enlightened and open approach to the problems of sexuality, not simply abortion.  It is possible, for example, that, if we had not imposed this rigorous constitutional ban in 1983 and had instead opted for open counselling and retention of the existing law on abortion, we might have fewer abortions and certainly a less fearful and apprehensive climate in the context of which so many women go to England to shamefully have performed what cannot happen at home.</P>
    <P>I am not going to go any further than that except to say that I support the motion.  It may well be that the most unlikely place to look for a model for our problems is Northern Ireland, which despite its horrific problems and conflict has, it seems to me, quite a sensible <i>modus vivendi</i>&mdash; if that is the appropriate word in this context &mdash; both in terms of the contraception issues and of abortion without what many people would regard <Col N="1084" /> as the permissiveness of the approach in other countries in this regard.  I repeat that I fully support the appeals at this stage for no acrimony, for the utmost in co-operation, because it is only through the ultimate consensus of the constitutional parties that we have any hope of securing a solution to this problem.</P>
    <P>May I make two points in conclusion which have no relation to this at all?  I welcome the Minister and wish him well in his portfolio.  May I also ask the Chair to note that in this small Chamber there are frequently three or four different conversations going on &mdash; at the moment I am fortunate &mdash; while a speaker is on his or her feet.  I think that is enormously distracting.</P>

      <P>It had not been my intention to speak tonight but I think it is critically important that the Government at least have to respond on this issue.  I find it extraordinary that we finally have come to the point of discussing this most pressing and topical issue in the public mind at the moment &mdash; the kind of issue which we from all sides of the House have determined should be discussed in this House &mdash; we fail to find any people to discuss it.  I do not know when we last had three groups in the House supporting an amendment which means nothing, and it certainly does not mean anything.  I just wonder what view these groups are going to take next week if in the meantime the Supreme Court judgment becomes available.  Are we still, despite all that, going to press this amendment?  Have the other groups considered their position in that situation?  How can you then decide that we should defer the motion?  The <Col N="1085" /> amendment, which has been duly proposed and seconded by the Progressive Democrats this evening, will then come before us in a situation where the information required is there; yet you are still committed to deciding that we will defer discussion that has taken place on the basis of the text of the Supreme Court not being available, though it will be available by that time.  It seems an extraordinary convoluted, contortionist approach to debate.</P>
      <P>I go along with the views of the people who said that nobody wants to be fighting again an amendment on this issue.  Many of us were scarred the last time around. I personally take the view that I would have been in this House five or six years earlier were it not for the row in 1983 and I get a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach with the thoughts of another amendment, debate and argument.  That is why I would like to point out that Senator Ryan's motion in the first place seeks all-party support for a referendum. I fail to see how that can be seen to be divisive.  It might well be that that discussion or that approach can only begin after the Supreme Court information has become available.  I do not actually see it that way myself, but if people interpret it that way they are quite entitled to do so.  But surely it is a matter that is open for debate.</P>
      <P>In regard to the idea of depriving people of information, Senator Ryan talked about the extraordinary position of a pregnant person who wishes to go to another jurisdiction to terminate a pregnancy. It is all right for that person to travel in ignorance, but it is unconstitutional to travel informed.  It is the old story of walking backwards into the future.  Every way we look at this conundrum we have created for ourselves, it is not open to clear interpretation, it is not open to clear application and it certainly does not touch in any caring, responsible and supportive way the lives of ordinary people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about information because my job as a teacher was a job of communication.  That has always been the concern of teachers. <Col N="1086" /> Every time the word &ldquo;sex&rdquo; raises its head, every time the word &ldquo;morality&rdquo; in the sexual context raises its head, it all goes back to information.  It is the old mushroom policy: tell them nothing, keep them in the dark, and watch them grow &mdash; and the other bits as well.  It seems precisely the way we approach tricky issues in our society.  I have already referred to the fact that the life of the young child &mdash; and she was only a child &mdash; in the middle of this whole controversy has been ruined.  I hope I am wrong in what I say, but I cannot see any way that that child will ever fully recover from her horrible experience at our hands &mdash; and all of us who are legislators must take responsibility.  There is collective responsibility there and, whatever side we took, we have to take some responsibility for it.  We have hurt that young child, for whatever the reason willy-nilly we have done it at this stage.  We had the opportunity in 1983 perhaps to go a different way but, we choose as a nation not to do it.  Democracy has taken its toll, and it has been a high price indeed.</P>
    <P>I feel that the point which Senator Norris made about the lack of information available to young people is causing a huge problem.  Let me tie the present situation into the general problems that are experienced by young people.  Apart from all that has happened since this young person's pregnancy became public knowledge, the crucial thing for me and for many teachers and, I am sure, for many parents also would be that were it not for the fact that she became pregnant nobody would ever have known that she had been abused and was being consistently and continually sexually abused.  The parents only became aware of it when they became aware of her pregnancy.  I think that that is horrific in itself, because that means that in our society there are many other children suffering similarly but who do not know how to cope because we do not give the information; who do not know how to respond because we pretend it does not happen; who do not know where to go for help because there is no help there for them.  That is the society <Col N="1087" /> that we are running.  We are failing to respond, we are failing to address these issues and we will continue to keep this going.</P>
    <P>I spoke on this particular issue in the context of the debate about the 14-year-old schoolgirl and the response I got through phone calls and the letters took me back ten years, it was like <i>deja vu</i>&mdash; the same old letters, the same old phone calls, the same people, because they have been mobilised and are on the war path again and, as they put it themselves, they are on a war footing to take us on all over again.  I have no doubt about the horrific consequences to Irish society were we to go into another amendment to the Constitution and my hope would be that it would not have to happen.  However, from what I have read from the Supreme Court, the legal position, a reading of the Constitution, the response from constitutional lawyers, the response from legislators, every indication is that we are going to have to grasp this nettle once again.  For that reason the proposal from Senator Ryan that such an approach would be all-party, would be collective, surely has the most merit and surely must be the approach that anybody in this House would go along with.</P>
    <P>We are coming towards the end of tonight's debate and a week will see many changes.  I would like to make a final appeal.  I realise I have some time left next week and I hope that when I come back to finish my contribution next Wednesday evening times will have changed and that the parties who are represented here will do the correct thing and will not push this extraordinary, I suppose extraordinary is not the proper word for it, the proposed amendment which is not capable of being implemented.  At least one can then say times have changed and circumstances alter cases.  Do not push that incredible piece of nonsense and we promise not to make any jokes about it next week.  Let it die the death it is entitled to.</P>

      <Col N="1088" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a comprehensive document which gives Members an opportunity to reflect on the electoral system that has evolved since the 1918 Sinn Féin election.  Little change has been made over the years.  While I have complimented the Minister on the comprehensive nature of this legislation, there are still a few areas that could enhance the living and working conditions of those who are lucky enough to be elected.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to consider, at a later stage, extending to the Cathaoirleach of this House the same re-election facility that is accorded to the Ceann Comhairle. A conscientious Cathaoirleach, according to precedent and procedure, has to stay a certain distance away from his or her political party.  If they were lucky to enjoy a four and a half or five year term of office they could find themselves far from the electors and their party.  To assist the holder of that office to be impartial, he or she should have that facility.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I am making the point.  One likes to do the job as it is laid down and as precedent dictates, but it is very difficult to do that if one is meeting the electors daily and one is discouraged from associating with them.</P>
      <P>There are many improvements which will add to the orderly operation of the poll.  When I became involved in parliamentary elections over 30 years ago tempers were often frayed.  Perhaps because we are more mature or better educated or perhaps it is due to apathy and disinterest, but election campaigns or final rallies which are now fought on television do not have the same sense of excitement.  There is not as much hot air or vexatious remarks exchanged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1089" /> It would be an improvement if election literature and posters were controlled.  It is tantamount to a significant waste of money and is a drain on the financial resources of political parties.  In winter the posters and literature may not last very long because of the damage done by storms.  It would be nice if, on election day, as is suggested in the Bill, displaying posters and literature in the precincts of the polling stations could be dispensed with.  In legislation like this there should be room for an element of trial and error to see how we can improve the situation.</P>
    <P>I note the Minister is not taking too many opportunities to introduce regulations this is the type of comprehensive Bill where one would expect the Minister for the Environment to have power to introduce regulations.  The older members of the population, those who are retired or octogenarians, read a lot and are often interested in politics.  They like to vote.  In practically every election some very elder persons in their nineties in bad health will be driven up to a polling station.  It is such an effort to get them out of the car and into the polling station, which may have steps leading up to it. The Minister should consider allowing the presiding officer to bring a ballot paper to the car to facilitate elderly persons. I do not think it would tip the scales to any degree.  It is nice to meet people who may not have been able to leave their homes for some time.  Disabled or handicapped people should not be put through the physical trauma of going into a polling station.  Many of these polling stations are held in buildings such as schools and the older buildings may have steps leading up to them.  Modern school buildings should have ramps to facilitiate people in wheelchairs.  The Minister might look at that issue.</P>
    <P>As far as Seanad elections are concerned, it would make a significant difference if nominations for election to the Seanad whether for panel Members or university constituency Members, were closed a day earlier than polling day.  That would make a significant difference to the composition of this House and probably to the esteem in which this House <Col N="1090" /> is held.  That may or may not suit any particular party in or out of power, but nevertheless it would make a significant contribution to this House.  It would demonstrate that the House is established in its own right.  People would opt as a matter of choice to contest and perhaps win election to the Seanad.  One hears jibes very often in the media and elsewhere that in the main the political system uses the Seanad to train in or blood candidates for the Dáil.  I do not know whether that is so, but it would be an opportunity to rid ourselves of that criticism.</P>
    <P>I do not have very strong views on opinion polls.  Many Members seem to hold very strong views on this matter.  I concede that nowadays the newspapers have very few reporters.  In the main they are correspondents who do not give a verbatim report of what a candidate says but their comment on what they think he said or should have said.  That puts a different perspective on the question of polls.  Electors are greatly influenced by the mass media rather than making up their minds by listening to what candidates say or observing how they perform. That could be dangerous in a democracy.  Democracy is one of the most delicate forms of government. Therefore, it must be protected.  People have rights.  We would hope that they would cherish the right to vote.  Sometimes there is a very low turnout in elections. Very often the people who complain about the performance of a Government or a public representative are those who do not spare half an hour to go and vote and do their duty as loyal citizens.  There is no point in being abusive and blaming a Government, a Minister or Deputy; it is the people who elect Members of the Oireachtas and it is up to the people to consider their choice in the run up to election day.  We are inclined to forget that.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of luck attached to the PR system.  In the larger constituencies, the location of the candidate who is eliminated very clearly determines the progress of the next candidate.  That is a hit and miss situation.  Very often the <Col N="1091" /> returning officer's assistance can considerably influence the turn of the election count by picking some of the votes from one box or another.  It is not all cut and dried.  It is difficult to translate it straight from the reference book or from this Bill.  I do not know how officers of the Department of the Environment can improve that situation.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to consider Sunday polling.  People should be facilitated regarding the times of voting.  In winter elections the number of hours that the polling booths remain open can be slightly shorter than in summer time when people have more outdoor pursuits or work longer.  The arrangements for the holding of elections is given too low a priority.  It is haphazard.  The election boxes and so on are very old.  I do not think the Department spend any money upgrading the service.  I remember working at a by-election in a western constituency a few years ago where, in the main, the presiding officer did not even bother to put up the cubicles.  That kind of slipshod approach should not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>If one wants to pull strokes at elections or do people out of votes, especially in rural areas where the presiding officers will have a 90 per cent shot at guessing what way one is going to vote, there is the old dodge of not stamping the ballot paper, which means the vote is invalid. In every election one finds hundreds of ballot papers that are spoiled and, irrespective of who the votes are cast for, it is an absolute nonsense and the presiding officer in those polling stations should never again have the opportunity of working in a polling station.  It does not take a genius to look at the serial number and see which polling stations it came from.  The Electoral Act should be enforced to the full with vigour and with the full force of the law.  Our democratic system must be protected against people who either take shortcuts or people who want to buck the system.  There is no room for that.  Irrespective of who stands to gain or lose, there should be one vote for one person.  People who are found <Col N="1092" /> guilty of offending against the code should be dealt with severely.  I hope the new Minister will be quite firm.  It is necessary to preserve out status as a democracy.</P>
    <P>A few years ago one would find a garda in every polling station.  Now there is a garda for quite a number of polling stations so that ballot boxes are transported to two or three stop off points on the way by the presiding officer.  I do not think that is good enough.  In every general election there are very close counts.  There are recounts and the temptation is there for people to interfere with the system.  It is not clear beyond a shadow of a doubt that every box is properly escorted to the counting place. I ask the Minister to ensure that there is an adequate police presence in every single polling station across the country. During the last couple of elections the Garda presence was reduced for the simple reason that the Garda authorities did not want to pay overtime.  I do not think that is any excuse.  There should be adequate services there to ensure that the letter of the law is upheld.</P>
    <P>When we are talking about protecting our democratic institutions and our rights we must remember that eternal vigilance is required.  If one leaves loopholes that give some people the opportunity to be smart and impersonate, they will take it. That is common to a lot of parties.  I am not talking about any particular party, but as a participant in and an observer of elections for almost 40 years one does not have to be blind to see that.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in this very comprehensive legislation, has a great opportunity to use the experience that all parties have gained over the years to improve the situation.  I hope the novel methods the Minister has introduced will pay off.  I would like him to have the opportunity to make regulations between elections.  We need to search for the optimum system.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Government have yet again deferred for a further period the proposal to hold the municipal and regional elections that were promised for the last couple of years.  That <Col N="1093" /> promised to be a novel approach to local government.  We all know that local government, as a result of the way it is financed, has been going through a very difficult time.  It is important that the Minister should endeavour to hold regional elections this year.</P>
    <P>On the question of the corporations, it would be a pity if the old corporations with charters, such as the city of Kilkenny and Clonmel, were to be abolished or left without the traditional mayor.  Most of those old boroughs have charters going back a long way.  Tradition is nice.  If we are going to go full blast into tourism we should conserve every possible opportunity of having a certain amount of pomp and pageantry for the people who represent cities and towns.</P>
    <P>I do not know if bribery has raised its ugly head to any great extent but it is something that we should be conscious of.  This is a very comprehensive Bill which will lend itself to debate on Committee Stage, when we will have the opportunity to deal in depth with its many sections and the many novel suggestions proposed.  There are some sections I have doubts about, but perhaps the Minister will allay my fears.</P>
    <P>As regards regulations for facilitating incapacitated people, those with impaired vision and especially illiterate electors, many years ago there were better facilities and better treatment of those people than now.  At present, many illiterate electors appear to be hijacked on their way into polling stations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That needs to be examined.  I doubt if my good friend from Trinity is correct in describing these people as illiterate.  There may be better descriptions, but that probably would not be one of them.</P>
      <P>We must try to improve the situation. The Act under which people will have an opportunity to register their vote must be such as to encourage them to recognise their rights as citizens and to exercise their vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1094" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. S. Byrne Mr. S. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and wish him well.  Given his interest and involvement in local government over the years he will be a very practical Minister. He has served the people in his constituency for a number of years.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It is a very good, constructive, worthwhile and timely Bill that has updated antiquated law.  I agree with many points made by Senator McDonald.  As regards the question of voting at weekends, whether on Saturday or Sunday, we have 60,000 to 70,000 young students of voting age in our colleges, regional colleges and universities. Most of them come from rural Ireland and the cost to their parents makes it unconstitutional, to say the least, to deprive them of the right to vote.  Most referenda, general and local elections are held mid-week.  Young people today are the men and women of tomorrow, who will be charged with looking after the nation.  We should accommodate students since most general elections and referenda are held in the month of June when exams are taking place.  To expect young people to leave Dublin, Donegal or wherever they are in college to travel half the length and breadth of the country to vote and return to continue their exams is unfair.  I hope the Minister will take that into consideration.</P>
      <P>Students have a constitutional right to vote.  I know there is a lobby against it and it might be inconvenient for many within the system, but as Senator McDonald stated it is a cornerstone of democracy to enable people to vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator McDonald about facilities being made available in polling stations to accommodate people who, through ill health, may not be able to get into the polling booth; they, too, should be accommodated.  In many rural polling stations there is no proper public lighting. When elections are held in the fall of the year or in early spring it is unsafe particularly for older people to go into badly lit polling stations.  The Minister should see to it that the local authority or whoever is responsible ensures that all polling booths stations, particularly in country areas, are properly lit so that <Col N="1095" /> people will not be staggering around in the dark.  The present situation is not good enough.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly that young people should be enabled to vote while they are studying.  This is their country and a general election, a referendum or a local election may change their future substantially without their having a say, due to exams or travel costs.  Some people may reply glibly that they can vote in Dublin or in Cork if they are studying there, but they have a right to vote in their own constituencies and that opportunity should be there for them.</P>
    <P>Thousands of other people due to their occupation are away from home during the week and cannot come home on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday evening to vote; they too have been deprived of their constitutional right to vote.  I do not suggest postal votes because there are all kinds of dangers in that system.  People who, due to the nature of their employment, cannot be at home to vote, have a right to vote.  It may not be necessary to amend this Bill, there may be other ways in which these people can be accommodated, but if necessary it should be included seeing we are updating an antiquated system which consisted of bits and scraps of legislation all over the place.</P>
    <P>Voters' registers can vary widely from one constituency to another.  I am not criticising county council officials but some counties produce nice tidy ones, maybe the size of the Seanad report, handy and easy to flick through to check voters' names; other counties produce registers with which one could paper the Seanad Chamber.  The Department of the Environment should enforce a standard type of voting list in every constituency with good quality printing produced in a standard size.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald mentioned the important matter of polling stations.  A few years ago an effort was made &mdash; I suppose the initiative came from the Department of the Environment &mdash; to close down a number of polling stations in every constituency.  I resisted that <Col N="1096" /> appalling move in my own constituency. Garda stations were closed down 25 years ago to save money and that was a mistake. National schools were closed down, although many of them should not have been.  The same thing happened in creameries and post offices and so on. Anything people in rural Ireland have is being taken from them, but one thing which should not be taken from them is their right to vote in their own area.  In cities and bigger towns there are a number of polling booths within ten minutes walk, but in country areas the distance may be five or ten miles.  People are being deprived of civil rights in order to make the system easier for those operating it.  I reject that attitude to people in rural Ireland and I hope it will not continue.</P>
    <P>The right to vote is a cornerstone of democracy.  Sixty people in a rural parish have as much right to a convenient polling station as people in cities.  Stations should be properly lit and furnished to suit old and young.  Rural people for the past 25 years have been too quiet; they have allowed many of the services available to them down the years to be taken from them with little savings made in the heel of the hunt.</P>
    <P>We have excellent staff in our local authorities who conduct elections and counts with great efficiency.  There may be room for improvement in the system of counting general elections and elsewhere, and the Department should look at that matter.  Counts can be chaotic at times.  Often the people who need to view the counting process have to struggle to see what is happening, which is not right. Only a minimum number of people should be allowed in if accommodation is limited.  The Minister should bear that in mind.</P>
    <P>I wish the Bill every success and hope the Minister will take on board the points I made about young people and people with employment which keeps them away from home so that they cannot vote mid-week. Twelve months ago I discussed this matter with some of my party colleagues and was told that lobbies existed on both sides against it.  I do not care about <Col N="1097" /> lobbies; the right to vote is a precious thing dearly bought.  Sections of the media sometimes criticise young people saying they have no interest in politics or in their country; we should make it easy for them to vote and not expect them to travel 200 or 300 miles in one day to vote, and their parents to carry the burden of that cost.  Neither should we expect them to interrupt exams which will determine their future.</P>
    <P>I wish the new Minister every success in the future.</P>

      <P>I welcome the provisions which tidy up certain areas of the electoral system.  It would not be appropriate for me at the end of a long day to start philosophising about the nature of democracy, the rights of man and so on. We all are agreed that the right to vote is an essential right for citizens of this country and we all know how precious is that right.  All sides of the House recognise and cherish it.  One hundred and fifty years ago or thereabouts the franchise was the prerogative of a privileged group and many people were excluded from voting.  During the period of Grattan's Parliament I think there was a religous test for voting which was extraordinarily regrettable, divisive, sectarian and wrong.  Land and property qualifications existed also, together with rotten boroughs.  Now, thank God, we have universal sufferage &mdash; I had forgotten that women had been excluded &mdash; and I welcome that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As previous speakers stressed, it is important that conditions be as favourable as possible in order to encourage people to vote.  I agree with the previous Senator who spoke about the necessity to provide decent polling booths and stations throughout the country acceptable to the elderly, to those in scattered farming districts and so on.  I concur with anything that encourages people to vote but I disagree with Senator Ryan when he says he is in favour of compulsory voting.  That is an outrageous idea. People should be encouraged to vote but compulsion will only produce resistance. I regret that a number of people in this <Col N="1098" /> society, which is possibly growing, do not wish to exercise their right to vote.  They have a democratic right not to exercise that right if they do not want to and compelling them to vote would be an absolute nonsense.  That would violate their rights of conscience and their right to exercise one particular option, which is not to go into a polling station and spoil the vote, but to stay away altogether. They have a perfect right to do that.</P>
    <P>I am a member of a gym and when I sit around with people in the sauna and talk about politics and so on, a number of them tell me they have never voted and never intend to vote they think we are all terribly corrupt and if I am not corrupt then I am an eejit.  I do not share this view.  I think it a great pity that so many decent young people appear to hold this view, but attempting to coerce such people into a polling booth will only disillusion them further.  I am completely and utterly against compulsory voting and I was horrified to hear an otherwise liberal colleague and friend, Senator B. Ryan advocate it, and he did not appear to produce any satisfactory justification for this aberration of civil and human rights.</P>
    <P>I am also against the proposed increase in the candidate's deposit to £500 because this appears to me to reintroduce some degree of property qualfication into the system.  Everybody should have the right to participate equally in the democratic system and this provision is wrong.  I do not care that this appears to be an equivalence of the £100 that was there for so many years; if the value of the deposit reduces so much the better.  I am not worried about loony parties or loony individuals; there have been a few not only among the successful candidates on the University Panel but among the unsuccessful ones.  Some candidates were regarded as eccentric, but that was a personal view of successful candidates among us; we thought we could spot the eccentrics.  Although I was not one of them, some people thought the Green Party was completely eccentric and on the lunatic fringe and would never get anywhere.  They did, however, and <Col N="1099" /> placed ecology and environmental concern on the political agenda.</P>
    <P>The deposit increase is not a wise or good move and Senator Eoin Ryan last week raised the question of a man who stands mischievously in a constituency under the same name as a legitimate candidate, and he gave an instance where this happened.  That may be a problem but it will not be solved by increasing the amount of deposit money required.  A vexatious candidate may have plenty of money and if this vexatious candidate managed to secure such a considerable body of votes from the other candidate, he probably did not lose his deposit anyway.  I do not accept the contention that an increased deposit is likely to deter vexatious candidates and I am against it.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that one can disqualify a political party from standing on the grounds that one does not approve of some of the things they stand for.  I deeply disapprove of Provisional Sinn Féin and the IRA and everything they stand for, but I think they have a right to stand in parliamentary elections.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong, dangerous and counterproductive to do so as a number of Members here have suggested and remove their right to stand because of their advocacy of violent methods.  If one believes in democracy one must accept that people have a right to say things with which one profoundly and desperately disagrees and I wish that Sinn Féin would get more involved in the political process rather than remain excluded from it. Another political party, formerly known as The Workers' Party, whose armed wing committed bombing atrocities, including the bombing at Aldershot, eventually made their way into democratic politics and have made a significant and worth-while contribution to the political process in this country.</P>
    <P>If Sinn Féin could be encouraged to take more responsibility in democratic politics, then I would absolutely and unequivocally welcome it; they should be encouraged to do so rather than discouraged. I object completely to their ideas but it would be counterproductive <Col N="1100" /> to attempt to stifle them by refusing to allow them to stand at elections.  The best outcome of all would be for them to stand and be roundly trounced, as happens regularly in the south of Ireland.  We would be leaving people open to despair in certain sections of the north of Ireland if they believed that having tried to take a democratic route they would be cut off from that particular avenue.</P>
    <P>I would like to talk a little about the votes for the disabled and to note the honourable and heroic struggle of a disabled woman, Mrs. Nora Dreaper, who is now deceased but who struggled for many years to obtain rights for the disabled to vote, and in particular to vote at home.  The legislative change which accords that right is welcome.  It is patronising to require disabled people to produce a certificate that they are of sound mind.  Why should they be treated in this way?  People who are able to walk are not necessarily of sounder mind than those who are disabled or, as they now say, differently able.  I think this is a most offensive and patronising attitude.</P>
    <P>I was concerned to hear my colleague, Senator Hederman, indicate that in city council elections prospective councillors are prohibited from putting the word &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; after their name on the ballot paper.  This is wrong and absurd and I do not see the reason for it.  &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; may not be a political party but it is an ideological stance and one which I naturally think is a valuable and decent position to take.  I urge that in these elections it be made perfectly clear that people can indicate to their voters that they are standing as an Independent candidate. There is a large measure of support and approval among the voters for Independent candidates.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate now to turn our attention to doing something about voting rights for emigrants.  Like many other people in this Chamber I have received considerably lobbying material on this matter from people in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Germany, Brussels, London and so on.  While I was in Australia a few months ago this was one of the subjects young Irish emigrants consistently <Col N="1101" /> brought up; they write about it in their newspapers and feel most aggrieved about it.</P>
    <P>I have always felt that an allocation of seats in Seanad Éireann would be an appropriate way to deal with this and I see from the records that Fine Gael feel the same.  However, recent correspondence from emigrant groups indicates to me that they do not want to be bought off in this manner and do not see it as appropriate.  It is not sufficient nor is it the mechanism by which they wish to be included in the electoral process. Perhaps they can be led to see the advantages of the proposal; I do not know. Perhaps they have strong arguments against it.  I wrote back to these people and asked for more information about their reasoning because they had previously stated that they did not regard it as suitable or sufficient.  I pointed out to them that they should perhaps be more delicate about approaching Senators and saying &ldquo;We do not consider Seanad representation any use at all; we are not going to be fooled by this kind of rubbish&rdquo;. I thought it a little tactless that they should address these dismissive remarks to someone who is a Member of the Seanad.  I presume that their principal target was Members of the Dáil and so on.  However we should include emigrants as far as possible in the electoral process particularly because they unfortunately constitute the most talented and best educated sections of our society.</P>
    <P>On the subject of registers, I agree with previous speakers who indicated that they feel that the previous method of maintaining the register over the Christmas period is inappropriate.  So it is.  At least it has had odd affects.  On several occasions I was equipped with a most unnatural baggage &mdash; a wife who behaved in a very peculiar way.  She appeared on the register, then she disappeared, then she was back again and I was extremely confused.  I was not aware whether I was married, when I had married or if I was going to be married again. She came in useful on one occasion only when the computer of a building society I had a loan with had a nervous breakdown <Col N="1102" /> and sent me some extremely angry correspondence and then sent copies to my wife.  I wrote back to them and said I was taking action against them because they had severely affected the mental wellbeing of my wife who was unaware of the fact that I was so deeply in debt and who was then in hospital.  If they did not believe me they could check the electoral register and find that my wife was alive and voting regularly.  That was a humorous error but it indicates that some degree of inaccuracy exists.  I was told that Mrs. Mary Norris who resided at the same address as myself had voted several times on different sides in elections.  I do not know whether that is true or not, but these kinds of rumours were going around.</P>
    <P>I would like to make some comments on University seats.  I note that my old opponent in this, Senator Jackman, introduced some material in her contribution. When Senator Jackman receives more than 56 votes in an election I will listen more sympathetically to her diatribes on democracy, considering that I received nearly 2,500 direct votes.  I would like to take up a point made by a clear lucid and logical mind which graces this House, belonging to Senator Éamon Ó Cuív.  On this occasion his argument was unusually specious because he knew that people like myself objected to delegated universal suffrage as it operates in the elections on the panel system for this august House and I have ridiculed it from time to time.</P>
    <P>The Senator drew an analogy with the American presidential system, which is an incomplete and inaccurate parallel.  It is not a perfect analogy at all because unlike the election of county councils, who are elected principally and in the minds of most voters virtually exclusively to perform as councillors and chairpeople of local authorities and so on, the American system elects people directly to the colleges for the presidential election with the single purpose of procuring delegates for a presidential election convention. That is a direct, simple, unitary process and the intention all the way through is to produce a President of the United <Col N="1103" /> States of America.  It is not at all like the situation of election to a local authority where the intention is to get people to deal with important matters like rates, lighting, drainage, schools and so on; I am not denigrating these matters but they have nothing whatever to do with election to Seanad Éireann.  That is where the analogy falls down, so I reject it.</P>
    <P>The Seanad has a very important role to play and reforms may be necessary.  In terms of constituencies it would be highly appropriate to include the new Dublin City University as well as the technical colleges in the Dublin University constitutency. The University of Limerick could perhaps be included in the larger constituency of the National University of Ireland.  I would welcome that; these other universities should be included.  I warn against any attack on the University of Dublin constituency.  That would be a major error of political judgment for a number of reasons.  Members of the Anglican Communion are extraordinarily thin on the ground of both Houses.  There is one, Ivan Yates, in the Dáil; there are two in Seanad Éireann, Senator Ross and myself.  Senator Ross and myself both acquired this status through the university seats machinery. This confirms the continuing usefulness of the system in guaranteeing political representation for a religious, cultural, ethnic or whatever you like to call it, minority in this country.  A sustained attack on the university seats, which I do not believe would come in any sectarian or religious sense, might come because university candidates are perceived as irritating and clamourous and vocal and perhaps a little too radical and dissenting for some of what are perceived as mainstream ideas.  That may be the reason for the major political parties ganging up on us as Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have a marked propensity to do from time to time, but any change here would be perceived in the North of Ireland as a sectarian attack.  I do not believe it would be, but that is now it would be seen.</P>
    <P>It is very important to remember that the university seats and particularly the <Col N="1104" /> University of Dublin had a high percentage at one time of students from Northern Anglican Non-Conformist backgrounds registered as voters; it is one of the few ways whereby our separated brethren, if you like to call them that, in the North of Ireland participate in our democratic institutions.  I would urge that this facility be respected and treated with some degree of sensitivity.</P>
    <P>This is an effective Chamber although its proper function, which is to revise and amend legislation, to explore areas where the law has found itself either unable or unwilling to tread, is frequently disregarded. For example, the debate we had last week and tonight on the necessity for a referendum to remove Article 43.3³º of the Constitution, which the Dáil has yet to touch, and the debate we had some years ago an AIDS were extremely significant and important debates.</P>
    <P>This is a valuable House, almost by accident.  It is almost accidental that people of the calibre of many of my distinguished colleagues are elected to the Chamber because, unlike the situation in universities, the ordinary members of nominating bodies do not have the franchise. The only way to get a real constituency developing is to give them a vote and I would urge the Minister to consider that.  I would also urge him to consider a suggestion I have made repeatedly over the years: that the dates of nomination to election for both the Seanad and Dáil should be made to coincide so that people would be required to choose whether they wished to run for the Dáil or for the Seanad.  We would know that people who were elected to this Chamber were fully committed to it.</P>
    <P>With those reservations and observations I am happy to commend the Bill. It is an advance on our current position. I do not think it is necessary to welcome the Minister to the House because I did so the other day although, as he knows, I did not particularly welcome what he had to tell me on that particular issue. He is a courteous, charming and decent man and I am very glad he has acquired his position as Minister.  I look forward <Col N="1105" /> to him being in this House on many occasions in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Minister to the House.  I was delighted with his promotion.  I knew him through politics before he ever became a public representative.  I am delighted that he has gone from being a member of local government to being elected as a TD and that he is now a Minister.  I wish him every success in his new appointment.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to consolidate, with amendment the existing law relating to the election of Members to Dáil Éireann and the Bill proposes to deal with all aspects of the electoral process including the registration of electors and the procedure for questioning the result of a Dáil election by means of a petition.  This Bill is overdue.  It will make important changes in the system of maintaining an accurate register, which is most important.  There will also be changes in relation to special voters, changes in the amount of candidates' deposits, prohibition of canvassing in the vicinity of polling stations and of taking opinion polls within seven days of polling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand a new and shorter timescale for preparing the register will be introduced.  I welcome this change, because one of the problems with the present timetable is that some of the information in the register is already seven months out of date by the time the final register is published.  The time for scrutiny of the draft register by public representatives and the public generally spans the Christmas holidays.  It is hard to scrutinise the register properly and accurately at this holiday time.  Under existing law, work on the register commences in mid September, the draft register is published on 1 December and the period of 1 December to 15 January is allowed for display of the draft and submission of claims for correction.  The revision court sittings must be completed by 28 February and the register of electors is published on 1 April, coming into force on 15 April.  Under the new timescale <Col N="1106" /> the qualifying date will be 1 September and a draft will be published on 1 November.  Claims for correction will be made up to 25 November and revision court hearings will be completed by 23 December.  The register will be published on 1 February, coming into force on 15 February.  This will be an improvement. With a long timescale there can be carelessness. In a shorter timescale there will be a more accurate register and fewer omissions.  I welcome these changes and hope they will ensure that everyone entitled to be on the register will be on the register.  We have from time to time encountered people who would be entitled to vote arriving at polling stations and, to their great disappointment, being told they have no vote because they are not registered.  According to law, they should have a vote.  This is probably a violation of their constitutional rights. The old timescale probably contributed to this problem and I hope these anomalies will be rectified with the new legislation.</P>
    <P>Many student nurses in my own area in West Limerick are also disenfranchised. The local officer responsible for compiling the register will not include them because they live away from home.  The officer in the area where they are studying nursing may not register them either and may not know they are there.  The end result is that they have no vote either at work or at home.</P>
    <P>Section 11 states that a person can only be registered once.  A person should be entitled to be registered in two registers. A person can only vote once.  If they vote twice, there is a large penalty which I am sure they would not risk incurring.  I do not see any reason why student nurses and other young people cannot be included in the register of their native place and at the same time have their names included in the register of the area of the hospital where they are studying nursing.  The same should apply to other students.</P>
    <P>I know section 11 of the Bill does not provide for such registration.  Section 11 (1) (b) states that &ldquo;Where it appears that a person may, <i>prima facie</i>, be eligible for <Col N="1107" /> registration in respect of two or more premises, the question of which of such premises he shall be registered for shall ... be determined by the registration authority.&rdquo;  This is not fair.  I would prefer to see the question of registration left to the elector in such circumstances.  At the same time I cannot see why there should be any objection to a person being on more than one register.  He should be given the opportunity to vote wherever he wishes.  As Senator Seán Byrne stated, students should be allowed to vote at home.  That should apply to student nurses also.</P>
    <P>The Electoral (Amendment) (No.2) Act, 1986, introduced a system which enabled disabled voters to vote in their own home.  This was welcomed at the time.  Under the special voting arrangement a presiding officer, accompanied by a member of the Garda Síochána, conveyed a ballot paper to the elector at his/her home.  While the system is expensive and cumbersome to operate, it is an important facility for household electors who are unable to go to their nearest polling booth because of some disability or illness.  This system will be continued and enforced by section 17.  Existing laws require an applicant for entry in the special voters' list to produce a medical certificate each year certifying the nature and extent of his/her physical illness or physical disability and indicating that the applicant is of sound mind and understanding. When a medical certificate is produced once, that should be sufficient, because these people are often old and it is doubtful if they will ever regain the health that would allow them to go out to polling booths.</P>
    <P>It is no longer necessary for the medical certificate to declare that a person is of a sound mind.  I welcome the change.  The previous requirement gave offence to some disabled persons.  I had experience myself when going to a doctor of being questioned as to whether certain persons were of sound mind and I was offended at being asked that question, and at the question itself.</P>
    <P>The deposit for persons to contest Dáil <Col N="1108" /> elections has been set at £100 since 1923 and has remained unaltered since.  The proposal in this Bill to raise the deposit fee form £100 to £500 is justified.  It is very modest, taking into account the change in the value of money since 1923.  Senators Costello and Norris did not agree that it should be increased.  They thought the proposed increase was severe and would prevent Independent candidates standing on local and other issues from contesting elections because they would not be able to afford the £500 deposit.  I cannot see how this sum would deter anyone from contesting an election.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to section 147 of the Bill which prohibits all political activity in the vicinity of polling stations for the duration of the poll and also for a half an hour before and after the poll opens and closes.  The prohibition will apply to congregating, canvassing in any form, display of posters and use of loudspeakers. It will apply to all elections and the penalties will be quite severe.  This is a welcome proposal because some voters can be harrassed by such canvassers at polling stations.  I am glad to say, from my own experience, that such harrassment is now on a much lower scale than it was some years ago.  However, canvassing at that late stage will not influence voters on election day.  It might have done some years ago, but not now.  It is quite likely to antagonise people and to damage rather than improve a candidate's prospects of getting the vote.  It is important that a presence of political parties should be seen near polling booths to show that the representatives of the candidates have an interest in the election of their candidates. Otherwise it might appear that the party was not interested in the candidate or the election.  The exclusion of people from the area within 50 yards or more of the polling station is a bit too restrictive.  I would like to see a more reasonable distance agreed to.  The Minister, on Committee Stage, might introduce an amendment to this section for a more reasonable distance.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to section 167, which prohibits the taking of opinion polls for a week before polling day.  As <Col N="1109" /> far as I am concerned, opinion polls mean nothing.  Right up to the last election, if we were to judge prospects by opinion polls, Fianna Fáil would have been brought back with an overall majority.  A month after the election, in which Fianna Fáil failed to get the overall majority, the opinion polls again gave them an overall majority.  That proves opinion polls are misleading.  It might be different if the opinion poll were held on the same day as a general election.</P>
    <P>Voluntary organisations, in order to make some money, organise lotteries on the results of elections.  This is wrong. A colleague of mine mentioned in his contribution here that he was a candidate in an area where there was a lottery. Because he was getting so many votes in the lottery they thought he was safe and he lost the seat by a small margin.  It is something that can be very unfair to candidates.</P>
    <P>Section 37 says, &ldquo;A Dáil election shall be conducted in accordance with this Act and, according to the principle of proportional representation, each elector having one transferable vote.&rdquo;  Section 37 (2) (b) says this vote is &ldquo;capable of being transferred to the next choice when the vote is not required to give a prior choice the necessary quota of votes, or when, owing to the deficiency in the number of the votes given for a prior choice, that choice is excluded from the list of candidates.&rdquo; That is slightly at variance with section 121 (5) (b) which mentions sub-parcels. This is something I cannot understand. Sub-parcels are not a fair or accurate way of distributing surpluses.  That is a fault in the proportional representation system in multi-seat constituencies.  It is hard for TDs in multi-seat constituencies, because of the competition and because of their constituency work, to give adequate time to the necessary work of legislating for this country.  When I was elected to the Seanad the first time I remember I met a local Fine Gael TD, Willie O'Brien, who had an advice centre in my parish.  He had with him a large book and I asked to look at it.  He said &ldquo;I bet you have the same names in your own book&rdquo;.  I am sure that is the position <Col N="1110" /> in the multiseat constituencies.  The work is duplicated and interferes with the legislation process.  At some stage this should be amended.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and wish the Minister every success with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Wallace) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Wallace)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank the Members from all sides of the House for their kind words and good wishes to me on my appointment as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment.  I very much appreciate their remarks.</P>
      <P>I would like to express my appreciation of what has been a very useful and constructive debate.  Many issues have been touched on, either by way of suggestion or seeking clarification.  I hope to deal with the main issues as fully and helpfully as I can.  In a sense, it is a tribute to the Bill that much of the comment related to what is not in the Bill rather than what it contains.</P>
      <P>Several Senators referred to the question of votes for emigrants.  The position is that the Government are examining the feasibility of this matter; consideration has not been finalised but it may be anticipated that the Government's position will be made known shortly.</P>
      <P>Many Senators referred to what are seen as defects in the law relating to the election of the Seanad, including the University electorate, the financing of the University register and the case for automatic re-election of the Cathaoirleach. The present Bill is essentially a Dáil electoral measure and only touches incidentally on the other electoral codes.  It would not be practicable to deal in a substantive manner with all seven electoral codes in a single Bill.</P>
      <P>Several Senators regretted that the Bill does not contain provision in relation to the funding of political parties and the control of expenditure at elections. Those questions are inter-related and would need to be examined in a broad context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1111" /> Up to 30 years ago the amount which a candidate could spend at an election was subject to statutory limit.  This control was removed on the recommendation of an all-party Oireachtas Joint Committee which took the view that the control was neither necessary, relevant or effective.</P>
    <P>In considering the financing of political parties it would be necessary to address questions such as public funding, contributions from trade unions and similar bodies and from business and private individuals as well as disclosure of sources and monitoring of expenditure. The examination would have to take account of the parliamentary functions as well as the electoral role of parties.  The present Bill, which deals essentially with the technical procedures at Dáil elections, would not be an appropriate vehicle for dealing with such questions.</P>
    <P>Senators Murphy and Ryan expressed support for compulsory voting.  Other speakers thought it might be a good idea if an element of compulsion were to be introduced in relation to the registration of electors.  It is regrettable that there is such a low level of co-operation from the general public in the compilation of the register.  However, I do not think that the idea of compulsion is the answer or would be in keeping with our liberal democratic traditions.  We all have a role in getting across to people the supreme importance of the register which is the very basis of our democracy.  The new timetable and the new procedures will, I hope, provide an opportunity to step up efforts to improve the register.  The obligation to revise Dáil constituencies is placed by the Constitution on the Oireachtas.  A Constituency Commission can therefore have only an advisory role, whether it is appointed on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis or, as suggested by Senator Costello, on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>Senators Foley and Conroy spoke of the desirability of a more far-reaching review of our electoral system and Senator Brendan Ryan seemed to favour single seat constituencies with a single transferable vote.  Whatever about the <Col N="1112" /> desirability of change, any substantial changes in the system would require constitutional amendment.  This Bill could not therefore deal with these matters. The same would apply to Senator Mooney's suggestion that the Dáil should have a fixed term and the suggestion made by a number of speakers that the age for membership of the Dáil should be reduced to 18.</P>
    <P>Most of the contributors referred to the proposal on the regulation of opinion polls and a fairly wide cross-section of opinion was revealed.  Some Senators are apparently opposed in principle to any regulation of opinion polls.  Others, on both sides of the House, either are not entirely convinced of the necessity for regulation or have reservations about the effectiveness of the provision proposed in the Bill.  The Government have decided not to proceed with a restriction on the taking of opinion polls in the days preceding an election or a referendum. This decision follows full consideration of the views expressed by many interests and takes particular account of the views advanced by Senators in the course of the debate on the Electoral (No. 2) Bill, 1991.</P>
    <P>The proposal to regulate the taking of opinion polls on electoral matters was brought forward last year in response to concern about their possible effects on voting intentions.  In recent decades several democratic countries have moved to regulate polls.  Some have proceeded with control measures while others decided on balance not to adopt this course.  When the Electoral Bill was published last year it was made clear that the Government were not necessarily committed to the particular form of regulation proposed and were anxious to receive the views of all interested parties on the issue.  Having now considered all aspects of the matter the Government have decided that the proposal to regulate the taking of polls should not proceed. An appropriate amendment to the Electoral Bill will be moved on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In relation to the increase in the deposit, there is recognition of the need <Col N="1113" /> to discourage non-serious candidates.  As Senator Upton said, such candidates seek to make a mockery of the election process. I am not talking about single issue candidates or candidates with radical or far out views.  I am talking about people who become candidates for reasons that have nothing to do with the election, people who are pursuing their own private agenda and have no intention or desire to be elected.</P>
    <P>We have probably the most open system of nomination in the world.  Any citizen of Ireland, irrespective of place of birth or residence, irrespective of any connection with the country or the constituency, may nominate himself or be nominated by just one elector.  The choice of methods of discouraging non-serious candidates lies between restricting the right to nominate to registered parties &mdash; this might not be generally acceptable &mdash; requiring the signatures of a substantial number of electors &mdash; checking the validity of such signatures would be an impossible task for returning officers &mdash; or requiring a deposit fixed at reasonable level.</P>
    <P>Requiring a deposit is of long standing, is well known and understood and, of course, the deposit is refunded if the candidate attracts a certain minimum of support. That minimum is being reduced from one-third to a quarter of the quota. If a candidate, no matter how poor, is genuine and has serious policies, he or she will have little difficulty in putting a deposit of £500 together.  I believe £500 is a reasonable level for the deposit and I would not favour the suggestion, made by a number of Senators, that the deposit be raised to £1,000.</P>
    <P>Senators Neville, Dardis and Raftery suggested that the threshold for the refund of the deposit should be further reduced to, say, one-fifth or one-sixth of the quota.  Senator Costello would have it reduced to one-tenth.  The reduced threshold of one-quarter proposed in the Bill would represent about 2,000 votes in an average constituency.  This seems a reasonable level.</P>
    <P>In another connection, Senator Lanigan thought it unlikely that a candidate <Col N="1114" /> would attempt to contest more than one constituency.  In fact, at the 1987 General Election one candidate contested a total of 13 constituencies.  The deposit at local elections is not affected by this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is an offence to nominate a candidate without consent.  The returning officer is required to give notice in writing to each person nominated as a candidate.</P>
    <P>In reply to Senator Costello, I would like to say that the disqualification for election of certain prisoners is not new. It has been part of our law since 1923 and a similar provision is found in the electoral law of many countries.</P>
    <P>In regard to picturesque additions to candidates' names, this is dealt with in section 52.</P>
    <P>In relation to the register of political parties, a number of speakers, including Senators Dardis, Murphy and Neville, expressed the view that parties who espouse violence should not be registered. I think the point was well answered by Senator Brendan Ryan &mdash; the measure is unlikely to be effective.  I understand that a test of this kind applies in relation to candidates for council seats in the North.  It does not seem to have achieved the desired objective.</P>
    <P>In response to Senators Naughten and Doyle, I want to confirm that the register will still be published each year as it is at present.  It will, of course, continue to be the main document &mdash; the supplement will only be used to add names which should have been included from the start. It is generally accepted that there must be a cut-off point for applications for inclusion in the supplement.  Several Senators made the point that omissions from the register are most likely to come to light in the run-up to an election.  They suggested that applications should be accepted up to a week or ten days before polling day.  Further thought will be given to this matter but it is essential that we have regard to the danger of abuse and to the risk, referred to particularly by Senators Doyle and Hederman, of undermining the status of the register proper. In response to Senator Neville, the supplement will apply in relation to the register proper.  The postal and special <Col N="1115" /> voters list will continue to be compiled on the existing basis.</P>
    <P>In relation to the cost of preparing the register, Senators Lanigan and Doyle inquired why section 20 provides that the State &ldquo;may&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;shall&rdquo; meet three-quarters of the cost of preparing the register.  The intention is, of course, that the State will meet this increased proportion.  However, the general policy in relation to grants for local authorities favours block grants rather than special purpose grants.  The wording of section 20 will leave it open to include the registration payment in a block grant at some time in the future.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Foighil's point in relation to anonymous claims for correction in the draft register will be referred to the registration authority.</P>
    <P>The need for the provision in relation to single registration arises from the ruling of the Supreme Court in November 1990.  The court ruled that certain students were, under existing law, entitled to be registered for more than one constituency.  This situation, which could apply to other categories as well as students, is undesirable.</P>
    <P>Under the proposed provision nobody may be registered more than once. Where a person occupies more than one residence, he or she will have a choice as to which of these to be registered for. Thus a third level student may opt to be registered for the home constituency or the constituency in which he or she lives for the purpose of attending college.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said in introducing this Bill, the Supreme Court ruling was not a statement of any constitutional or other fundamental right, it simply clarified the meaning of the existing legal provision. In effect, the Bill will restore the provision to what it was assumed to be before the court ruling.</P>
    <P>Senators Doyle, Honan, Jackman and others suggested that students should be afforded free travel to and from their home area on polling day.  This suggestion would involve open-ended expenditure and would not seem to be practicable.  If the facility were to be <Col N="1116" /> given to students, in fairness, it would have to be extended to others in a similar situation, to anybody absent from their polling place, abroad or elsewhere, at election time as well as to electors living at a distance from their polling station.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan and others inquired if it would be an offence for an elector to be registered more than once.  The obligation to register is and will continue to be on the registration authority.  The question of an offence of plural registration, as such, does not arise.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers referred to the proposed new timetable for compiling the register and some saw difficulties with certain aspects of it.  The objective of the new timetable is two-fold &mdash; to reduce the overall time scale and to take the time for public scrutiny of the draft register out of the Christmas period.  Subject to these objectives, I am open to suggestion on the detail of the timetable.  Should the dates decided on give rise to practical difficulty, it would be possible, under section 20, to alter the timetable by order of the Minister with the approval of both Houses.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman suggested a &ldquo;qualifying period&rdquo; rather than a &ldquo;qualifying date&rdquo; for registration purpose.  I should like to explain that the requirement for registration is &ldquo;ordinary residence&rdquo;, and, for this purpose, temporary absence or temporary presence is disregarded.  The requirement is quite different, for example, from the census where <i>de facto</i> presence on the census date is what counts.</P>
    <P>The prohibition on political activity in the vicinity of polling stations was included in response to representations from many sources.  We have an obligation to deal with the matter and the prohibition will apply to candidates as well as everybody else.  However, under section 98 the candidate and his election agent will have the right of admission to any polling station.</P>
    <P>The distance of 50 metres will be measured, in effect, from the school gate. A number of speakers suggested that this distance is insufficient and should be extended to 100 or 200 metres.  I would <Col N="1117" /> be happy to be guided by the House in this regard.  The prohibition will apply to posters affixed to vehicles as well as fixed locations.</P>
    <P>In regard to access to polling stations, the Department recently requested returning officers to review all buildings used for polling purposes with particular regard to the requirements of the disabled and the infirm.  I assure Senator McDonald that all care is taken to ensure that rules are fully complied with and that security is adequate at polling stations.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers referred to the arrangements for free postage for candidates. The Bill continues the existing situation but enables the Minister to alter the arrangements following appropriate consultation, with the approval of both Houses.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;free postage&rdquo; facility is very expensive.  For this reason it should not be extended to local elections as suggested by Senators Mooney and Hederman.  The cost, like the other costs of conducting local elections, would have to be met by the local authorities.  The same consideration would apply to Senator Doyle's suggestion that the issue of polling cards should be obligatory at local elections.  Because of the high cost involved, the matter should continue to be left to the discretion of the local authority concerned.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators suggested that postal voting be made available for various categories &mdash; emigrants, students, merchant seamen, fishermen, prisoners, the disabled, people working away from home and so on.  An excellent case could be made for such a facility for all sorts of categories.  However, experience here and elsewhere has shown that postal voting is very open to abuse.  There is a solemn obligation on us as legislators to ensure that elections are not affected by abuse.  In 1986 the Oireachtas decided on home voting for the disabled rather than postal voting.  It is unlikely that there would be general support for extended postal voting now.</P>
    <P>Senator Conroy would like to see the polls staying open later and Senator Cosgrave favours earlier opening.  Under the <Col N="1118" /> Bill the polls must be open for a minimum of 12 hours within the period 8 a.m. to 10.30 p.m.  It would be possible, if considered desirable, to have them open for up to 14½ hours.</P>
    <P>Senators Foley and Lanigan inquired why illiterate votes may not be assisted by a companion, as in the case of blind and incapacitated electors.  This is a continuation of the existing provision.  The difference in treatment of the categories seems to relate to the prevention of abuse.</P>
    <P>A companion may assist not more than two electors.  This seems to be a prudent precaution and I understand that a similar restriction is not unusual in the law of other countries.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis questioned the provision under which the presiding officer may refuse assistance in the last two hours of polling.  What we are doing here is reducing the existing period from four to two hours.  Presiding officers are, and will continue to be, instructed to avail of this only where absolutely essential.</P>
    <P>The suggestion by Senator Upton that the instructions to the voter appearing on the ballot paper should be printed in larger characters will be taken up with the returning officers at the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>In response to Senator Hederman and Senator Ó Foighil, there is no obligation whatever on any candidate to use the expression &ldquo;Non-Party&rdquo;; a candidate is free to leave the relevant space on the nomination paper and ballot paper blank.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators suggested that the names on the ballot paper should be randomised.  This would cause serious difficulty for electors, particularly those with imperfect vision or with a low level of literacy.  Electors are long accustomed to the alphabetic order; to change it could cause confusion.  The House will recall that this question was the subject of legal action in 1986.  The High Court took the view that the alphabetical system of listing candidates provided for in the 1963 Act was a reasonable one.</P>
    <P>If a change in the format of the ballot paper were to be considered, there may <Col N="1119" /> be a case for grouping the candidates of each party together on the ballot paper as is done in Malta where the single transfer voting system is also used in multimember constituencies.</P>
    <P>Senators Ryan, Finneran, Cosgrave and McDonald favour Sunday voting. Under existing law, Dáil elections could not be held on Sunday.  This Bill will remove the blanket prohibition and it will be possible to consider the matter for future elections.  However, there must be regard to the fact that the minority Christian churches are opposed to Sunday voting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">

      <P>In connection with counting the votes, Senators Naughten and Mullooly expressed the views that surpluses should be transferred as they arise or that candidates should have the right to demand the transfer of a surplus. Under existing law the returning officer has discretion whether to transfer a surplus in certain circumstances.  Different practices by returning officers have given rise to some misunderstandings on this point.  The present Bill proposes to standardise the position &mdash; a surplus will not be transferred if its distribution could not advance the count in any material way. The non-transferred surplus will, of course, be looked at afresh at the end of each subsequent count and it will be transferred if at any time the transfer could make a difference.</P>
      <P>To require every surplus to be transferred, irrespective of size, could prolong the count unnecessarily and to no purpose. For example, you could have a situation on the first count where a candidate might be elected with just one vote over the quota.  To transfer that single surplus paper would require the re-examination and resorting of all that candidates's papers, numbering perhaps 8,000, 9,000 or 10,000 in all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Upton asked about the right of a candidate to be present at the <Col N="1120" /> counting of votes.  That matter is covered by section 6 (10) which permits a candidate to be present at any time during an election, either in addition to or in substitution for any of his agents.</P>
    <P>Senators Mooney and Upton inquired about the right of candidates and their agents to oversee the proceedings at the count, particularly in respect of doubtful ballot papers.  Section 113 repeats the substance of existing law.  Candidates and their agents have a statutory right to be present.  The returning officer is required to provide them with all reasonable facilities for overseeing the proceedings.  The ruling on doubtful papers normally takes place after the ballot papers have been sorted for the first count, but occasionally a paper may have been overlooked at this point and come up for ruling later.  I would expect the ruling to be closely monitored by the candidates and their agents and, in practice, returning officers are advised, as far as possible, to seek agreement with the candidates in regard to the type of markings which will be accepted.</P>
    <P>Several Senators referred to what might be called the &ldquo;4, 5, 6 vote&rdquo;, that is, where two ballot papers are taken together and some electors may vote 1, 2, 3 on one paper and continue their preferences 4, 5, 6 on the other.  I do not know that we can legislate on this.  The answer may lie in returning officers reaching a consensus on the approach to be adopted.</P>
    <P>Senators Mooney and Ryan queried the necessity for a provision dealing with disorderly conduct at election meetings, pointing to the demise of &ldquo;faction fighting&rdquo;. The provision in question reproduces existing law.  There are a number of provisions of this kind in the Bill dealing with matters such as the interruption of nominations or of the poll.  Fortunately, incidents of this kind do not happen. Nonetheless, it seems appropriate that there should be a recognised procedure for dealing with them, particularly since, at a general election, there would be no Dáil to deal with any eventuality of this kind.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney and others suggested <Col N="1121" /> that bill posting at elections should be banned.  A statutory ban would probably be regarded as excessive, particularly as there appears to be a growing realisation among candidates and parties of the limited value of this kind of publicity.  I believe we will experience a progressive reduction at future elections.  The Litter Act requires election posters to be removed within seven days after polling day and local authorities are the enforcing authority.  In response to Senator Doyle, I would like to clarify that it is the person on whose behalf a poster or advertisement is exhibited who is liable for prosecution for an offence under the Litter Act.  The purpose of the requirement that election literature must disclose the names of the printer and publisher is probably to give the option of proceeding against them, as well as the candidate or party, in the event of libel or defamation.</P>
    <P>I would like to clarify two matters referred to by Senator Upton.  First, in relation to election petitions, a petition may be presented by any person registered, or entitled to be registered, as an elector in the constituency and he may cite any grounds likely to have affected the election.  The Director of Public Prosecutions must question an election if it appears to him that the election was affected by electoral offences.  The second point relates to by-elections.  If <Col N="1122" /> two or more casual vacancies arise at the same time in a constitutency, it will be a matter for the Dáil to decide whether the vacancies should be filled separately or together, in other words, whether there should be one or more by-elections.  This is dealt with in section 39 (3).</P>
    <P>I hope I have dealt adequately with the main matters raised in the debate and, again, I thank Senators for their contributions. As already indicated, the Bill is essentially an up-dating and consolidation measure, as a number of speakers said, largely a &ldquo;tidying-up&rdquo; job. It is a solid and workmanlike restatement of the existing electoral law with many worth-while improvements and, by and large, it is a non-controversial measure. I believe it deserves support.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister for Health to provide extra funding to the Southern Health Board for the staffing of a dialysis unit in Tralee General Hospital.  I thank the Cathaoirleach and the Minister for taking this very deserving motion on the Adjournment tonight.  I propose to share my time with Senator Foley.</P>
      <P>The counties concerned, Kerry and Cork, are the most densely populated in the country.  I often come to Dublin via Cork and when I reach the Cork border on my way I am only half way there.  That gives some idea of the distance people in Kerry have to travel for treatment in the dialysis unit in Cork.</P>
      <P>The Kerry branch of the Irish Kidney Association was set up in Killarney in Autumn 1985.  Subcommittees were set up in Tralee, Dingle and Castleisland. Subsequent fund raising quickly raised £90,000 for the purpose of providing a dialysis unit in Tralee General Hospital. This money is lodged in banks in Killarney and Dingle and could be used to provide the capital cost of a dialysis unit, but it is the Irish Kidney Association's policy not to contribute towards the running costs of a dialysis unit.  At the February 1992 meeting of the Southern Health Board it was estimated that the total cost for such a service would be £20,000 per annum per patient.  We have eight patients which would represent a total cost of £160,000.  In 1991, the Southern Health Board contributed £25,407 towards the cost of transporting seven patients to and from Cork.  The eighth patient has lately rejected a transplant kidney and is back on dialysis again. The Southern Health Board estimate the cost of running a dialysis unit at £60,000 for staff &mdash; one ward sister and four staff nurses.  A registrar's half salary is £12,000, non-nursing salary is £10,000 and visiting consultants cost £15,000.  That is a total of £97,000.  Training costs are approximately £2,000 for staff.</P>
      <P>In 1992, we have eight chemo dialysis patients who travel three days a week to Cork from all parts of the county for dialysis.  In addiiton, five patients who are on home dialysis must also travel to Cork for regular examination.  Patient A leaves Castleisland at 11.30 a.m. three days per week and returns at 7 p.m.  He cannot work.  Patient B leaves Asdee at 5 a.m., travels to Tralee which is 27 miles away and from there to Cork, which is another 70 miles, three days a week and is home at 3 p.m.  This patient had a transplant in November 1991 which she quickly rejected and she is on dialysis now for a total of six years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Patient C has diabetes, which causes renal failure and blindness.  He had a transplant but rejected it in December 1991 and is back again on dialysis.  He travels from Tralee three days a week to Cork.  The other patients are from Kilflynn, Listowel, Dingle and two are from Killarney.  The Dingle patient is able to continue working due to rearranging his schedule to incorporate an early morning dialysis session in Cork Regional Hospital.  This necessitates leaving home at 5.45 a.m. three mornings <Col N="1125" /> a week.  That patient is a neighbour of mine in Dingle and he is trying to carry on his business as best he can.  He is a young man of about 40 years of age with a family and a large business.  About six months ago he was operated on successfully in Beaumont and both his kidneys were removed.  He is not sure what length of time he will have to wait for a kidney transplant.  To go to Cork three times a week so early in the morning and arrive back home late in the evening is a great hardship for an able bodied person let alone a person who has to go on the dialysis unit for four to five hours in Cork.</P>
    <P>The Kerry branch of the Irish Kidney Association will undertake to provide at Tralee General Hospital dialysis machines, a bicarbonate monitor, to change the wider filtration system and to replace existing equipment as necessary. The cost of a dialysis machine is £14,000 and the monitor £4,500.  The Irish Kidney Association, Kerry branch, have £90,000 in a bank account.  A ceiling of £90,000 was put on the collection by the Irish Kidney Association in Dublin until they received a guarantee from the Southern Health Board that such a unit would be put into the Tralee General Hospital. The people who responded so generously to the original appeal for funds in 1985 would again donate further funds for replacement equipment for a dialysis unit in Tralee.</P>
    <P>The consultant staffing of the unit can be organised as is done, for example, in Letterkenny or in Waterford and there is no need for the employment of a fulltime specialist.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to do everything in his power to alleviate the hardship of these people who must travel to Cork three days a week.  I hope his response to the motion will be a favourable one or an indication that something will happen shortly in Tralee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>If my colleague, Senator Dan Kiely, comes in I will give him some of my time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset I wish to thank my colleague, Senator Fitzgerald for sharing his time with me and giving me the opportunity <Col N="1126" /> to support this very important motion on behalf of the people of Kerry who are undergoing great strain and hardship by being obliged to travel to Cork Regional Hospital for dialysis treatment. These people have to travel three times per week, in many cases at great inconvenience to themselves.  The patients coming from the Dingle area have to leave home at 5.30 a.m.  Having arrived at the hospital, they spend approximately five hours on the machine before returning home.  That practice is repeated three times each week.</P>
    <P>The Kerry branch of the Irish Kidney Association was set up in the autumn of 1985 in Killarney.  Subcommittees were set up throughout the county and I am privileged to say that I was a member of the committee set up in Tralee.</P>
    <P>Much fund raising was organised and in a very short time £90,000 was raised for the purpose of providing a dialysis unit in Tralee General Hospital.  This money is still available and would be provided towards the capital cost of the dialysis unit.  This effort was fully supported by the Irish Kidney Association. It is the policy of that association not to contribute towards the cost of running a dialysis unit and they should not be expected to do so.  The people of Kerry have responded in a very positive way to the original appeal of the Kerry branch of the Irish Kidney Association.  For this reason it has been most disappointing since 1985, that the Southern Health Board have not come forward by installing this unit in the Tralee General Hospital.</P>
    <P>The only expense to the Department of Health and the Southern Health Board would be in relation to staff.  I appeal to the Department and the Minister to make the essential funding available.  This would be a tremendous boost to these patients who have suffered much hardship, and continue to do so over the years.</P>
    <P>There is a total of 13 people involved. It was anticipated that when the new Tralee General Hospital opened almost seven years ago the provision of dialysis treatment facilities at the hospital would <Col N="1127" /> be a major priority.  Hence the disappointment that nothing yet has happened.</P>
    <P>There is no condition so requiring of instant specialised treatment as the conditions of those who need treatment under renal dialysis technology.  The treatment must be carried out in most cases in a hospital and it has to be ongoing for a good number of hours.  The most difficult time for the patients is when they have to travel to Cork during the winter months, especially when there is frost and snow on the mountain roads.  This adds to the tremendous mental stress and strain on both patients and their families, especially if there is a danger they will not reach the treatment centre in time.</P>
    <P>The Southern Health Board estimates the cost of running a dialysis unit, as follows: Staff &mdash; one ward sister and four staff nurses &mdash; approximately £60,000; Registrar (half salary), £12,000; Non nursing salary, £10,000; Visiting Consultant, £15,000.  Making a total of £97,000 per year.  This works out at approximately £7,500 per patient, which is a very small outlay.</P>
    <P>If such a unit were installed in the Tralee General Hospital it would prove cost effective over a period of time.  If one were to compare the cost involved in these patients travelling to Cork at the moment, and should the facilities be available in Tralee, I believe there would be a saving to both the Southern Health Board and the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>The Minister recently met representatives of the Irish Kidney Association and I understand it was a very fruitful and informative meeting.  I also understand the services for Kerry patients were discussed at this meeting.  A proposal for the provision of kidney dialysis services at the Tralee General Hospital was submitted by the Southern Health Board to the Department of Health in 1986, but it was then indicated that due to financial constraints they were not in a position to proceed with the proposed plans.</P>
    <P>I now understand that the Southern Health Board have agreed to make the provision of a dialysis unit at Tralee <Col N="1128" /> General Hospital a priority and I congratulate them.  I appeal to the Minister, as I know he is a man of deep compassion for the weaker sections of the community, especially the sick, to make the essential finance available for the establishment of dialysis services at Tralee General Hospital.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and hope he will have good news for the dialysis patients.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I support my two colleagues, Senators Foley and Fitzgerald, in the case being made for a dialysis unit for the Tralee General Hospital.  This is an ongoing saga for the patients of County Kerry.  The biggest trauma these people experience is getting up at five or six o'clock in the morning, travelling 120 miles to Cork and back and having that treatment in between.  They do this three times a week.  It is a full time job for these people and they want to try to live some kind of life as well.  If the dialysis unit were set up in Tralee General Hospital, they feel they could contribute to some kind of family life.  That is the reason they are looking for this unit to be placed in Tralee.</P>
      <P>There is a strong case to be made for these people.  We have a lovely hospital, one of which we can be proud.  It cost about £28 million of taxpayer's money and the people of Kerry are very thankful for that.  The facilities there are fantastic. When the hospital was being erected we were promised that the dialysis unit would be in place for the kidney patients of County Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The organisations in Kerry raised something in the region of £50,000 for a dialysis unit.  In Limerick a doctor gave his professional services on a voluntary basis to patients in County Limerick.  We thought something similar might be made available to the people of Kerry.  Senator Foley stated it would cost £97,000 to the State to provide the staff for a dialysis unit.  That is a small amount of money when one considers the number of lives that could be saved.  If a person were to die in the morning, God forbid, while <Col N="1129" /> travelling from Kerry to Cork for treatment, £97,000 would seem a very small price to pay.  I appeal to the Minister and to the Southern Health Board to make the necessary resources available to ensure that this facility is installed in a hospital we are very proud of, a hospital we want to expand and have further treatment in.  I welcome the motion.</P>

      <P>This is my first visit to this House and I congratulate the Chair very warmly on the fact that he has been promoted to that most important position.  I say that against the background that the Chair and I come from the same beloved county of Westmeath. Above all else, we are very good a producing successful politicians.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Tom Fitzgerald for raising the matter and also compliment his colleagues, Senators Foley and Kiely, for their contributions. I am acutely aware of the needs of dialysis patients in Kerry and in other parts of the country also.</P>
      <P>I am especially conscious of the difficulties faced by patients who have to travel some distance for treatment and this has already been referred to by the contributors.  With regard to dialysis service generally, Senators will be interested to learn that the previous Minister met with the Irish Kidney Association in January. I understand at that meeting many aspects of the kidney service nationally were discussed, including services for Kerry patients, and that it was a most fruitful and informative meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senators will be aware, of course, that the provision of services at Tralee General Hospital is primarily a matter for the Southern Health Board, which must have regard to its competing service priorities and the resources at its disposal. A proposal for the provision of a kidney dialysis service at Tralee General Hospital was submitted, as already mentioned, by the board to my Department <Col N="1130" /> in 1986 but was not proceeded with then because of financial constraints.  No further proposals have been received in my Department in recent years.</P>
    <P>However, I understand that at a recent meeting of the health board a decision was made to include the provision of a dialysis unit at Tralee General Hospital in the board's priorities for development at the hospital.  I understand also that health board management are now exploring the possibility of establishing a dialysis service at the hospital.  The meeting took place early in February this year and I understood that the Southern Health Board have decided that the establishment of a kidney dialysis service at Tralee should be included in their priorities for development at the hospital and that discussions are taking place with the health board, management and the professionals in the hospital in regard to the possibility of establishing at least a limited dialysis service.  Discussions are also taking place with hospital consultants. I am told that if these discussions are successful management hope to be in a position to put proposals before the hospital committee of the board this month.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Kerry branch of the Irish Kidney Association have raised funds for the purpose of equipment for a dialysis unit at Tralee and the commitment of this group to dialysis patients and the generosity displayed by the people of Kerry are very impressive.  As I indicated earlier, any proposals for the establishment of a dialysis service at Tralee will have to be looked at by the Southern Health Board in the context of its overall service priorities, its priorities for Tralee and the resources available to meet these priorities.  I hope that the discussions underway within the setting of the hospital and in conjunction with the Southern Health Board officials will prove successful.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Senators again for the manner in which they put forward the case for a dialysis service at the Tralee General Hospital.</P>
