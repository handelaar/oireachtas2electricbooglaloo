      <P>I have notice from Senator Hussey that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to indicate the up to date position regarding the Williamstown sewerage scheme, County Galway.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Cosgrave of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to make a statement to allay public concern regarding the administration of justice and the present procedures being adopted.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator Hussey as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>
      <P>I regret I have had to rule the matter raised by Senator Cosgrave as not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment as it relates to a matter that is <i>sub judice.</i></P>

      <P>May I ask the Leader of the House as we are debating the Finance Bill today does the Leader feel it is reasonable that we have only been issued with copies of the Finance Bill as passed by Dáil Éireann particularly in view of the fact that there is a completely new Chapter, Chapter 4.  I ask the Chair and Leader of the House to ensure that this House is not treated in this way, particularly on an issue as important as the Finance Bill.  Perhaps it is an indication of the way the State manages public finances but I do not find it acceptable that we have to go looking for a copy of the Bill we are supposed to debate today.  We are starting Committee Stage today and with the amendments taken on board in the Dáil and with the new Chapter it was imperative we had the Bill for at least 24 hours so we could submit amendments.</P>

I ask this because it is an important matter that the Seanad should make a contribution on and in the light of the ill-considered remarks by a Member of this House at a Fianna Fáil party meeting which were widely canvassed in the newspapers this morning.

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Finance Bill provides a statutory basis for the taxation measures which I announced in the budget on 29 January. It also contains the legislative basis for provisions which were foreshadowed in the budget, notably in order to prepare for the EC Internal Market and for other tax policy measures which the Government now consider necessary.  Overall, the Bill marks a further significant step in the Government's strategy of tax reform as set out in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and our revised Programme for Government. Before turning to the main provisions of the Bill, I would like to outline briefly the strategy underlying the budget and review the economic prospects for the year ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The central objective in the budget was to maintain the soundly based public finances which are an absolute prerequisite for the creation of sustainable employment.  The prudent budgetary policy we have pursued over the past five years has been the correct approach.  The reduction of our dependence on borrowing, the control of public spending, the easing of the tax burden and its more equitable distribution, have restored confidence and strength to the economy and enabled us to participate in the narrow band of the European monetary system, to introduce a new climate of low inflation and to unwind the massive differentials which had emerged between the Irish and other European interest rates.  It is no coincidence that to date we have been able to weather the current difficulties in the international economy <Col N="1366" /> with much less damage than we suffered during similar circumstances in the past.</P>
    <P>The convergence criteria set out in the European Monetary Union Treaty put a firm obligation on member states to meet challenging budgetary guidelines.  We are now consistently satisfying these criteria but because of the large overhang of public debt still remaining, we must keep our annual deficits low &mdash; even lower than those in other EC member states.  I should stress, because there was some confusion about this matter in the Dáil, that our target here is to keep national debt moving satisfactorily downwards towards the level of 60 per cent of GDP specified in the draft Treaty.  We do not, as has incorrectly been claimed have to meet that 60 per cent ratio in order to be accepted as full partners in the new Europe; what we have to do is simply make consistent progress towards that objective.</P>
    <P>This Treaty obligation is entirely in accordance with our own domestic priorities. The fact is that irrespective of European Monetary Union, the overhang of debt must be reduced as rapidly as possible so that we can free more of our national resources for other needs.  It is a sobering fact that almost one-tenth of GNP must annually be allocated to meet debt servicing costs before the Government can address the many other spending priorities which are of more direct benefit to the Community.</P>
    <P>Gross domestic product expanded by about 2 per cent last year.  In view of the difficult international conditions, this was a very creditable performance.  Our growth rate was twice that of the world economy.  It was all the more impressive in view of the fact that output in our main trading partner, the UK, actually declined by 2.5 per cent.  Merchandise export growth was strong in the face of difficult international trading conditions. Exports of goods and services increased by about 5.75 per cent, helping to boost the balance of payments surplus to about 5 per cent of GNP.  There was a rise in manufacturing output of more than 3 per cent, with strong growth in the chemicals and electrical engineering sectors. <Col N="1367" /> Inflation, at 3.2 per cent, was well below the EC average.</P>
    <P>Most important of all, there was every indication that employment held up very well in a difficult year.  This view is supported by figures released only last week which show that manufacturing employment continued to rise in the final quarter of last year to reach its highest level for over seven years.  For the year as a whole, manufacturing employment rose by 1,500.  Average employment in banking, insurance and building societies was up by almost 1,000 in the first nine months of the year.  While we will not have final confirmation of the outcome for some time yet, the available evidence suggests that non-agricultural employment expanded last year.  It is becoming increasingly clear that the sharp rise in unemployment, by over 29,000 to 254,000, reflected labour force growth &mdash; influenced by changed migration patterns.</P>
    <P>The limited data on economic trends so far this year are reasonably encouraging. Manufacturing output showed a 9 per cent increase in January.  Exports performed well in January and February and the trade surplus in January was one of the best on record.  Retail sales, which had been weak for some time were up by 1.5 per cent in January with provisional February data pointing to an even stronger increase.</P>
    <P>Tax returns and employment levy receipts to date support the view that an improvement is under way.  There were, however, some significant timing factors involved in certain aspects of the tax out-turn for the first four months which explain part of the sizeable year-on-year increase in direct taxes.</P>
    <P>These pointers support the widely held view that 1992 is likely to be a better year than 1991, with somewhat faster economic growth, more evenly spread across the economy.  Last year, growth was concentrated in the export oriented sectors. This year we are likely to see some strengthening of private consumption and private investment, the main components of domestic demand.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1368" /> Looking ahead, prospects for the international economy remain as uncertain as ever.  Developments so far this year in the major economies suggest that the international economic recovery may be slower and more modest than earlier envisaged.  Predictions made at the turn of the year by the main international agencies now look a little optimistic. However, I think we can still look forward to some improvement in our export markets as the year goes on.  At home, we should see another appreciable increase in after tax incomes.  Assuming broadly unchanged savings behaviour, both consumer spending and investment should show a modest improvement with growth of around 2 per cent in real terms.</P>
    <P>Economic growth this year should both be a little better than last year, and be somewhat more employment intensive. However, with unemployment in the UK likely to go on rising for the foreseeable future, and with only modest growth on the Continent and in the US, job opportunities abroad will be scarce.  Given the projected rise in our labour force, average unemployment here is likely to rise significantly again this year.</P>
    <P>Much attention is rightly focused at present on the continuing rise in the number on the live register.  Without wishing for a moment to play down the scale or the seriousness of this problem, I would like to reflect on the background to it.  In the early eighties the Irish economy was characterised by a series of massive imbalances: public sector borrowing reached 20 per cent of GNP; inflation also topped 20 per cent; there was a chronic deficit in the balance of payments which peaked at 14 per cent of GNP; and public sector debt was exploding at a rate which was to bring it to 130 per cent of GNP.  To cap it all, employment was on a steady downward trend.</P>
    <P>Today, things are very different.  The consistent pursuit of courageous policies has stabilised the economy and restored our international standing.  The public finances were brought under control by a restrictive approach to public expenditure. A programme of positive tax reform was put in place.  A national social <Col N="1369" /> consensus was established with the agreement of a binding three year wage deal in 1987.  This agreement, with adoption of a hard currency option and rigidly improving public figures, brought inflation down.  A successor agreement was reached last year which extended the consensual approach into other areas of Government policy.  Key elements in the new deal were explicit undertakings in relation to industrial peace and the acceptance by the social partners that both the pay and the non-pay elements of the agreement were conditional on the attainment of specified targets for the public finances in 1993.  The perceived commitment of the Government to tax reform greatly facilitated the success of this approach.</P>
    <P>The results have been impressive: record rates of output and employment growth were attained; inflation is below the EC average and is in line with the EMS narrow band average at 3.5 to 4 per cent; the balance of payments is in substantial surplus; and the burden of debt is comng down, releasing more and more resources which otherwise would have had to be devoted to interest payments.</P>
    <P>The view now taken of the Irish economy by overseas commentators is that very significant progress has been achieved.  The Irish experience has been cited as an example of what can be done to stabilise an economy facing serious imbalances.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the Government's overall economic strategy is working.  The correct policies are in place and they are being effectively implemented.  They will provide the spring-board for more rapid growth as international conditions improve.</P>
    <P>The first chapter of the Bill deals with income tax and I would like to outline briefly for Senators what the Government's policy is on this tax and how it is reflected in this chapter.</P>
    <P>I suppose no tax has been the subject of so much expert advice from outside bodies in recent years as income tax.  The Commission on Taxation, the National Economic and Social Council and the <Col N="1370" /> Industrial Policy Review Group have all made recommendations on it, as indeed have international bodies like the EC, the OECD and the IMF.</P>
    <P>Their recommendations have been remarkably consistent.  Indeed, they have all said essentially the same thing: broaden the tax base and reduce tax rates.  In other words, general policy should be to ensure as far as possible that income, however derived or received, should be subject to income tax; at the same time, the rates to which it is subject should be as low as possible consistent with equity and the need to generate revenue to meet expenditure.</P>
    <P>In fact, there has already been a good deal of progress in implementing this policy.  Nineteen eighty seven was a year when, by common consent, no income tax reliefs at all were possible because of the state of the public finances.  Since then, however, income tax policy has made substantial progress on three fronts; the low paid, and especially those with family responsibilities, have been helped by means of substantial increases in the exemption limits and the introduction of a child addition to them; the standard and top rates of tax have been cut; and the standard band has been significantly extended.</P>
    <P>Income tax improvements since 1987 have been carried out or a basis consistent with the objectives set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, and, indeed, they played no small part both in assisting the negotiation of these programmes and in securing their continuing acceptance.  They have thus contributed significantly to the wage moderation which has been so important to our economic development in recent years in improving competitiveness and enhancing prospects for employment.</P>
    <P>Last October's review of the Programme for the Government indicated that there would be a continuation and an intensification of this process with a view to making further improvements to our income tax system.  The first few sections of the Bill show the fruits of <Col N="1371" /> this renewed commitment to reform: the general and age exemption limits have been increased by £100 for a single person and £200 for a married couple, and the marginal relief rate, which applies where income does not greatly exceed the relevant limit, has been reduced from 52 per cent to 48 per cent; the standard tax rate has been reduced from 29 per cent to 27 per cent; the top rate has been reduced from 52 per cent to 48 per cent; and the standard band has been extended by £775 for a single person and £1,550 for a married couple.</P>
    <P>What this means in brief is that since 1987, we have substantially increased the exemption limits, particularly for low paid taxpayers with families; we have cut the top tax rate by 10 per cent and the standard tax rate by 8 per cent; and we have extended the standard tax band by £2,775 for a single person and £5,550 for a married couple, or nearly 60 per cent. These are very substanital improvements, especially when one reflects that radical improvements in the public finances were effected over the same period.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill provides for the renewal of the £286 PRSI allowance for the 1992-93 tax year.  The remaining sections of Chapter I deal mainly with measures designed to broaden the income tax base.  Since these have generated a certain amount of discussion, I would like to devote a few moments to the rationale for broadening the tax base by introducing measures like these.</P>
    <P>The purpose of broadening the tax base is simply stated.  It is to ensure that, in line with the Government's general policy, income however received is, as far as possible, subject to income tax. Treating one sort of income differently from another is difficult to justify in terms of equity; it also tends to produce economic distortions because one sort of income becomes more valuable than another, and it favours the making of decisions for tax reasons rather than for commercial ones.  By contrast, broadening the tax base is aimed at ensuring <Col N="1372" /> as far as possible that everyone pays his share of tax according to the size of his income, at reducing economic distortions, and at having decisions made essentially for commercial reasons. Broadening the tax base also releases funds to help reduce tax rates and widen the standard band; or, looking at the question the other way around, a narrow tax base means that tax rates are higher than they need be and that those paying tax on all their income have to pay more than they would if all income were subject to tax.  This argument must be kept very much in mind in considering the remainder of Chapter I.</P>
    <P>The first element of base broadening in the Bill is in section 4 and will surprise no one.  The income tax relief on life assurance premiums has been steadily reduced since 1989, and last year stood at one-eighth of the eligible premium. Section 4 abolishes this last portion of relief with effect from 6 April 1992.</P>
    <P>I announced in my budget speech that the rate of tax charged on refunds of pension contributions was being increased from 10 per cent to 25 per cent with effect from budget day.  The increase was intended to recoup, in some measure, the tax relief already given when the contributions were made. Section 6 of the Bill confirms the increase but provides, however, that it will not apply where an application for a refund was made before budget day.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains two provisions relating to company cars.  Section 8 increases the cash equivalent used for taxing the benefit-in-kind enjoyed by a person who has available for private use a car supplied by his or her employer.  The additional yield from the increase in the benefit-in-kind on company cars is partially offset by the cost to the Exchequer of the increases from £7,000 to £10,000, provided for in section 21, in the threshold for capital allowances and for allowable running expenses in respect of cars used for business purposes.</P>
    <P>The old benefit-in-kind rates, that is, 20 per cent of the original market value where all the costs were met by the employer but falling to 12.5 per cent <Col N="1373" /> where the car only is provided, were very lenient when compared with the cost of private ownership.  When this sliding scale was introduced in 1982, it was intended that these rates would be doubled to 40 per cent and 25 per cent for 1983-84 and subsequent years but this increase never took place.  The increase in the benefit-in-kind rate to 30 per cent announced in the budget, is seen as being fair and reasonable having regard to the annual cost for an individual of providing a car at his or her own expense and the benefit derived from private use of an employer-provided car.</P>
    <P>Equally the Government consider that the curtailment of tapering relief announced in the budget is justified. Tapering relief is available to employees with high business mileage and reduces the benefit-in-kind charge by varying amounts linked to the business miles driven.  This tapering relief will in future only come into reckoning when business mileage exceeds 15,000 miles; at present the figure is 10,000 miles.  Furthermore, I announced in the budget that tapering relief will not permit the benefit-in-kind charge to be reduced below a minimum 25 per cent of the basic amount irrespective of the level of business mileage.</P>
    <P>While satisfied that the benefit-in-kind increases announced in the budget are fully justified compared with the cost of private motoring, I made certain changes which will reduce the impact of the increases on employees, such as company representatives and commercial travellers, who drive very high business mileage. The Bill provides for the phasing-in over five years of the minimum 25 per cent charge allowable under tapering relief.  This concession will mean that the minimum charge will be 5 per cent in 1992-93, 10 per cent in 1993-94, increasing by equal amounts to 25 per cent in 1996-97.  The new tapering relief tables are set out in the First Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 12 abolishes the concessionary tax treatment of share options granted under approved share option schemes. These schemes, introduced in 1986, meant essentially that the recipient of <Col N="1374" /> share options was liable only to capital gains tax, a charge which arose only on his eventual sale of the shares.  Abolition of this concessionary regime means that an income tax charge will now apply on the difference between the option price and the market price of the shares when the option holder acquires them: the charge will arise at date of acquisition. this is in line with the recommendation of the Commission on Taxation.  On his eventual sale of the shares, the option holder will be liable to capital gains tax on the difference between the market price at date of acquisition and the sale price.  The capital gains tax charge will, of course, be subject to the indexation and small gains exemption provisions in the tax.</P>
    <P>Section 13 confirms the budget day measure abolishing the tax relief on dividends from 10 per cent companies as part of the tax reform programme contained in the budget.  In the case of close companies, where the shareholders were also the directors, this relief gave scope for partially taxed dividends to be substituted for fully taxable remuneration, which loophole was never intended.</P>
    <P>Section 14 deals with the income tax relief available on interest on loans to acquire shares in a quoted company.  The section eliminates the relief in respect of such loans applied on or after budget day or, if later, the date on which the company becomes quoted, and phases out the relief in respect of loans applied before such date.  The date on which the phasing out begins is determined by the age of the loan: 6 April 1992, where the loan was applied on or before 5 April 1989; 6 April 1993, where the loan was applied in the 1989-90 tax year; and 6 April 1994, where the loan was applied on or after 6 April 1990.  If later than the relevant one of these dates, the phasing out will begin on 6 April of the second next tax year after the company becomes quoted.  Section 14 also introduces a general anti-avoidance provision into the relief on interest to purchase shares, to ensure that it is confined to interest on loans for bona fide commercial purposes and not for tax avoidance ones.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1375" /> Section 15 is an enabling provision to provide for the treatment as income for tax purpose of disability benefit, including occupational injuries benefit and unemployment benefit, and pay-related benefit.  The section provides that they will be treated as emoluments for the purpose of PAYE.  A commencement order or orders will be needed to bring the section into effect and such an order will require a positive resolution of Dáil Éireann before being brought into effect.</P>
    <P>Treating disability benefit as income for tax purposes presents substantial practical problems because of the potential interaction between employers, the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social Welfare and large numbers of benefit claimants.  My aim will be to keep this interaction to a minimum. Briefly, the solution being considered at present by the Departments concerned would involve potential claimants' tax free allowances being notified by Revenue to the Department of Social Welfare and that Department using the weekly rate of allowance when making disability payments.  Any excess of the payment over the tax-free allowance would be subjected by that Department to tax in the normal way at the taxpayer's marginal tax rate.  Where the tax-free allowance exceeded the benefit payment, the intention would be that the excess would be available to the employer for use against any occupational sick pay payments to the employee.  The net effect would be that disability benefit would be taken into account in determining income for tax purposes.</P>
    <P>Taxation under this system, and indeed taxation of longer term disability benefit and disability benefit paid to claimants without an employer, cannot be introduced until 1993.  However, it may be possible later this year to introduce some limited form of taxation of disability benefit for those in employment, by having employers reduce the tax-free allowance of benefit claimants in employment by the amount of the disability benefit being paid to them by the <Col N="1376" /> Department of Social Welfare.  The net effect would be to curtail availability of tax refunds to employees who are claiming disability benefit, thus meeting a core objective of introducing taxation of disability benefit.  However, much work remains to be done both in this area and in regard to the longer term arrangements for taxation, and I am not yet in a position to announce an implementation date.</P>
    <P>The operational requirements for taxing unemployment benefit also continue to be examined.  It is still the Government's intention that taxation should begin in 1993.</P>
    <P>I would emphasise that there will be no change in the present tax status of any of these benefits until the commencement date for taxation; I hope to be able to announce a date for this in the reasonably near future as far as disability benefit is concerned.  I would also emphasise that what will be done will be to treat these benefits as income for tax purposes; the extent, if any, to which taxation will arise in a given case will essentially depend on the amount of other income the recipient has in the same tax year.</P>
    <P>Chapter II of the Bill deals with income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax. The first section, section 16, provides for foreign adoptions to be recognised for the purposes of these taxes on the same basis as they are recognised for the purposes of the general law under the Adoption Act, 1991.  There are similar provisions later as regards stamp duty, capital acquisitions tax and residential property tax.</P>
    <P>Section 17 reduces, for 1992-93 and subsequent years, the limit on the annual value of shares an employee may receive under approved profit sharing schemes. The limit is being reduced from £5,000 to £2,000.  In addition, to cater for the situation where an employee received less than £2,000 worth of shares in the 1991-92 tax year, he will be able to receive an additional allocation in 1992-93 so as to make up the deficit.  The additional allocation will be deemed to have been made on 5 April 1992, that is, in the 1991-92 tax year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1377" /> Senators will be aware that the original budget provision was to eliminate the profit sharing relief entirely.  In continuing the relief, but with the £2,000 ceiling, I have been conscious of the views expressed by both sides of industry &mdash; that is, the Confederation of Irish Industry and the Federation of Irish Employers on the one hand and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on the other &mdash; and by the Irish Profit-Sharing Association, as well as by others, that the scheme can play a valuable role in improving industrial relations and employee motivation.  The £2,000 ceiling will cover the share allocations made to the vast bulk of scheme participants and will continue to provide a generous incentive for companies to introduce and maintain such schemes.</P>
    <P>Section 19 deals with the tax exemption which applies to patent royalities and to dividends paid by companies out of exempt income derived from such royalties.  The section as originally introduced preserved the exemption for companies, in order to help foster research and development, but phased out the exemption for individuals.  On Committee Stage in the other House the argument was put to me that the exemption had a significant place in our industrial policy in that it encouraged inventors and invention and so helped to expand our industrial base without much cost to the Exchequer.  The point was also made that the exemption should be continued for the original investor who often invests much time, money and brains in producing an invention and should be both rewarded for his efforts when he succeeds and encouraged to try again where he failed.</P>
    <P>The present section responds to these arguments.  It retains the exemption for companies, for inventors, as respects royalties and dividends relating to their own inventions and for dividends paid to holders of ordinary shares but it phases out the exemption otherwise.  One-third of patent royalities or dividends paid by companies out of exempt income derived from such royalties will be taxable in the period from 24 April 1992 to 5 April <Col N="1378" /> 1993, and two-thirds in the 1993-94 tax year, with the full amount being taxable in 1994-94 and subsequent tax years.</P>
    <P>The section is aimed at meeting the industrial policy argument for the patent income exemption as far as companies, inventors and ordinary shareholders are concerned and I trust it will be operated in that spirit and not exploited for abuse purposes.  If it is I will, of course, be forced to look at the exemption provisions again.  However, I trust that this will not be necessary and that instead research and development, both by companies and individuals will flourish, will enhance our economic development and will produce much needed employment.</P>
    <P>In order to avoid clawback of stock relief, farmers are allowed a two-year period to rebuild herds which have been depopulated due to disease eradication measures.  Section 20 extends this period by a further year.</P>
    <P>Sections 22 and 230 of the Bill provide for the new arrangements for the taxation of interest income following the removal of the remaining exchange controls.  The remaining controls mainly involve the prohibition on Irish residents, both companies and individuals, opening and maintaining bank accounts abroad. There is little doubt that unless I took action in this Bill serious problems would have arisen following the abolition of the remaining controls.  There are clear indications that the Irish financial institutions were planning to offer their customers investment opportunities abroad which would have avoided both DIRT and any other taxation.  The resulting capital outflows would have put upward pressure on interest rates and consequently would have had deterimental effects on the whole economy.</P>
    <P>Therefore, a radical approach to the taxation of interest income was necessary. The Bill provides for a combination of special low tax accounts and new reporting arrangements.  These aim to prevent foreign accounts from being used for tax evasion purposes while at the same time they seek to maintain the maximum possible tax revenue from interest income.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1379" /> A number of people have criticised the changes proposed on the grounds that they will have a detrimental effect on the equities market and on the life assurance industry.  I would like to remind them that, as I have already explained, the alternative was not to leave things as they are.  The correct comparison is not between 10 per cent on special savings accounts and the existing 27 per cent tax but rather between 10 per cent and no taxation in a foreign account.</P>
    <P>On the position of equities, I understand that the major players on the equities market are the financial institutions. This can be seen from the fact that the average transaction size in 1991 was £20,150.  Pension funds are the most important financial institutions involved and they will benefit from the changes. A meeting has been arranged between my officials and the life assurance comapnies to discuss the effects of the changes on them.</P>
    <P>Section 23 ring fences the losses arising from limited partnerships to the trade of the partnership.  A similar restriction is being introduced under section 25 for the capital allowances on holiday cottages. The captial allowances were being increasingly used as a tax shelter, which was in some respects better than the relief for rental residential accommodation in that the investor could put the construction costs of the cottage against all his income not just his rental income.  At the end of the ten year qualifying period, the investor would own a holiday home in respect of which the Exchequer would have contributed a large part of the cost. In response to representations, I introduced amendments to these sections in the Dáil which give transitional relief for holiday cottage projects in the course of development where certain conditions are fulfilled.</P>
    <P>Section 26 introduces the new wear and tear capital allowances regime for plant and machinery which I announced in the budget.  This consists of a seven year write-off period on a straight line basis for all new or secondhand plant and machinery acquired on or after 1 April. <Col N="1380" /> The new system both simplifies and is a major improvement on the old wear and tear regime which had three different depreciation rates and where the tax write-off period was much longer because it applied on a reducing balance basis.</P>
    <P>Section 22 contains a technical measure relating to the double rent deduction available to lessees in the urban renewal designated areas.  It closes a loophole whereby the deduction could be claimed in respect of an existing industrial building in such areas without any qualifying expenditure being incurred by the lessor on refurbishment.  This was never the intention of the existing legislation and the section makes the requirement explicit.</P>
    <P>Section 29 introduces a restriction of the accelerated capital allowances which can be claimed upfront in the final year of the time extension for the Custom House docks area.  This is intended to encourage as much development as possible in the preceding period of designation. In the other designated areas, the practical effect of the one-year extension is that &ldquo;new build&rdquo; developments must have their foundations fully laid before 1 June 1993 in order to qualify for the urban renewal tax incentives.  This restriction will serve to bring forward projects in the pipeline, which now have a full year's notice of the measure.</P>
    <P>Sections 29 and 30 provide for the final time extensions to the duration of the urban renewal designated areas, which I introduced on Committee Stage in the Dáil.  For the Custom House docks area, a four-year extension will apply, terminating on 25 January 1997 and for the other designated areas a one-year extension is being given to terminate at end May 1994.</P>
    <P>Section 31 extends up until end May, 1994, in parallel with the urban renewal reliefs, the relief known as &ldquo;section 4&rdquo; which gives income tax relief to owner-occupiers for the renovation of historic or architecturally significant houses in the designated areas.</P>
    <P>In section 34, time limits are established for the relief, popularly known as &ldquo;section 23&rdquo;, which is given on the <Col N="1381" /> construction of residential property, and for related conversion and refurbishment. &ldquo;Section 23&rdquo; will be available on the same basis as the urban renewal reliefs which I have just outlined for sections 29 and 30.  Finally, section 34 provides for the four-month extension I announced in the budget for &ldquo;section 23&rdquo; construction projects which had their foundations fully laid before budget day.</P>
    <P>Section 35 abolishes the tax exemption for dividends which are distributed out of profits which were exempted from corporation tax as a result of export sales relief or the Shannon relief.  Partial relief on these dividends will apply until 6 April 1994, when the full tax charge comes into effect.</P>
    <P>Section 38 is concerned with the Irish income tax liability on dividends distributed by Irish resident companies to their foreign shareholders.  A <i>de facto</i> tax exemption has existed for many years in regard to such payments and the section now brings the legal position into line with this.  This will remove uncertainty for foreign investors and thereby facilitate foreign investment.</P>
    <P>Section 40 restricts domestic-sourced section 84 loans in accordance with the measures announced by me on 20 December last.  This restriction is in line with the subsequent recommendation made by the Culliton report in this connection. As provided in the last two Finance Acts, section 84 loans will still be available to those projects specified on two lists of approved manufacturing projects.</P>
    <P>Section 42 gets rid of a tax anomaly which had existed for many years in the case of banks and general insurance companies which trade in the State on a branch basis.  Prior to the budget these branches were able to obtain tax free profits from their holdings of Government securities on the grounds that they were non-resident.  The section also restricts the entitlement of these branches to loss relief arising from this exemption and an amendment was introduced in the Dáil which extends the scope of the section to cover securities of State-sponsored bodies and local authorities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1382" /> Section 44 deals with the corporation tax arrangements for life assurance companies. The section remedies two defects in the existing arrangements which had resulted in the companies avoiding or postponing tax.  First, the expenses incurred by a life company in acquiring new business will in future have to be spread over a seven year period instead of being fully offset in year one.  This change is being phased in from 1 April last and will take full effect on and from 1 January 1994.  Second, there is to be a new annual charge on the unrealised capital gains accruing to a life company on their holdings in unit trusts or other tax exempt investment vehicles.  This charge will commence on and from 1 January 1993 with indexation relief applying to both the gains and losses involved which will be spread over seven years.</P>
    <P>Sections 45 and 200 bring in the new arrangements for the bank levy which I announced in the budget.  Section 200 continues the bank levy at its 1991 level of £36 million for the three years 1992 to 1994.  Section 45 provides that where a bank increases its annual corporation tax liability by a sufficiently large amount so that it exceeds a specified threshold, the bank will be entitled to offset some or all of its annual bank levy against its excess corporation tax over that threshold.  This threshold will be the higher of the bank's advance corporation tax payment for that year or a level of corporation tax arrived at by indexing the bank's corporation tax as prescribed in the section.  These new arrangements have been devised as a result of the discussions of a working group on which the banks were represented and the arrangements will be reviewed in three years time.</P>
    <P>Section 46 provides that, where a company incurs losses from an activity chargeable at the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax, such losses can no longer be offset against the profits of that company chargeable at 40 per cent.  I introduced a transitional relief in the Dáil on Report Stage to cater for certain manufacturing projects affected by this section.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1383" /> The measures concerned with the taxation of co-ops are contained in sections 47 and 48.  The position of Bord Bainne is catered for in paragraph (c) of section 47 by ensuring that the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax will apply to its sales of processed products purchased from its members, both co-ops and non-co-ops alike.  That paragraph also provides that a co-op which supplies milk to a processor engaged wholly or mainly in the manufacture of specified milk products will also be given the 10 per cent rate.  The termination of the co-op tax exemption is contained in section 48, which provides for a phasing-in of the tax charge.  This phasing relates to co-op activities taxable at the 40 per cent standard rate; where a manufacturing process is involved, the 10 per cent rate applies.  The exemption will still apply to two-thirds of relevant profits in 1992, and to one-third in 1993.  Losses incurred by a co-op up until 1 April 1992, while the exemption was in existence, can be used as a set off against profits arising after that date.</P>
    <P>The Enterprise Trust Limited is a body established by the main employer bodies, in the context of chapter VII of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, to foster a community based response in combating long term unemployment. Section 56 provides tax relief on corporate donations to the trust.</P>
    <P>The relief for investment in films, known as &ldquo;section 35&rdquo;, is renewed for a further period, up until end-March 1995 in section 58.</P>
    <P>Section 55 deals with the late submission of tax returns by companies. Though companies have until nine months after the end of the tax year to send in their tax returns, the compliance rate is most unsatisfactory being only about 60 per cent according to the most recent estimate by the Revenue Commissioners. In order to improve this situation, the section provides that where a company fails to send in its tax return on time, it will not be entitled to use particular tax reliefs in the way intended for the tax year in question.  These reliefs are not, however, lost but are carried <Col N="1384" /> forward for use in the next tax year. Though this is not an extreme penalty, the section has been criticised in an over-the-top fashion.  However, because there might be some continuing adverse effect in the case of a very small minority of cases, I amended the section on the Report Stage in the Dáil so as to reduce by 50 per cent instead of 100 per cent the use by the company of the tax reliefs involved for the tax year in question.</P>
    <P>Sections 59 and 60 provide for the reforms of capital taxation which were introduced in the budget.  Section 59 reduces the annual small gains exemption to £1,000 for a single person and £2,000 for a married couple.  These exemptions were formerly £2,000 and £4,000, respectively.  Section 60 confirms the single 40 per cent of capital gains tax. Sections 61 and 62 close loopholes in the capital gains tax code.  Section 61 confines the capital gains tax relief which is currently allowed when a trader transfers assets into a company to cases where the transfer is carried out for bona fide commercial reasons.</P>
    <P>Section 62, which was introduced on Committee Stage in the Dáil, counters an avoidance practice which centres on section 9 of the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975.  Section 9 concerns situations where an asset can be regarded as having been acquired at market value, even though it was actually acquired at less than market value.  The Bill confines the application of section 9 to cases where the acquisition in question involves a corresponding disposal. In general, this will confine the operation of section 9 to gifts, which is what was originally intended.</P>
    <P>Section 63 was also introduced on Committee Stage.  It provides for a number of changes in the tax treatment of options.  First, it provides that quoted options should have the same favourable tax treatment which currently applies to options on business assets.  This is to ensure that taxation does not act as a barrier to the development of a quoted options market in Ireland.  Second, the section moves to close a loophole.  It provides that the abandonment of an option will now be regarded as a disposal for <Col N="1385" /> capital gains tax purposes.  However, except in the case of quoted options and options on business assets, abandonment of an option will not be allowed to give rise to an allowable loss.</P>
    <P>Sections 224 and 225 extend the tax base for discretionary trust tax.  At present, a charge arises when the youngest principal beneficiary is 25 years of age.  These sections reduce that age to 21.</P>
    <P>Sections 64 to 74 in Chapter V deal with the implementation of an EC Directive on mergers, divisions, transfers of assets and share exchanges between companies in different member states.  This is a rather technical matter involving both company law and tax law.  The main change being implemented by Part V is the deferral of capital gains tax where a company in one EC member state transfers some or all of its trading assets to a company resident in another member state.</P>
    <P>Chapter VI of the Bill sets out a definitive tax regime for oil and gas activities in Ireland's offshore areas, other than the Marathon acreage, and is specifically intended to secure Ireland's position in competing for oil and gas exploration.  It includes provisions from the 1985 Petroleum Taxation Bill, which was never enacted, and which have been updated to reflect policy decisions taken since then. The significant feature is the availability of a special incentive rate of corporation tax of 25 per cent to apply to income arising under petroleum production leases granted by the Minister for Energy before certain specified dates.  In essence, these dates are related to the particular problems likely to be encountered in discovering and developing commercial finds in the various offshore areas.  The exploration licences granted for those areas will also reflect their nature, with longer licences being granted for exploration of more difficult waters.</P>
    <P>From now, I shall indicate some of the more significant sections in the chapter. The 25 per cent incentive rate of corporation tax is contained in section 77. Section 78 and 79 apply ring-fence provisions for relief for losses and capital allowances and for group relief purposes <Col N="1386" /> with the exception of allowing losses incurred in an onshore mining trade to be set off against petroleum profits.</P>
    <P>Section 83 to 85 deal with the treatment of the various allowances for expenditure incurred on production and development and on exploration, both abortive and successful.  Section 86 gives an allowance for abandonment, which is important in protecting our marine environment. Section 87 provides for the valuation at market value of petroleum which, for example, is being sold by a production company to an associated refining company. There will be an opportunity on Committee Stage to deal with the sections in this Chapter in more detail.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill deals with Customs and Excise.  Apart from confirming the various budget rate changes, provision is made for implementing the other initiatives which were announced, with a few modifications.  The Bill also provides for the transposition into national law of the EC Council directive adopted last February for control and movement of excisable goods in the Internal Market.</P>
    <P>Section 89 to 102 provide a framework for the levying of excise duty on beer on the finished product instead of at the &ldquo;worts&rdquo; (pre-fermentation) stage as at present.  The new system will come into operation on a date to be specified.  The draft EC directive on a new Internal Market structures for the taxation of beer and alcoholic drinks generally envisages of course a 1 January, 1993 start.  The actual rate of duty to be applied will be determined in the light of budgetary circumstances and Single Market constraints then prevailing.</P>
    <P>Sections 103 to 119 set out the revised legal arrangements that must apply to the control and movement of excisable goods between member states from 1 January next.  They will replace the existing border controls in the intra-EC movement of tobacco products, mineral oils and alcoholic beverages.  In the case of commercial transactions, excise duty will continue to be payable to the member state in which the goods are consumed and at the rates charged by that state. Personal purchases of alcohol and tobacco <Col N="1387" /> products in other member states will not be liable to any further tax when brought into the state in which the goods are to be consumed.  The Revenue Commissioners have had discussions with trade interests on the new arrangements and these contacts will continue in the run-up to the implementation date.</P>
    <P>Section 120 to 129 detail the arrangements for charging an annual excise duty of £100 on amusement machines.  The duty will apply for instance, to, video-based games, skills machines and certain kinds of poker machines which do not return cash winnings or redeemable credits.  It will not apply to the likes of kiddie rides, juke boxes or to pool tables. In response to the representations made about the need to take account of the seasonal nature of this business in certain locations, I have provided for a concessionary high season rate of £30 which will apply for the three-month period up to 15 September in each year.</P>
    <P>Sections 130 to 144 introduce the arrangements for a new system of registration of motor vehicles by the Revenue Commissioners and the imposition of a charge on registration as a replacement for the existing excise duty which is being abolished as a result of EC Single Market requirements.</P>
    <P>Briefly, the registration tax will be the responsibility of the Revenue Commissioners so as to protect the large Exchequer revenue involved &mdash; VAT as well as excise.  That office will have total responsibility for the registration of vehicles, as well as for the assessment, collection and control of the new tax.  It will be collected, in the main, through dealers under Revenue control, and will be administered and controlled through the network of Revenue offices around the country.  This will ensure a local service to dealers and members of the public, as well as helping to absorb a sizeable number of surplus Customs and Excise staff in the various locations.</P>
    <P>The role of the Garda in relation to the enforcement of road tax will be supplemented by an enhanced resource of Revenue officials as part of Revenue's <Col N="1388" /> enforcement of the new registration tax. Of course, road tax itself, both initial and renewals, will continue to be administered by the local authorities.</P>
    <P>While the actual rates of vehicle registration tax to apply will be set out in the autumn Finance Bill, I can say that my objective is to broadly maintain existing revenues from this source.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections in this part of the Bill confirm changes announced in the budget with a few modifications: the abolition of the duties on televisions and video players from budget night and on table waters from 1 November 1992; the reduction in the duties on petrol, effective from 1 May 1992, and on non-automotive liquid petroleum gas, from 1 July next; the increases in annual road tax, cigarettes and other tobacco products and cider and perry; the restructuring of the duty on motor vehicles involving the reduction of duty on most cars, the elimination of the duty on a wide range of commercial vehicles and the increase in the duty on vans derived from cars and jeeps.  However, following representations received concerning certain small commercial vans which had been included in the car and jeep-derived van category, I have modified my proposal to remove these vehicles from that category with effect from the enactment of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The present licence fee arrangement for public houses, whereby each premises irrespective of size or location, pays the same annual charge of £100, is, in itself, inequitable and any increase in the flat rate would accentuate that aspect.  That is why, in my Budget Statement, I announced that I intended to replace the current charge for publicans and hotel liquor licences with one based on the rateable valuation of the individual premises concerned.  However, following representations and contacts with the trade I have modified my proposal.  I now propose to relate the duty chargeable for spirits retailers on licences for pubs and hotels to their turnover.  Section 155 provides for the basic provisions for the duty.</P>
    <P>The licence charge which will apply equally to public houses and to the bar <Col N="1389" /> turnover of hotels is set at £200 where turnover is less than £150,000 annually; on the best information available to me, up to three-quarters of premises could be liable at this minimum rate.  A sliding scale of increased charges will then apply subject to a maximum of £3,000 for those premises with turnover of more than £1 million a year.  Provision is made for the exclusion of non-pub turnover from the basis of the charge.</P>
    <P>In drawing up the detailed provisions for the new system, I sought to ensure that, as far as possible, all holders of liquor licences would be treated fairly and equitably, having regard to the different nature, conditions and scope of the various types of licences involved. Hence, the rates of duty on other categories of liquor licences are also being increased.</P>
    <P>Provision is also being made for the duties on other excise licences, for example, on bookmakers, gaming, exemption orders etc. to be increased.</P>
    <P>Section 156 amends the Finance (1909-10) Act, 1910, to require applicants for liquor licences to produce a tax clearance certificate.  Section 242 defines what tax clearance means and to whom it shall apply.  Under the Bill individuals, companies or partnerships seeking or renewing a licence will have to meet all their obligations in respect of income tax, VAT, corporation tax, PAYE/PRSI and capital gains tax as a condition of getting their licences.  The Bill also provides for an appeal against refusal of a tax clearance certificate.  In the event of an appeal against the refusal of a tax clearance certificate, the Bill provides that if a licence is already in existence that licence will continue in force and in the case of a new application a temporary licence will issue pending the final determination of the appeal.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill provides for VAT changes.  These comprise confirmation of the rate changes announced on budget day; the transposition into national law of the new EC rules on the levying, collection and control of VAT after 1 January 1993; the upgrading of Revenue's control and enforcement powers for <Col N="1390" /> VAT purposes; and a number of base-broadening and general tidying-up measures.</P>
    <P>The vast bulk of the VAT changes relate to the new regime which will apply within the Community from 1 January next when tax borders are abolished. After that date movements of tradeable goods between member states will no longer be controlled for tax purposes at point of entry to the State.  The free movement of goods within the new Single Market requires a whole set of new rules and these have been set down in an EC Council directive.  Basically, VAT on intra-community sales will accrue to member states in which the goods are consumed.  This taxation at destination systems is intended to apply for a transitional period until the end of 1996; a changeover is then envisaged to a regime based on payment of tax in the country of purchase.</P>
    <P>The Single Market should make life easier for businesses involved in crossborder trade since formalities at borders will be removed.  The lodging of official documentation for imports and exports and the physical checking of goods will cease.  Compliance will be based essentially on ex-post audit supported by traders' records.</P>
    <P>Private individuals also should gain considerably from this freeing-up of trade since they will be able to buy most goods tax-paid in the member state of their choice.  However, special rules will ensure that it is the country of consumption who collect the tax on sales of new vehicles and mail-order sales.  The operational rules for all these arrangements are included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The dismantling of frontier customs controls for tax purposes will substantially weaken Revenue's present control over VAT collection.  To counteract this potential risk, the Bill provides for enhanced powers for VAT officials to enable them to combat effectively the new forms of fraud that will undoubtedly occur as a result of the abolition of frontier controls.  Essentially what is involved is the transfer of customs powers currently exercised at the frontier to authorised <Col N="1391" /> VAT staff.  The main powers involved are those of search, arrest, and the right to seize goods in limited specified circumstances.  To enhance the security of the tax I am also proposing the introduction of a new monthly control document on which firms will record their sales to other traders thereby facilitating cross-checking of sales and purchases by VAT inspectors.  The Bill also gives Revenue the power to require security in the case of serious non-compliance. These additional anti-fraud measures pose no threat to legitimate traders; they are aimed at those who would seek to evade their responsibility, in terms of tax compliance, to the community at large.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides in Part IV for the stamp duty changes announced in the budget.  The Bill also confirms the Stamp Duty (Variation) Order which came into effect on 1 November 1991.  This Order exempts many instruments used in the financial service industry from stamp duty.</P>
    <P>With the increasing need to audit the returns of taxpayers within self-assessment, it has become clear that the existing Revenue powers to examine trading records and other documents with a bearing on tax liability are inadequate.  The provisions in Part VII dealing with the inspection by authorised oficers of various records address this difficulty. Before going into the details I would like to put the record straight in one regard.</P>
    <P>There has been some confusion in the media about changes I have made in the provisions in the Bill regarding Revenue powers.  I want to make it quite clear here that there has been no watering down, or general deferral, of the powers set out in the Bill as published some weeks ago. There have been some refinement of the provisions, but I am fully satisfied that these powers are necessary to enable the Revenue Commissioners to carry out their functions efficiently and to ensure that they have the necessary powers to combat tax evasion.</P>
    <P>Sections 226 to 228 of the Bill relate to the obligation by third parties to make certain returns of information to inspectors <Col N="1392" /> of taxes and the inspectors' rights to audit this information.  The first returns under the new procedures will be due, in the case of companies, on 6 January 1994 and, in the case of individuals, on 31 January 1994.  Section 231 deals with record keeping for tax purposes and extends the meaning of records to include documents relating to sources of income and linking documents prepared in the course of making of business accounts.</P>
    <P>Section 232 extends the powers of authorised officers to enter premises to inspect documents and records.  It permits officers to search premises for records where these are not produced. It provides that an officer may enter a private residence only at the invitation of the occupant or on foot of a warrant issued by the District Court.</P>
    <P>Sections 233 and 235 contain provisions for the supervision of the PAYE system and the construction industry tax scheme broadly similar to those contained in section 232.  The Bill also provides for the extension of the construction tax scheme to forestry and meat processing operations.  Section 236 provides that Revenue officers, in carrying out their powers of inspection under sections 232, 233 and 235 of the Bill, may be accompanied by a member of the Garda Síochána who is given the power of arrest in the event of obstruction.  The Revenue officer concerned has no power of arrest nor can he instruct a garda to carry out an arrest.</P>
    <P>Section 239 empowers an inspector to require the submission of a statement of affairs &mdash; assets and liabilities &mdash; where no return of income is filed, or where he is dissatisfied with the return submitted.</P>
    <P>Section 241 extends the Revenue Commissioners' powers to attach amounts owed by a third party to a taxpayer who has defaulted in paying tax.</P>
    <P>Sections 244 and 245 provide for a further development of the self-assessment system in that PAYE directors and their spouses will now be obliged to make returns of income without being served with notices to do so.  Also these returns may be subject to audit by an inspector of taxes and to the imposition of the 10 <Col N="1393" /> per cent surcharge for late filing.  Directors of shelf companies, and directors of certain dormant companies, will not, however, be required to file returns unless, of course, they receive a notice from an inspector of taxes to do so.</P>
    <P>Sections 246 and 247 provide that details of paper-for-paper transactions must, in future, be supplied in tax returns.  Section 248 increases penalties under the Tax Acts.</P>
    <P>Finally, regarding the extension of Revenue powers, I would stress that these powers are necessary to ensure that the Revenue Commissioners can tackle tax evasion effectively, and that they are, in any event, circumscribed in the legislation. Moreover, the Board of the Revenue Commissioners has emphasised that the officers concerned will receive appropriate training and guidance in the use of these powers, particularly as regards entry to, and searches of, premises and that the use of the powers will be closely monitored by the board.  I would emphasise that the compliant taxpayer has no grounds for concern.  On the contrary, it is in the interest of the general body of taxpayers that the authorities should be able to ensure that those who fail to pay taxes properly due can be detected and successfully prosecuted, and that avoidance practices can be addressed promptly.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as usual, contains a number of miscellaneous provisions.  Section 249 contains the usual provision relating to the capital services redemption account. Section 252 requires the Voluntary Health Insurance Board to pay a levy of £3 million into the Central Fund on or before 30 June 1992.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I would like to draw attention to the Government's plans for further legislative provisions in the fiscal area during 1992.  A second Finance Bill, to be introduced in the autumn, will complete the programme of fiscal legislation required by the Internal Market, covering those areas where the relevant EC Directives have still to be adopted.  This will also provide for the domestic measures needed to offset the adverse cash-flow implications for the Exchequer <Col N="1394" /> in 1993 of the ending of VAT at point-of-entry on goods sourced in other EC member states.  Finally, this second Finance Bill will contain the legislative provisions for a new fringe benefits tax as announced in the budget as a means of ensuring the effective taxation of such forms of remuneration and of broadening the tax base, and which is to come into operation from 6 April 1993.</P>
    <P>In this opening address I have outlined for Senators the Government's approach to general economic issues as well as detailing the more significent elements of this Bill.  I look foward to the opportunity on Committee Stage to discuss in more detail the individual sections of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the Seanad.</P>
    <P>At the outset of this debate I also take the opportunity to thank the House for the use of this Chamber last week.  It was a suggestion from the two major Opposition parties that we would use an alternative location to the Dáil and in discussions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I always listen to the Seanad carefully.  I was about to say it was a suggestion that was put forward during the discussion on the Appropriation Bill in the Dáil that we would look for another location.  In the discussions that took place afterwards with all concerned, it was felt the most suitable arrangement would be to seek to use this House.  On the completion of Second <Col N="1395" /> Stage of the Bill in the Dáil, I thanked the Seanad for the use of the facilities.  It was made known to me afterwards that the Seanad had not agreed that we would have these facilities.  The Government Whip promptly apologised to the Seanad for any confusion in that regard.</P>
      <P>The use of this Chamber was deeply appreciated by all 15 Members of the Committee.  We apologised as I did in writing immediately, for any inconvenience caused.  I apologise personally to the Leader of the Seanad and to the Whips.  I want to apologise for the confusion, which was not of my making but since it was my Bill, I felt obliged to do that.  It is not my function to organise the allocation of the different rooms in Leinster House or any part of it, whether it be the Dáil or the Seanad.  I want to thank all sides of the House for the opportunity to have a Committee Stage debate here, which doubled the number of hours we normally would have had.  It worked extremely well.  That would not have been possible without the use of this Chamber.  In no way would I be disingenuous.  I immediately left the other House to meet the Cathaoirleach to make sure there was no confusion.  I want to thank all the Members for their co-operation.</P>
      <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>We fully accept the Minister's apologies for the confusion and the displacement of the work in this House that occurred when it was used for Committee Stage.  I do not think any of us has an objection to this House being used when we are not in session, or when we do not intend to go into session.  I am all for making maximum use of State facilities of any kind.  There are excellent facilities in the Chamber.  The point to which we all objected rather vigorously was that we were displaced from our normal working schedule.  When I referred to the possibility of the Minister being disingenuous, I was referring to what he said in his opening comment on this issue when he suggested that the two main Opposition parties were the ones <Col N="1396" /> which guided the hand towards the use of the Seanad.  I accept it when the Minister says they did suggest the idea of a Special Committee which would work parallel with the Dáil in another premises.  I fully accept what the Minister says.  We all agree that maximum use should be made of this House but not in such a way as to displace us and our work schedule here, which is very important.  I welcome comments made by the Taoiseach during the week in relation to his views on the Seanad.  They should be noted on the record of this House.  They are very welcome.</P>
      <P>As we discuss this Bill we have got to bear in mind that a second Finance Bill is due in the autumn.  The Minister in his speech this morning said that we must complete the programme of fiscal legislation required by the Internal Market. That sentence immediately caught my attention.  One of the disaster areas of this Finance Bill has to be the extension in the number of VAT rates to six.  The Minister may deal with this when replying on Second Stage.  How will we get from six VAT rates to two VAT rates by the autumn when the second Finance Bill is implemented?  If what he says is true, we will complete the programme of fiscal legislation required by the Internal Market.  My understanding was that we were ending up with two VAT rates and that there was to be harmonisation of VAT rates throughout the Community. The Minister's statement and what is expected of us by Brussels do not tally.  I would appreciate advice from the Minister as to how between now, May 1992, and the autumn when we will discuss the second Finance Bill, we will go from six VAT rates to two VAT rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding the Minister's eloquence &mdash; and I thank him for his time, detail and patience with us here this morning on this Finance Bill &mdash; I have got to ask the only real question &mdash; what is this Bill all about?  It is anti-work.  It discourages risk.  It promotes a DIRT of 10 per cent versus income tax rates of 27 per cent and 48 per cent.  We have six rates of VAT for the business sector to contend with.  Where now is the <Col N="1397" /> eloquence of the Minister for Education in loudly promoting the enterprise culture in our schools and in the curriculum of the future?</P>
    <P>The balance is now in favour of deposit accounts, away from equity investment. The Minister has reduced capital gains relief tax by half.  He has also a single rate of 40 per cent capital gains tax, abolishing the 30 per cent and 35 per cent rates. Surely all of this is moving away from investing in job creating industries of our publicly quoted companies.  Where will small investors put their money now? Gilts and Government bonds are out of reach so, with capital gains tax relief halved, how are we going to see all small investors' money in the new special deposit accounts?</P>
    <P>I accept the Minister's explanation.  He valiantly tried to defend the present system by saying the comparison is not with 27 per cent but with no Revenue take at all, if all the money leaves the country.  The reality will be that small investors &mdash; and perhaps the not so small investors &mdash; will go for the safe haven of the special deposit account, which will only attract a 10 per cent DIRT take. Why would they invest in risk-taking manufacturing businesses?  Why would they invest in any new start-ups where there is, naturally, greater risk?  They will shy away from all equity investment.  At a time when we are looking at 300,000 people unemployed &mdash; perhaps by the end of this year, given the increase in unemployment from budget day to date &mdash; how can we justify a Finance Bill that is totally anti-work, anti-productive investment and which does nothing for the unemployment crisis?</P>
    <P>In the Minister's Dáil speech &mdash; and I notice he did not say it here today but he may give it to us on Second Stage &mdash; he mentioned there would be no requirement to make any return on the special deposit accounts interest to the Revenue Commissioners.  Has the Minister changed his mind on that or is that still the state of play?  Will the source of the money being deposited in these new accounts ever be questioned once the 10 per cent DIRT has been paid?  Are they <Col N="1398" /> to be a haven for hot money, both in and outside this country?  Perhaps the Minister and the Department of Finance are trying to do something, the purpose of which escapes me.  Perhaps they wish to attract hot money back to this country by saying &ldquo;we will not look beyond the name on the account provided the 10 per cent DIRT is returned by the financial institution to the Revenue Commissioners.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What is behind these accounts apart from trying to keep as much money as possible, which we can understand, when all exchange rules are removed?  Are they to be safe havens for hot money, laundered money and questionable money in any account in this country from now on?  Despite what the Minister said this morning we have got to come back to the treatment of earned income at the 27 per cent and 48 per cent rates.  While we welcome the reduction in the tax rate, it still compares very unfavourably with the treatment of unearned income in these special deposit accounts as now proposed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister rightly pointed out the difficulties that will occur once all exchange controls are gone.  We must reduce the present 33 per cent rate of DIRT to stop the outflow.  If one takes this, together with the restrictions for investment in manufacturing industry, the fact that the manufacturing dividend relief has gone, the reduction in the capital gains tax relief which the Minister is now proposing as well, the changes in the share options and in the workers' profit sharing schemes in this Bill, I am afraid that the balance tilts entirely in favour of the special deposit account.  This is totally anti-work and anti-investment in productive enterprise.</P>
    <P>In a word, this Bill is anti-job creation. To that scenario, we have to add the other proposals &mdash; the increase in the publicans' licences, the new co-operative tax, tax on company cars and the six VAT rates which I have already referred to instead of making progress towards the two rates that are required for us by the Internal Market.  I challenge the Minister to point to one proposal in this Bill that is <Col N="1399" /> specifically geared towards job creation.  I say to the Minister: give me one proposal and I will debate it with you.  Even the further reduction in marginal tax rates, while welcome, will not produce an extra job.  The reduction from 35 per cent to 27 per cent in our tax rate only saw the number of unemployed increase dramatically.  There was a massive hike in those unemployed with the reductions we have already had in our tax rates. Why should the reduction now from 27 per cent to 25 per cent make any difference to job creation?</P>
    <P>The ESRI medium-term review from 1991 to 1996 points out the urgent need &mdash; and I use their words &mdash; for a critical examination of what policy and behaviour changes are needed to prevent a continuing crisis in employment and a return to emigration rates of 40,000 per annum by the year 2000.  They are forecasting that the true figure of unemployed will be masked again by the year 2000 by an enormous increase of emigration to 40,000 per annum in six to eight years' time.</P>
    <P>We need a radical review of policy and radical thinking from this Government in the whole area of job creation.  I will underline a concept that is gaining immense credence through the country. I am sure it has been brought to the Minister's attention.  In fact, Brendan Logue of the IDA in his personal capacity has put a tremendous amount of thought into this issue, and I would like the Minister to consider the creation of district service companies &mdash; and I bring this specifically to his attention.  There is a document available which outlines in detail the proposals in this concept.  I quote:</P>
    <P>The general concept proposes the establishment of a network of Private Limited Companies' under the indirect control of the State which would employ certain unemployed persons (UPs) willing to work.  The UP would apply to become an employee of the DSC and would sign over his social <Col N="1400" /> welfare (SW) entitlement to the DSC on being accepted.  This would be returned to him, whether he works or not, in the form of a basic wage providing he fulfilled the company's rules.</P>
    <P>The DSC would then sell the labour of the employee in the form of a service to the open marketplace as with any other service activity.  Payment for the service would be made by the customer directly to the DSC which would return a proportion of it, less a progressively rising clawback, to the employee.  The employee would be permitted to earn a set amount over his existing SW entitlement before clawback would commence.  The clawback would then rise progressively until an effective cap on total earnings is achieved equal, say, to the average industrial wage.</P>
    <P>The clawback would be refunded to the Department of Social Welfare less the direct non-staff operating costs of the DSC.</P>
    <P>Staffing of DSCs would be achieved by using existing Public Sector Employees or the UPs themselves.</P>
    <P>Special incentives would be applied to potential employees in the private and public sectors.</P>
    <P>VAT would be charged at the 10% rate to customers.</P>
    <P>We all know, particularly those of us running households and small businesses, the difficulty in getting services of one kind or another.  There is no general register of services available to the public, particularly if you have small once-off jobs, be they plumbing, engineering, house maintenance, gardening maintenance, any skilled or non-skilled type.  It is very hard to find someone to do the once off small jobs.  It we could organise the enormous talent and skills in these areas that are now on our dole queues into district service companies, I think there would be a tremendous spinoff and reduction in the number of those unemployed.  This idea has been mooted before; I do not claim credit for it, but from day one it really took me as something that we need and that the unemployed people deserve to have fully <Col N="1401" /> investigated, and I specifically put it before the Minister.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to add to the concept of district service companies, the Fine Gael proposal in our policy document &ldquo;The Jobs Economy&rdquo; to introduce on a phased basis a tax break on labour intensive home delivered services, like child care, nursing care, home repair and home help.  If those using the skills that would be gathered together in the district service company for child care, nursing care, home repair, and other areas I have mentioned, could get a tax break for moneys expended in this area, there would be a greater encouragement to ensure that services provided in the home, or in the household generally, would not continue to be part of the black economy.  You would get the services declared and it would become a part of the regular white economy and thereby creating more jobs in the home area.</P>
    <P>I have felt aggrieved for a long time that my husband in running his business can get tax relief on any wages or salaries he may pay on the farm, or wherever else, to the help he gets to allow him to complete his business commitments but I, and other people like me, particularly working mothers, are not entitled to any tax relief for any salary or wages we may have to expend in home help to allow us to carry on our jobs.  I wonder in this day of equity and equal treatment of both genders, whether that can be tolerated any longer.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of work in the household, on the small farm and in the small business generally, that could be taken out of the black economy if the concept of a district service company and the concept of the tax break on labour intensive home delivered services could be implemented in a future Finance Bill, and quickly, before we see those on the dole queues go over the 300,000 mark.  Those are two new and radical policy changes and the type of thing we need.</P>
    <P>This Bill is more of the same, it is anti-work, it is tagging on to already bad policy ideas bits of changes here, there and elsewhere to try to close some tax loopholes, fiddling around with existing <Col N="1402" /> provisions instead of a radical change which is now called for, given the critical economic and social issue facing this country today &mdash; the enormous number of unemployed.  If you add to that the huge numbers that will come on to the labour market out of our schools, training colleges and universities in the next few years, you can see the situation demands that immediately the Oireachtas must put their heads together and deliver radical changes and radical proposals for job creation.</P>
    <P>It is with great regret that I recognise in this Finance Bill the Minister's continued refusal to widen tax bands and to take more people on low incomes out of the tax net altogether.  In fact, I think more productive use of resources would have been made if the Minister had made a start in this direction rather than reducing the top rate by the two or three per cent, welcome as that is to those to whom it may apply.  Has the Minister ever considered an introductory rate of tax between 10 and 20 per cent, as has recently been implemented in the UK?</P>
    <P>The greatest tragedy in terms of getting people to work and creating an incentive to accept work, even when it is available, is that particularly for single people they reach the taxation level at far too early a tranche of income and come into the tax net at 25 per cent.  That position has improved but they reach the taxable income stage far too early &mdash; the band just is not wide enough to provide an incentive for young people to get out and try to earn an income for themselves. I suggest the introduction of a new tax rate of between 10 and 20 per cent for the first tranche of income.  Has the Minister given this any consideration?  I would love to know his views on it and why he feels we could not incorporate it in our taxation code.  Surely a greater priority than reducing the top tax rate at this stage would be to widen the tax bands and, indeed, it would benefit us all, even those at the higher income level because initially they would not be caught as quickly as they are now.  I think more of a case could be made in that regard.</P>
    <P>We will now discuss a few specifics of <Col N="1403" /> the Bill.  I welcome the major improvement the Minister implemented on Report Stage in the Dáil.  The battle continued to Report Stage before the Minister saw wisdom in relation to his treatment of Bord Bainne in section 47. I suspect that his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food had a word in his ear, if that is not putting it too gently. There was a lot of pressure for the Minister to see the light, given the importance of the service Bord Bainne provides both nationally and internationally in the promotion of Irish goods and the Irish trademark on what is best in Ireland.  I thank him for finally seeing the light, albeit as late as Report Stage which was only in the last couple of days.</P>
    <P>Given the way we structure the debate in the Seanad &mdash; and I am not criticising the Fianna Fáil Whip or the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party for this &mdash; there is so very little time between the completion of the debate in the Dáil and its introduction in the Seanad; it was only ten minutes before we came in to hear the Order of Business this morning that we got copies of the Finance Bill as passed by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The Minister has introduced a new section dealing with vehicle registration and there were other important amendments introduced on Report Stage.  If we want to table amendments in this House &mdash; and Committee Stage starts this evening &mdash; it is unacceptable that we only get the Bill ten minutes before the commencement of the debate.</P>
    <P>I make that point not particularly to the Minister and I am not making a criticism of those who printed the Bill &mdash; they had an impossible job to do between the completion of Report Stage and the commencement of our Second Stage this morning &mdash; but we should order our business in such a way that we are not precluded from giving detailed attention to an important Bill like this and precluded from making important amendments we might want to circulate because of not having the correct references in the Bill we only got today.</P>
    <P>In relation to the point I was making on the co-operative tax treatment, I know <Col N="1404" /> many small co-ops are still very unhappy. The Department of Finance are trying to trap the plcs.  Maybe they do not intend to catch the co-ops but the legal definition of catching one lot in the net and not catching the other appears to have eluded them.  I wonder if we could look again and see if there is any way of not trying to catch the small developmental co-ops that have been the backbone of many rural communities?  I know many of the major co-ops and the big plcs who are big players in the European market started as truly Horace Plunkett-type small co-ops down in the towns and villages of rural Ireland where there was a co-operative effort to market the produce at the local area.  There are still many of those and there is room for a secondary tier of co-ops if they do not feel they will be taxed out of existence before they get on their feet.</P>
    <P>The Kerry group had £24 million profit last year.  They paid between £600,000 and £700,000 tax and it is reasonable of any Government to ask them to give a little bit more to the national Exchequer. Bringing in 10 per cent for the Kerry group on last year's figures would mean they would now be paying £2.4 million instead of £600,000.  None of us like being asked to pay more tax but a case can be made that it is still reasonable.  However, it is not reasonable to expect the small development co-ops to be treated in the same way.  Co-ops are distinct from the multinational players and the plcs.  I ask the Minister to look at that again to make sure he is not restricting development in our rural towns and villages or any of our cities because of the imposition of this new co-operative tax.</P>
    <P>I will not say much more about the six bands of VAT &mdash; zero, 2.7, refund of VAT to the unregistered farmers, 10 per cent, 12.5, 16 per cent and 21 per cent. Where are we in relation to two bands of VAT and harmonisation goals in the Single Market?  How will we achieve them by the autumn Finance Bill?  I accept that the abolition of VAT at the point of entry will cause a loss of £200 million, once off, to the Exchequer.  That will be dealt with in the autumn.  I would <Col N="1405" /> like the Minister to give us an outline of his thoughts in relation to that matter in his response on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>There has been an outcry about the anti-avoidance measures introduced in the Bill and the increase in the powers of the Revenue Commissioners.  The opposition has mainly come from the professionals. I am not inclined to buy all their arguments, providing the implementation and the extra powers are used as they should be when there is reasonable cause for doubting true returns have been made or for believing that some funny business is going on in a business or with an individual.  If self-assessment is ever to be established as a fair method of assessment for the self-employed we have got to be open for reasonable Revenue inspection.  We should not be comparing with the lack of similar powers in the UK where they do not have self-assessment, we should be looking at the USA if we want a comparison. I would hate to think we would get to the stage where, as I read recently, one businessman crossed the road every time he saw the local Revenue official. They have engendered such terror in small businesses and individuals over there that it has gone too far.  However, with the Irish mentality of trying to avoid all we can avoid and trying to ensure that legislation is just for the Statute Book and not to be enforced, we need a reasonable line to say we mean business.</P>
    <P>If self-assessment is to work it has got to be seen to work.  The Revenue Commissioners have to be seen to have the powers.  After all, Customs and Excise officials have always had these powers of stop, search and investigation without any warrant.  We are really extending what has already been the powers of Customs and Excise officials to the Revenue Commissioners and, provided it works as it should, it will be an important compliance weapon.  We will be the first to come back if there is any maverick behaviour by any section of those enforcing the law.  I am sure the Minister would be open to discuss that but, given the spirit in which the Minister intends it, we should <Col N="1406" /> support it if it is to have the credibility we would like it to have.</P>
    <P>As we have heard in the media this morning and last night, it would appear the Common Agricultural Policy reform talks are coming to a conclusion.  There is one aspect that is not highlighted either by the leaders of the farming organisations, the Minister for Agriculture and Food or any other group that has the interest of the farming community at heart.  That is because the Common Agricultural Policy is no longer common, and if these reforms are agreed it will certainly not be common.  Larger member states are in a position to subvent their farmers by national aids to compensate them for the reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy to a far greater extent than the Irish Government could ever look after our farmers.  It is said European compensatory measures will be made permanent.  I do not know what &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; means because any budget can change them.  I do not know how they can be tied down forever.</P>
    <P>Apart from that nonsense which is being peddled by all and sundry, the farm leaders are taking comfort in trying to convince their farmers that it is &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; compensation we are talking about.  I feel the retail aids in Germany, France and other countries will be able to compensate their farmers and buy the peace of their farmers in acceptance of the reform proposals to an extent that the Irish Government never will.  That means our farmers and our farm produce will not be playing on a level field.  We talk about 340 million consumers in the Single Market which is to be saviour of us all in barrier-free Europe after next January.  Do I have the Minister's assurance that if nothing else happens in the Common Agricultural Policy reform talks he will get assurances from his former colleague, Commissioner MacSharry, and the Competition Commissioner, that Irish farmers will not be at a competitive disadvantage because of extra national aids being offered to other farmers by their Governments?</P>
    <P>What progress is being made in resolving what is for me one of the greatest <Col N="1407" /> enigmas and dilemmas of the present discussions on an issue That gets no prominence? In about a year's time we will understand why the French farmers, and maybe the Italian and English farmers, acquiesced and accepted what we might consider unacceptable proposals in the various agricultural enterprises because the difference in what they are getting and what the Common Agricultural Policy is proposing will be made up by their own national governments.  We cannot do that so where is the Irish agricultural sector going?  Are we to be the Cinderella of the farmers in Europe and will it be a level playing field?  If is is not, we must agree to nothing.</P>
    <P>Recently we heard a great outcry at the cost of policing the concert at Slane. Some 45,000 young people gathered for a day's entertainment.  We heard a junior Minister indicate that very soon there would be legislation providing that promoters of such events would have to pay a contribution towards the policing costs. I want to pose a question as to why young people enjoying their choice of music, in their venue, should be penalised?  Why not insist that in the case of Derby Day at the Curragh, which incurs an enormous amount of security and extra policing, a contribution has to be made by the racing authority?  What about the Carrolls Irish Open and the extra security and policing that incurs?  What about Croke Park on All-Ireland day?  What is the thinking on this area?  We must be sure.  I have been asked by young people why it is that they will have to pay for the cost of policing their events, Their recreation, their social occasion, when adults do not have to do the same.  Could we have an explanation from the Minister of the legislation proposed in this area and an assurance that it will be applied in an even-handed way?</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the requirement that we must be approaching a debt/GNP ratio of 60 per cent rather than achieving a debt/GNP ratio of 60 per cent by 1996 or thereabouts to be considered eligible for the single currency club in Europe.  The ESRI view is that we will only be at 70 per cent at best by the year <Col N="1408" /> 2000.  Does the Minister seriously believe that the efforts we are making are sufficient to be considered worthy to join the single currency?  I am a great supporter of this but we do not quite understand some of the details of its operation as yet, whether the Irish currency will become obsolete or if we will have a coin with ECU on one side and the £ on the other, or how the logistics will work.  Perhaps the Minister will inform us what the thinking on this is because many people are interested.  The average citizen is very interested when we talk about single currency and what it will mean to them and what it will look like.  Does the Minister think we will be considered eligible to adopt the single currency and that the progress we are making with our debt/GNP ratio will be acceptable to the authorities in Brussels?</P>
    <P>Chapter IV relates to vehicle registration &mdash; and we saw that in print for the first time at 10.20 a.m. today.  I welcome the details the Minister has given us in this area.  Am I right in assuming that the main vehicle registration and taxation office will be in Wexford?  I thank the Minister for that; it is extremely welcome. There are almost 40 Customs and Excise officials who are now surplus to requirements &mdash; to use the official expression &mdash; given the completion of the Internal Market by 1 January and I understand that they will have first call on extra jobs being created by this office. For the last two or three years, Customs and Excise officials have been very concerned about their future in the public service.  Even though we got an answer to the problem in Rosslare late in the day, it is very welcome.</P>
    <P>There is a down side to the Maastricht Treaty, we must be prepared to admit that and to face the problem fairly, rather than give the impression that all will be a bed of roses.  There is no doubt but that we must have a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote on 18 June. The balance lies massively in favour of being equal partners in the European Union proposed at Maastricht last December, but let us be honest about areas that will have problems.  I am concerned that as the west of Ireland has <Col N="1409" /> greater difficulties in many ways than the rest of the country at the moment, in the European Union, as conceived, Ireland could become the west of Europe in the same way that the west of Ireland is relative to the rest of the country.  Whatever Government are in power, all our efforts must go to ensure that Cohesion Funds, convergence and subsidies and all the marvellous Euro-speak that means nothing to anyone except people in this House, become a reality and that we do not create a State on the western fringe of Europe that has a relationship to the main European Community similar to the relationship of the west of Ireland to the rest of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Let us be vigilant and honest with the public.  If we are honest with them about the problems, they will believe us when we say that the issues are economic and political union and the no Protocol or Solemn Declaration should be allowed to divert us from what the Treaty is supposed to be about.  Homespun problems must be dealt with at home and, I put the Minister on notice, must be resolved at home as well.</P>
    <P>This Bill is the pup of the mismatch of ideologies of the present Coalition partners. One can see what the Progressive Democrats were trying to achieve and that Fianna Fáil would not give in, so we get a hotchpotch.  Throughout the Bill one can see difficulties.  Taxation reform how are you?  We have heard so much about it, it is not credible to talk about it any more.  There is no coherent strategy; it is just a hotchpotch of badly constructed, anti-work, anti-enterprise measures that leaves us further from compliance with Single Market requirements, and this at a time when the unemployment figures in this country are tragicially reaching the 300,000 mark.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  At all times he has accorded this House and the Members of this House the respect they deserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Programme for Government, it was generally agreed that the tax rates were far too high.  They set us an objective to reduce those tax rates and <Col N="1410" /> there was a commitment to examine all the tax shelters throughout the system and any money that would accrue from that would be used to reduce tax rates. In successive budgets this has happened. Unfortunately, there will always be winners and losers.  In my view, the Government have rightly decided to leave aside the relief on mortgage interest which costs the Exchequer £220 million and the VHI which costs £50 million.  That is a correct decision, given that many home owners entered into an agreement and into an contract on the basis that this was already the position, that this was something they were entitled to and to remove it would have major repercussions for the family budget in the home.  Given their commitment to lowering taxation, the Government had to look at other areas, particularly at exemptions and reliefs, and ask themselves: &ldquo;Is this justified?  Does it add anything to economic activity?&rdquo; This is the basis of the major changes which have taken place in one of the most comprehensive Finance Bills ever placed before the Oireacthas.</P>
    <P>Let us not forget that in the budget the Minister has given relief to the hard pressed PAYE earner.  He has reduced the standard rate from 29p to 27p and the higher rate from 52p to 48p, while the income tax band has been increased for a single person from £6,700 to £7,475 and for the married person from £13,400 to £14,950.  It would be nice to be able to continue to widen the bands further as there is a lot more to do, but any Government will be restricted by the amount of resources that are available.  Therefore, the Minister, quite rightly, looked at the other side of the coin where money could be directed to the Exchequer and he made the tax system less beneficial to what we call the Mercs and perks brigade. Effectively, that is what the Minister has done in this Bill; indeed, that is what many Members on all sides of the House have been calling for over a sustained period.</P>
    <P>In broad terms the Finance Bill can be seen as benefiting the small and the middle income earner by increasing the <Col N="1411" /> burden on the better off, the business and corporate sector.  Rightly or wrongly, there is the perception out there that the business sector and the high earners were not paying their fair share of tax.  People who held this view felt that certain benefits, reliefs and loopholes were only available to those how had sufficient resources to pay people to operate them for their own benefit.  While such a perception might be very simplistic, the measures taken in the Finance Bill will go along way towards ensuring that the tax burden is more fairly distributed.  In effect, those who are in a position to pay more will now be seen to be paying more.</P>
    <P>One group of personal taxpayers who may be unhappy with the Finance Bill are those who have company cars and preferential loans.  Any advantage which those people may have had in the past has been reduced.  The Finance Bill provisions are a move towards equality of treatment with those taxpayers who are not in a position to avail of those perks. How many of us have heard of people who must drive 20, 30 and, sometimes, 40 miles per day to their place of employment? No such perk is available to those people and they feel hard done by, and quite rightly so.  At the end of the day, however, it can still be argued that those with the perks are still better off than if they had to use their own resources to provide the same items.</P>
    <P>Tax-free dividends which have been available to shareholders in certain companies have been abolished.  Some anomalies between capital gains tax and corporation tax have also been removed. The financial sector, in particular life assurance companies and building societies, will contribute more tax to the Exchequer.  I wonder how many people will quibble with that.  All these changes help to spread the tax burden.  They enable greater numbers of taxpayers to avail of the lower rates and the wider tax band exemptions than ever before.</P>
    <P>Section 54 of the Bill deals with the withdrawal of co-operative exemptions. The effect of this exemption was to exclude from corporation tax certain profits <Col N="1412" /> of agriculture and fisheries societies who have registered as industrial and provident societies.  It is interesting to note those areas which were exempted: profits in the processing of produce supplied by members, that is milk, butter etc.; profits on the sales to members of inputs such as feed and fertilisers; and profits on services such as artificial insemination, auctioneering of animals and fish.</P>
    <P>This obviously meant that the bulk of the profits of many of the co-ops were exempt from tax.  Where such profits were not required as retain reserves they could be distributed to members, not by reference to shareholding but by reference to the volume of turnover transacted with the co-ops.  In effect, the profits were passed back to members and they were assessed in those members' hands.  Whether any tax was payable on such profits depended therefore on the tax position of the individual member.</P>
    <P>This exemption from tax may have been appropriate many years ago when the farmers themselves were outside the tax net and when the co-ops arguably were a logical extension of the trade of each individual farmer or fisherman.  In recent times we have seen that the co-ops have developed a business identity of their own and have progressed into activities further removed from the farm gate itself.  It is right therefore that they be treated in the same way as any other business and that the benefits accrue to the consumer of their products in urban areas as well as to the producers in the rural areas.  It must be remembered also that bringing the co-ops into the tax net is not unduly onerous as many of their activities will be liable at the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax, such as the milk area, and those elements of their income taxable at 40 per cent, are in themselves subject to a phasing-in provision.</P>
    <P>The main area of concern has been compliance, returns, anti-evasion and anti-avoidance.  I would like to spend a little time on that particular section.  I must compliment Senator Doyle on her approach to it, because methinks they do protest too much.  The Minister would <Col N="1413" /> not be looking at this area unless the Revenue Commissioners, indeed the Minister, were unhappy that the loopholes were there, that avoidance was going on and that it was about time this whole area was looked at.</P>
    <P>Part VII deals with anti-avoidance and anti-evasion.  Throughout the Bill many other parts deal with returns, time limits, appeals and penalties.  Nobody can condone a person evading their responsibilities to their fellow citizens, and indeed to the State.  It has to be recognised that a system of self-assessment introduced in the past few years requires certain returns being placed on the self-assessment basis which heretofore were requested by notice from a tax inspector.</P>
    <P>The Bill strengthens the Revenue powers in many areas and indeed some say that the powers are greater than those given to the Garda Síochána.  Obviously all of us would make the suggestion that these powers should be exercised with great care and that they should not be in the hands of over-zealous taxmen who could jeopardise job creation and enterprise. I am pleased that the Minister said in his speech that the board of the Revenue Commissioners will emphasise the training and guidance of people in that area.</P>
    <P>When we are talking about levelling playing pitches, may I refer to one area that is of interest, and it is coming down on the side of the self-employed.  Special allowances totalling £1,086 were introduced some years ago for the benefit of the PAYE earner on the top rate of PRSI because he was perceived to be at a disadvantage compared to the self-employed taxpayer at that time.  Since then there has been the introduction of the current year base of assessment, preliminary tax requirements, PRSI for the self-employed and withholding tax on professional fees.  That in itself has eliminated many of the anomalies that existed at that time.</P>
    <P>Three elements of the Finance Bill will further eliminate any remaining anomalies. They are specifically in the area of extending the list of accountable persons for withholding tax on professional fees, <Col N="1414" /> changing the basis for VAT liability from cash receipts to an invoice basis for persons engaged in the supply of taxable services and the extension of self-assessment to all company directors and their spouses even if their tax is fully discharged under PAYE.  Perhaps the Minister, in line with what I would term his commendable policy of equality of treatment and as a form of <i>quid pro quo</i>, would look at this sector to see if the situation could be equated.</P>
    <P>We are all well aware of the situation as it applies to the EC implications and particularly the entry into Community trade which will see the abolition of VAT at the point of entry.  This will have a dramatic effect on the VAT revenue, given that it brought in something like £1.2 billion last year.  Any Minister would be very anxious to ensure that this revenue would be made secure.  It is incumbent on the Minister to strengthen the powers of the Revenue Commissioners to ensure against any loss.  Indeed, the major scandals of last year also give cause for concern as the Revenue people have had experience of self-assessment over the last few years and they became aware of the weakness in their powers.</P>
    <P>The proposed changes in the Bill amending tax treatment of deposit interest will significantly reduce the income tax payable by individuals in respect of deposit interest.  Deposit interest is currently subject to income tax at the taxpayer's marginal income tax rate.  Under the new provisions it will be subject to 10 per cent, provided it is put into a special savings account.  I would differ with Senator Doyle on this because I think it is extremely important for us to ensure that deposits are kept at home. Any enticement and encouragement we can given must be worth while and the Minister is quite right in ensuring that this special savings account is put in place. Furthermore, deposit interest on these accounts will no longer be subject to PRSI, youth employment levy or health contributions.  These provisions will come into force under ministerial order. Again, I would say that they significantly increase the after tax return on deposit <Col N="1415" /> interest earned by individuals and will constitute a very strong incentive for Irish residents to retain funds in this country, notwithstanding the imminent abolition of exchange control.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other very positive things in the Finance Bill that obviously have not been mentioned because they are not controversial.  The first is the capital gains tax on the sale of development land which has been reduced to 40 per cent.  It will now be possible for companies to transfer development land within a group of companies without giving rise to a capital gains charge.  This surely will help to persuade land owners to sell off development land and thereby stimulate growth in the construction industry.</P>
    <P>It is also important to mention the stamp duty amnesty.  It has been introduced in the Bill and will give one an opportunity to have old unstamped documents stamped without paying any interest penalties.  This is a very humanitarian gesture by the Minister and will give property owners an opportunity to put their affairs in order.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the provision on foreign adoptions.  For tax purposes the definition of the child has been extended to a child whose adoption is a foreign adoption and is recognised under the Adoption Act, 1991.  Many parents in this country will be extremely happy with this provision.</P>
    <P>It is also worthy of note that the capital value used in determining restriction of a tax deduction for car expenses and capital allowances for cars has been increased from £7,000 to £10,000.  It is important that we stress the positive aspects of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to one or two points made by Senator Doyle regarding concerts and the payment of security at those concerts.  It would be unfair to let that pass without mentioning specifically that both GAA and the Football Association of Ireland have to pay for their own security.  Therefore it seems very strange and illogical that people who are making good returns from concerts would not be <Col N="1416" /> levied in the same way to help defray the inordinate cost of security on such occasions.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the DIRT tax and the fact that it has been stated that this is an anti-job creation Finance Bill. One of the things we have looked at from 1987 and have paraded is that if you contain public borrowing, ensure there is low inflation and bring down interest rates, this will generate economic activity.  In that regard I would like to make a particular point to the Minister.  It is significant that the Minister for Labour happens to be in the House at this time.</P>

      <P>Training courses have been by and large geared by FÁS to the unemployed.  I make specific mention of the enterprise allowance scheme.  How logical is it to expect that people who have been unemployed on a fairly long term basis would generate economic activity, would generate jobs and be successful in setting up enterprises?  Is it not reasonable to assume that many of these individuals do not possess that expertise? Is it too much to expect that they could make massive inroads into the unemployment sector?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to look instead at the major expertise we have in industry here.  I am thinking of the qualified chemists, engineers and food technologists.  These are specialists in their own areas and they have a knowledge and an expertise in research and development.  Would it be worth our <Col N="1417" /> while looking at courses in entrepreneurship for individuals in these sectors so that, if I may use a loose phrase, we would suck them out to suck them in and so create industry in the sub-supply, assembly sector or within various other niches?</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that many of these people will have expertise relative to their own area, but what many of them will lack is managerial expertise and entrepreneurship.  Should we not, therefore, be putting a far greater emphasis on making available training courses, perhaps at off duty times and at weekends, and make it worthwhile for these people to come forward, to encourage them to come up with ideas for job creation and for R &amp; D and to put together a management structure that will help us to make use of that available expertise and convert it into useful employment projects?  I would recommend to the Minister that it is worth seriously considering.  There are many Senators wishing to speak and I do not wish to delay the House.  As a result of the provisions of this Bill, the disposable income of most individual taxpayers will increase and to fund that increase there have to be a number of unfavourable tax provisions.  Thankfully, they are in the sector that can best afford them.</P>
    <P>I take great pleasure in commending the Bill to the House.</P>

An dóigh a bhfuil cúrsaí gnó, eacnamaíochta agus cúrsaí cultúrtha dulta chun donais san iarthar le tamall de bhlianta anuas, tá sé deacair ag cuid againn, atá ag feidhmiú thiar, a fháil amach cén chiall ata ag an mBille Airgeadais seo i gcomhthéacs saol mhuintir an iarthair.  Tá an dífhostaíocht chomh forleathan agus an infheistíocht chomh lag san iarthar go gceapaim gur beag an mhaith bheith ag caint faoi Bhille Airgeadais, 1992, ó thaobh ghnáthphobal an iarthair de.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is beag an bhaint atá ag an chuid is mó de na moltaí agus na rialacha atá idir an dá chlúdach seo le saol eacnamúil an <Col N="1418" /> iarthair.  Má chíoraimíd cuspóirí an Bhille Airgeadais i gcomhthéacs leasa don iarthar ní léir dom go bhfuil aon dóchas ann, ábhar bróid nó sásaimh maidir le caitheachas agus foinsí airgid, agus is amhlaidh an scéal i gcás na fostaíochta. Ag labhairt anseo dúinn tá sé sin intuigthe go mbeadh ár n-aire dírithe ar na ceisteanna móra náisiúnta, ach, ar deireadh thiar, tá ar chuile dhuine freisin aire faoi leith a thabhairt do cheantar ar leith agus an reachtaíocht a mheas dá réir.  Mar sin ní fheictear dom go bhfuil an Bill Airgeadais ag dul a dhéanamh mórán maitheasa don iarthar i leith fostaíochta. An t-airgead a bhaileofar de bharr an Bhille seo, chun an tír a reachtáil, ní fheictear domsa go bhfuil sé ag dul a dhéanamh mórán maitheasa do mhuintir na hÉireann.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá i dtaobh an Bhille seo agus an meon atá léirithe ag an Stát i leith chúrsaí eacnamaíochta an iarthair, mar is é bunchúram lucht airgeadais airgead a bhailiú, agus díol agus ceannach atá taobh thiar de chúrsaí airgeadais, nó chúrsaí eacnamaíochta, chun maoin a chruthú.  Chuir an Rialtas rompu, trí thuarascáil Culliton agus shaothar a thascfhórsa, cúnamh agus poist a chur ar fáil.  Ní léir domsa go mbeidh aon toradh sásúil ar fhorálacha an Bhille seo maidir le gnáthdhaoine san iarthar leas a bhaint astu.  Is í aidhm an Bhille ná freastal ar an tír uilig ach i gcás an iarthair, tá an taobh sin tíre agus an daonra scoite amach ón chuid eile den tír agus nuair a chuireann tú san áireamh an bhochtaineacht, a laghad deiseanna fostaíochta atá ann, an saol geilleagrach, sóisialta, cultúrtha ag dul in ísle bhrí, bliain i ndiaidh a chéile, ní fheictear dúinn conas mar is féidir mórán dul chun cinn a bheith ann.</P>
    <P>Níl fágtha ag na créatúir bhochta seo ach an dole, cheal deiseanna fostaíochta. Is cuimhin liom sna seascaidí toscaireacht againn ag dul go dtí Roinn an Gaeltachta i mBaile Átha Cliath chun a impí ar an Aire faoiseamh éigin a thabhairt do lucht an dole, tríd an Bhuiséad nó Bhille Airgeadais; go mbeadh cead acu roinnt oibre a dhéanamh gan sin ag cur isteach ar a gcuid dole.  Anois, 30 bliain ina dhiaidh <Col N="1419" /> sin, níl dul chun cinn ar bith déanta.  Is ag dul in olcas atáimid, dar liomsa.  Cad é an réiteach atá ag an Rialtas maidir le gnáthchúrsaí na tíre a reachtáil?  Cuireann siad tascfhórsa ar bun le poist a sholáthar, de réir mholtaí thuarascáil Culliton, ach cuireann sé alltacht orm nuair a fheicim cuid de na moltaí a bhaineann leis an iarthar.</P>
    <P>Moltar sa tuarascáil seo, mar shampla, gan aon chúnamh de bhreis ar an chabhair atá le fáil ar an gcósta thoir a thabhairt don té a bheadh ag iarraidh monarcha a bhunú laistiar den tSionainn.  Is ionann sin agus a rá, má thagann duine chun na tíre seo agus fonn air monarcha a chur ar bun, caolseans go rachadh sé go dtí an t-iarthar má fheictear dó nach mbeidh aon chúnamh breise le fáil.  B'ionann an deontas a gheobhadh sé ar an gcósta thoir agus a gheobhadh sé ar an gcósta thiar.  Sin an rud atá molta ag DKM consultants sa Culliton report.  Is ionann sin agus a rá nach mbeidh aon dul chun cinn ann ó thaobh eacnamaíochta de san iarthar. B'fhéidir go n-abrófar liom nach bhfuil aon bhaint ag an Culliton report leis an ábhar atá faoi chaibidil, ach tá mé cinnte de go bhfuil, mar is é bun agus barr an Bhille Airgeadais seo ná airgead a chur ar fáil chun tacaíocht a thabhairt don tuarascáil agus a bhfuil ann a chur i gcrích.</P>

      <P>Faoi alt 26 den Bhille, tá sé i gceist ag an Aire faoiseamh a thabhairt do dhream ar bith a bheadh ag plé le haerfort a thógáil, go mbeadh deiseanna ann chuige sin ó thaobh chaiteachas caipitil agus cánach de.  Tá comhlacht beag ann, Aer Árainn, a chuireann seirbhís ar fáil d'Oileáin Árainn thiar i gConamara agus, i mí Feabhra anuraidh thosaigh siad ar aerfort beag nua a thógáil. Tá fear thall ansin a chaith cuid mhaith airgid ar Aer Árainn le blianta beaga anuas.  Éireannach on iarthar ab ea é agus is beag airgead a ghnóthaigh sé thar na blianta, rud a chruthaíonn na leabhair chuntais.  Ní bhfuair sé aon fhaoiseamh faoi na Billí Airgeadais éagsúla a chuaigh tríd, ach lean sé leis an tseirbhís, atá thar a bheith riachtanach i saol mhuintir na n-oileán.</P>
      <P>Cúpla bliain ó shin thosaigh cuid againn ag áiteamh air an aersheirbhís a fhorbairt agus aerstráice nua a thógáil i gConamara, agus dúradh leis go mbeadh sé in ann a chuid costas a roinnt trí fhreastal ar cheantar turasóireachta, agus, sa chaoi sin, go mbeadh brabach ann.  Rinne sé amhlaidh ach gan oiread is pingin rua a fháil ó dhream ar bith, ó Roinn na Gaeltachta ná ó Údarás na Gaeltachta ná ón Roinn Airgeadais.  Chaith sé £750,000 ar aerstráice beag agus anois cuirtear ar ár súile dúinn go mbeidh an tAire sásta, faoi alt 26 den Bhille, faoiseamh chaiteachas caipitil a thabhairt do dhuine ar bith a thógfaidh aerstráice nó aerfort amach anseo.  An mbeidh aon fhaoiseamh le fáil ag an duine a thóg a t-aerfort seo anuraidh?  An mbeidh an tAire sásta an cás seo a scrúdú agus an comhlacht beag seo a chur san áireamh maidir le caiteachas caipitil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1422" /> Tá go leor cainte ann faoi thosca a chruthú san iarthar chun obair a chur ar fáil, ach seo fear a rinne gníomh in ionad cainte agus a bhí sásta infheistíocht a dhéanamh i bhfiontar a raibh spéis aige ann.  Tá súil agam, nuair a rachaidh an tAire i mbun leasuithe, go ndéanfaidh sé leasú ar alt 26 chun an cás áirithe seo a réiteach.  D'fhéadfainn leanúint liom ag caint faoi chúrsaí airgeadais an iarthair agus an chaoi a bhfuil an Bille seo ag dul i gcion ar na daoine ansin ó thaobh fostaíochta agus an daonra de.  Tá drochaoi ar iarthar na hÉireann agus tá daoine ann a deireann nach fiú infheistiú a dhéanamh ann mar go bhfuil an dé agus an chroí bainte as, beagnach.</P>
    <P>Tá rudaí éagsúla sa Bhille seo, ar nós faoisimh i gcáin phearsanta agus i gcáin chorporáideach ach ní dhéanann an Bille aon ní ar son muintir an iarthair nach bhfuil acu ach na sléibhte, na haibhneacha agus an deis chun suí ar a dtóin. Fuair na daoine a d'fhan san iarthar buntáistí thar na daoine a d'imigh.  In áit an Bhille Airgeadais seo a chur i gcomhthéacs Culliton nó i gcomhthéacs DKM ní mór é a chur i gcomhthéacs an iarthair. Ní fheicim leor dóchas ann do mhuintir an iarthair.  Tá daoine aonaránacha ann a dhéanfaidh go maith as, ach má ghníomhaítear de réir moltaí Culliton ní bheidh monarcha fágtha san iarthar ach i gcorrbhaile mór ar nós Chaisleán an Bharraigh agus Gailleamh.  Molann Culliton go ndúnfaí monarchana ar fud an iarthair agus rachaidh na moltaí sin os comhair an Rialtais.  Tá tasc fórsa curtha ar bun chun na moltaí a chur i bhfeidhm, a fhágann go bhfuil sé fánach domsa a bheith ag labhairt thar ceann an iarthair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill.  It marks a further stage in the Government's economic strategy of tax reform as set out in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and in the Programme for Government and provides a statutory basis for the taxation measures introduced in the budget on 29 January.  It is one of the biggest Finance Bills to come before us.  The Minister on Second Stage outlined his proposal to introduce a <Col N="1423" /> second Finance Bill in the autumn as a result of the various decisions which will be made by Heads of Government and Ministers at future Heads of Government meetings.</P>
      <P>It is essential to outline some of the grounds quoted by the Minister on which the current Finance Bill is based and to look at economic prospects for this year. We are informed that the international economic outlook for 1992 remains uncertain.  We had been informed that last December the OECD and EC Commission forecast a slow and modest international recovery with growth picking up by 2 per cent or more from about 1 per cent last year.  Developments so far this year in the major economies, the US, Germany, the UK, and Japan, suggest that international recovery may be somewhat slower and less than earlier indicated. It is now indicated that economic commentators in December were a little off the mark and too ambitious in their forecast.  Little information is to hand on how the economy is performing this year but there are indications that performance is on target.</P>
      <P>Exports turned in another strong performance in January, and the same applied to industrial output.  The seasonally adjusted trade success was one of the best on record.  Consumer spending and building investment indicators for the recent few months show excellent signs of improvements.  We have been asked not to become complacent about inflation which rose to 3.7 per cent in the year to February last.  However, it is still one of the lowest levels in the EC.</P>
      <P>Tax returns and employment levy receipts for the first quarter of 1992 point to employment holding up reasonably well.  PAYE receipts for the first quarter were almost 10 per cent ahead of the first quarter of 1991.  Training and employment levy receipts up to early April were over 10 per cent ahead of the same period last year.  Both figures suggest that the continuing rise in employment reflects a growing labour force rather than falling numbers of unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased that the Minister for Finance <Col N="1424" /> decided to reconsider his budget proposals for the licensed trade and that the suggestion that the liquor licence would be charged on the basis of ratable valuation has been modified.  The Minister is now making provision for a turnover base system.  This is welcome to all concerned.  Strong representations were made to the Minister on this issue, in particular from Kerry and he accepted that his original proposal was unreasonable. I am personally pleased that holders of liquor licences will be treated on a reasonable basis having regard to the conditions for the various types of licences involved.  Section 135 of the Bill deals with this matter in an extensive form.  No doubt this section will be welcomed by the trade.</P>
    <P>The budget also allows for a 4 per cent increase in all social welfare payments. A special increase to £53 for all short term recipients, including disability benefit, unemployment benefit, short term unemployment assistance and carer's allowance, constitutes an increase of 6 per cent.  Unemployment imposes strain on families, especially on those with young school going children and it is pleasing to know that the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance has been increased by £10 per child bringing the full payment to £50 for each child attending second level school and £35 for each child attending primary school.</P>
    <P>An adoptive benefit scheme has been introduced for women in employment. Further improvement has been made in the family income supplement scheme to help those at work on low pay from which it is predicted, 7,200 families and 29,000 children will benefit.  There is also the introduction on a phased basis commencing this year of measures to give effect to an EC Court of Justice ruling on equal treatment which would be readily acknowledged to have been around for quite a while.  The Department have established a special group to devote attention to the matter this year.</P>
    <P>It is further proposed that the age for the pre-retirement allowance be reduced from 58 to 55 with a special increase in the adult dependant allowance payable <Col N="1425" /> with the old age non-contributory pension. There is also the extension of the free travel companion pass to certain pensioners and the extension of the over-80 allowance to invalidity pensioners with effect from April, giving them an extra £4.20 per week.</P>
    <P>As a result of a recent change in social welfare legislation pensioners over 66 years of age will have the option of moving into accommodation more suited to their needs with the security of knowing that they will retain their pensions. Many elderly people live in houses that are no longer suited to their needs and which in many cases they are no longer in a position to look after.  Up to now these people had a serious problem.  If they were to sell their home they would be means tested and might as a result lose all or part of their pensions.  For this reason many elderly people retained their homes or even transferred and eventually in many cases finished up in homes for the elderly.  These changes in the social welfare legislation are much appreciated by our senior citizens.</P>
    <P>Referring to social welfare I wish to seek clarification under a number of headings which are being drawn to my attention.  The first is the effects on payments and entitlements under the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>The social welfare system is designed to ensure against the contingencies of sickness, unemployment, maternity, old age and motherhood.  The principle of the PRSI system also encourages the notion of solidarity between those who are in a position to pay and those who are not.  It provides insurance against sickness and unemployment.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Bill which is complementary to the budget seems to be interfering with this insurance provision and some elements of these changes could become to the subject of a judicial review.  On Second Stage the Minister pointed out that he is not attempting to dismantle the PRSI system but rather to remove the concept of automatic entitlement. Why not automatic entitlement?  A weekly premium has been paid to ensure entitlement.  The main area where the <Col N="1426" /> system is being interfered with is in pay-related benefit.  The maximum benefit is being cut from £17.40 per week to £17 per week.  The pay-related element is no longer paid in respect of week on, week off work and is no longer to be paid with disability benefit.</P>
    <P>Part-time workers will only be eligible for unemployment benefit at a level related to the employment lost.  Those under 55 who are made redundant and receive severence in excess of a fixed level will lose unemployment benefit for nine weeks because redundancy payment is seen as compensation.  Any earning from days in part-time employment will be treated as means on a pound-for-pound basis for assessing unemployment assistance for the remaining days.  This is seen as a disincentive for the unemployed to actually seek work.</P>
    <P>If a sick person in receipt of full unemployment assistance of £55 is fortunate enough to find two days work at £20 per day, deduction of PRSI at 5.5 per cent which is the lower rate brings the net payment to £37.80.  Because of pound-for-pound means testing the person would only receive £15 unemployment assistance added to the £37.80 wages making a total of £52.80, showing a net loss of £2.20 after working for two days. This will have two major effects: one is a disincentive to seek employment and the other is an increase in the black economy.  The disqualification period has been extended from six to nine weeks.  I fail to understand why a person is guilty until proven innocent for social welfare purposes.</P>
    <P>Thirteen of the 39 contributions needed for disability benefit must be paid rather than credited.  It will no longer be possible to qualify solely on the basis of credited contributions.  If an employed person goes on disability benefit for 40 weeks, returns to work and is unfortunate enough to become ill again in the following year she/he will find that because credits are no longer a basis for qualifying they cannot draw disability benefit for the second period of sickness.  Occupational injury benefit is a scheme where the employer and employees pay contributions <Col N="1427" /> to cover the cost of an accident at work.  Under this Bill occupational injury benefit is being reduced by £12 per week to £53.</P>
    <P>To qualify for dental and optical benefit people are required to have 13 paid contributions in the year.  Does this mean that a person on disability or unemployment benefit cannot qualify for dental benefit?  The same rules have been introduced for the maternity allowance scheme which have been amalgamated so that a women who is unemployed, who takes up a full-time job, who becomes pregnant, will not then be able to avail of the maternity allowance scheme or maternity leave.</P>
    <P>I welcome the reduction of VAT on technical assistance service and farm relief schemes to 12.5 per cent.  The farm relief scheme provides essential services especially for those working alone or for those who are out of work through sickness, injury or for some social reason. Under the scheme employment is also created for many young farmers who do not now have full-time work on the farm and for young people who would be otherwise unemployed.  These people have received good training and the scheme is effective.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the Minister's decision not to tax the artificial insemination service. This full-time important service is aimed at improving the national herd and the quality of our stock which is essential at a time of tight pocket margins for many producers.</P>
    <P>Much discussion has taken place with regard to co-operatives having been brought into the tax net.  Small co-ops should be exempt; large plcs and those making substantial profits should not. Small co-ops throughout the country provide a good service and any profit they make is channelled back to improve the service for the farmer.  As a result of the introduction of the Leader programme those co-ops will play a major role in ensuring that the programme is a major success.</P>
    <P>The Minister made special reference to the excessive burden which our national <Col N="1428" /> debt imposes on our finances.  Almost one-quarter of total tax revenue is spent on servicing our national debt.  This has obvious implications for spending and it imposes certain limits on what the Government can do in terms of reflating the economy.  In terms of public expenditure with particular reference to expenditure on health, social welfare and education, almost one-tenth of GNP or one-quarter of the total tax revenue must be allocated on an annual basis to meet debt services and costs.  We cannot lose sight of this.  The Minister has stated he is committed to maintaining financial and economic discipline.  Any sign of slippage or any indication that we are going back to the old system will affect the economy. The Minister is going to follow through on budget discipline to attain the welcome targets he set for borrowing, public expenditure and taxation.</P>
    <P>The Minister also indicated areas in which the Government are moving to combat unemployment.  The first is by simplifying the taxation system and reducing tax rates.  Most groups who have carried out surveys and analysis of our economic performance to date have drawn attention to the taxation system as a serious factor and a major disincentive to the creation of employment.  The National Economic and Social Council, the Commission on Taxation and the Culliton report have made similar points and recommendations on taxation.  The Minister has followed through on a number of those recommendations in this Bill and he has gone further than most Finance Bills in trying to implement certain proposals put forward by the Commission on Taxation and other bodies.  It is hoped that by streamlining the taxation system and reducing tax rates we will give a greater incentive to the private sector to create more worthwhile employment.</P>
    <P>I welcome sections 12, 13 and 14 of the Bill.  Section 12 abolishes the concessionary tax treatment of share options granted under approved share opions schemes.  These schemes introduced in 1986 meant that the recipient of share options were liable only to capital gains <Col N="1429" /> tax, a charge which arose only in the eventual sale of the shares.</P>
    <P>Section 13 confirms the budget day measure regarding tax relief on dividends. Section 14 deals with the income tax relief available on interest on loans to acquire shares in a quoted company. This section eliminates the relief in respect of such loans applied on or after budget day.  He also referred this morning to farm taxation.  In order to avoid a clawback of stock relief, farmers are allowed a two year period to rebuild herds which have been depopulated due to disease eradication measures.  Section 20 extends this provision by a further year.</P>
    <P>It has also been indicated that the urban designated areas scheme has not taken off as originally intended.  In Tralee we were very pleased to have an area designated which has helped us to secure a new conference centre and has helped to attract many worthwhile conferences to Tralee over the past few years, thus creating much needed employment.  I hope to see this development extended over the coming years to areas like Listowel, Ballylongford and Castleisland and also to the seaside resorts of Ballybunion and Ballyheigue to encourage development.  I appeal to the Minister to consider the extension of this worthwhile scheme to the areas I have mentioned. Developments should not be prevented because of a deadline at the end of 1994. The Minister should be flexible in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill is courageous.  It contains many proposals in relation to the development of Europe.  We must be seen to bring the benefits of European Union to all parts of Ireland, European Union is fundamental to our future progress. We need to invest more in the development of tourism and to offer attractive incentives for private investment in tourism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>When Deputy Séamus Brennan was Minister for Tourism, <Col N="1430" /> Transport and Communications he launched the tourism task force consisting of representatives of banks, hotels, accommodation providers, unions and marketing sectors to examine the potential of the tourism industry.  I understand that, following discussions, proposals will be put forward on this issue.  I hope a tourism plan will be devised for the country with special recognition for areas with potential for tourism development and job creation.  I hope that special recognition will also be given to areas not interested in tourism at present but which have potential.  I have no doubt that the present Minister, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, will follow on these lines.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in his speech, made special mention of corporation tax.  I welcome section 23 of the Bill.  It ring-fences the losses arising from limited paratnerships to the trade of the partnership. A similar restriction is being introduced under section 25 for the capital allowances on holiday cottages.  These capital allowances were being increasingly used as a tax shelter, which was in some respects better than the relief for rental residential accommodation in that the investor could put the construction costs of the cottage against all his income, not just his rental income.  At the end of the ten year qualifying period, the investor would own a holiday home in respect of which the Exchequer would have contributed a large part of the cost.  The Minister has, in response to many representations, introduced amendments to these sections.  I congratulate him on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to refer to the question of incentives which the Minister spoke about this morning and, in particular, the Government assistance to the Cork-Swansea Ferries.  With the aid of a Government grant, Swansea-Cork Ferries operated a service from May to September 1990 and carried a total of 88,000 passengers and 23,700 cars.  A grant of £500,000 and a loan of £500,000 were made available by the Minister for Tourism and Transport to the company.  The loan was repaid in full in December 1990 <Col N="1431" /> and the comany recorded a profit, before tax, of £310,000 for the year.  The company chartered the <i>Celtic Pride</i> from the Polish Baltic Shipping Company to provide the service for 1991, with renewable options.</P>
    <P>The season was extended to eight months from March to October and a total of 125,000 passengers and 33,000 cars were carried for the season.  No grant was made available for 1991, but a loan of £500,000 was renewed.  The loan was once again paid in full by the comany and pre-tax profits of £952,100 were returned for that year.  The chartering costs of the ship and the full costs are paid in US dollars.  The dollars were bought early in the year on foot of guarantees from three Irish shareholders by way of forward contract.</P>
    <P>Here I must give credit to the local authorities, because it was due to the input of Kerry County Council, Cork County Council and Cork Corporation that this was possible, with the aid of substantial funding from the Government. It also created worthwhile employment. This year it is hoped to improve on last year's figures.  I have no doubt that the ferry has been a major boost to tourism in the Kerry-Cork area.  A target of 130,000 passengers and 34,000 cars has been set for the current year.</P>
    <P>As a result of Maastricht we will be able to get additional assistance from the EC to promote tourism, agri-tourism and so on.  It will be to our advantage to ensure that we are part of a greater European Union.</P>
    <P>I welcome the setting up of the jobs forum.  Only good can come of it.  I am disappointed that the Fine Gael Party decided not to take part in the forum as they were the party who originally called for it.  I would hope to see them take part in the employment committees.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for putting such excellent and far reaching legislation before the House.  I wish him well.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and compliment him on the attention and respect he shows this House during debates on financial matters.  He sat through the debate on the Appropriation Bill here before Christmas; he has been here in the House all morning and I am very pleased to see him here again this afternoon.  I thank him for the attention and respect he shows this House.  I greatly appreciate it.</P>
      <P>The Bill before us today is one of the most complex Finance Bills ever to be placed before the Oireachtas.  It is an enormously long and detailed Bill and it is difficult to expect any of us to be able to fully comprehend all the details of what is involved.  One of the reasons the Bill is so long and as complex is that it contains many of the measures required to make adjustments necessitated by our expected entry into the European Union, and the challenges which economic and monetary union will present to us.  These challenges are enormous and unavoidable. Joining the European Monetary Union will result in considerable constraints on our ability to manage our own affairs.  It might be good for us to be members of the European Monetary Union, but it may not be a pleasant experience, particularly in the short term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are debating this Finance Bill in the context of an unemployment level in excess of 280,000.  If we are to believe predictions and work out the implications of the Minister's budget proposals, we are heading rapidly for unemployment levels in excess of 300,000.  That presents an enormous challenge which I am not sure we are geared up to face.  What is happening should be seen in the context of what is likely to develop here between now and the year 2000.  I understand that approximately 22,000 people are scheduled to enter the jobs market each year between now and the year 2000.  That figure has to be seen in the context of our best ever efforts at job creation, 17,000 jobs were created in our best year.  Even <Col N="1433" /> if we equal that maximum level of achievement, we will still see increasing levels of unemployment.  The outlook is very disturbing and grim.  We can expect to see unemployment increase unless an unprecedented and enormous effort is made at job creation.  We need to considerably exceed our best efforts and it is very difficult to see how that can be done.</P>
    <P>The alternative is that a resumption of emigration.  That is not a very appealing prospect.  Admittedly that would reduce unemployment but I would not want to see it happen that way.  However, if the number of people emigrating does not increase again, unemployment levels will continue to increase.  I wonder if many people understand the full dimension of the challenge we are facing.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report spelled out these challenges in grim terms.  Any of the economists who deal with the area of economics has little hesitation in spelling out the dimensions of the challenge which the average person does not understand or appreciate in the context of our past achievements.  I will not join those who come up with instant solutions.  That is unrealistic and serves no purpose.  It is very important that there should be wider understanding of the dimensions of the problem in the hope that we will begin to work towards solutions.  Solutions are possible.  Everybody should understand what the options are.  The employment committee, of which I am honoured to be a member, should at least spell out the options, to the public.  If we make sacrifices than we can expect certain things to follow but as things stand, many people think we can have it every way. Unfortunately we cannot.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that there was no shortage of expert reports on income tax, there are enough to fill a small library.  One could spend the rest of one's life reading such reports but it would not do much good.  Most of these reports seem to say that there is a great need to broaden the tax base.  Everybody agrees with that, including myself, but the difficulties arise when you get down to the specifics of broadening the tax base because some people will be paying more <Col N="1434" /> tax.  As soon as that is mentioned those people will begin to react in a very negative manner and will resist this move very strongly.</P>
    <P>In relation to taxation generally, there is a need to shift tax in such a way that people will be encouraged to take more risks than has been the case in the past. In the past most investors understandably went for the safe option.  They put their money into property, and investments guaranteed to produce a reliable income. That element must to some degree, remain.  The balance should be shifted to make it more attractive for people to take risks when they invest.  In the area of investment and tax, over the years a tax advisory industry has grown where many people seem to make large amounts of money simply by advising people how to invest to reduce their tax liability.  I wonder if that type of industry serves any real need.  It might be desirable to alter things so that the need for such services could be reduced and the time, energy and capacity of the people engaged in such services might be directed elsewhere, for example, to improve our economic performance and job creation record.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the levels of taxation which he was imposing on co-operatives. I accept that there is a need for co-operatives to be treated in the same way as other forms of industry. However, we have to see co-operatives in the light of their history and the social purpose for which they were established. Many co-operatives have simply turned into private limited companies, but I would have preferred the Minister to have phased in the measure so that the burden of taxation which he has imposed on them could have been reduced.  Could the Minister not encourage co-operatives through the taxation system, to investigate more in product research, product development and in areas which would create more jobs?  The point made by Senator Foley in relation to small co-operatives is a very important one.  I hope the Minister would have another look at that.  A number of small co-operatives are struggling to get by and they should <Col N="1435" /> be encouraged to get something going. They should be given financial encouragement if it is feasible.</P>
    <P>Much attention has been focused on the taxation levels paid by those on the higher tax rates.  The Progressive Democrats like talking about this.  They seem to believe that if the higher rate of taxation were lowered, some form of magical job creation energy would enter the economy and hundreds of thousands of jobs would be created in a very short time.  I do not subscribe to that view.  The United Kingdom experience in the days of Mrs. Thatcher clearly indicated that that would not happen, even if we moved in that direction.  That is not necessarily a desirable way forward and I do not believe it would generate the type of response they seem to believe it would.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to a specific area of which I have a certain amount of knowledge, the possible development of science parks around areas of expertise, mainly the universities, the regional technical colleages and so on.  I would like to hear the Minister's response to the suggestion that some extra encouragement should be given to the development of those parks. A great deal of knowledge is available in the colleges and yet very little formal or structured effort is made to exploit that knowledge.  There are considerable options, they are referred to in the Culliton report and the idea has considerable potential.  There must be opportunities in relation to Trinity College and University College Dublin, where I work when I am not here.  There are also opportunities in the various other areas where we have third level colleges.  That potential has not been exploited.</P>
    <P>There seems to be antagonism to any idea that we should expand the public sector.  If the jobs problem is to be tackled in a meaningful manner, we must have some expansion in that sector.  I am not suggesting that we should just dump money into the public sector and hope for the best.  That is not a wise course of action, but there is potential for further expansion and for further investment in <Col N="1436" /> public companies such as Bord Na Móna. As they have considerable capacity at present, they would seem to be in a position to develop in a manner that many of the smaller companies are not geared to doing.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Keeffe in his speech referred to the perks which some of the owners of big cars have had available to them over the years.  To a large extent, I would agree with his line of thought, but perhaps the Minister has been too hard on people who are supplied with company cars, in particular those who are engaged as company representatives.  For these people a car is absolutely essential. I suspect, to some extent, the antagonism to the car comes from the Civil Service. Some people in the Civil Service have a thing about cars.  They seem very anxious to hinder the usage of cars, and are anxious to ensure control of the tax allowances which might be available to people with cars.  I am not in favour of people who have very large cars being given very generous allowances, but I am concerned for people in very ordinary jobs, who badly need a car to enable them to do their work.  Many of them travel in very modest family cars.</P>
    <P>Anomalies still exist in the legislation in relation to the taxation of separated people, specifically those who are now involved in new relationships.  There is a great need to reorganise the law in this regard.  The problem is considerably wider than the scope of the Finance Bill. There seem to be considerable anomalies in relation to inheritance and so on. People form new relationships which in many cases amount to second marriages and if they die enormous tax penalties arise from the distribution of their money.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill contains very sweeping, additional powers for the Revenue Commissioners, which are a matter of considerable concern to many business people, particularly to small, very ordinary business people who are worried as to how those powers will be exercised.  I accept the need for those powers.  I am prepared to go along with them, but I want to sound a note of concern about <Col N="1437" /> them.  I am most concerned that these powers should only be used by the Revenue Commissioners as a matter of last resort.  They should not be heavy-handed in the operation of those powers.</P>
    <P>If I heard the Minister correctly, he mentioned that the Revenue Commissioners were taking courses on how to engage themselves with the public and so on.  That is very desirable.  The language used by the Revenue Commissioners is excessively oppressive and abrupt, which is unnecessary for the most part.  For those people who are prepared to pay their tax such terminology is quite unnecessary.  The Revenue Commissioners approach to them should be more polite.  They should have a more highly developed, public relations oriented manner.</P>
    <P>The other side of the coin is that those people who are firmly committed to not paying their tax, are all too well aware of the type of language the Revenue Commissioners use and they take no notice of it.  They have a whole array of tax consultants, advisers and a battery of lawyers to protect themselves from the Revenue Commissioners.  For that reason, I do not think such heavy language really serves any useful purpose.  It annoys, disturbs, and upsets people who are going to pay their taxes anyway and people who are opposed to the idea of paying tax will not be frightened.</P>
    <P>There are considerable new changes in the Finance Bill in relation to the licensed trade.  On the night of the budget I met a publican who seemed to be very aware of the provisions in the Finance Bill.  I was very impressed at the capacity of the Minister to get through to a busy owner of an important public house.  It was very impressive.  He was fully aware of all aspects of the budget and the man in question has not fully settled down since. He still remains very disturbed.  He has had a number of conversations with me and with many of his other customers.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes introduced by the Minister.  They are more appropriate and more just than what was introduced initially using valuation as a basis.  There are many anomalies in the law in relation <Col N="1438" /> to valuation and in the extent to which the process is up to date.  On the matter of publicans and public houses, perhaps there is a case at this stage for liberalisation of the licensing laws.  There is a strong case to be made for liberalisation of the law which would allow some of the licences which are now held in rural areas to be transferred to the urban areas.</P>
    <P>I conclude by referring to the remarks which were made this morning by my colleague, An Seanadóir Pól Ó Foighil, who spoke for some time.  All he seemed to be saying was Ochón, Ochón agus Ochón, arís agus arís in relation to the west.  What good does such a speech do? Where does it get us?  I know there are problems in the west, but we must begin to think in terms of reaching some solutions. I do not think any useful purpose is served by statements such as &ldquo;Níl aon dóchas ann&rdquo;.  That is the politics of &ldquo;táimid cráite, táimid briste&rdquo;.  I do not see where that gets us, and I certainly do not see where it gets the people in the west who are in difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>Finally, for better or for worse, and in spite of all the difficulties which Senator Pól Ó Foighil spoke about in terms of the neglect of the west and so on &mdash; I do not dispute that there are considerable levels of neglect in some cases &mdash; the bottom line remains that the people of the west, continue to support Fianna Fáil in proportions considerably in excess of the national average.  If this country is to face up to the existing problems and if we are to try to find solutions to our enormous unemployment difficulties, I see no purpose in continuing to ochón, ochón.  That will get us nowhere.  We have to start thinking in terms of solutions and we owe it to the thousands of people on the dole queues to put our heads together to try to solve this problem. Many people have serious reservations about the employment committee, and I certainly am not naive about it.  However, it is a start, an effort on the part of the Government and I hope the people who have reservations about it will do better than continue to <Col N="1439" /> moan and groan without putting forward alternative solutions.  That attitude will never get us out of the mire.  It is time we began to look forward and to grasp any opportunities to help resolve our problems.</P>

      <P>There could hardly have been a less desirable Finance Bill for any new Finance Minister than that which is before this House today.  Much of the target of the Bill could be, and no doubt has and will be, argued over for a long time to come by experts, each in their own specialist fields.</P>
      <P>Our job here is not just to look at any one aspect in isolation and see how it may affect us or those we individually represent.  We must concern ourselves in down to earth pragmatic terms with the overall effect &mdash; the cross-over effect of one area of taxation or tax relief on another, which is contained within the Finance Bill and which is, or might be, contained in existing or future legislation.</P>
      <P>The temptation to take a softly, softly approach to financial legislation is great, to introduce some reliefs and restrictions and see how they run or are digested. Such an approach would lead to more uncertainties than the financial markets could ever dream up on their own, and one has to accept that the financial world is more than prone to severe cases of the jitters, albeit among the most dreaded diseases in financial circles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the 1992 marathon Finance Bill designed to take into account the various changes which are necessary as a result of EC developments, in particular the abolition of all exchange controls from 1 January 1992.  This brings me to my first point which I would ask the Minister to consider again, either now or in the near future.  The shape and effect of the welcome adjustments to deposit interest retention tax &mdash; DIRT as it is <Col N="1440" /> known &mdash; are too severely limited to have any meaningful effect on either depositors or revenue receipts.  With a ceiling set at £50,000 for special deposits, at a reduced tax rate, the whole scheme seems set, for the most part, to be applicable only to small personal savers.  There can be no question that such encouragement to personal savings is to be applauded and, indeed, the general high level of savings to which we aspire in Ireland will no doubt see us move quickly out of the short lived depressed state of our economy.</P>
    <P>However, we should realise that many of those who might benefit from the special deposit arrangements &mdash; particularly at the lower end of the scale &mdash; will either be unaware of the scheme, unlikely to be made aware of it and not sufficiently sophisticated in matters of finance and taxation to benefit or to be affected by it; they will simply leave their savings where they are.  Those who could and would benefit by the special deposit scheme are unlikley to be attracted by it simply because the ceiling at £50,000 is too low by at the very least half.</P>
    <P>The real money &mdash; the big six figure deposits &mdash; will go overseas as they have in the past.  Even if the new regulations designed, or should I say, written, for the reporting of individuals overseas deposits plans are taken into account, the overall effect will only be to add to the grand list of unenforceable regulations.  There is every reason to look at a much higher ceiling which can bring about a twofold beneficial increase on cash deposits held in this country.</P>
    <P>We can simply make it not worth the risk of moving large deposits to offshore tax havens or overseas to more favourable tax climates and we can encourage the repatriation of funds which are currently overseas.  The Central Bank, no doubt, have fairly accurate but undisclosed estimates of the many millions of pounds this represents and how much of this is made up of deposits of up to £100,000.</P>
    <P>Ten per cent of any sizeable part of this money would make even the most cynical taxman smile.  Of course, it is not <Col N="1441" /> as simple as that.  Keeping large deposits at home is one thing, getting the accumulated deposits which nestle overseas back home from sunnier tax free areas is another.  Yet, we would like to have it back where it belongs.  In many cases those who have such holdings overseas would also like to have it here, but only if they were not about to find their funds locked in.</P>
    <P>As the proposed regulations stand, a resident repatriating or, simply bringing in, quite legitimately, accumulated funds from overseas would neither be in a position to invest these funds in Ireland nor, if he or she so wished, to move them overseas again without being caught up in complex taxation regulations.  It is a no win situation without some form of immunity, some simple tax amnesty to put all special deposits on an even footing.</P>
    <P>Tax amnesties are not popular on the face of it as they give preferential treatment to those experts in tax avoidance and those guilty of tax evasion.  However, there is often a fine and controversial line between avoidance and evasion.  The practical view we have to accept is that we can all benefit by attracting the funds, which we do not have access to now, back into the system by declaring a simple tax amnesty.  In line with the proposed strengthening of the Revenue Commissioners' powers to seek out evasion, such an amnesty would be a suitable and practical arrangement at this time.</P>
    <P>The second and equally serious point I would ask the Minister to consider again is the removal of tax concessions on loans to finance the purchase of shares in publicly quoted companies.  Clearly, the intention is not to discourage private investment in industry.  Our industries, if they are to develop and expand as we would wish, as wealth and employment generators, must be assured of maximum support from investors.  Investors must be encouraged to realise funds for investment against existing assets not held in readily available funds for the purpose of investment.  Of course it is a risk for the investor but, in the spirit of enterprise which we so desperately need in Ireland, <Col N="1442" /> risk is a necessary ingredient; enterprise needs funding.</P>
    <P>Too many of our entrepreneurs go overseas to develop their talent.  Without some encouragement to work at home this trend will continue and with the removal of investment incentives and the introduction of a single 40 per cent capital gains tax, together with a reduced tax free allowance, we may well be looking at an acceleration in the movement of wealth from our shores.</P>
    <P>The cross-over effect of the adjustment to DIRT and the removal of investment tax relief together with the capital gains adjustments, add up to a vicious circle where the saver could benefit greatly if only there were opportunities created by now departed investors or investors turned savers for him to have the necessary funds to benefit from saving.</P>
    <P>The Minister has already shown his willingness to look again at some of the proposals contained in the Finance Bill, as indeed have the Government made clear their anxiety to maximise the opportunity for free and open debate on the Finance Bill.  The Minister has given indications of a phase two Finance Bill.  We can, perhaps at either Stage, see a more equitable balance between tax revenue benefit and business incentive brought about with a minimum of damaging delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank Senator Bennett for allowing me to share her time.  There are a number of points I wish to raise in relation to tax on amusement and gaming machines.  This section is primarily concerned with the implementation and collection of the new tax of £100 on amusement machines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the advent of new technology there is now a very fine line between what constitutes an amusement machine and what constitutes a gaming machine.  In this regard there is now in operation in Dublin and other areas, a considerable number of what is known in the trade as credit poker machines.  As far as I can ascertain, these machines were manufactured and introduced to Irish arcades <Col N="1443" /> in many areas as a response by the trade to the local authorities rescinding of Part III of the 1956 Gaming and Lotteries Act. The Minister will be familiar with this because I understand it was he who proposed the relevant motion in Dublin Corporation in 1985.  He did so with the stated intention of urging the then Government to proceed with the early introduction of legislation updating the 1956 Act.  That was seven years ago and since then there has been no move by any Government to update that Act.  I mention this by way of a background illustration because the 1956 Act is still the relevant Act.  It does not define an amusement machine and neither does the current Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>The definition of a gaming machine has been the subject of many court proceedings in recent years.  The definition of the categories of machines is central to any meaningful and efficient administration of a system of taxation and more especially when a new system of taxation is being introduced, as is the case under this Bill.</P>
    <P>This brings me to my main concern, into what category does the Minister propose to place credit poker machines for the purpose of taxation under this Bill? He has two main options.  First, he can define them as amusement machines and in this category they would attract a tax of £100 per annum.  I do not see how the Minister can proceed on this basis because, as he may be aware, a Dublin District Court recently convicted a Dublin operator of credit poker machines of illegal gaming, yet the same court decided these credit poker machines were gaming machines in accordance with the definition of the 1956 Act.</P>
    <P>I am aware this decision is under appeal to the High Court and that, in the circumstances, the District Court decision can be regarded as merely provisional. Nevertheless, the successful prosecution of this case by the garda, the support of the State's legal advisers and the decision of the district justice must prevent the Minister for Finance from now defining credit poker machines as <Col N="1444" /> amusement machines.  Furthermore, if the Minister did so it would be disastrous for the Irish amusement trade and would lead to an undesirable proliferation of these machines all over the country.  I am advised on good authority that such a development would be strongly opposed by all responsible persons in the trade. Therefore, I strongly urge the Minister to ensure this does not happen.</P>
    <P>I now come to the second option.  The Minister can define credit poker machines as gaming machines.  This is what these machines really are.  This course may pose problems for the Minister and I realise the question of definitions and other related matters in relation to gaming machines is more properly the function of his colleague, the Minister for Justice.  If this is the case, I suggest that he urgently consults the Minister for Justice on the matter.</P>
    <P>There is a further option open to the Minister on this issue, namely, to ban credit poker machines entirely and many responsible people in the trade have expressed their wish in this regard to me. However the amusement trade exists and gives a substantial amount of employment. Therefore, it should continue in a controlled and well regulated environment, but to achieve this end many issues must be considered.</P>
    <P>I suggest, therefore, that the Minister consults with his colleague, the Minister for Justice, as to how these problems can best be resolved.  He may consider the time is ripe to set up a committee mechanism, with some limited representation from outside the public service, to advise him as to the best way forward.  I believe this course would be most essential.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to the Minister and congratulate him on the establishment of the jobs forum because that is an important development at present. However, I would ask him to amend the regulation whereby a person must have been on the live register for a year before being assisted in setting up a business.  I have always mentioned that I would never draw the dole and I never did, but my first job was as a temporary postman and I lost it because I was not on the live <Col N="1445" /> register; because I was not on the dole I could not hold a job of temporary postman. The same applies today.  I have seen many firms close down and some of the people in those organisations who wanted to revamp them or, alternatively, set up smaller units on their own, were precluded from doing so because they would not get assistance unless the people involved were on the live register for at least six months.  This is regrettable because within that six months the trade goes elsewhere and the business is dead. The Minister should reconsider this matter and take into account all unemployed people, regardless of whether they are on the live register because for many it is anathema to draw dole and will not do so or be part of that system.  They may be living a poor miserable life but they put their principle and pride first. Those people cannot be assisted in starting up a business because they are not on the dole.  If a firm closes and some members of the firm wish to start an alternative business in order to salvage some of the custom, they should not be denied an opportunity to do so.  I would welcome a move in that direction.</P>

      <P>Recently, the Minister has been criticised by the media for making certain changes to the Finance Bill following mature consideration of representations made to him, but I do not share that criticism.  In fact, in the few changes of which I am aware, I believe it was a mark of courage on the part of the Minister to realise that, perhaps, there are better ways of achieving certain objectives.  I welcome one change and I do not mind paying a compliment to the Minister in this regard.  As I was nominated to the House by the licensed trade, I appreciate the fact that the Minister recognised there was a better way of dealing with the increased charges relating to the renewal of publicans licences.</P>
      <P>The proposals in the budget caused serious concern in the licensed trade and representations were made to the Minister in this regard.  However, certain changes can still be made and one is in relation to the proposed table of tiers in the Finance Bill.  The Minister should include an additional tier in the bracket between £300,000 and £500,000 turnover. I ask the Minister to make that change.</P>
      <P>Many people regard the licensed trade as a source of finance.  That is a serious misconception.  The people who hold this viewpoint judge the trade by the top 5 per cent.  I would like to put on the record a synopsis of an investigation carried out by a reputable firm of accountants and management consultants, Stokes, Kennedy and Crowley.  They made a number of points as a result of a full investigation into the viability of the licensed trade throughout Ireland.  They stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When wages are charged to the accounts for the publican and/or his family, 43 per cent of Vintners would <Col N="1447" /> show a loss in 1989 and 25 per cent would break even.</P>
    <P>When wages are charged to the accounts, Vintners with a turnover of less than £195,000 display consistent losses.</P>
    <P>There is a significant and increasing reliance on food sales to maintain overall Vintner profitability.</P>
    <P>Over the period 1986-89, drink turnover decreased in real terms by 2 per cent while overall costs increased by 6.3 per cent.</P>
    <P>Average trading hours have increased from 82 hours in 1985 to 88 hours in 1989.</P>
    <P>From 1982 to 1989, Vintner turnover declined steadily in real terms by 14.7 per cent while individual personal consumption on goods and services has increased by 14 per cent.</P>
    <P>Drink volume and value declined by 30 per cent and 12 per cent respectively over the period 1979-89.</P>
    <P>The volume of business in rural areas has declined steadily.  Demographic trends underline the need to rationalise the over-supply of rural pubs.</P>
    <P>Those are important points to bear in mind when judging the licensed trade.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister explain why the same scale of licensing renewals is not being applied to registered clubs given that they enjoy many distinct advantages over pubs?  Registered clubs are in direct competition with pubs, they do the same business, but clubs benefit from grants and other financial assistance not available to pubs.  Clubs trade long after the legal closing time and many are not registered for VAT and other taxes.  If the Minister is seeking equality in the licensed trade, I suggest he consider applying equal costs to registered clubs.</P>
    <P>In regard to the requirement that all clearance tax certificates must be produced by September next for the purpose of renewing a licence, I would remind the Minister that there are only a few months left and many publicans may not be able to meet the deadline.  What is the position with regard to what are known as inpocket <Col N="1448" /> licences?  Will such licences be renewed for those who have retired and are no longer in the trade but who renew their licences each year because it appreciates in value?  The Minister should consider a lead-in period of one or two years in regard to the production of tax clearance certificates.</P>
    <P>In regard to the additional powers given to the Revenue Commissioners, I want to refer to Revenue audits, the failure of certain Revenue inspectors to observe the Charter of Rights and a recent document issued by the Revenue Commissioners.  I accept the Minister's point in relation to tax evasion, business scandals and so on and I have no serious objection to the Minister providing Revenue with additional powers.  However, if these powers are being provided, the Minister should insert a clause as a safeguard against abuse of this power or victimisation of compliant taxpayers.  I would like to see-safeguards in place which give a statutory base and a force of law to the Charter of Rights.  I invite the Minister to confirm that is his intention and if it will be of assistance, I propose to put down a recommendation to that effect.</P>
    <P>Revenue audits have been in practice for two years and the pattern that is emerging in the treatment of the small family owned business has give rise to disturbing results.  Surveys of small family businesses carried out by trade organisations reveal a consistent pattern of behaviour by some Revenue auditors, which falls into two brackets.  If the business is large enough to employ a professional accountant and transactions are computerised, Revenue auditors are seen to behave in a professional manner. Investigations and inquiries are being conducted by professional people and few complaints come from people at the level of business.  However, there are a large number of complaints from smaller business people who cannot afford the services of a full-time qualified accountant, whose transactions are not computerised, where members of the family are doing the books on a part-time basis and where the maintenance of records <Col N="1449" /> and documents may not be as efficient as they might be, particularly if they are going back over a period of years.  Surveys carried out by trade organisations in relations to Revenue audits of small business people have shown a disturbing attitude by some Revenue staff.  The Charter of Rights is being ignored and the presumption of honesty, which is the first requirement of the Charter of Rights, is being replaced by a presumption of dishonesty.</P>
    <P>The Charter of Rights was published by the Revenue Commissioners a few years ago and they emphasised its purpose. The charter stated that the &ldquo;objective of the Revenue Commissioners is to collect taxes, duties and other charges placed under our care and management in an efficient way and at the least possible cost to the public.  This objective is to be achieved in a manner which fosters the highest degree of public confidence in our integrity, efficiency and fairness and encourages voluntary compliance with our Revenue law and deters evasion and avoidance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The first item in the Charter of Rights states that there must be courtesy and consideration on the part of Revenue staff.  The presumption of honesty is that a person has dealt with tax affairs honestly unless there is reason to believe to the contrary, and subject to the Revenue Commissioners' responsibility to ensure compliance with the law.  In relation to information, it says that every reasonable effort will be made to give access to full, accurate and timely information about Revenue law and entitlements and obligations under it.  Revenue Commissioners staff are entitled to expect to get the full facts and co-operation.</P>
    <P>There is more than that in the charter. In view of the additional powers being given to the Revenue Commissioners, there is a growing belief &mdash; which is one I share &mdash; that there is a need to include safeguards to protect the honest, hardworking compliant taxpayer.  The first step the Minister should take is to ensure that these safeguards are put in place and <Col N="1450" /> to give this charter the force of law.  I invite him to do this, as part of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have admitted that many of their auditors are trained in interrogation techniques. These techniques can be used with devastating effect on vulnerable, honest, hardworking business people.  Surveys have shown that after a friendly first meeting the attitude of the inspector changes.  Accusations of dishonesty and concealment of income begin to flow.  If requests for supporting documentation going back over a number of years cannot be complied with, the family and business in question are advised that they are in conflict with the law, that they may face subsantial fines and imprisonment, that their only hope is to admit false accounting and deliberate concealment of income and to seek a settlement with the Revenue Commissioners.  Major assessments are carried out when accounts are set aside and substantial settlement figures are imposed.</P>
    <P>I have no sympathy whatsoever with tax dodgers but I believe that if evasion can be established with sufficient proof, then those responsible should be brought to court and face the full rigours of the law, rather than having a situation develop &mdash; as unfortunately these surveys would appear to indicate &mdash; where honest, hardworking people, who, because their knowledge of keeping accounts to the standard required is probably insufficient, are harassed and intimidated into making settlements which, perhaps, are not due.  What the Minister is then receiving is extortion money.  Perhaps that is emotive and strong language but I intend to quote some examples of what has happened to business families as a result of their experience of business audits which justifies the terminology I am using.</P>
    <P>Reports of small family business people who have had Revenue audits show that the objective of setting aside accounts and finding the means as quickly as possible to do it because an objective at an early stage.  It continues until that result is achieved.  The vast majority of family business people are honest and <Col N="1451" /> proud people who regard their own integrity and standing in the community as being of great importance.  Many of them are stretched to make ends meet in a difficult economic climate.  Pressures on small businesses are many and growing. Unfortunately, they are vulnerable and easy prey for the interrogation techniques that are definitely required to break the hardened and professional operator and tax cheat.  Appalling and disturbing consequences for some families are emerging from this exercise.  It is no pleasure for me to give some examples to the House.</P>
    <P>The first example has a certain element of lightness about it.  It concerns a publican to whom I was speaking quite recently.  Fortunately for this man, he had served as an officer in the United States Marines in Vietnam.  Part of his training concentrated on preparing him to deal with interrogation by the Vietcong, should he be taken prisoner.  He told me after his Revenue audit that were it not for that training he would clearly have been broken.  I believe what he told me.  I will give a few other examples.</P>
    <P>A couple I know bought a pub a few years ago.  The wife kept the books.  They worked hard to have this business succeed. A Revenue audit took place.  The interrogation techniques that I referred to were used.  The husband and wife were interviewed in separate rooms with similar list of questions.  They were then brought together and challenged about any inconsistencies in their replies.  This went on for a number of days.  The wife felt responsible because she kept the books.  She had a nervous breakdown followed by a miscarriage, and is now under continuous medical care.  Their business failed and it is now sold.  The achievement by the Revenue Commissioner officials in that case is a broken family and a broken business.  The tragedy, of course, is that at the end of the day no irregularities were proved or found.  These cases are on record and will be presented to the Minister very shortly.</P>
    <P>The second case to which I refer concerns another family business.  A young <Col N="1452" /> family were left fatherless in the most tragic circumstances because of the pressures created by a Revenue audit.  Again, no irregularities were discovered at the end of the day.  I am personally aware of a girl in her late twenties whose father is now in a wheelchair as a result of a stroke he got two years ago.  She took over the running of the business with her mother. Two members of the family are employed in the business, and there are three part-time employees.  She was due for a Revenue audit a few weeks ago.  The night before the audit her mother took seriously ill and at 10 o'clock on the following morning the mother was in an operating theatre in the local general hospital.  The girl waited for the Revenue inspector to call.  She explained her dilemma and asked him to put back the audit for a week.  He agreed, but then inquired as to whether her mother was in a public or private ward.  The techniques was already being applied.  I have spoken to that girl since.  She had heard of the experience of Revenue audits.  She has worked hard to keep the family business together.  She is in no position to go through with this exercise and I am satisfied that when she fails to produce the first linking document she will collapse and beg for a settlement.</P>
    <P>When the techniques required to break hardened tax thieves are relentlessly used on vulnerable people, further tragedies will inevitably affect more families.  It is essential that, where necessary ordinary decent, honest people are protected from the tactics I have referred to.  The Charter of Rights is now necessary.  We have a duty as legislators to protect the rights of the ordinary law-abiding citizens against abuse or ill-treatment by any arm of the State.  We do that effectively where, for example, oppression or alleged oppression by the Garda is concerned.  A few days ago a judge released a murder suspect because, he claimed, there has been oppressive questioning.</P>

      <P>We have often discussed here, after the event and after we should have done our duty, the presence of a heavy gang in the Garda and in the police force in Britain.  That gave us the Nicky Kelly episode.  It gave us the Birmingham Six.  It gave us the Judith Ward case.  As legislators, we stand condemned for our failure to nip in the bud the activities of the so-called heavy gang.  We failed to do so.  We had the knowledge but, unfortunately, we also had the cowardice. What I am saying quite bluntly is that if the nucleus of another heavy gang is emerging within the ranks of another arm of the State and applying the same techniques and the same pressures that broke the likes of Nicky Kelly, then we have a legal duty to act in order to ensure that such tactics will never again be used by an arm of the State against any of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Revenue needs extra powers, then I am in favour of giving them.  If they need extra powers to break the professional tax cheats and those who avoid their responsibilities to the State, I am in favour of giving these powers.  In my own experience of dealing with the Revenue in relation to VAT audits I could not complain in relation to the treatment I received or with the approach of the people concerned who were dealing with me but, unfortunately, the pattern emerging from the surveys I have referred to clearly indicate there is a growth of unacceptable practices against genuine honest traders and business people.  Therefore I propose that the Charter of Rights be given legal effect in the Finance Bill.  There are people in the Revenue Commissioners who would welcome its inclusion.  Their own words in preparing and producing it indicated they wanted to be perceived as dealing honestly and fairly with the public.  They wanted respect for their institution and I want to see that also.  I do not want to be misunderstood as advocating that whatever powers are genuinely required should not be provided.  I am in favour of that, but I believe it is necessary to include the safeguards to protect the people I am talking about and who have <Col N="1454" /> been vulnerable in the circumstances I have outlined.</P>
    <P>The complaints I have referred to are widespread and well documented.  It is time to face up to this.  It is probably not a very popular thing to do, but nonetheless I believe I have an obligation to do so.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by reverting to what I referred at the beginning of my contribution. The Minister left us for a short time but I am sure he has been given a note of certain matters I raised.  I did, of course, compliment him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>There were a couple of queries I addressed.  In case there might be any misunderstanding in the course of their transmission, I would like to repeat them.  I referred to my belief that the same licensing regime and costs should apply to registered clubs as apply to pubs. I made the point that clubs are in direct competition with pubs.  They enjoy certain advantages which pubs do not in so far as they receive grants and other financial services.  I also made the point that clubs rather than pubs trade long after the legal closing time for pubs. Many are not registered for VAT and for other taxes.  If we are to have a level playing pitch and equality for everybody, let us all operate on the same level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also mentioned the requirement for a tax clearance certificate and I referred to the fact that many rural pubs would be below the VAT threshold.  Therefore, in the few months between now and September, they may have difficulty in getting the tax clearance certificate due to the fact that they are below the VAT threshold.  I also want to know what is the position in regard to what are known as the inpocket licences.  This refers to people who no longer trade and who have retired.  They renew their licence each year because a licence has an asset value. They are not trading so they are not going to have a tax clearance certificate.  Are <Col N="1455" /> such licences, therefore, non-renewable? Are they going to lapse?</P>
    <P>I spent a long time on the matter of the Revenue audits and the need to balance these with giving effect in law to the Charter of Rights.  I look forward to the Minister's response.  Perhaps there are others who either share or disagree with my view.  Surveys now being conducted will reveal a most disturbing trend and, as legislators, we should deal with this situation before it develops to the point many of us would regret.  My concern is solely for the honest, hardworking small business person who has not the resources to employ a full-time accountant or to computerise his business.  Such people seem to be getting a raw deal, from the evidence that is emerging from these surveys.</P>
    <P>I was glad to have the opportunity to speak on this debate.  I had other matters to raise in regard to employment opportunities, the withdrawal of certain encouragements which I believe a workforce should always receive if you are to get productivity and so on.  However, I have not the time to deal with these matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has done an excellent job in the proposals which he has put before us in attempting to bring financial rectitude into the taxation system.  I agree with every word said in terms of the increased powers of the Revenue Commissioners.  Basically, what has happened over the past number of years is that the powers of the Oireachtas have been taken away and have been given <i>de facto</i> to the Revenue Commissioners.  In each Finance Bill in the past 20 years, the Revenue Commissioners have been given increased powers which cannot be given back to the Oireachtas.  Members of the Oireachtas can get up here and rail against various elements of the Finance Bill, but when the Bill is passed the Revenue Commissioners get increased powers each time.  In this Bill again, the Revenue Commissioners are given powers which supersede the powers of <Col N="1456" /> the Oireachtas.  This annoys me considerably.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have powers with are over and above the powers of the Minister for Finance.  That should not be the case.  They should be a secondary element in developing a collection system of taxation.  When the Government make a decision, they should have control over the decisions made.  They should not give over the control to the Revenue Commissioners. By giving over control to the commissioners, the matter goes into the courts and the Oireachtas becomes totally irrelevant as far as revenue collection is concerned.</P>
      <P>I have been in business since 1957 and, thankfully, I have been able to stay in business since then.  There are very few people in my line of business who have successfully stayed there.  Revenue factors have been most significant in the elimination of businesses in this country.</P>
      <P>Mention was made by other Senators about the problems associated with the collection of revenue from publicans. There are major problems in that area. It has to be said that the Revenue Commissioners do not employ the same business methods as those employed by any other employer in Ireland, or even worldwide. The Government, unfortunately, have allowed the Revenue Commissioners to employ what they call Revenue sheriffs, a small group who are in the multi-millionaire class.  I have not seen a Revenue check on any sheriff in any county.  These people are solicitors who generally employ retired gardaí to harass traders not alone for taxes that have not been paid but for the interest on late payment that might have been due and, in many cases, for collection fees.  There are heavy gangs going around the country.  They are in Ennis, Kilkenny and in other places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These ex-gardaí enter premises.  They came into my premises for £27, a collection fee.  When the three lads came in, the girl in my office started crying because she did not know what was happening. They had been in the supermarket next door but the owner was not there.  They <Col N="1457" /> went into a restaurant at lunchtime and the owner told them to take a stool.  He was busy.  They were not in collecting taxes.  They were collecting the fees that were due to the sheriff.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners should have the same collection policy as any other business.  The policy should be that when one owes money one pays it.  I suggest that instead of having selected Revenue sheriffs in selected counties, who are making millions of pounds out of the system, there should be a Revenue collection system in each town.  The person in charge should deal with the collection of taxes just as any businessman deals with the collection of taxes. The Revenue officer could, at the end of the month tell the businessman he owes so much and it must be paid.  If I am owed money I try to collect it.  Why should the taxman not collect his own money?  If that were done tax sheriffs in Carlow, Waterford, Dundalk and Dublin would not have multi-million pounds deposit accounts.  They do not send the money to the revenue until the total tax bill is paid. They are milking the system.</P>
    <P>I do not mind anybody coming into my business to check whether I owe tax.  My books show exactly what I owe but some people have been unduly harassed by people who have no connection with the tax system.  They are employed by tax sheriffs.  I would like audits on the tax sheriffs and those who work for them. There is a major problem there.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that people can evade paying taxes which are due but the same method of collection should be used in all cases.  I have seen businesses fail because of non-compliance with tax payments. That is fair enough, but business people should not be put to the pin of their collars by tax collectors employed by the Government who do not know what business is about in the first place.</P>
    <P>Benefit-in-kind and taxation are thorny subjects.  I suggest that the policy of the Government and of the Revenue Commissioners in terms of benefit-in-kind should be addressed.  There is not a single member of the Revenue Commissioners who has a car does not charge <Col N="1458" /> for that car if he travels on Revenue Commission business.  He gets paid 73p for every mile he drives.  Why should the same concession not be given to a commercial traveller who is travelling on business?  If benefit-in-kind is charged against a commercial traveller, such benefit-in-kind should be charged against every civil servant who claims 73p a mile for the use of his own car.  He does not pay benefit-in-kind because he buys his own car and charges mileage against the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I could reverse the situation and suggest that everybody who is in business should buy his own car and charge the Revenue Commissioners a stated mileage allowance against his tax, which is the proper way to deal with it.  I have heard civil servants in the Minister's Department ask why should these people be allowed a car allowance when they can get on the DART from Dún Laoghaire into Dublin.  If you are in Mullinahone there is no DART to Kilkenny or Clonmel. I am suggesting that instead of charging benefit-in-kind there should be the same allowance for a businessman travelling as for the civil servants.  They have allowed themselves &mdash; and continue to allow themselves &mdash; payment for travelling. Let us be straight about it.  The civil servants who allow themselves 73p or 74p a mile are the very people who are creating the Finance Bill stipulations over the years.</P>
    <P>There is a very dangerous situation in section 239 of the Bill which will have to be addressed.  Under section 239 where an inspector of taxes is not satisfied with the return of income submitted, the inspector may serve notice on the person concerned that a statement of assets is required by way of check on the accuracy of the return.  That would mean that if I bought a bullock for a £100 today, and the market value of that bullock was £1,000 the Revenue sheriff will assess me on a statement of assets rather than a statement of income.  That is the most dangerous section I have ever read.  It means that any Revenue person can come into any person's home and get an auditor, an accountant, or somebody <Col N="1459" /> involved in business, to assess the assets in the house and then make a judgment about taxing the assets rather than a return of income.  That is horrendous.</P>
    <P>Who is going to decide the value of an asset?  This means that every auctioneer and valuer in the country will have a field day because they may be called in to assess my assets, and the Revenue Commissioners will give their figure.  That is horrendous in its implication.  I would like the Minister to address himself to that.  I can see the reason for a return of income &mdash; I presume this is what you earn in a year.  It does not relate to the asset value of what is in your business or your home.  This is very different from anything that has been included prior to this in any Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>None of us could condone the unlawful use of the taxation system but I have to agree with Senator Howard that once a small business gets into the tax system they are harassed and hounded.  We had earlier this year a statement from the tax authorities that 90 per cent of the tax which could not be collected was due to the fact that the people had either left the State or they could not be contacted. This gave the impression that as a small businessman I am paying extra taxes because people have come into the country and have left it without paying their taxes.  Their tax is written off.  If I have a tax charged against me it continues on and on.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a job to do.  I would like to ask him whether he would consider giving a tax amnesty to young people going in to the taxation system for the first time.  Instead of charging as happens at present, the top rate of tax why not give them a total tax amnesty for the first two to three years they start working.  As young people, the likelihood would be that they would spend everything they get.  Their take-home pay would be doubled because they would not have to pay tax.  They would be paying tax in the VAT section; they would be paying tax because the things they would buy, generally speaking, <Col N="1460" /> would be taxed very high.  If they did not spend the money they would be able to hold it and they would probably put it into a bank or post office.  The post office happens to be the best investment anyone can have in Ireland and the return in free of tax under DIRT.  After five years you double your income so maybe these people might put their investments into a DIRT tax-free investment.</P>
    <P>People on the live register have the advantage of free phone, free fuel, free shoes and other concessions.  If somebody comes off the live register they should get a tax advantage for the few months after they go back into the workforce. They should see that when they go back into the workforce there is an actual benefit in working.  After a while they could be eased back into the tax network. One of the major problems we have in Ireland is that many businesses cannot pay the rates that are needed to keep people above the level they can get on social welfare.  It is not the actual amount of money but the subsidiary benefits that are important.  I suggest to the Government that if they want to increase the number of people working those coming off the live register should not be deprived of certain benefits on coming back into the workforce.</P>
    <P>The Government's overall strategy has been excellent but, as a businessman, there is no way I can continue to employ people when I have to pay the taxation involved in employing them and the tax in continuing to employ them.  We do not take on apprentices any more because that is no longer viable.  There are literally no apprentices in the motor trade or in the building trade.  If the economy took off in the morning there would not be enough technically qualified people to take up the jobs that might become available and we would have to bring back people from abroad which is a positive thing.</P>
    <P>There has to be some incentive to small businesses to increase the number of people they employ.  There has been some aid to people taking on extra employees over the past 12 months but anybody who has been in business for a <Col N="1461" /> long time knows these short term measures do not create jobs.  The FÁS courses have to produce long term jobs but they are not producing them at present.  The Minister must look at FÁS and say to them: &ldquo;You have 20,000 people on X number of courses.  Where are the jobs coming from?&rdquo; Are these courses an extension of education or an extension of unemployment benefit?</P>
    <P>I would like to get a response to the suggestion of a tax-free PAYE base for people going into the workforce.  I would like a response to the suggestion that such people should not be in the situation that they would get more money and benefits on the live register than they would receive at work.  I say again specifically that anyone who is employed as a commercial traveller should receive the same terms of taxation in regard to their cars as civil servants receive.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister whom I am very glad to see in this sensitive and important Department and I congratulate him on his previous career when he was a very fine Minister for Labour.  I have some matters to raise to which I hope the Minister will be able to give some consideration and then I will engage in a little generalised comment which I hope will not be too waffling.  I will keep it to a minimum because I am not an expert on the economy.  Very often economic matters are dealt with in a jargon that is impenetrable to the ordinary person and that includes me in this instance.  I do not presume to travel into areas where I have no competence whatsoever although I have a very good instinct and I explored this before on a Finance Bill with two of the Minister's predecessors.  When Mr. McSharry was Minister for Finance there was a question of giving some tax incentives for the redevelopment of our heritage in the inner city and Mr. McSharry very courteously allowed me to meet officials of the Department of Finance and they wiped the floor with me.  They proved I was wrong but I knew I was right.  I said: &ldquo;They have proved I am wrong but I still know I am right.  Can I go and bring back <Col N="1462" /> some official assistance?&rdquo;.  I brought in the distinguished economist, Paul Tansey.  He worked on a paper with me, I presented it and ultimately Deputy Reynolds, now Taoiseach, introduced some of the suggestions I made.  This was to do with giving some degree of tax break, in very limited circumstances, to people in the inner city who restore houses of architectural, cultural or scientific merit within a rather wide framework. We managed to demonstrate that the existing tax provisions vitiated the situation because of the cubic space requirements for getting grants, they actually required the destruction of one of the most significant features of 18th century houses, and that is the wonderful proportions, the wonderful shapes.  So, in order to get a grant one had to produce rooms of a certain size, and these were rather small and pokey, and destroyed the Georgian impact.</P>
      <P>We managed to get some incentives. There was tax relief granted.  The conditions were that they had to be listed buildings of architectural merit, they had to be within the designated areas and so on.  I would like the Minister to inquire about the take up of that scheme.  My information is that at most two, and probably only one person has managed to benefit from this scheme.  Could there be a review of this scheme?  It is very narrow indeed.  It only hits places like Mountjoy Square, North Great Georges Street and Henrietta Street.  There are fewer than 300 or 400 houses involved, and it is very important that this ever diminishing stock of our heritage should be encouraged by taxation measures where possible.  Since I raised this last year on the Finance Bill, a number of people &mdash; one of them well known to the Minister &mdash; contacted me with an intention of buying a house in this area with his wife but when their accountant examined the tax provisions they found them so unsuitable that, instead, they went to Temple Bar and bought there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like an opportunity to have a discussion with the Minister's officials to explore the possibility of increasing this tax provision, although I believe that tax <Col N="1463" /> incentives alone are not sufficient.  One really needs a direct grant, a direct cash allocation to people who take up the challenge of restoring these houses.  There is an economic benefit to the State in terms of culture and tourism, there is no doubt about that.  That is an argument I will be happy to make to the officials.</P>
    <P>I regret not being here for the Temple Bar Bill; I was lecturing abroad when this Bill went through.  It is a matter in which I take a considerable interest because I took a lease on a building there in 1978, the Hirschfeld Centre, the Gay Community Centre, which was subsequently burned down.  It had a considerable impact on limiting the spread of the AIDS infection in the city.  The Minister knows the cost of maintaining somebody with AIDS &mdash; £25,000 a year.  If you prevent two people from getting AIDS there is a saving to the State of £50,000. We did get an allocation of £50,000, a theoretic one from Dublin Corporation but that was junked.</P>
    <P>I was interested to see an increase in the allocation to voluntary organisations. It is a pity the group that started and spearheaded the very important revitalisation of the Temple Bar area have received no assistance whatever, in fact have been impeded in their work by their honour and integrity, because I made sure that a proper limited company was established in order to do this important work, and then made sure we paid all our taxes, all our PRSI, all our VAT, the whole works.  We paid something like £135,000 in tax over the years.  None of us took any money from it and then I found &mdash; and the Minister will be aware of this problem &mdash; that not only was I working for nothing, not only had I invested my own funds, not only were we denied any form of State assistance but I was actually penalised for not making a profit.  I thought that was rather odd.  We got this demand from revenue saying we were being surcharged for non-distribution of profit.  I asked an accountant about it.  He explained that family firms sometimes put back profit into the business which increases the value of the <Col N="1464" /> asset, and this is non-taxable.  I understand that but particularly with organisations constructed in the way this group is and, which has done such valuable work, there should be some degree of flexibility, particularly when we appear to be completely excluded from any form of grant.</P>
    <P>However, that is my own little hobby horse and I will hop off it and get on to another one, and this is one where the Minister could be of assistance to me.  I raised this issue briefly on the Appropriation Bill.  I was contacted by an academic colleague who pointed out an anomaly in the tax legislation.  I have not put it down as a recommendation because we could recommend until we are blue in the face, but if the Minister thought it worthwhile he might examine this and introduce an amendment himself.  This deals with the double taxation agreements between this country and the United States of America, Australia and other countries which were entered into so that we could have the advantage of the academic wisdom and teaching skills of university personnel from the United States, Australia and so on.  This double taxation agreement came into existence as a gesture of goodwill by the Government towards universities and in order to foster this kind of intellectual exchange.</P>
    <P>However, because changes in the tax code, and particularly in terms of PRSI, have superseded the agreement &mdash; there have been subsequent developments in terms of PRSI &mdash; the effect has actually been negated.  The agreements were made in the days before pay related social insurance reductions applied to this class of people.  Consequently the exemption that was entered into by the Government on foot of the double taxation agreement did not include any reference to PRSI. I believe this was an oversight and the Minister might be able to introduce some slight change in order to rectify the situation because, as a result of this oversight, a visiting professor receives a salary without deduction of tax but is obliged to pay, himself or herself, 7.5 per cent of the salary as PRSI and the host university has to pay 12.5 per cent as the employer's <Col N="1465" /> responsibility.  There you have a tax yield to the State of 20 per cent where the Government's clear intention was not to reap any tax benefit from the existence of this exchange programme.</P>
    <P>I will move on to some general observations. The first one may strike the House and you, a Cathaoirligh, as a little unusual.  I would like to applaud the work of the Roman Catholic clergy.  They are often excoriated for talking too much about sex &mdash; in my opinion they do and they do not really talk very much sense about it either &mdash; but they talk a great deal of sense about poverty and they often complain that they are not given credit for their excellent contributions, their well researched documents and their wise statements on the nature of poverty.  I would like this afternoon to give them credit for a real concern in this area which is not often highlighted.  I have received from the Conference of Major Religious Superiors a copy of their response to the 1992 budget called &ldquo;A Question of Choices&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am confining myself but this is a reaction to the budget which the Finance Bill implements.  I want to talk about the specific intention behind the Finance Bill.  I am sure you will call me back to order when I get outside it.  I think I am entitled at this stage to lay down general parameters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem with both the budget and the Finance Bill is that as they are examined by, among others, the Conference of Major Religious Superiors, they do not sufficiently recognise or attempt to tackle and counter the growing divisions in Irish society between the poor on the <Col N="1466" /> one hand and the stronger on the other because there are choices involved; choices between the rights of the poor and the underprivileged on the one hand and the rights of people like ourselves who already have a sufficient income.</P>
    <P>In the Finance Bill, certain choices are clearly articulated.  It is decided that certain groups will be favoured, encouraged and fostered and others will not be so favoured, encouraged and fostered.  I would like to quote, if I may, since you are requiring me to be technical and point out the kind of worry I have.  I realise the very difficult problems the Minister has in attempting to balance the books and to deal with the various deficits that exist. If you look back over the period which has led to this Finance Bill you will see what kind of choices are being made.  For example, there is the decline in social expenditure as a percentage of gross national product.  If you look, for example, from 1986 until 1992, which is a comparatively short period of time, there has been a consistent decline in expenditure on social welfare although the number of unemployed people has risen by 13.4 per cent.</P>
    <P>I will put on the record of the House rather interesting statistics &mdash; in 1986 expenditure on all social services as a percentage of GNP was 29.2 per cent; expenditure on social welfare as a percentage of GNP was 14.9 per cent, the total number of people unemployed was 250,200 and tax as a percentage of gross national product was 36.9 per cent.  In 1992 the estimated expenditure on all social services as a percentage of gross national product was 26.9 per cent.  In other words, it had gone down by over 2 per cent in this year.  Expenditure on social welfare had gone down from 14.9 per cent to 13.8 per cent although the total number of unemployed people was estimated at 283,800.  In other words, the provisions of the Finance Bill appear not to take into account sufficiently the increasing number of people who are unemployed in terms of the distribution or the redistribution of wealth to the most disadvantaged sections of the community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1467" /> I am aware that the Conference of Major Religious Superiors made certain recommendations and some of them may perhaps have been met but there are others that have not and perhaps the Minister might look again at them.  They have, for example, welcomed the increased allocation to the Combat Poverty Agency, the community development programme for voluntary organisations.  Although they welcome this, one of the ironic aspects, and the Minister must appreciate fully the irony, having increased the allocation to groups such as the Combat Poverty Agency, the magazine <i>Poverty Today</i> leads off in April 1992 with an editorial which contains this paragraph which I would like to put on the record.  I am not inciting the Minister to shut down the Combat Poverty Agency but this is what they say:</P>
    <P>It can scarcely be a coincidence that Ireland has, by EC standards, both exceptionally high levels of unemployment and an unusual degree of inequality in the distribution of income, wealth, educational opportunities and access to key services such as health, legal, arts and recreational services.  In addition to being a major factor in widespread poverty, the debilitating effect on this very unequal society is to undermine personal development and initiative and to limit social mobility.  In these circumstances implementing the commitments in <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to radical structural reform, greater social rights and increasing social equity take on a special urgency and should be given a high priority in any programme to address unemployment and build long term economic growth.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that in a paragraph like that is contained a criticism of Government strategy because they have not significantly addressed the inequalities or used the Finance Bill to articulate policies that would significantly redistribute wealth to the least advantaged section of society.</P>

      <P>Do you really?  Perhaps you could inform me subsequently.  Whoever they were they did a very good job in my opinion although they were in certain instances critical.  I am not going into length on this because I am not an expert and the Minister has access to all these documents.  They seem to me to make an argument with regard to matters that could perhaps be addressed in a future Finance Bill, if not in this one, for example, as child poverty and poverty traps.  They made the point that 40 per cent of children live in households with incomes below what is required to maintain minimally adequate standards of living, that this should be a concern in financial terms and that an independent inquiry report which was prepared by the Combat Poverty Agency and published recently outlined the implications for Government policy and what could be done about it.  They made it clear, for example, that a positive budgetary response to child poverty would be to raise child benefits substantially and then subject them to income tax.  That sounds a strange argument to come from people on this side of the social equation which would be rather left-wing but I believe that argument is sustainable.  If you raise the amount sufficiently and then subject it to income tax then you manage to cut out elements of the poverty trap.  This would mean the child benefit cost could be raised by substantial amounts; let the Minister consider the political benefits of giving an increase of 40 per cent in child benefit and then subjecting it to tax.  For <Col N="1469" /> an annual cost of £20 million child benefit could be raised by 50 per cent and most people would not suffer in terms of coming in a serious way into the income tax net; in fact, most people would gain.</P>
      <P>There are a number of major suggestions here which the Minister could very usefully take on board and some on unemployment.  &ldquo;Dole&rdquo; is a horrible word.  It suggests doling things out to people.  Nobody likes to have things doled out.</P>

      <P>It has rather unpleasant connotations because it suggests passivity and Victorian gratitude on the part of the recipient.  Is it not possible where people have skills which could be applied for the benefit of the community, to offer them the opportunity of some slightly increased dole if they can be employed on public work schemes of some kind.  I would like the Minister to look into the possibility of this kind of approach to the unemployment situation.  It is very demeaning for people to be unemployed, particularly if they have skills, trades or professions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to poverty traps, the Minister knows better than I that what can happen is the gross income increases and then you get into a higher level of tax and your actual take-home pay either remains static or is reduced.  I have spoken on this before in the House with some considerable feeling as this actually occurred to me in Trinity.  On one occasion when I received an increase in my salary nothing happened in my wage cheque and I was rather surprised.  I thought there was a mistake.  I wrote to them and said there must be some mistake because I got an increase but my salary cheque remained <Col N="1470" /> the same.  They said that because I have entered a higher tax net my income should have diminished by a small amount of about 35 shillings because what I received in fact was a negative increment.  I wrote back and said I am glad to say I know nothing whatever about either mathematics or accounting but there is no such animal as a negative increment.  What you are talking about is an excrement and I do not want it, you can have it back.  That was just my little linguistic joke.</P>
    <P>I am glad that mortgage interest relief was not touched; it would have been a mistake to interfere with it.  I am also glad that, at least for some time, some of the inner city reliefs survived.  The Minister will be aware that in North Great George's Street for example, after a lot of hesitation the provisions of the various budgetary reliefs as articulated in various Finance Bills have at last incited a builder to commence work, very hesitantly, and the entire scheme was sold out in the first day.  Anything that can contribute to a reflation of the building industry is good for the economy.</P>
    <P>I view with some angst the reduction of the threshold for residential property tax from £96,000 to £90,000 and the reduction of the income threshold from £28,500 to £27,500, and my reason for doing so is personal.  I live in a house which some people would be foolish to value at perhaps, around that amount; and my income, because I teach in Trinity and I am lucky enough to share these august halls with the Minister, the Cathaoirleach and my fellow Senators, would be over that amount.  I wonder if this is justified in all cases.  Again, I would like to make a special argument, and I am returning to some of the material I addressed at the beginning when I was talking about tax provisions for the inner city.  I suppose it is unrealistic to suggest that the Department of Finance should look at the possibility of exempting what could be described as heritage houses completely from the residential property tax.  It seems absurd that you get people like myself coming into a derelict area of the north inner city, spending enormous <Col N="1471" /> amounts of money refurbishing the house, with no direct cash grants, with an unworkable system of tax incentives, which only one person so far has taken up, and then almost like the 19th century when Charles Gavan Duffy and James Fintan Lawlor were working for the three Fs &mdash; fair rent, fixity of tenure &mdash; what was the other one?</P>

      <P>Thank you very much, Minister, for reminding me.  I had forgotten one leg of that triad.  I think one of the things they were very much against was rack-renting, because they objected when the Irish people had improved themselves, for every improvement they made by the sweat of their brow and their toil, they were hit with an additional tax. In terms of heritage houses that is exactly what happens.  You move into what is effectively a slum, you sweat and labour and spend your own already heavily taxed money, and then find there is a gentrification process going on, and by your own efforts you place your house in the tax net.  This means you are penalised rather than rewarded for improving not only your own accommodation but also the cultural heritage of the country.  I appeal to the Minister to think about that, as I have already appealed to him to consider increasing the tax provisions for these houses and the possibility of introducing direct cash grants for this kind of work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on this Bill.  He performed a difficult task.  He is probably very frustrated as he sits here and listens to many of the good ideas which Senators from all sides put forward about what they would or would not like to see done.  The Minister represents an extremely poor constituency. The north inner city is a place where everyone would like to see investment, with improved housing and improved living standards for everybody.  I intend to ask the Minister to look at one or two <Col N="1472" /> things which may cost some money but which I believe in the long term will be of benefit.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Norris.  I believe the Government should look at further tax breaks for anybody refurbishing an old Georgian house or a house of architectural merit.  In the long term it is of great historical and archaeological benefit and has a tourism spinoff.  It makes people aware of their heritage and attracts people back to living in the inner cities.  Inner city revitalisation is very important and the more people we can get to refurbish these houses and to attract people to live in the inner city, the greater the long term benefit will be for Dublin and other cities.</P>
      <P>I would like to talk about the patent section of the Bill.  The Government have put great efforts into developing the science and technology industry.  Irish scientists are not by any stretch of the imagination very well paid.  The slim prospect that they might invent something where they would get a tax free benefit on the patent is a small incentive to Irish scientists.  Not many of them get it, and for those who do, it is not a lot of money.  This change in the Finance Bill is taxing very few people.  I wonder what is the income from this tax; I cannot imagine it would be a lot.  Patents are the intellectual property of scientists.  It is difficult for anybody to get a patent because very often scientists come up with great ideas but they are not commercially viable.  To get a good idea, to be able to patent it and then make it commercially viable, is extremely rare.</P>
      <P>In Ireland we produced very few patents, but we are trying hard to increase the level of commercially relevant innovations. I believe this section may do the opposite.  I would like the Minister to look at this over the next 12 months, and maybe change it next year.  I cannot imagine the Exchequer are getting a lot of money from these people.  I would ask the Minister to have a look at that again and to change it in order to encourage Irish scientists to develop ideas with the potential of creating a considerable number of jobs in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1473" /> We have a very good science and technology base.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, when he became Taoisearch in 1987 put science and technology on a new footing and it has developed since then.  Perhaps unkown to the Minister, this change is going to have a negative effect on work well done.  A considerable number of people are putting a lot of work into it and I would ask the Minister to look at this over the last 12 months.</P>

      <P>At the outset I would like to compliment and pay tribute to the Minister for Finance for his interest in the Seanad.  I also welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O'Rourke, to the Seanad this afternoon.</P>
      <P>Regrettably, the Finance Bill repeats and enforces the major errors which were made in the budget of 1992.  The Bill fails completely to address the enormous problems facing the country, in particular the very serious cancer of unemployment. It also fails to take advantage of the opportunities of a new Europe on whose edge the country is now poised.  In fact, I believe this Finance Bill could be described as anti-work and anti-enterprise. I do not make those remarks lightly.  Inherent in the Bill is that sort of message.  It discourages risk taking and rewards fence sitting and playing it safe. This is a retrograde step.</P>
      <P>It marks the first increase in the Exchequer borrowing requirement since 1986 and moves fiscal policy further from the medium term target of a balanced budget by 1993 and the long term target of reducing the national debt to 60 per cent of GNP by 1997.  It is a product, unfortunately, of some conflict between our two partners in Government, the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats.  The message one gets is that there is a certain amount of conflict emerging which is apparent throughout the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Never before has this country needed greater vision and greater imagination in the application of fiscal policy to solve the country's problems.  It is regrettable that never before has there been such <Col N="1474" /> clear failure in this regard.  Of all the missed monetary opportunities in recent years, this must be considered the greatest one.</P>
    <P>One of the most interesting aspects of the Finance Bill is the disparity and contradiction between the contents of the Bill and the rhetoric with which the Bill and the budget has been presented to the people.  Neither the budget nor the Finance Bill does what those persons advocating them claim.  The facts belie the words and one needs an insight into the conflict between the Government partners, at Cabinet level in particular, to understand how this has arisen.  The Programme for Government negotiated between the major partner in Government, Fianna Fáil, and the junior partner, the Progressive Democrats, gave a solemn commitment to reduce the marginal rate of tax to 25 per cent and 44 per cent, respectively.  This was to be done in a revenue neutral manner.  Whatever was given in the swings would be taken back on the roundabouts.</P>
    <P>The document was quite precise in indentifying the particular Peter who was to be robbed to pay Paul.  Tax breaks, tax avoidance schemes and tax reliefs were to be abolished to fund the reduction in income tax according to the agreed programme.  Government spokesmen said that almost unlimited funds were available for PAYE income tax reductions if reliefs and breaks were abolished. One Deputy from the Government parties claimed amounts up to £1.5 billion being available and the Government spin doctors placed juicy items in the media suggesting that the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance were amazed at the possible yield. There was a euphoria projected, promoted and put before the people as to what could be done.  Yet on budget day, when the Minister for Finance announced the reductions in the top rate of tax to 48 per cent and the standard rate to 27 per cent &mdash; a welcome move &mdash; at a cost of £168 million, he found only £37 million from the abolition of tax reliefs, breaks and tax avoidance measures, and £17 million of this came <Col N="1475" /> from changes in taxation on company cars.  So, effectively, with the exclusion of company cars, there is only £20 million involved.  Clearly, the only reliefs whose abolition would provide the Government with large sums of money were interest relief and VHI relief.  There appeared to be a greater conflict between the Government partners again in this area.  Frankly, it was evident that while a certain section of the Government wished to have the VHI reliefs and mortgage reliefs abolished, the other partner did not do so, and that argument won in the end.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of confusion when ideology on the one hand gets confused with expediency of a political nature on the other, leading to a certain amount of debris through the Finance Bill, which is a very important document.  The political fallout from this situation is very serious. A large number of tax rates have been abolished for a small yield.  The reasoning of certain people is that all tax breaks are wrong and should be abolished.  I do not agree with this.  The use of tax reliefs and tax breaks to encourage certain desirable kinds of social and economic behaviour is a feature of the tax code of every developed country, and to adopt a purist approach which claims that all breaks are wrong as an instrument of social and economic policy is ridiculous.  This feature of ridiculousness is demonstrated time and time again throughout the Bill, and there are measures to prove that. There is little encouragement to advocate investment, enterprise, job creation or risk taking.  Those sheltered in employment are rewarded through some of the measures taken.  There will be an adverse effect on enterprise; in fact, it will cost jobs rather than create them.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that if we omit the company cars dimension from this famous £37 million, we have only £20 million accruing from tax breaks.  Since the Government failed to find the yield to fund their tax cuts in the way they said they would, they had to look elsewhere for revenue.  They got it from two places &mdash; they increased borrowing and raised VAT.  Both these measures run counter <Col N="1476" /> to our commitments to our EC partners and are totally inconsistent with the obligations which the Government are undertaking under the Maastricht Treaty.  It is not generally realised that as a result of the Taoiseach's last budget and Minister Ahern's first budget the real Exchequer borrowing requirements have been doubled, and at a time when the Government are committed to a balanced budget in 1993 and are urging the electorate to undertake the far more onerous task of reducing the debt as a percentage of gross national product to 60 per cent by 1997.</P>
    <P>One could go on and on and cite examples of the type I have referred to, but frankly the main thrust of this Finance Bill is one of great disappointment. We do not see much hope in it for jobs. Enterprise development is sadly lacking in the Bill.  For instance, with regard to enterprise, the changes in VAT will cost jobs.  The changes in the co-operative taxation will cost jobs.</P>
    <P>On this point, may I elaborate slightly? Many of our co-operative societies will have a liability of 40 per cent tax; those are the non-producing co-operative societies such as livestock marts.  I suggest that 40 per cent is not a very reasonable or equitable figure.  Many of our co-operatives, big and small, depending on their type of operation, will find it extremely difficult to survive in the times ahead. The changes in tax on company cars to which I have already referred will also cost jobs.  The changes in capital gains tax will cost jobs.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to an amendment put down in the other House by Deputy Foxe of Roscommon requesting the abolition of capital acquisitions tax.  Deputy Foxe failed to get the amendment clarified. I support the view expressed in that amendment, the total and complete abolition of capital acquisitions or capital gains tax.  I can justify my view by saying that at present the rates are such that many properties either have to be sold or the people have to borrow heavily on them when they pass them on to their successors.  I appreciate that there are certain concessions available for inter-family <Col N="1477" /> arrangements where a father passes a property on to his son or his daughter, but these are exceptional.</P>
    <P>There are many other examples I could talk about.  It is imperative that the Government would realise that we need to have a very determined and close look at what is happening at present.  For example, we have introduced a VAT arrangement which has six different rates: zero, 2.7 per cent, 10 per cent, 12.5 per cent, 16 per cent and 21 per cent. This could not in any way be regarded as progress towards harmonisation or simplification of the code.  We appreciate downwards adjustments in the VAT area, but, frankly, presenting us with six different VAT rates is a bit too much.</P>
    <P>Taxpayers who do not avail of the new deposit accounts will pay only 27 per cent on their unearned income from other accounts, but if they are part of the 40 per cent of taxpayers, they will be paying at the higher rate of 48 per cent.  This is a disincentive to people rather than an encouragement to them to take risks and make money.  It is important that we as a nation followed the example of other countries, such as the USA, and considered that there was nothing wrong with wealth or profit provided that it was made within the parameters of propriety, corrections and so on.  There is a similar discouragement to small investors in the equity market, as the balance of advantage has swung in favour of the deposit accounts and against investment in equities.</P>
    <P>There is not one single job creation measure in the Bill.  I repeat that fact because I believe it is so important.  It is difficult to conceive how indeed 15 intelligent people sat around the Cabinet table and saw his kind of document and gave it their approval.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to answer one simple question.  Is there such a close connection between the marginal rate of tax and job creation?  If there is, why is it over the last few years, when the standard rate of income tax has been reduced from 35 per cent to 27 per cent and the high rate has been reduced to 48 per cent, that this has been accompanied <Col N="1478" /> by the highest level of unemployment since the foundation of the State in 1922? I ask the Minister to respond to that question and to respond to the question on capital acquisitions tax to which I referred earlier.</P>
    <P>I also would like somebody to explain how a further reduction in the marginal rate of tax to 25 per cent and 44 per cent is going to provide the magic trigger for job creation when larger adjustments up to now have had no effect whatsoever.  Is it not time that there was a clear understanding about our present tax policy which, I respectfully submit, is not workable and not capable of giving effect to the dramatic economic changes that some people propose it can do?  I know there is divided opinion on this matter, but I suggest that it is a very major issue in this Finance Bill and something that has to be addressed.</P>
    <P>When the Finance Bill was published the Minister's PR people projected him in the resolute cloak because he insisted in the Finance Bill on implementing some of his budgetary proposals.  The message was that the Minister would not change.  Perhaps it was a list more personal than that.  I would suggest that what was wrong with the budget in January was wrong in the Finance Bill in April and should have been changed.  This is a weakness that has been allowed to go by. There was merit in the case put forward by commercial travellers, publicans, members of co-operative societies, small investors and farmers and the Minister should have listened to them.</P>
    <P>I will deal with a few of the specifics in the Finance Bill.  It is not the rate at which people pay income tax which is the key issue but the total amount paid.  Taxpayers are dragged into the tax net at a low level of income, and at a moderate level are dragged into the higher band.  It should be remembered that almost 40 per cent of all taxpayers pay tax at the higher rate.  Single people on £60 per week fall into the tax net.  It is logical that there should be a lower tax rate as an introductory rate and it would be feasible to introduce a rate of perhaps 15 per cent <Col N="1479" /> on the first £1,000 of taxable income for married persons.  A clear commitment should be given to widen the <i>tranche</i> of income to which the lower introductory rate of tax would apply.  It also makes good sense for the Minister to widen the standard rate band so that 80 per cent of taxpayers would pay tax at no more than the standard rate of tax by the year 1994-95.</P>
    <P>With regard to the abolition of income tax relief on insurance policies, this would make endowment mortgages more costly and there would need to be a commitment from the Minister for Finance to maintain mortgage interest relief and VHI tax relief.  On the question of the premia for life assurance it was a retrograde step to remove the tax relief there; it discourages important investment beneficial to our economy.</P>
    <P>The decision by the Minister for Finance to introduce on Report Stage in the other House an amendment to the Finance Bill to apply the 40 per cent rate of corportion tax to advertising profits is appalling.  The media are extremely important and the Minister made no provision for that in his budget or in the Finance Bill.  It is appalling also that a major change in newspaper taxation is being introduced in an underhanded fashion.  This new provision will have a serious effect on the newspaper industry and put additional pressure on its ability to carry out a fundamental democratic role in society.</P>
    <P>Other provisions in the tax code which are being firmed up in this Finance Bill will make it difficult if not impossible for companies to offset losses made in the manufacturing part of the company against gains in the advertising area. Consequently newspapers which make an overall loss will quite likely have to pay tax on profits from advertising.</P>
    <P>This Finance Bill is without imagination or vision and gives scant regard to putting our economy back into shape. Fortunately, an air of buoyancy is developing in the world economy and I hope it will come our direction soon.  We must put our house in order to avail of <Col N="1480" /> that buoyancy when it comes.  I am not sure that this Finance Bill equips our economy to avail of that buoyancy which will come I hope sooner rather than later. The measures introduced in the budget and in the Finance Bill will do little to attract foreign investment which is vital to the advancement of our economy and to the survival of our nation.</P>
    <P>Every Irish person is concerned about the serious crisis in our economy at present, and I include the Government and Government parties in that.  They are aware of the seriousness of the economic situation.  I would like the Government to address our economic problems.  The Government cannot solve our unemployment problems or our taxation problems but they could play a greater role in alleviating present difficulties.  I am aware that most decisions which affect our economy are taken now in Brussels and we must exert more influence over what is decided in Brussels.</P>
    <P>There are three sectors in our economy &mdash; agriculture, tourism and industry &mdash; which are the earners of money for State services.  At the moment agriculture is underdeveloped and we must ensure through the Common Agricultural Policy and GATT, that it does not lose out.  We must promote our tourist industry and develop certain industries more vigorously so that we will have more money for our starved Department of Health, for education, for law and order enforcement and for all other vital services that cannot generate or create revenue.  It is incumbent upon the Government to take on board certain policies that will develop to the fullest these various sectors so that our economy can succeed.</P>
    <P>I want to revert again to the question of inheritance tax and capital acquisitions tax which is a more serious problem than is appreciated by the Minister and by the Government.  Many people do not have a direct relationship with the person to whom they transfer their farm or business. Small allowances only are allowed in those cases of inter-family transfers. The allowances that apply in industry and in agriculture are more generous; the allowance in agriculture is substantial <Col N="1481" /> whether the transfer is from parent to child or from spouse to spouse.  Numerous properties throughout the country are transferred in circumstances other than a direct relationship.  These transfers, together with direct family transfers, must be looked at with a view to abolishing the capital acquisitions tax or inheritence tax.</P>
    <P>The amendment which Deputy Foxe of Roscommon put down in the other House and which was not dealt with there has my support.  I hope that the Minister will give it and the other points I raised here his fullest consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and commend him for staying through so much of the debate.  I welcome this Finance Bill in which the Minister shows the same practical, effective approach he brought to the Department of Labour.  In the Department of Labour he was made familiar with the serious problem of unemployment.  The present Government have already made enormous strides in financial matters over the past four or five years.  We have transformed our financial situation from one in which we were close to being a case for the World Bank to one of growth.  It was a pretty close thing.  Present unemployment levels might have been worse under former policies with little hope of improvement.  Now we have tackled the financial problems successfully.  This afternoon one of the major banks dropped its interest rates overall by something like .5 per cent.  There has been tremendous progress in that direction and also with regard to employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of permanent jobs in industry has increased considerably over the past 40 years.  Last year was one of the few years in the history of the State since records have been kept in which we had nil emigration, the traditional way of dealing with unemployment where sons and daughters went to the States, to Britain and elsewhere to seek jobs.  To deal with unemployment on a lasting basis and not over a year, 18 months or two years in a way which will provide long term unemployment, we must establish <Col N="1482" /> profitable, successful, competitive industry in the widest sense of the words.  The Minister has gone a very long way towards clarifying the tax situation.</P>
    <P>Tax breaks provide a certain temporary advantage but it is a transient one. In industry or business one needs to know what the rules are, to have what is sometimes known as transparency in the tax system together with clarification and, equality because then can one make serious investment on a long term basis. That is the only way to achieve worthwhile, lasting employment.  We would all like lower taxes on capital gains, and lower corporation tax.</P>
    <P>If we want to develop industry here two requirements are essential and one of these is capital.  We can talk about plans, hopes and intentions but if capital is not available then industry and business will not develop.  The European Community brings freedom of movement of capital throughout the European Community, comprising 300 million people. People will decide where to place their capital on the basis of where it is going to be profitably employed.  The second requirement is for a proper physical infrastructure of roads, ports and facilities which make it practicable for an industry to set up here in the knowledge that it can compete.</P>
    <P>The previous Minister for Education was rightly praised for her contribution to education during her period in that Department.  Education is essential for development and should be more of an applied nature.  To compete as an attractive location for investment with consequent growth in worthwhile employment, we need people capable of competing and of taking up the available jobs.  We have a very good education system which continues to improve year by year.  May the days be gone when young Irish girls and boys of 14 to 16 years with a primary certificate went to London or New York seeking the lowest paid jobs available.  Those boys and girls often proved, in the most difficult circumstances that they were intelligent and able.  They deserved a better education. Although things have improved greatly <Col N="1483" /> here only about 60 per cent of our young people between 16 and 19 years are in third level education.  In that respect we lag far behind the Dutch and the Germans; 90 per cent in the same age group in those countries are in third level education and if we had the same percentage in third level education we would remove at least 50,000 from our unemployment register and do so with cost saving.  That proposal should be examined.</P>
    <P>The third essential for development is initiative.  Let us have more Irish initiative. We have erred over the past few years in over dependence on foreigners investing in peripheral industry here while headquarters and key management structures remained abroad.  Research and development departments were not established here and once the tax advantage period elapsed these industries tended to pull out.  Despite that, over 1,000 foreign firms have set up here over the past few years.  That is not a bad record but we need to encourage more indigenous initiative.</P>
    <P>Many Irish people with ideas and initiative succeeded under adverse conditions in the United States, Australia, Britain and elsewhere.  It is tremendous that people with initiative now stay in this country.  We need to ensure that they are given the opportunity and encouragement to develop industries here.</P>
    <P>That is a matter of which the Minister is well aware.  The 1,000 plus major industires if located in small communities can impose considerable disadvantages on the community if the plant closes.  These industries should be located in larger urban centres.  They will not locate here other than on a temporary tax advantage basis unless there is associated small industry.  The vast majority of successful industries in Hong Kong, Taiwan, West Germany, North America, the United Kingdom, France and the Netherlands are small.  If an industrialist wants to develop a large plant in aerospace or whatever one of the essentials is to make sure there is a cluster of smaller companies of related subsidiary industries which will provide a base on which the <Col N="1484" /> larger industry can prosper.  Without such development we will continue to enjoy merely a temporary advantage from major industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister is well aware of the importance of fiscal incentives and some of the major European countries, despite all their advantages, offer better fiscal incentives than we do.  Fiscal incentives are only a temporary measure but we need to ensure that we do not have fiscal disadvantages.  This Finance Bill moves towards laying down the necessary ground rules which, based on the tremendous progress that has been made, will enable us to develop worthwhile, well paid, interesting competitive employment. In years to come, instead of being one of the disadvantaged areas of Europe looking for Cohesion Funds we could become one of the more prosperous areas.  We have already shown our competitiveness in many ways.  We have a young active population and enjoy many opportunities and advantages which other countries do not.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's tax provisions in relation to exploration, production and development and particularly in relation to abandonment in offshore exploration. We made a series of grave taxation mistakes in our exploration industries in the seventies.  One could draw a graph to show the close relationship between money spent in this country on exploration and the tax system on one hand and the number of actual discoveries on the other.  In the case of a very disadvantageous tax system it does not matter what physical resources exist &mdash; people will not spend their money.  On the other hand, if one does not make discoveries people will not spend money either.  It is a vicious circle.  Let us not forget in relation to oil exploration that it costs approximately $5 million to sink a well in the Celtic Sea.  If a discovery is not made, that $5 million is written off. If one invests $5 million in almost any other business one may lose most of it but some remnant will remain; put down a dry hole somewhere and one may lose everything.</P>
    <P>However, $5 million in the Celtic Sea <Col N="1485" /> is peanuts compared to the situation in the Atlantic Ocean or the Porcupine Bank.  There, costs of drilling if one is lucky are about $20 million.  Why should any group spend those sums of money unless, first, there is a reasonable likelihood that they will find something to make the risk of spending such enormous sums worthwhile and, second, they will not be taxed so heavily that the discovery becomes uneconomic and not worthwhile. In the seventies we made the appalling mistake of bringing in tax systems which brought the exploration industry here almost to a halt.  It was disappointing from the point of view of discoveries but what finally finished it off was that companies were spending huge sums of money and yet the tax system was such that even a very large discovery was unlikely to be economic.  It will take a long time to recover from that.</P>
    <P>The Minister has now taken sensible steps to repair the damage which, I hope, will encourage exploration around our coasts again.  Much time has been lost and much leeway remains to be made up. Many other countries around the globe are looking for exploration dollars as well.  Nobody is going to come to us unless there is something worth finding and unless it will be financially attractive to risk money looking for it.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister in relation to abandonment tax.  One of the dreadful features of the oil industry, particularly to offshore oil industry and it applied to other aspects of natural resources industry also, was that when an oil field or mine came to an end it was left in poor condition, environmentally.  Those living in the area had to suffer the consequences and often the seas were polluted afterwards.</P>
    <P>It is extremely expensive to allow for abandonment costs for offshore oil rigs. We must insist on companies having full abandonment policies in force so that at the end of the period when they have made a discovery, put it into production and provided revenue to the State the drilling hole can be carefully shut down and appropriate abandonment procedures brought into play.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1486" /> I commend the Finance Bill.  It is yet another step towards progress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House but I cannot say I commend him on a totally acceptable Bill. However, I commend him on certain developments there.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his speech said that the statutory basis for taxation is laid in the Finance Bill, that measures are taken there to prepare for European monetary union and that he is indicating further steps in the Government strategy of tax reform in the context of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first part of his speech he dealt with the state of the public finance which forms part of the introduction to the Finance Bill and to the budgetary policies being pursued.  The figures quoted by the Minister in relation to our economic progress and development over the past number of years are impressive.  He told us that gross domestic product expanded by about 2 per cent last year and in view of the difficult international conditions this was a very creditable performance. He said our growth rate was twice that of the world economy, all the more impressive due to a decline of 2½ per cent in the growth rate of the United Kingdom.  We were in the first ratio.  Merchandise export growth was strong in the face of international trading conditions. Export of goods and services increased by about 5.75 per cent, helping to boost the balance of payments surplus to about 5 per cent of gross national produce. There was a rise in manufacturing output of more than 3 per cent, and strong growth in the chemical industry.  Inflation at 3.2 per cent was well below the EC average.  That is an indication of a very strong economy.  In fact, our economy has been growing at an average of 4 per cent to 5 per cent over the past five years and our inflation has been kept very low. Wage increases, as the Minister knows as he negotiated the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, have been kept very low also amounting to 2.5 per cent each year from 1987 and 4 per cent, 3 per cent and 3.75 per cent under the <i>Programme <Col N="1487" /> for Economic and Social Progress.</i> Indeed, the Minister, reduced those figures further when he indicated before Christmas that the country could not afford to pay the increases.  Of course it can afford them.  The Minister should have left the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> as it had been negotiated 17 months ago.</P>
    <P>The figures are disturbing and everything the Minister said is true, but the problem is that none of the strong economic indicators have transformed into job creation.  That is the critical disappointment of our economic progress under the Government and their predecessor. Since 1987 we have had an enormous upturn in the economy in terms of our international competitiveness, the quantity of exports and the very substantial surplus of trading we have had in recent years.  From that point of view, I am extremely disappointed that the Minister did not introduce in the budget interventionist policies to provide incentives towards jobs creation.  That is my gravest concern about this Bill.</P>
    <P>Having read it thoroughly I can find very little of significance or substance in it indicating a policy of job creation, or showing that the Minister introduced a pro-active budget that will transfer the benefit of our economic progress into benefit for our people.</P>
    <P>The only judgment one can make on economic progress must be based on whether it benefited all the people of the country.  Some anomalies have been eliminated which is very welcome, but this is more tinkering with the system, moving a tax exemption here or closing a loophole there.  It amounts to moving money around and it does not address the underlying problems.</P>
    <P>In the introduction to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, the previous Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, stated in January 1991 that the programme was a strategy to accelerate economic and social progress in the nineties. The strategy was simple.  It was to maintain a low inflation economy, with a stable exchange rate which could compete <Col N="1488" /> internationally and give us the higher standards of living and improved social services to which we aspired.</P>
    <P>The Minister was central to negotiating that programme which indicated a certain basic approach towards job creation: if we have low inflation and a stable exchange rate, we can compete internationally. We have done all that.  We have been doing it since 1987.  We have been able to compete internationally but not to deal with our unemployment problem. In other words, we created the right climate in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> What we are doing here is creating the right climate once again and then leaving it to the private sector to create jobs.  There is tremendous dependance in this Bill on the ability of the private sector to create jobs.  The Minister, in his speech, said that for last year as a whole in manufacturing industry employment rose by 1,500.  Average employment in banking, insurance and building societies was up by 1,000 in the first nine months of the year, yet unemployment was up by 29,000.  The Minister's figure of 254,000 is wrong in relation to the present position.</P>
    <P>In fact, it is in excess of 280,000.  The Minister, in December last when presenting his Estimate said that by 1992 the unemployment figure would be 275,000. We hit that figure one week after the budget was presented at the end of January. In the beginning of February the figure was about 277,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That was an average; an average rate is not a figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have to wait until the end of the year to determine that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  The average rate is not the figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, the last figures we got, which brought us up to 281,000 plus, indicated that there was a very strong underlying rising trend in the unemployment figures, so I cannot agree with the Minister's sentiments in his <Col N="1489" /> speech, namely, that the economic trends are encouraging.  They are certainly not encouraging at present.  One could argue that they may improve but that is mere speculation.  Economic trends remain good but unemployment trends do not.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer also to the fact that there has been no mention in the debate so far about the transfer of funds from the EC.  We have received approximately £1 billion each year since 1987. Last year we received in excess of £2 billion.  There has been an enormous transfer of EC funds to us which is a tremendous boost to the economy.  I would have liked to hear the remarks of the Minister's officials, on the effect that has on economic development, in relation to unemployment and development and how the funds can be used for job creation and for the benefit of the people.</P>
      <P>My concern about the lack of improvement in job creation has to be underlined by the very large number of work days lost in the first three months of this year through disputes.  We have lost 50,000 work days compared to 10,000 in the same period last year.  We know that last year this Minister was Minister for Labour and, perhaps, if he were still Minister for Labour some of those industrial disputes might not have taken place. That is no reflection on the present Minister for Labour.  Nevertheless we now have a rising trend, where industrial strife is becoming the norm rather than the exception.  That is hitting at the heart of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and at the heart of the philosophy of bringing about consensus, negotiation and round table talks to resolve problems rather than a heavy-handed macho management approach. We must not go down that road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an underlying trend of rising unemployment but there is also an underlying trend of rising industrial strife.  Such a combination is lethal.  I could name the various firms that have gone to the wall, the companies which shed jobs &mdash; United Meat Packers, on which we had a long and difficult discussion in his House and the other House; Apple Computers, <Col N="1490" /> Cork; Dublin Cargo Handlers has gone into liquidation with the likely shedding of 220 jobs.  It is unacceptable that a company can so easily go to the courts nowadays, to secure liquidation.  During the bank strike, workers were suspended. This was a new development indicating a heavy handed approach to industial relations which we have not encountered in the recent past.</P>
    <P>The present postal strike is the worst example of industrial relations this year. Workers have been suspended even though they are available for work; workers who are working are not being paid; casual staff are being brought in and, most terrible of all, while a ballot was taking place on a deal for proposed changes the unilateral decision of An Post management was pushed through. We can do without that type of industrial relations.  I would bring to the attention of the Minister the need to try to soften that approach.  I ask him to put it to management, particularly those so-called trouble-shooters in the semi-State sector, that macho management is not the way forward in industial relations.  Perhaps the Minister could bring that to the attention of the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications and the Minister for Labour.</P>
    <P>The Minister, no doubt, knows the two disputes I referred to: Dublin Cargo Handlers and the Sheriff Street Sorting Office, where the present dispute is centered. A great deal of employment will be lost there and the north inner city is already blighted when it comes to jobs. We can ill afford to lose further jobs through bad industrial relations.</P>
    <P>Any budgetary projections depend on our ability to produce, manufacture and provide services.  There is a ripple effect; if we do not have good postal services commercial and enterprise activities suffer.  There is also a threat to Iarnród Éireann.  If the Sheriff Street Sorting Office disappears and packages and letters are carried to centres throughout the country by road, obviously Iarnród Éireann will suffer and vulnerable lines, such as the Sligo line, will lose out.  If the mail train is taken off its daily route, <Col N="1491" /> and the double trip to Galway and Cork, obviously that will have an adverse effect both on employment and the whole rail system.</P>
    <P>We have moved a long way from the principles enunciated in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and unless we return to negotiation, industrial strife will take over and the employers and the trade union movement, in particular, will find it very difficult to come into partnership with the Government.  It must be remembered that budgetary projections are based on a good, stable working partnership.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer to the jobs forum.  I compliment the Government not so much on taking the initiative but on listening to the calls from the Organisation for the Unemployed and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  However, I am not happy with the constitution of the jobs forum.  I believe it should be much broader.  I am very concerned that it could become another Oireachtas committee that would end up as a talking shop.  Because of its constitution and procedures, members may not be able to address the real business for which the forum was set up &mdash; job creation.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to consider setting up local jobs forums on a regional basis. This would complement the national jobs forum and ensure that all those concerned with job creation &mdash; the unemployed, the trade union movement, residents' associations, tenants' association, job creating agencies, and training agencies &mdash; could meet at the local level and pool information.  They could then channel ideas to the national forum and, at the same time, receive some degree of funding for serveys that might be required from the national forum.  They could also focus on job potential in the local areas.  Such an initiative, in the context of job creation, could get down to the grass roots and make some substantial proposals.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill and the budgetary provisions that underlie it will not make any substantial change to the welfare of the majority, it is merely tinkering with <Col N="1492" /> the system.  Very few people at the bottom of the scale, especially those on social welfare would say they were better off, on social welfare, although those at the top of the scale will probably be relatively happy with it.</P>
    <P>In relation to income tax, this Government are very much Progressive Democrat driven.  It is a desirable objective that tax be pitched at as low a level as possible, but it must be done on an equitable basis. It is not acceptable that the greatest reductions should be in the higher rates. This year there has been a reduction from 52 per cent to 48 per cent on the top rate &mdash; 4 per cent &mdash; whereas on the standard rate, the reduction is from 29 per cent to 27 per cent &mdash; 2 per cent.  Obviously, if one were trying to bridge the gap between those on lower wages and those on higher wages, the reduction, proportionately, should be greater in relation to the standard rate of tax rather than the top rate.  Over the last five years, there has been an 8 per cent reduction on the standard rate and a 10 per cent reduction in the top rate.  Once again, the trend has been disproportionately in favour of those on higher salaries.  These tax reductions benefited those in the top bracket proportionately more than those in the lower brackets.  The Minister should redress that trend.  We should not be tied to the policy enunciated by the Progressive Democrats of reducing the tax rate to 25 per cent.  It is more beneficial to the taxpayer to broaden the bands at the lower level and to increase the exemptions to reduce the top level.</P>
    <P>The Minister missed that opportunity and he should give it priority in the next budget.  The tax bands should be sufficiently wide so that anybody on the lower rate would reach a high level of salary before reaching the top rate and the top rate, for top earners, should remain at the present level.  I am disappointed the Minister took the option he did this year and I hope he will redress the balance in the coming year.</P>
    <P>In relation to broadening the tax base, I listened recently to the previous Minister for Eeducation, Deputy Davern, talking about a tax amnesty.  You do not <Col N="1493" /> broaden the tax base with a tax amnesty. He was putting forward the idea that there were many Irish citizens who had wealth deposited abroad and who were anxious to bring it back to the country for some productive purpose.  He apparently knew of about £3 billion waiting to come in, which would not come in because people were not prepared to pay tax on it but if they got a tax amnesty they would willingly bring it in.  How did that money get out of the country in the first place and why is its return now sought?</P>
    <P>In this context, one could ask what is happening to the £2.165 billion export over import surplus.  We do not know whether that money has come back into the country or whether it has been deposited abroad.  What accountability is there on earnings made abroad?  Is there any way of tracing them to see what type of account they go into and whether they come back to this country?  What measures can be taken to ensure that they are repatriated for the benefit of this country?  That seems to be the real deficit in relation to job creation.</P>
    <P>It has been said that we will not get any significant increase in job creation until our gross national product increases by at least 3 per cent.  We would get a very marginal increase at this point.  The reason it is so low is that the economic wealth we are creating from our profit margins is not coming back into this country for productive purposes.  We are creating the wealth but it is leaving the country and is not used for the benefit of the people.  I would like the Minister to examine the surplus value of our exports and see how we can best channel it for the benefit of our country.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 4 relating to the abolition of income tax relief on life insurance.  That is long overdue.  I also welcome section 8 in relation to the benefit-in-kind. This was often used in an enlarged and exaggerated fashion.  A company car was given as a way of getting round paying higher salaries.  It gave the maximum tax relief without appearing to do so.  A revision of these procedures is welcome but the Minister is still far too harsh in relation to commercial travellers <Col N="1494" /> and company representatives, for whom it is not really a benefit-in-kind, it is the tool of their trade.  I would prefer that to be entirely exempt rather than have a phasing out process take place over a period of five years.</P>
    <P>Section 15 cannot be welcome because it refers to the taxing of disability benefit, occupational injuries benefit, unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit. That is postponed until 1993, so presumably the intention is to introduce it at a later stage, perhaps after an election. The principle of taxing benefits that have been taxed already, when a person has paid PRSI seems very strange and I do not agree with it.  If somebody is unemployed or becomes disabled, they suffer sufficient trauma in their lives without having it added to by finding that the meagre returns they will get from the social welfare system will be further reduced by having them taxed.  This is as a very unsatisfactory development and the Minister should look at it again.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 17, the Minister's original decision to eliminate any profitsharing relief and reduce what was originally a £5,000 maximum to nil was undesirable.  At least I am glad he has listened to some advice and is now restoring it, at least to £2,000.  This is an undesirable provision in the Bill, because the practice led to an element of job creation, certainly job maintenance.  It was a good incentive to employees to have an interest in their companies, to get involved in share option schemes where they would benefit from the profits made by the company.  Such schemes would improve industrial relations, motivation and output.  Companies should be encouraged to introduce such schemes and the Minister should not have reduced the relief substantially, as he has done.</P>
    <P>I have considerable reservations about the provisions in section 22 in relation to the DIRT tax.  The Minister is proposing to reduce the tax take from 27 per cent to 10 per cent.  This will now encourage people to invest their money in savings rather than in some more productive forms of investment.  Money which is available for productive proposes will go <Col N="1495" /> in the wrong direction rather than towards job creation.</P>
    <P>Regarding the urban renewal designated area scheme, I am glad to see an extension of this scheme.  I do not see why there is a difference of one year between all other areas and the Customs House Docks area although I welcome the extension for that area.  Other areas, particularly in the north inner city could be reconsidered.  Here, incentives need to be provided for the entire area rather than selected areas, and over an extended period.  I would like the Minister to look again at that provision.</P>
    <P>I welcome the enterprise trust, where companies are encouraged by tax relief to make corporate donations towards job creation.  That is just one good section.  Overall, the budget is not a job creation budget.  I would have liked to see the Minister introduce provisions which he himself would like to have, whereby incentives could be given for job creation rather than simply trying to create the right climate and expecting the private sector to do the rest.</P>

      <P>I dtosach baire, ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire go dtí an Teach.</P>
      <P>There are many things one could say about the Finance Bill, which would take about a month to read from cover to cover.  It contains many provisions, but I will make some general remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is regrettable that we discuss the Social Welfare and the Finance Bill separately because on the day of the budget they go hand-in-hand, and they tend to impinge on each other.  In my work I deal with people who are on the margins of the tax system and, in one way or another, involved with social welfare, therefore, I will address my remarks to that group of people on low incomes.  Since more and more people now have to make tax returns it is important that the tax system be as simple as possible.  Particularly for the low paid sector.  Those people have no experience of dealing with bureaucracy and most of them find the plethora of <Col N="1496" /> rules and regulations totally bewildering. Tax forms require all sorts of questions to be answered and most people with whom I deal do not understand the reasoning behind the questions.</P>
    <P>There are too many little side issues in the system.  For example, the average small farmer in receipt of a social welfare pension must answer a whole range of questions.  If they are on social welfare they are asked if they are in receipt of a taxable pension.  Unemployment assistance and disabled person's maintenance allowance may not be taxable as the tax position varies greatly between one type of social welfare payment and another. They are also asked if they have a medical card, if so, they do not pay the health levies.  If one's income is over £2,500 one pays RSI, but if it is under £2,500 one does not pay RSI.  However, there is another complication, you do not pay PRSI if you are on unemployment assistance. It might be said that I am straying into the social welfare area and far be it from me to stray from the discussion on this Bill, but I am talking about filling in a tax form.</P>
    <P>In returns to the tax office those questions are raised on the tax form which must be returned to the tax office.  Therefore, the complication that faces ordinary individuals is staggering, particularly for people on the marginal rates of tax. There is the additional complication of dealing with exemptions, etc.  My understanding of the exemption system is that if one is repaying a loan, etc. one can add that to the exemption.  One then has to explain about the marginal rate of tax paid when it is over the exemption level. Therefore, the entire tax system needs to be simplified, rationalised and co-ordinated with the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>When speaking on The Social Welfare Bill I referred to the problem in the social welfare-cum-tax system of the limits for family income supplement being in excess of the exemption limits for tax which means that people pay tax and get family income supplement in the same week.  I pointed out at the time that if you give such a person a rise in their income, they end up with less take-home <Col N="1497" /> pay when the family income supplement is adjusted.</P>
    <P>This Government have made rapid strides in rationalisting the tax system and increasing the exemption limits, but I would like to see a major increase in exemption limits and a marginal rate for those just above the exemption limits that would gradually bring them into line with the ordinary taxpayer, using the ordinary system.  In that way a good deal of unnecessary bureaucracy would be removed from the system.  I also believe that the health and unemployment levies should be brought into the main system and, therefore, somebody who would be exempt from tax would automatically not have to pay the 2.25 per cent.  This amount of money is generally very small for people on low incomes and merely means another bundle of letters from the collector general and so on.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I suggested here previously in regard to dealing with the system on a day-to-day basis, that, with computerisation, when the yearly tax form is being sent out to people it should be possible to give details of the loans they have already declared &mdash; relief on life insurance policies does not exist any more &mdash; and not to seek information already given.  Similarly if an employer's number does not charge from year to year it should not be necessary to insert it on the tax form each year because people do not always have that information to hand when filling in their tax forms.  That can be a daunting experience for somebody who is not familiar with filling in a tax form or who does not keep photocopies of the previous year's return.</P>
    <P>Another point I would like to address briefly is the need to examine the whole tax structure and its imbalance on the regions.  One of the greatest ways our tax system causes regional imbalance, is the amount of tax we take in regard to transport, whether tax on diesel, petrol or on vehicles.  This causes more regional disparity, particularly in peripheral regions, than many other tax policies. The regional nature of taxation, its effect on different regions as well as its effect <Col N="1498" /> on socio-economic groups within regions has to be taken into account in any total review of the tax system.</P>
    <P>Overall, I welcome the reduction in the tax rates.  It will be a major incentive to people.  I have always believed the trading-off of some of the lesser allowances in return for generally higher exemption limits and reduced tax rates was beneficial.  Some of those allowances and benefits are dear to the hearts of business people but I would shed no tears if they were gone and although I use the BES scheme to collect money for local enterprises I would include it.</P>
    <P>On the personal level, the aged relative's allowance, which is £100 a year, means that the maximum relief you can get is 48 per cent but it would be better to incorporate that into the tax relief system and take out all this form filling and complications which cause a great deal of misunderstanding in the system.</P>
    <P>I listened to the debate in the Dáil and to some of the debate in the Seanad and was surprised in regard to the resistance that has suddenly sprung up on certain sides to anti-avoidance and the new methods of ensuring that people who are avoiding and evading tax will be brought to book.  I thought it was agreed generally a year ago that we would have to grasp the nettle in this regard and that the people who do this in a professional way will use every means in their power to avoid or to evade paying tax.  I have no doubt there are enough checks and balances in this democracy to ensure that any powers given reasonably by this Legislature will not be abused by going after people who are not trying to defraud the State.  However, it is important that the loopholes are closed and, having done that, that the method of collecting would be enforced with the full rigours of the law.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that borders will be dismantled in 1992 mechanisms should be put in place similar to those which the Customs people already have which would ensure that taxes would be collected and that avoidance would not become the name of the game.  In that context, changes in the regulations as <Col N="1499" /> they apply to publicans are welcome. Publicans who pay their taxes are not competing on equal terms with those who are not.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that publicans will have to produce a tax clearance certificate before their licence is renewed. That is a reasonable request and it is something all of us in receipt of State grants have to do.  Those who wanted to play fair found that compliance with the system was not so onerous and it ensured viability because it meant that those who were not operating fairly did not get an unfair advantage.  I compliment the Minister on the changes he has made in the regulations regarding the licence; the new proposals are fair.  There is a favourable reaction in rural areas to the Bill as it affects the licensed trade.  It is considered an equitable way of collecting the licence fee.</P>
    <P>The co-operatives are not overjoyed about coming into the corporation tax system, but I appreciate that the Minister has made major changes and given reliefs in certain areas.  For example, milk producers will now be in the 10 per cent bracket and co-operatives may bring forward historical losses no matter when they were incurred.  While the co-operatives may not recognise that as being fair I would have no objection to paying corporation tax if, in return, payroll taxes were reduced because one only pays corporation tax if one makes a profit while one pays payroll tax whether one makes a profit or not.  I have always favoured a shift to corporation profits taxes.</P>
    <P>There is a need to consider the structures of co-operatives, the creation for taxation purposes of something akin to what exists for charitable organisations in the companies sphere, where co-operatives acting as community bodies would have preferential status as opposed to seven or eight people coming together to form a co-operative for purely personal gain.  Within that structure there should be some thought put into new methods of making it attractive for communities to put money into community enterprises.</P>
    <P>Because of time constraints, I will be <Col N="1500" /> unable to expand on this matter today, but it should be given serious consideration for the future.  Most rural communities have hidden cash reserves &mdash; which could be better utilised by introducing attractive schemes to ensure that people invest in their own area.  I hope we can discuss this matter in more detail at a future date because if money is released into local economies I believe it would be a most effective way of tackling unemployment at local level.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill and look forward to Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Finance Bill, particularly as this House does not get an opportunity at the post-budget stage to discuss matters in depth as we do on the Appropriation Bill.  Some provisions in the Bill are addenda to the budget and others are of a technical nature.  Some items need to be considered in isolation before we deal with the overall strategy of the Bill.  In particular, we must consider how the Finance Bill will improve people's lives and alleviate some of our problems.  It is regrettable that a Bill of 268 pages, 254 sections, which was passed by the other House yesterday is presented here today and we have to adhere to certain time limits.</P>
      <P>I will raise several points which the Minister may be able to deal with in his Second Stage reply or on Committee Stage.  The Finance Bill could be described as the final quarter of the January budget.  What is the Minister's view of the implications of harmonisation of the VAT rates?  I believe further progress should have been made in reducing the 21 per cent rate which is a crippling burden on business.  Those who can reclaim VAT do not find it such a burden, but for an individual who gets a bill for £500 with £105 added for VAT, his total bill comes to £605.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about the provision in the Bill that gives the Revenue Commissioners powers which, if abused, would have a drastic effect on companies and, possibly, individuals.  The Minister <Col N="1501" /> has been quoted as saying that some of those proposals have been introduced as a result of the various financial scandals which have dogged this country for the past year or so.  I would remind the Minister that some of those scandals were in the public sector &mdash; although I am not saying there are not a few hidden skeletons in the private sector also &mdash; but having regard to the events of the past year or so some of the Minister's colleagues should endeavour to get their own houses in order.  I do not believe the provisions relating to some of the Revenue techniques will necessarily have the desired result.</P>
    <P>One matter I would like the Minister to address relates to section 250 which states:</P>
    <P>The Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927, is hereby amended by the substitution for section 4A (inserted by the Appropriation Act, 1991) of the following section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;4A.  Where Dáil Éireann, having passed a resolution under this Act, has been dissolved on the date the resolution was so passed or within four months of that date, then the period of dissolution shall be disregarded for the purposes of calculating any period to which paragraph (a) or (d) of section 4 of this Act relates.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>After so many years and so many Finance Bills why has this matter suddenly come to light now?  Does it concern a further Finance Bill &mdash; budget later in the year which the Minister may, or may not, present to this House and to the other House?  Has it anything to do with a restriction being put on the Taoiseach in relation to the possible calling of a snap election?</P>
    <P>It appears from the Bill that those prepared to take risks with their money are to be hounded by the Revenue Commissioners while others will be encouraged to stow money away, albeit legitimately, and not to take any risk. Apart from keeping bank or building society employees and others in employment <Col N="1502" /> there will be no incentive for any individual to put money back into ventures in the hope of creating badly needed jobs.</P>
    <P>Our unemployment level is steadily heading towards a figure which I suppose will be a further noose around the neck of some of the 1977 brigade, not to mention some of the 1992 brigade.  One wonders if we are only months or perhaps weeks away from an unemployment figure of 300,000 people.  The Minister is already on record as saying we are facing that reality.  Some of the actions he is taking in this Finance Bill will hasten that reality and push more people on to the dole queues.  This Bill will certainly not help to create jobs.</P>

      <P>I am surprised at the Leader of the House disagreeing with me.  With your assistance, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, I hope to be able to continue without interruption.</P>
      <P>Certain measures in the Finance Bill are welcome.  Obviously, any reduction in the overall burden of personal taxation &mdash; a direction in which we are moving, even if at a snail's pace towards reducing the marginal and higher rates &mdash; is welcome so that people will not have to pay more than half their earnings in tax but we must do more in that regard.</P>
      <P>There are a few other queries I would like to put to the Minister.  First, in relation to the £3 million VHI levy, will that burden be passed on to the people who are already paying exorbitant premiums? Will it be a once-off payment or will people have to pay further levies which will be returned to them in yearly or monthly payments, but which will appear as another unlisted tax kindly sent by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter which must be considered is the question of how the motorist is being treated and in particular, the treatment of benefit-in-kind.  I know the Minister said this will be done on a phased basis but I am sure he is aware that for many people a car is essential in enabling them to travel to work and so <Col N="1503" /> on.  I will not go into the whole question of how unfairly motorists are treated in regard to tax etc. but I would remind the Minister of the 1977 &ldquo;freebie&rdquo; in regard to motor tax which, I am sure, assisted him in getting his Dáil seat, although I doubt if he got as many votes then as he is getting now.  As I said, cars are an expensive item to run and it is time the Minister gave the motorist a break as he has done in the past for his colleagues and friends who frequent the odd house for sustenance.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reply to some of the points I raised and also those raised by our spokesperson and by some of my other colleagues.  As a priority, we must consider whether this year's budget and the Finance Bill will set loose the Revenue Commissioners to hound individuals, small risk-takers and businessmen.  I look forward to discussing some further matters on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank all the Senators who contributed to this debate and to respond as best I can in the time available.  Some of the detailed questions posed can be dealt with at greater length on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to respond to Senators' remarks about the general thrust of income tax policy.</P>
      <P>Briefly, as I said in my opening remarks this morning, the thrust of this policy has been to extend the tax base, reduce tax rates and extend the standard band, and provide targeted help for the lower paid by means of the exemption limits and child additions.  Persistently following this policy in recent years has produced a tax system which would have been virtually unimaginable in 1987, with much better provision for the low-paid, especially those with families, much lower tax rates and a much wider standard band.  This year's budget represented a substantial step forward in this process, and has provided us with a simpler, fairer and less onerous tax system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1504" /> Senator Doyle and others spoke about a simpler and fairer system and I totally agree with that and I hope we will have an opportunity of dealing with it later. At last we have an income tax system with tax rates of 27 and 48 per cent, a manufacturing tax of 10 per cent, corporation tax of 40 per cent, capital gains tax of 40 per cent and the wear and tear allowances on the straight line system. This is a far simpler and a more satisfactory tax system, and as I said in the other House, it is the persistence in doing the same thing over a number of years that makes for a simpler and fairer system.  I will not go into the arguments about how simple and how fair we can make it, but I agree with the concept that we must work to that end in so far as is possible.</P>
    <P>These general improvements have been accompanied by base-broadening measures which are designed to further the Government's general policy that, as far as possible, income, however received, should be subject to taxation. Of course, they also release funds to help ensure that the rates of tax to which income is subject are brought as low as possible, consistent with equity and the need to generate revenue to meet expenditure. I know that the loss or phasing out of these reliefs may have had an impact on different groups but this has to be seen in the context of the improvements in the mainstream income tax code introduced not just this year but over the past number of years.  I would also like to make the point that it was always inherent in the strategy of widening the tax base and reducing tax rates that there would be trade-offs between on the one hand, improvements in the mainstream income tax regime and, on the other hand, curtailment of reliefs which benefit limited groups or sectors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This was common ground among the proponents of tax reform and was explicitly stated by the Commission on Taxation.  The Commission said in its first report: &ldquo;tax reform is a collection of measures, each of which affects some individuals adversely and others favourably.  Those who will not benefit are those who are over favourably treated under the existing system&rdquo;.  That has been the concept of all of our reports on taxation.  That is now what is happening. As I said several times during recent months in debates on these issues, it is fairer to take away reliefs available in some cases, to a few hundred, in others to a few individuals and in other cases to a few thousand, and to spread those benefits over the 750,000 taxpayers who pay PAYE in particular.</P>
      <P>Of course I recognise that more remains to be done in the income tax area and I would emphasise to the House that the Government's firm intention is to continue our endeavours to lower tax rates and increase the basic personal allowances and, I emphasise, widening the standard band.  Tax reform must, of course, as the Review of the Programme for Government makes clear, be conducted within the overriding parameters of sound budgetary policy.</P>
      <P>Some Senators were of the view that the Bill will do little to increase employment and that some aspects of it, notably the proposed DIRT provisions, are damaging to enterprise.  Other Senators made the opposite point on DIRT and asked why DIRT was only available to £50,000 because all of the money would go out of the country if it was confined.  They have answered each other and so there is no great need for me to go into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that people involved in <Col N="1506" /> major capital investment or major productive investment will not be curtailed one way or the other.  The reality is that we have about £3,500 million reserves in the State and it is well known &mdash; as I said in my speech this morning &mdash; that the banking groups were getting ready &mdash; at least they hinted &mdash; to advise people on how to move their money.  That would have immediately lead to increased interest rates and would have gone in all the wrong directions.  As Senator Conroy informed the House, since we started this debate thankfully one of our banks has reduced its interest rates and that is what I hope to see the other banks doing.  The last thing we want is our reserves to leave the country.  That would automatically push up interest rates which would stop investment, stop productive action within the economy and increase unemployment even further.  I will not go into that in great detail again other than to say to Senators who were not here this morning that if they read the arguments I made about the employment aspects they will see what is happening.  The employment figures are holding quite well here thanks to the public and private sectors.  Non-agricultural employment is not disimproving.  The difficulties are because of the global recession.  In some countries at least, like the United States and Canada, the recession seems to be coming to a halt or is reversing very dramatically.  We will have to wait to see what happens in the United Kingdom.  It is too early yet.  The ability of our labour force to move to some of these economies is not there at present, not that we want to see them go but that is a reality.  Our labour market is growing more quickly than we would, even in good times, be able to cope with.  I recognise that we have to do more and I am not arguing against that.  I am on public record many times expressing my views on what can be done.</P>
    <P>Let me outline the connection between tax reform and the creation of jobs.  It is accepted that the increasing burden of income tax on wages had an impact on wage movements for much of the eighties with adverse consequences for this country's <Col N="1507" /> international competitiveness and probably for employment.  Developments since 1987 have operated in the opposite direction.  The Government are pursuing a policy of widening the tax base and using the proceeds of this base-broadening to reduce tax rates and to increase the width of the standard tax band.  The effect of this policy is to reduce the income tax bills faced by taxpayers. Under the provisions of this Bill, for instance, about 750,000 taxpayers will face lower tax bills this year than they would have otherwise.  In fact, as a result of the mainstream tax improvements, an employee getting the basic <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> pay increase this year will actually see his or her take-home pay increase by a bigger percentage.</P>
    <P>What we are aiming at in the income tax area is structural change that will make the system overall more conducive to employment creation.  The likely impact will necessarily be gradual, as the effect of lower income tax bills continues to exert an influence on both wage demands and on the tax wedge.  Reducing the burden of income tax helps to reduce the cost of labour and this will increase the demand for labour above what it would otherwise be.  I could go on at length about budgetary matters and the incentives for employers.  They are not in the Finance Bill; they are funded between the Exchequer and the European Social Fund and Senators are aware of that.</P>
    <P>Turning then to the new DIRT provisions in the Bill, I cannot pretend that the proposals are desirable from a purely tax viewpoint.  I have heard the complaints of those commentators who have criticised the special savings accounts for rewarding unduly those who are risk averse.  I do not think that an income tax rate of 10 per cent on savings, when other income is liable to tax at higher rates, is something we would willingly choose. But the special savings accounts are the lesser of two evils.  With the coming of the Single Market, Irish savers will be free to open accounts outside the jurisdiction <Col N="1508" /> where no withholding taxes on interest income will apply, and no tax might ever be paid in practice.  The Government could not ignore the risks inherent in this situation for the stability of our monetary system and for the future of interest rates.  While I can understand the viewpoint of those who have criticised the special savings accounts, I have heard no alternative proposals which would deal with the threat posed by the coming of the Single Market.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested in another context that the special savings accounts are intended to be a mechanism through which money which was exported illegally may be facilitated to return.  I would be surprised if the accounts were to have this effect.  While financial institutions offering these accounts will not have to make returns to Revenue of interest paid on the accounts each year, it will still be open to Revenue to inquire from taxpayers about the source of money if, for instance, during the course of an audit they should become aware that a taxpayer holds such an account. That is the answer to the question raised by Senator Doyle.  These accounts do not provide any guarantee of immunity from Revenue scrutiny about the source of the money in such an account.  In these circumstances, it would be surprising if these accounts were to receive significant amounts of funds formerly held illegally abroad.</P>
    <P>Senator Upton referred to the changes I have made to the budget proposals in relation to benefit-in-kind on company cars.  I want to emphasise that what is being taxed is the availability for private use of a car provided by an employer. There is no question of the business use of the car being taxed.  Other Senators made that point, including some of my colleagues.  I am surprised that, four months after the proposals were announced people still do not understand it.  There is no tax on the employment use or the work use of the car.  It is agreed that the value of an employer giving a car to an employee for their work use and their personal use is 40 per cent.  That has been worked out in many surveys.  The <Col N="1509" /> private use of the car has nothing to do with the use of the car for business purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I could go into it in great detail but that is it basically.  There is no question of it being on the business use. The old rates were too low compared with the cost of private motoring.  Tapering relief started too early, it started at a level of 10,000 business miles a year which works out at an average of about 40 miles a day.  There is no way anyone can argue that 40 miles a day is high business mileage.  Under the old system such a relief could wipe out the complete BIK charge.  This was unrealistic because there is always some benefit in having a company car for private use in the evenings or at weekends.</P>
      <P>I have had a number of meetings with a number of groups representing commercial travellers and company representatives and my officials met others. I proposed to the Government that they agree that certain changes should be made which would reduce the impact of the BIK increases particularly on employees such as company representatives and commercial travellers who have very high business mileage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to stress again that the BIK charge only arises where the company car is available for private use.  The benefit-in-kind charge does not apply where the employee arranges with his employer that he will not have use of the car other than for business purposes.  In that regard I tried to assist the representatives and they told me that the figure they came up with is about 3,800 but the international survey in <i>The Financial Times</i> a few months ago showed that we were at the top of the OECD list as far as business cars in the State was concerned, at 94,500 cars.  Senators can see very clearly if remuneration is going to be based on people getting cars it is totally unreasonable on <Col N="1510" /> people who are paying standard tax and higher tax.  It makes an absolute nonsense of the system.  I have moved in some way to try to help those on high mileage, who would be company representatives by and large.  There are difficulties with that system also but at least we have tried to deal with the point.</P>
    <P>Various Senators, including Senators Doyle and Upton, have made the point that taxation should not apply to the smaller co-ops and that the exemption, which has existed up until 1 April should be continued in their case.  From a tax policy point of view it would, however, be invidious to discriminate on the basis of size and such an approach would not be acceptable.  There are already several measures in the Bill which address the changeover from exempt to taxable status for the co-ops and I want to thank Senators for acknowledging that.  These are of particular relevance to the smaller co-ops who are not involved in manufacturing and whose activities will, therefore, be taxable at the standard rate of 40 per cent.  In section 48 a phasing arrangement is provided in which co-op profits will retain a two-thirds exemption from 1992 and a one-third exemption from 1993.  Only those profits arising from 1994 onward will be fully taxable.</P>
    <P>As an additional measure, net losses which a co-op may have incurred while the exemption was in place may be used as a set-off against taxable income from 1 April 1992.  Senator Ó Cuív picked up that point but it is a substantial one particularly for the small co-ops.  ICOS, who have been a very diligent and hardworking group in the interests of their members, have made the point to me that this would be beneficial.  I want to put on the record of the House and for the information of Senators that it is there and there is no time limit on that.  They can go back into the distant past.  The overall effect of these provisions will be to greatly ease the transition from exempt to fully taxable status.  I want to emphasise that I included these provisions after taking into consideration the representations from ICOS and from other individual co-ops, both large and small.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1511" /> Senators will appreciate that the fundamental thrust of tax policy is to abolish shelters and reliefs in order to fund reductions in income tax.  I want to thank Senators for their support in that policy. The co-ops tax exemption was a quite exceptional concession and its retention would have been inequitable.  As with all economic entities the co-ops should be taxed.  In cases where they are not making profits, taxation will not be a factor and where only small profits are being made, any tax charge will not be of significance.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle said that the Finance Bill does not truly reflect a tax reform programme.  Needless to say I disagree with that.  The changes in capital gains tax represent a radical reform of the capital gains tax code.  The tiered rate system, where the rate of tax depended on the length of time the asset was owned, has been abolished and replaced by a single tax rate of 40 per cent.  A single rate was recommended by the Commission on Taxation a long time ago but I thought it was advisable to move to that.  It will do away with the need for schemes such as those involving the use of loan notes which were developed to avoid the top rate of tax.  The annual gains exemption was also reduced.  This exemption encouraged the frequent turnover of investment and, therefore, encouraged short term rather than long term investments. The new exemption is sufficient to keep those with small gains out of the tax net, while ensuring that the tax avoidance potential of the provision is greatly diminished.  Again, I take Senator Ó Cuív's point; this removes a lot of paperwork from that area.</P>
    <P>In addition to these changes, the capital gains tax code is streamlined by the closing of three tax avoidance loopholes. Senator Ó Cuív spoke at some length about that.  The first involves the abuse of the relief available to a trader putting assets of a business into a company.  This provision is designed to facilitate the incorporation of sole traders.  By confining the relief to those transferring assets for bona fide commercial reasons, <Col N="1512" /> the abuse of this relief will be stopped without affecting the genuine trader.</P>
    <P>The other two abuses of the capital gains tax code involve options.  Section 62 will prevent the misuse of section 9 of the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975, which was designed primarily for gifts.  This section is being used in an unintended way in order to reduce or eliminate capital gains tax on the disposal of certain shares.  Section 63 closes off a scheme which was designed to use options in the sale of shares in a private company worth £2.5 million in order to avoid capital gains tax on the sale.  Section 63 also changes the treatment of quoted options to ensure that there is no tax barrier to the development of a quoted options market in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle asked about the staffing of the head office which will oversee this new tax.  I want to thank her for her supportive comments about the decisions on that.  At the time of publication of the Finance Bill I indicated that there will be a decentralised head office, with staffing of over 30 officers, to oversee the administration of the new vehicle registration tax.  This office is to be based initially in Rosslare pending the building of new decentralised Government offices in Wexford.  As regards absorbing surplus Customs officers I can say that there will be sufficient new posts in Rosslare initially and later in Wexford to do so.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard asked why the new arrangements for taxing pub licences do not apply to clubs.  While the turnover basis for changing excise duty on certain liquor licences does not apply to pubs, I would point out to the Senator that the duty on annual club certificates is increased to £400, from £100, in the Bill. I am sure the Senator will agree that the duty charged on pubs and hotels in the lower turnover brackets is favourable by comparison.</P>
    <P>The Senator who was thankful to me for my remarks about the pubs and the changes in the pubs unashamedly hung his colours to the mast in regard to those for whom he was lobbying.  Sometimes it is difficult to know who Deputies and Senators are lobbying for but not in this <Col N="1513" /> case.  The city vintners said to me that two-thirds of the pubs would be paying the £200 rate and they would all go bankrupt if it was any more than £200.  I am sure it will be said that clubs will almost go out of existence if you follow the logic; I say that in jest because I believe neither argument.  We will see how it works for a while and then perhaps return to what is a more realistic assessment.  I thank Senators who were grateful for the changes but I want to say very clearly that these changes are on ice as far as I am concerned.  It is based on good faith that we can make the system work.</P>
    <P>As I said on Committee and Second Stage I spent a lot of time talking to the vintners' lobby and I decided to make these concessions to give them an opportunity to come into line.  I know that end of the profession fairly well and I have listened very carefully to what many members of the profession have told me about the rates.  The profit used to be about 34 per cent but is now in excess of 40 per cent in most cases.  I find it rather hard to believe that a £200 licence will have any great effect but we will continue to monitor it carefully.</P>
    <P>In reply to Senator Howard, in my city there are the same number of licences as there were in 1908 and there are now 600,000 more people in the city.</P>

      <P>I would also have to remind Senator Doyle and Senator Howard and any other people who are close to the pub lobby that in the past five or six years while the excise on drink has not increased, that percentage has been taken by way of profits and the mark-up along with the percentage for pay rates under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  I will not trouble the House to go into what that means to profit margins but we have to take these issues into account when we are looking at the issue.  Senator Howard will probably forgive Revenue then for being careful about what happens in <Col N="1514" /> these areas.  It is all about equity and fairness but we have given a short break on these matters so we can see what the position is but they will remain under review so far as I am concerned.</P>
      <P>Senator Doyle referred to the multiplicity of VAT rates currently in our system saying this did not fit in with the EC proposals for a dual VAT structure. I would like to point out that this original commission proposal has been overtaken by events and that last June, the ECOFIN adopted a much more flexible structure which enables member states to adopt a range of rates depending on budgetary and other considerations.  The original proposals were that each member state would have two VAT rates, one standard rate of between 14 and 20 per cent and a reduced rate of between 4 and 9 per cent. The new proposals, as amended by the Council of Ministers, provide that member states will have one standard rate which will be 15 per cent or greater. In addition the option is available and I stress that this is an option, to have one or two reduced rates, which must be 5 per cent or greater.  In addition there are transitional arrangements which will allow Ireland to keep our zero rate for the time being as well as our special low livestock rate.  This arrangement could, therefore, result in a single rate, a two rate or a multi-rate system depending on the policy of individual member states. The VAT rate changes adopted in the last three budgets are prefectly consistent with this proposal.</P>
      <P>With regard to possible replacement measures to make good the revenue loss arising from the abolition of VAT at the point of entry, I am not yet in a position to give precise information on these because analysis of various alternatives is still under way in my Department.  I can assure Senator Doyle that as soon as this exercise is completed we will make public the result because I know it is important for the various sectors to make the arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Senators who gave a general welcome to the provisions in relation to Revenue powers.  A number of Senators referred to the need for restraint <Col N="1515" /> by Revenue in using the new powers.  I want to make it clear that the Board of the Revenue Commissioners are fully conscious of this aspect and had assured me before they got these powers, that the officers concerned would receive appropriate training and guidance in the use of the new powers.  I would again emphasise, as I did in my opening speech, that the compliant taxpayer has no grounds for concern.  What I want and what the general public want is that Revenue should use the powers available to them to ensure that those who fail to pay taxes properly due can be detected and successfully prosecuted and that avoidance practice can be addressed promptly.</P>
    <P>I will just say to Senator Howard and to the other Senators &mdash; the same as I have said in relation to pubs and other matters &mdash; that if I find these powers are not being used in the spirit in which I understand them, I will change them also.  I will just rescind them.  As Senator Doyle, Senator Batt O'Keeffe and other Senators said this morning, it is an area where we have to tread with caution.  I was rather surprised that the only people who are totally against the powers are the Labour Party.  They seem to be out of line with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  There must have been some falling out.  Congress have argued strongly for these powers.  In fact last Sunday when a Sunday paper got a headline wrong even though the substantive argument in the article was right, the first people to condemn me out of court was the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Consequently, I was rather taken aback to be castigated by the Labour Party today for trying to ensure that defaulters and others who do not pay their taxes should get away scot free.  I assure the House that the powers will be used cautiously.  There was another issue which Senator Costello raised on which there was a difference with Senator Upton.  Maybe it is merely a point of difference within the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>I take Senator Costello's point on clarification and I have given an assurance to both the Taxation Institute and to the <Col N="1516" /> chartered accountants and the other accountants body that rather than having argument or confusion about any of the new sections a statement of practice will be drafted in consultation with the professionals. In this way data that is required will be set out for business people so that they are not gathering and collecting information that no one will ever use.  This statement of practice will be worked out by the respective presidents of the relevant institutes and Revenue immediately on the passage of this Bill.  I am glad to see that the professional interests have welcomed that.</P>
    <P>It is strange that in political life the atmosphere can change dramatically within a relatively short time in regard to the same subject.  I am sure that if I was in this House at the start of the session last October, and dealing with the subject under discussion, everyone would have said: &ldquo;What we need are increased Revenue powers.  Look at what has been happening right through September and October.  This cannot go on.  The whole system is failling apart.  The country's credibility is down the tubes&rdquo;.  Six months later everyone stands up and says: &ldquo;What are we doing?  We are hammering people. This is awful abuse.  It is right-wing fascism&rdquo;. However, after 15 years in the Dáil, such contradictions go in one ear and out the other.  I have given a commitment to ensure that these new powers, under the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, will be properly used and monitored.  If the powers are too strong, they will be rescinded, if they are too weak they will be strengthened.  I want to thank particularly Senator Doyle for a very balanced understanding of what I am doing on this particular issue.</P>
    <P>Senator Batt O'Keeffe and Senator Doyle put forward some good proposals. Senator Doyle asked me to look into the matter of the district service companies. I will do that.  She mentioned Brendan Logue of the IDA.  A Mr. McGoldrick, who was an unemployed man from Sligo, brought forward proposals to me in that regard also.  I have promised both of them that I will examine the proposals.  I give <Col N="1517" /> that assurance to the Senator, to, and I will pass the proposals to the Department of Social Welfare also asking them for a detailed and critical assessment.  I see merit in them if they can be operated. They are not unlike the small co-operative areas where people are working for themselves.  Any initiative that is in that area deserves a full examination and assessment and I am undertaking to do so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1518" /> I thank the Senators for their time and their patience during what I think has been a good debate.  I assure Senators that we have taken note of the various other points raised and will follow them up.  Where I think it is necessary to do so, I will send an individual letter to the Senator involved.</P>

      <P>I move recommendation No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 22, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) This section shall not apply to persons whose employment requires the fulltime use of a car supplied by their employers.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I recognise that the Minister dealt with much of the contents of recommendation No. 2 in his reply on Second Stage, but he will be aware of the enormous disquiet among those who need to use their cars for full-time employment and, indeed, whose employment specifically requires the full-time use of a car supplied to them by their employers.  I ask the Minister to accept this recommendation as it puts on the record specifically the assurances he gave verbally in his reply on Second Stage.  It would remove the anxiety that is being caused by this section and the changes in the benefit-in-kind requirements generally.  I await the Minister's response.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Doyle's concern relates to high mileage drivers and how we would phase the tax for them.  It will be on an increasing sliding scale of 5 per cent to 25 per cent over the next five year period.  It is fair and also gives them an opportunity to adjust to the new position.  I accept that high mileage drivers are unlikely to have the same benefit from the use of the car.  They have pointed out to me that the last thing they want to do on a Friday night when they return from work is to use the car for personal purposes over the weekend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of the rate being 25 per cent from day one, it will be 5 per cent for the first year.  This addresses the problem from the point of view of company representatives. We would like to make this provision tighter but we looked at definitions which the company representatives submitted &mdash; they had their own advisers &mdash; and at the end of the day they accepted that there was no system where we could <Col N="1520" /> ring-fence 3,800 drivers out of a total of 94,500 drivers.  If we were to have any other definition, everyone would return forms saying that they too were high mileage drivers and claim that they were driving to the airport when they were driving home.  This section addresses the company representatives and the high mileage drivers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that there are specific types of employment and job descriptions which would make it easy to distinguish people who use their car on a full-time basis for their employment &mdash; for example, sales representatives who are on the road from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. from Monday to Friday on a constant basis and for whom the car is a tool of their trade?  I am not talking about people who use the car for a minimal amount of time in relation to their job, but people for whom the car is almost the sole tool of their trade.  It would be very easy to distinguish, by their job description, who these people are and I ask that they be exempt completely from this section rather than applying the sliding scale that the Minister has suggested.</P>

      <P>I looked at the section and I want to bring it back to basics.  I am thinking of individuals who have to drive 20 or 30 miles to their job every day.  They must have a car to get to their place of employment but they get no perks, good, bad or indifferent, but yet they must use their cars every day, five days a week.  They look at people who are using a car as a tool of their trade and say that up to now they have been doing particularly well.  If we examine what the Minister is doing here, we are talking about any sales person who drives in excess of 15,000 miles a year.  For a sales person, that is not a lot of mileage in a year; any politician knows we travel in excess of 30,000 miles a year.  The cost of this measure to the individual this year is £2 per week, not a major imposition.  In the circumstances and given the changes that the Minister has brought in, it is a fair and reasonable charge.  I would not <Col N="1521" /> quibble with the changes that the Minister has brought in the terms of the benefits-in-kind.</P>

      <P>This section terminates the concessionary tax treatment available in respect of share options granted under the approved share options scheme on or after 29 January last.  The share options granted before the date are not affected by the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Share options are rights to acquire shares in a company and are often given to directors and favoured employees of a company as part of a remunerations package.  Section 10 of the Second Schedule to the Finance Act, 1986 provided a concessionary tax regime for share options granted under approved share option schemes which provided broadly that a participant in an approved scheme would not suffer any income tax charge or any gain arising from the grant or exercise of a share option.  Instead a capital gains charge arose on the total, that is, the difference between the indexed actual cost of acquiring the shares and the sale proceeds, if any, arising from the shares if and when they are sold.  In the case of manufacturing companies in Shannon there was a significant concession in that the period of ownership of the shares which determines the rate of capital gains tax began at the date in which the option to buy the shares was granted and not on the date on which the option was exercised and the shares <Col N="1522" /> acquired as in the normal rule of determining the rate of capital gains tax.</P>
    <P>The termination of the concessionary tax treatment for the approved share options scheme is in line with the commitment given in the review of the Programme for Government for a radical overhaul of the tax code involving a curtailment, on a phased basis of the range of exemptions, shelters and concessionary tax rates.  The Senator will agree that the favourable treatment of share options under the approved share options scheme was generous.  It was difficult to justify that to ordinary taxpayers who generally do not benefit from them in any way. The abolition of the concessionary tax treatment is in line with the recommendations of the Commission of Taxation. What will happen is that share options granted on or after 29 January, budget day, will be subject to the general tax treatment of options and the recipient will be charged income tax when the option is exercised.  As I said, that is where shares are acquired under the option on the market value of the shares at the time they are acquired, less any acquisitions costs which includes the cost of the option.  When the shares are eventually sold the capital gains tax will be charged on the difference, if any, between the indexed market value of the shares on the date of acquisition.  For the information of the Senator, and the House, the figure for this year is estimated at £1.2 million for this year and at £1.4 million in the full year.</P>

      <P>There was a good deal of public debate about this provision when the Bill was published.  There is still some confusion and as the Bill is now going through the final stages in the Seanad <Col N="1523" /> this evening will the Minister deal with disability benefits and taxation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The section is an enabling provision to cater for the announcement, as Senator Honan said, that certain short term social welfare benefits are to be brought in to charge to income tax.  The benefits in question are disability benefit, occupational injuries benefit, unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit.  When brought into charge to tax the benefits will be regarded as emoluments for the purpose of and taxed under the PAYE system.  As I indicated in my Second Stage speech, there are oprational difficulties involved in taxing the benefits, for example, the potential interaction between employers, the Department of Social Welfare, the Revenue Commissioners and the large number of benefit claimants.  These difficulties are at present being examined with a view to devising a system to keep the interaction to a minimum and so as to reduce the administrative burden on all concerned, including the benefit recipients.  Until these difficulties are resolved, I am not in a position to announce a commencement date for taxation but the section provides power to bring in taxation by order on a phased basis if considered appropriate.  A draft of any such order would have to be approved by Dáil Éireann before it can be made.  I indicated this morning the lines on which the consideration is proceeding in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the operation arrangements for implementing this taxation, discussions are ongoing with the Department of Social Welfare and the Revenue Commissioners.  I am hopeful that a limited form of taxation of disability benefit for those in employment may be introduced later this year and while it is the Government's intention that taxation of unemployment benefit will begin in 1993, I would also like to emphasise to the Seanad that the taxation of these benefits <Col N="1524" /> is basically a matter of equity.  There is no reason why the benefits, which are substitutions for taxable employment income, should not also be chargeable to tax.  Non-taxation gives rise to anomalies in the tax treatment of different individuals with the same level of income and, by contrast, my intention is to try to ensure that, as far as is possible, income, however received, is regarded as income for tax purposes.</P>
    <P>It has also been suggested on a number of occasions that non-taxability of the payments gives rise to absenteeism and is a disincentive to work.  That is continually raised by the Federation of Irish Employers whenever they undertake any studies or whenever there is research done by academics on the question of absenteeism.  This would not arise if the relevant social welfare benefits were taken into account for tax purposes which is what the section proposes.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that what happened over a long number of years was that in the last number of weeks in a tax year, people on certain rates of pay with certain benefits under PRSI found that they would be in a better position if they were not working than if they were working. This provision will end that.  I would emphasise that the extent &mdash; to which taxation will arise will essentially depend on the amount of other income the individual has in the tax year.  It is not a question of a person paying tax on disability benefit.  If no other income is involved, then they will not pay tax.  That is the key point.  There is no taxation on disability benefit in its own right.  It is only when it is joined to some other income.</P>
    <P>It is a fair system but the difficulty is to get the systems and the same computers to work together.  They were formulated and developed in different times.  As soon as that is sorted out I will be able to give the Oireachtas an idea of how this system can work.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Section 16 agreed to.</P>

      <P>Recommendations Nos. 3 to 11 form a composite proposal and may be discussed together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 27, line 10, to delete &ldquo;£2,000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£4,000&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister on the provisions in section 16 that we have just passed in relation to foreign adoptions, the capital gains tax Acts and the general tax Acts. It is a very positive step and is to be welcomed.  Indeed, many to whom it will apply probably do not realise that this provision has been incorporated in the Bill and it deserves to be recognised.</P>
      <P>Regarding section 17, and the list of recommendations, I will not pretend that I am overly optimistic that the Minister will take all of them on board.  I await the Minister's explanation of what he is trying to achieve in this section.</P>
      <P>Approved profit sharing schemes have, over the years, been a tremendous boon to enterprise and encouraged investment in industries.  I fail to understand what the Minister is trying to achieve by reducing the ceiling.  I ask him to delete the £2,000 ceiling.  It was £5,000 and the Minister proposes to reduce it to £2,000. I would like him to substitute a ceiling of £4,000.  Ideally, I would like him to leave the ceiling at £5,000; I would ask him to justify why the figure of £4,000 should not be substituted for £2,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also ask the Minister to allow for a roll-over, in other words, if an individual did not make use of the full £2,000 he is allowed in relation to the profit-sharing scheme in any one year that he would, in the subsequent year or in any three years, be allowed the benefit of a £6,000 ceiling. The explanatory memorandum states that the section allows for shares in excess of a value of £2,000 to be appropriated to an individual in the years 1992-93 if in the year 1991-92 no shares, or shares to a value of less than £2,000, were appropriated to him.  I presume where one reads &ldquo;him&rdquo; one could read &ldquo;her&rdquo; also. <Col N="1526" /> Could the Minister elaborate on what he means by this?  He is allowing a roll-over from one year to another but could he build this in as part of the scheme where, if in any particular year, an individual was not in a position to avail of a profit-sharing scheme to the limit of £2,000 in the subsequent year he could have a maximum of £4,000 or in any three years, £6,000, or a similar type scheme that was not totally restricted on an annual basis?</P>
    <P>People have good and bad years in business.  Some years there may be a little surplus after the Revenue Commissioners have relieved us of at least 25 per cent if not 48 per cent of what we have earned.  Having paid these taxes, if people have money left over in one year but not in the subsequent year, they should be allowed to roll-over their entitlements under this section and I ask the Minister to strongly consider this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that there was quite a lot of concern about the issue Senator Doyle mentioned.  I thank the Minister for amending this section in the Dáil.  The ceiling is now £2,000 but I notice that in the years following 1992-93 additional allocations will be available. Senator O'Keeffe made a number of recommendations to which the Minister listened and he amended this section.  I do not have any trouble with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Honan for thanking me for changing the original decision.  In the examination of the curtailment of reliefs and exemptions, and particularly on the profit-sharing share options and the purchase of shares in companies, the Government decided these were shelters that were distorting the system.  They were all abolished.  Following on that, a strong lobby across the board &mdash; the Federation of Irish Employers, the Construction Industry Federation, the Congress of Trade Unions and a number of other bodies, including the profit-sharing association who originally put this proposal to the Government and which was <Col N="1527" /> implemented by Deputy John Bruton &mdash; argued that for industrial relations reasons and in order to get additional productivity and activity in companies, it was a scheme worthy of some merit and they more or less accepted my arguments for the abolition of the other schemes; as the Commission on Taxation reported some years ago, some of these abolitions hurt some people but benefit the greater number of people.</P>
      <P>On that basis I said I would take another look at the scheme.  We spoke to a number of firms and received representations from many more.  My officials met with several firms that used this scheme.  On balance, the scheme was used mainly by multinationals and by companies for their more senior directors, but only a small number of companies used it for their ordinary employees.  I was involved with the Basil Chubb committee who were working with the Federation of Irish Employers and the Congress of Trade Unions trying to implement some of these schemes in order to help worker participation in industry.  It did not meet with great success and when we were trying to promote it we did not get much support from the trade unions.  However, people said it was a scheme that should be continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We then looked at the use of the scheme by companies who appropriated shares to the value of £5,000.  From the records of the Revenue Commissioners the profit-sharing association, it seemed that well in excess of 50 per cent of companies had been appropriating shares to the value of £1,000 a year.  The profit-sharing association reckoned that &mdash; they did not have factual figures &mdash; over 90 per cent had been using it to a value of £1,400 to £1,500.  At a meeting with the profit-sharing association it was suggested that rather than letting the scheme be used by people who were displaced from other share option schemes and the purchase of shares in companies, we should keep it in its present form, perhaps extend it to more companies and use the £2,000 limit which effectively brought in all the known companies that <Col N="1528" /> the profit-sharing association were aware of.  Guinness were the exception because they felt they would be able to live with some cost to themselves and they agreed with the £2,000 ceiling.</P>
    <P>In reply to Senator Doyle, the £2,000 limit keeps the principle of the scheme and keeps it for the great majority of people who would be using it.  There is no disimprovement in the scheme for those who have been using it.  If we were to change it to £5,000 it would not benefit those who were using it because none of them exceeded £2,000, but it would benefit those who were using other schemes, such as higher executives on.</P>
    <P>Something that was highlighted by other companies is that before this scheme was introduced a number of companies gave Christmas bonuses.  The Christmas bonus was a cost to the employer, but by giving it in shares it was a lesser cost.  They were using this not as a new scheme, but as a substitute for the old bonus scheme.  I am not arguing that but it is a point firms will use for their own purposes.</P>
    <P>The £2,000 ceiling from 5 April last year was a once-off because I abolished this scheme on 29 January.  Therefore, companies which had not paid out in the last six year were at a disadvantage.  By bringing back the scheme I had broken the cycle.  The ceiling is up to £2,000 every year, and you cannot withdraw your money or sell your shares at the market value for five years.  It would have been unfair to somebody who was carefully building up their shares for five years.  If a company want to give £2,000 in shares for the last tax year.  I am allowing them to do so.  One of the advantages of the proposal was that it generated debate.  Up to then the vast majority of Irish workers knew nothing about it.  Perhaps companies who did not avail of it before will do so now.  If there is an argument to be made in the future that it is being used extensively, up to the limit of £2,000, some future Government may decide to extend it.  We have reinstated the scheme at a rate which is well in advance of what was the case in the past.  That is the reverse of what I <Col N="1529" /> said on budget day but it is based on the constructive arguments put forward by people from both sides of industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider this provision.  He has come along way down the road in reconsidering his views as of budget day on this issue.  He intended abolishing the scheme but not he has decided to continue it with a limit of £2,000.  I ask him to leave it at £4,000, if not the original £5,000.  I still fail to understand the arguments for fiddling around with this scheme at all.  Even the Minister's explanation argues my line on the issue in that 90 per cent of those using the scheme only use it to a ceiling of £1,400 or £1,500.  Why fiddle with it? What difference will it make to the 10 per cent who may use it up to the £5,000 limit?  On that basis, it does not need to be fiddled around with particularly since, on the Minister's admission, it has benefits. It increases productivity.  It is an incentive for profitability in a company if the workers and middle management avail of this scheme at the end of a profitable year.  It helps the whole concept of worker participation and industrial relations.  Workers feel they are part of the company, that they own a stake in the company and that it is in their interest to ensure it runs smoothly and profitably and that productivity is maximised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot, with respect to the Minister and the Commission on Taxation, see any logic in fiddling around with the scheme that is there at the moment.  After all, it only involves £5,000 a year at most in each case.  Very few have used it up to that limit.  Why trouble the 10 per cent of a very small overall number who might want the benefit of the £5,000?  I am lost in regard to the Minister's argument.  He can be convincing and very well advised on these issues but, on his own admission, since his all out stance against this scheme on budget day he has come down the road and recognises considerable merit in it.  Given the unemployment figures, the need to increase the incentive to work generally and productivity in particular for the sake of the country and our GNP, why fiddle with a scheme that may be <Col N="1530" /> marginal in terms of its overall effect but is very important to those who use it?  I urge the Minister to reconsider what he is proposing in this instance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try again.  The point I was trying to make was that by keeping the scheme at a limit of £2,000 it covers those who presently use it, with the exception of a handful.  I have abolished the other share option schemes that were there for people who had a greater number of shares, up to 19,000 and over. If we leave a figure of £5,000 those people will all move to the extent of £5,000 and for every individual who does so we forego £2,480 in tax.  That is the cost to the ordinary taxpayer.</P>

      <P>It helps to give an incentive to the ordinary worker and we are keeping it for that reason.  But to follow the Senator's logic, 750,000 PAYE workers would move to this scheme to the extent of £5,000 which, would cost the Exchequer near enough to £2,400 so that we would forego a huge amount in revenue.  I accept the argument that it is the only scheme for the small ordinary <Col N="1531" /> person.  That is why I have maintained it. The Senator's argument would be right if no new person joined the scheme and nobody went over the £1,400 threshold. In that case there would be no cost to the State.  We have reinstated the scheme and it can be monitored in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>It is not something I would change now just to see what would happen.  If people were at the limit of £2,000, we would have to look to see if it should be extended.  At £1,400 or £1,000 there is a cost foregone but some of these people would be on the standard rate and some would be at 48 per cent.  Roughly it would be a little under £1,000 so it is reasonable enough.  If it were there for everybody it would cause difficulty.  We will see the effect of it in the future.</P>

      <P>I move recommendation No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 41, subsection (1), line 35, after &ldquo;apron&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;or airport hangar&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section amends section 255 of the Income Tax Act 1967.  My recommendation asks the Minister to include airport hangars as well as airport runways and &mdash; an airport apron.  The amendment is self-explantory and I await the Minister's explanation as to why airport hangars <Col N="1532" /> could not have been considered in the original change, which I welcome.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to seriously consider the points made in the recommendations that have been disallowed and to refer to them when replying.  I am not sure if these would have been brought to his attention or if he knows what the disallowed recommendations were about as well as those that were in order.  Technically, I understand why it was disallowed. It refers to subsection (2) of this section which, if the amendment was accepted, would read: &ldquo;(2) subsection (1) shall have effect in relation to capital expenditure incurred on or after the 24th day of April 1991.&rdquo;  I ask the Minister to give this serious consideration.  I have a feeling that even if the Minister agreed with my argument, because of the role of the Seanad in regard to the Finance Bill, he could not accept my amendment.  This is an issue he might seriously look at favourably particularly with an autumn Finance Bill promised.</P>
    <P>Galway Aviation Limited have undertaken in the past 12 months a development from a green field site of a new airport in Inverin, County Galway.  This is to service Aer Aran's Aran Islands service.  While this is a local problem it is a very important one for the west.  This initiative was taken by the company without the benefit of any grants, financial assistance or gurantees from any Government Department, Údarás na Gaeltachta or the EC.  They did not get assistance from anybody.  Despite the fact that this service is non-commercial, it is funded by those who have the best interests of the west at heart, people who are concerned about accessibility to the Aran Islands by the natives and tourists.</P>
    <P>The company, spent £750,000 on this airport project of which £500,000 relates to the runways and aprons and was largely expended prior to 24 April 1992, the date referred to in section 27 (2).</P>
    <P>The airport development was undertaken with the twin aims of providing for and improving the vital economic and social links between the Aran Islands and the mainland and attracting and providing a service for tourists.  We cannot <Col N="1533" /> argue with those aims.  The airport has been operating since 14 April this year and already the shorter flying time to the islands have been well received by the islanders and others availing of the service.</P>
    <P>Galway Aviation Limited is the only developer of a new airport and, as far as can be ascertained, this is the only company that has incurred expenditure which might have qualified under the provision to extend industrial building allowances to airport runways and aprons. There is no other company, as far as can be ascertained, that might qualify for this extension of the definition in this section. It would seem unfortunate, and significantly unfair, that the company should now narrowly fail to qualify for the relief under the new provision.</P>
    <P>Tax allowances for the development costs would obviously be of tremendous assistance in funding the very significant financing cost of the project.  The logic of extending capital allowances to expenditure in runways and airport aprons applies equally to the expenditure on airport hangars.  In fact, it may have been an oversight that airport hangars were not included.  I ask the Minister, through my recommendation, to now extend the definition to include airport hangars.</P>
    <P>In relation to this development in the west, the ceremonial turning of the first sod took place on 16 June 1991 but the development work actually commenced on 1 May 1991 so that any provision for capital allowance to apply from time prior to that date would enable the company to qualify for an allowance.  That is why I would like the Minister to look at this section and if possible insert 1991 instead of 1992.  That would enable a most important development that has not been grant-aided or subvented from any other source to become eligible.</P>
    <P>This company has demonstrated an interest in the development of the west by a continuous commitment to the Aer Aran air service despite its inability to generate anything approaching a commercial return on the investment.  I urge the Minister, given all our concerns for the west and the difficulties there, particularly <Col N="1534" /> in regard to transport and communication as we prepare for the Internal Market on 1 January next.  We have heard much about cohesion and convergence in the Maastricht Treaty and I ask the Minister to backdate this provision by 12 months and include airport hangars as part of the general definition in the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not certain what scheme Senator Ó Foighil was talking about but when Senator Doyle referred to the date of the opening I knew.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 27 extends the meaning of industrial building or structure for tax purposes to include runways and airport <Col N="1535" /> aprons.  This recommendation seeks a similar inclusion for airport hangars.  The spelling of the word &ldquo;hangars&rdquo; on the official list of recommendations &mdash; in case my friend thinks I turned against him &mdash; will not fit in with the kind offer of the individual in supplying the airport.</P>
    <P>Airport hangars in which a process akin to manufacturing has been carried on already qualifies as an industrial building for tax purposes.  An example of this would be hangars used for the repair of aircraft.  The rationale for the qualification of such hangars as industrial buildings is that they are broadly analogous to a factory.  Airport hangars which are mainly used for storage purposes do not qualify as an industrial building.</P>
    <P>Section 27 already provides a significant concession for the air transport industry in allowing runways and airport aprons to qualify as an industrial building or structure for tax purposes.  If the concession were to be extended to airport hangars generally, it would undoutedly impose an additional cost on the Exchequer.  Moreover, it would be hard to resist claims to have structures such as bus depots also treated as an industrial building or structure which would impose even more expense on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I take the Senator's point that there may be only one individual in this category and up until recently nobody other than the State would have been involved in developing airports anywhere on the island.  There is some concession in the present system.  The difficulty would be to change the date.  In tax law that is just not done.  I would hate to argue the case but a person who undertakes such a development would have been aware of the regulations at the time and undertaken the development on that basis.  I am aware that it was never expected to be a profit-making scheme.  I know that the homeland of the individuals involved had more to do with it than profits.  I am not going to argue with that.</P>
    <P>If it is not viable there would be very little use for capital allowances being set off against income in the short term.  I do not know about the possibility in the long <Col N="1536" /> term of making a substantial profit but time will tell.  In the circumstances it would not be possible to go back a year in tax law.</P>
    <P>Are we taking the two recommendations?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Recommendation No. 13 is out of order but the Minister is not precluded from saying he agrees with the spirit of the recommendation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Doyle is seeking retrospection for a tax relief.  The Legislature does not seek to tax taxpayers retrospectively, and the converse is that tax reliefs only apply from a current date. That has always been the way.  Inevitably there will always be cases where taxpayers find themselves on the wrong side of the commencement date for tax relief. It is unfortunate, but it is the nature of tax legislation.  I have sympathy with the case not just because I know the individual but because it is a scheme of some merit.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept the recommendation, because it would create a precedent that would inevitably lead to demands for similar favourable treatment from other taxpayers who might miss qualifying for tax relief by a few days or weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's response.  There are two points I would like to make.  I would have thought that given the vigorous support from this side of the House for these two recommendations, particularly the one that is in order and the point that is made in the other, it might have made it easier for the Minister to give on the issue.  I understand the sensitivity of the situation given that the developer behind Galway Aviation Limited might be a friend of his.  Surely we neutralise any potential political fingerpointing by having an all-party approach in this House in requesting the Minister to accept the two recommendations.</P>

      <P>I do not follow the logic of excluding airport hangars &mdash; however one might like to spell that word; it is a direct lift from the letter I received from the company concerned.  Maybe the company secretary could take a look at the dictionary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>If airport aprons and runways come within the extended definition at this stage, surely there is no possibility of constructing any small rural airport without some type of hangar in which to house aircraft in adverse weather, for servicing, etc.  It seems illogical to exclude airport hangars from the extended definition.  I ask the Minister to look at that again.  A rash of hangars will not be built throughout the country if the definition is extended to include hangars. How many airport hangars will be constructed if the Minister agrees to this? We are talking about the exception; there may be one or two cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider the point I made about retrospection of the commencement date on the grounds that any expenditure incurred last year would be put against profits this year, particularly if it had not been completed.  If there was a runover in terms of expenditure on the work being done, surely much of last year's work would be put into this year's calculations for tax liability? The Minister could allow one year only because of last year's expenditure being considered against this year's income, particularly when there was a runover, or he could make a recommendation because Senators cannot propose increases in expenditure.  However, <Col N="1538" /> if the Minister took the sentiments in my recommendation on board and allowed expenses incurred last year to be incorporated in this year's balancing of the tax composition for the companies involved, we would get over it.  If the Minister had the will, and without creating a precedent through retrospection, the one small unprofitable rural airport that might make good use of the provisions in this section need not be excluded.  I urge the Minister to look at this again and at the two recommendations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister the reason for the different treatment for builders' subcontractors?  I understand that they are levied at a different rate from other subcontractors in relation to the subcontractors certificate.  Is that correct and, if so, why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference is that on the C.2 certificates they are levied at 35 per cent.  That arrangement was made some years ago when concern was expressed about some of the operations in the construction industry.  The builders subcontractors are levied at 35 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The arrangement was brought in for the protection of the Revenue base, to make sure subcontractors could claim the levy back when they did their accounts.  That arrangement was considered preferable to the 27 per cent levy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider this.  It is no longer justified, given the importance of production of the tax clearance certificate, the C.2 certificate. Now that everybody is properly registered and accounted for in the system, they should not be singled out for the higher rate but should be levied at the lower rate along with all other subcontractors. I ask the Minister to consider revision.  If the change cannot be made in this Bill, could it be introduced in the second Finance Bill, due in the autumn? There is no justification in continuing the system any longer, given the regularisation of the building trade and the importance of the C.2 certificate in trying to get work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme has existed for more than 20 years.  It was introduced in the 1970 Finance Bill.  As the Senator can see, this Bill extends the scheme to other sectors in the meat processing and wood processing industries.  If we were to reconsider the scheme, it would be at some other time.  The system has worked <Col N="1542" /> well and those in the industry are used to it.  There is a necessity to extend it to some other areas.  The measure was introduced in an effort to combat the avoidance and evasion that was occurring in some sectors.  The House has been called on several times to do that.  I am not sure that it would be advisable to remove it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to let this section pass without making a comment. The Minister states that urban renewal of designated areas, which has been of extraordinary importance to the nation and to towns such as Ennis, Nenagh and Clonmel, closes a loophole.  I accept the section absolutely but I warn that in closing loopholes we should guard against damaging people who may still get concessions under this section of the Finance Bill.  That is just a warning, because all Members have witnessed urban renewal revitalise towns and be of enormous benefit to them.  We have to make sure that the loopholes are closed at the appropriate point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue arose in connection with the Temple Bar area in Dublin, but could have arisen anywhere. The loophole Senator Honan talks about is in existing legislation.  It provides that a double rent deduction in respect of rent paid on an existing industrial building in a designated area will now be available, as was the original intention of the legislation, only when the capital expenditure is incurred on refurbishment of a building in the qualifying period for the urban renewal scheme.  As the legislation stood, refurbishment would not have to be undertaken at all.  I want to make that point absolutely clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extensions to the urban renewal scheme run until the end of May 1993. The concept is to keep that work going, provided that a development has been <Col N="1543" /> commenced pior to the end of May 1993 applicants will have a year to complete the work.  Effectively, the deadline for the completion of developments is now the end of May 1994, on the basis that the work on a development has been commenced substantially by the end of May 1993.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 47 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister addressed this section specifically in his Second Stage speech today.  I welcome the changes contained in this section, which cater for the position of An Bord Bainne.  The importance of An Bord Bainne is recognised. The board fly the flag for the Irish trade mark in many different agricultural commodities.</P>
      <P>In speaking to this section and, to some extent, the next section, I ask the Minister to consider again the major difference between small developmental co-operatives and the larger, mega, plc-type co-operative structures.  I should like the Minister to determine whether he could separate the two kinds of co-operatives in relation to his proposed termination of the tax relief accorded co-operatives generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I concede that the Minister has made concessions.  Indeed, he has fairly &mdash; and, I presume, graciously &mdash; bowed to the request of his colleague and, I imagine, the Cabinet in relation to the treatment of An Bord Bainne and others by ensuring that the 10 per cent corporation tax rate will apply to sales of processed products purchased for members of An Bord Bainne, both co-operatives and non-co-operatives. The Minister conceded also that a co-operative that supplies milk to a processor engaged wholly or mainly in the manufacture of specified milk products would also be taxed at the 10 per <Col N="1544" /> cent rate.  That aspect was a cause of major concern when the Minister made his announcement on budget day in relation to the imposition of a tax on co-operatives generally.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider the provision of a two-tier tax system for co-operatives. Could he also give consideration to different treatment for the small development co-operatives &mdash; a tier of co-operatives that could effectively be considered secondary co-operatives at this stage, given the development and the progress that has been made by our better established and larger co-operatives? Many co-operatives are still extremely concerned by the provisions announced by the Minister in this area.  Perhaps co-operatives could be exempted from the new tax proposals on the basis of turnover; for example, those with a turnover of less than £100,000 per annum might be exempt in terms of the new tax proposals. In that way the continued use and the establishment of new co-operatives in rural Ireland could be encouraged.  I am a great supporter of the concept of the true co-operative system as envisaged by Horace Plunkett.  Many co-operatives, because they have grown out of their origins, have gone on to become major players in the national and international marke-place but we still have many small, local co-operatives that need all the State support they can get.  I ask the Minister to consider a ceiling on turnover &mdash; perhaps around the £100,000 mark &mdash; and exempt from the proposals contained in the Bill those co-operatives which are truly co-operative in their functioning and structure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise that the Minister has a major problem in trying to cater for all of the different sizes of co-operative structures.  If the proposal made by Senator Doyle were accepted the Minister would then create a position of unfair competition.  A family-owned hardware shop in rural Ireland, for example, would find that they were at a major disadvantage compared with a competitor who would be termed a co-operative. This is a very big issue and one <Col N="1545" /> that will have to be settled.  At present we have co-operatives listed on the Stock Exchange and we also have small co-operative movements in rural areas.  Co-operatives now sell everything from garden tools&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>But they are being taxed on their trade, like other businesses.  I am talking about the other manufacturing areas.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Co-operatives now sell everything from garden tools to combine harvesters.  Some of them have forgotten where they come from.  It is mainly farmer co-operatives we are talking about here, and in the first instance these farmers had to subscribe pound by pound in order to form those co-operatives.  The farmer, the initial subscriber, is now an insignificant element.</P>
      <P>I should prefer the Minister to give consideration at a later date to the whole definition of a co-operative.  There is much disquiet within the trade.  Those who have to survive within it find themselves in very serious difficulties in that at present advantage is given to those organisations that term themselves co-operatives.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I come from rural Ireland and I believe that I am reasonably near the grass roots.  I work with co-operative movements and I am a member of co-operative cattle marts.  I buy from, subscribe to and work with co-operative organisations.  It is my contention that on another day and in different legislation the Minister should examine the whole issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the Minister has done a reasonably good job in this legislation, that he has done as much as is possible. We should not create a two-tier system because two tiers might not be enough; <Col N="1546" /> perhaps even a six-tier system would not cater for all the different kinds of co-operatives. I hope that in the future close examination will be given to the definition of co-operatives in the market-place; whether they trade inside or outside this country and whether they are comprised of farmer participation or membership participation &mdash; the area is vast.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have spoken on this issue today.  If we were to provide for a 10 per cent rate of tax across the board there would certainly be EC implications. I realise that that is not what Senator Doyle is seeking.  I may not have been Ireland's greatest expert on co-operatives six months ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>But you are now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that I am better informed, anyway, with the help of Senator McGowan and approximately 160 other Members of the Oireachtas who are concerned about co-operatives all over the country.</P>
      <P>Whatever about the rights and wrongs of the comments made by Senator McGowan, he is right when he talks about the diversification in the range and size of co-operatives.  I shall not mention any names, because I feel that drawing attention to a half dozen huge co-operatives and the profits they make would distort the situation.  There are many co-operative organisations ranging from middle ranking ones down to the smaller sized ones.</P>
      <P>The point regarding equity has to be made.  Whatever the structure of co-operatives, and I do not criticise their structure, that is not the point of this debate. From what I have heard from deputations on both sides, including the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, and the small business people on behalf of ordinary individuals who are selling precisely the same products and trying to run a business, they must pay 40 per cent while a co-operative pays zero.  That was one of the reasons for the distortion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following discussions, tax on co-operatives was introduced at one stage, was <Col N="1547" /> taken out, was proposed at another time but did not go ahead.  I was adamant that we had to deal with this and frame the legislation as best we could to take into account the real requirements.  There were four or five of those.  The Bord Bainne issue, which Senator Doyle referred to, was resolved.  We implemented three or four rules to get it right.  At the end of the day we have been extremely generous with the interpretation and I hope it works to the benefit of all the business expansion that has been mentioned to me during the discussions.  I expect to see a considerable increase in employment in the immediate weeks ahead but we will have to wait and see if that happens.</P>
    <P>The smaller co-operatives had a complaint about milk, where they collect milk which they do not process but refer on for processing to a large or another co-operative. It is very hard to distinguish what is the small, medium or large co-operative. To keep it simple, where a co-operative is involved in liquid milk, does not process it in any way but refers it on to another co-operative for processing, they remain at the 10 per cent rate.  There are co-operatives that sell liquid milk straight to a plc or company in whatever form outside the co-operative movement; for example, co-operatives selling directly to Cadburys, Rowntree Mackintosh, Nestlé and other companies, they are at 10 per cent also.  We phased the tax over three years for the remaining groups, which gives them a chance to operate.  Many of these are fishery and other co-operatives who are earning very litle money but money is now being reinvested. Because of this tax position they are entitled to company expenses, capital allowances and so on which they did not utilise before.  Presumably they will benefit from those; it is a matter of their accounting systems.  There is no difficulty with that.  However, for those co-operatives who have set up and who have had recorded accounting losses, this can be availed of in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I have made by far the most extensive changes in the area of co-operatives.  I <Col N="1548" /> hope it works and that we have not created too many distortions for the ordinary business person.  Such distortion of trade would be unfair competition for the small, family-owned companies that have been brought to our attention.  Overall, the system is fairly good and I hope it will not be too open.  We will have to wait and see how it operates.</P>
    <P>I wish to extend my appreciation to ICOS who remained in contact throughout. If it were not for them I would not understand it all so well.  They were based in Merrion Street for the past three or four months and they fought a good battle on behalf of the co-operatives. They had to adjust their case a little; they fought on behalf of Bord Bainne initially and then on behalf of the big co-operatives. I learned a lesson from this experience and that is if you give a little, more will be sought.  I ended up giving at least half a dozen concessions to ICOS in order to resolve this.  I learned as I went along. Senator Doyle asked why I waited for Report Stage to introduce the first amendment.  In some instances that would probably be the answer and perhaps it would be a good practice for future Ministers for Finance to follow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one group of co-operatives that may have already been dealt with &mdash; if so I apologise for my intrusion at this stage &mdash; namely, livestock marts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Livestock marts are not processing outfits and they are liable for 40 per cent tax.  A livestock mart could have a very substantial turnover but yet have a very small margin of profit.  We have quite a sizeable mart in Ennis, County Clare, with branches through the county and similarly in Wexford.  They have been a matter of great concern for the Irish Co-Operative Society and I ask the Minister to address this matter, if he has not already done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This proves the point I made in my reply to Senator Doyle about <Col N="1549" /> the distinction that Senator McGowan mentioned between a big co-operative and a small co-operative.  A very small co-operative or mart can have a high turnover with low profits.  This is where the distinction lies between the big and the small co-operatives.  In this case the profit margin is very small so, therefore, the tax is on the profits.  Unlike the position in the marts, the capital allowances and the business expenses are matters that now come into play and because of the operation in the marts the tax yield cannot be high.  Some of them have had no capital investment for a long time.  In other words, they had losses.  These are matters that can now be considered in their accounting procedures, so the tax yield will not be substantial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Livestock marts at present are very expensive places for farmers to buy or sell cattle.  They were expensive even before this new tax system came into existence.  You are talking in terms of £5 or £6 per animal minimum to the seller and to the buyer, and higher depending on the price.  While we say that the marts have a narrow margin and a small profit, they are a very costly place to do business.  If the marts increase their prices too much, we will revert to the old system of selling outside the marts which is a highly organised system.  The Minister should consider the marts as a special case.  There is a vast turnover at marts, they are providing a great service to the Irish farmer and people in the cattle business generally, and they cannot be cast aside.</P>

      <P>Is section 47 agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to clarify a point raised by Senator McGowan; no one on either side is making a case for the regular trading in co-operatives to be treated differently from the other sections of retail such as hardware trading, tools and so on.  I address my remarks strictly to the original concept of co-operatives, particularly the fishery and farming co-operatives, the small co-operatives, startup <Col N="1550" /> developmental co-operatives.  I feel those who are in the manufacturing and processing area should get special treatment. With the depopulation of our rural areas and the distances from major marketplaces, with the difficulties for farmers in marketing their own produce, and the urgent need for value-added generally to be developed, particularly in the more remote areas along our seaboards and in depopulated villages, we must ensure that no tax regime, however benign the Minister might consider it, is put in place that will exacerbate the social and economic problems that exist in many parts of our country.  That is my concern.  If the Minister is not prepared to make any changes at this stage &mdash; and facing reality I believe he probably will not &mdash; will he promise a review of the operation of this section if it is seen to adversely affect those truly co-operative systems in the remote and disadvantaged areas I have just outlined?  I would like to be assured that when it comes to amending legislation a review could take place without any major difficulty and that amendments would be fairly quickly put through if there was any risk to isolate communities. Many of these communities fear greater isolation given quota restrictions both under the fisheries policy and the common agricultural policy, and everything possible must be done to increase employment and value-added in agri and fishery products.</P>
      <P>I support my colleague, Senator Hourigan's comments about livestock marts. With various Directives coming from the EC there will be a major overhaul in the livestock marts system.  These marts replace the fairs of bygone years and they remain an intrinsic part of rural trading. I presume the Minister's proposals are based on equity, but if they are seen to adversely affect a system and a network that has served the rural community well, I urge him to confirm that these proposals can be reviewed immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, if any of the proposals cause a major problem, they will be considered in the context of the budgetary circumstances at the time.  We <Col N="1551" /> must be very careful in this regard in that the Senator's argument can be turned around the other way because &mdash; and this has been pointed out to me by several people in the most isolated parts of rural Ireland &mdash; the tax exemptions that are currently enjoyed by agricultural co-operatives in many cases cannot be justified on economic or competitive grounds; most of the larger co-operatives are operating as plc's, and many of the smaller ones have their own subsidiaries which trade and export on behalf of the parent co-operative.  These co-operatives are clearly involved in commercial activities but continue to enjoy a substantial tax advantage over other commercial companies providing similar services in the sector.  The point made this evening by many Senators, including Senator McGowan, was that there was a clear distortion of trade and unfair competition. We are not talking about marts in this case but about other businesses.  I would say that in the Bord Bainne case we are in agreement.  In the area of liquid milk, the co-operatives have an overwhelming percentage of the business, but for other co-operative activities additional commercial entities are in operation.  On the basis of equity it is very simple &mdash; zero tax for the co-operative and 40 per cent for, say, a family owned company.  Should we therefore put these small family companies that have been operating in rural Ireland for generations at a disadvantage, while co-operatives can link in to various structures and put them out of business?  I am not suggesting that is what the Senator is saying but that could be the effect.</P>
      <P>I believe the ICOS have been fair. We have considered milk production and have protected it by keeping the rate at 10 per cent.  Whether the milk is going to a co-operative, a plc, to Bord Bainne or some other company, it is still 10 per cent.  In the other cases it is phased; they may use their losses but I think it is a fair deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept Senator Hourigan's point, but ICOS have already launched their proposals on rationalising the marts, which <Col N="1552" /> are divided into 12 regions.  We could probably debate all evening the reasons why it is costing £6 here and £6 there, but Agriculture is not my brief.  However, the Senator indicated where the difficulties lie.  There is an argument about efficiency and I believe ICOS are a very constructive organisation and are leading the campaign on this.  It might be moving away from the traditional marts, but what we have done is fair, not implementing this immediately, not intervening except where there are competitive distortions, and catering for reinvestment and other business allowances and expenses, so I do not believe there will be any great difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I say that I am not unaware of the view of ICOS on the co-operative marts issue because I have close liaison with them.  They are very concerned about the future viability of many of their members, be they big or small.  Many of their members have expended a good deal of money in recent months.  I am certain that the ICOS would be hoping for something significant by way of a change from the 40 per cent tax liability presently on marts. There are other non-processing co-operatives that are equally hard hit, but the most glaring examples are the livestock marts.</P>
      <P>It would be very satisfactory if the Minister would give some assurance that the matter will be considered further or, as Senator Doyle has suggested, reviewed and monitored on an ongoing basis to see how the system is working, because I believe that livestock marts in particular, and other non-processing co-operatives also, will find it extremely difficult absorb a 40 per cent tax in the future.</P>

      <P>Section 52 makes a technical amendment to section 39 (a) of the Finance Act, 1980 &mdash; 12 years ago &mdash; which provides that certain certified trading operations carried on in Shannon Airport qualify for a 10 per cent rate of corporation tax.  This section provides that, in addition to the existing circumstances in which certificates may be revoked by the Minister for Finance, the Minister may revoke a certificate where both he and the company to which it is issued are agreeable.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister comment on this section?  I have a horror of technical amendments in a Finance Act?  You are referred back to subsection after subsection, but at the end of it you find they are subject to subsections (5) and (6) in which the Minister &ldquo;may give a certificate certifying that such trading operations,&rdquo; and so on.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister translate into the vernacular for most of the mere mortals in this Chamber the parliamentary gobbledegook contained in this section?  The Explanatory Memorandum does not explain much when it comes to section 52.  I defer to Senator Honan's greater knowledge on the comings and goings at Shannon Airport, but what exactly does the section mean when it says:</P>
      <P>....The section provides that, in addition to the existing circumstances in which certificates may be revoked, the Minister for Finance may revoke a certificate where both he and the company to which it was issued are agreeable to its revocation....</P>
      <P>In what circumstances might a company be agreeable to its revocation?  It goes on to state &ldquo;and replacement with another certificate&rdquo;, another certficate of what? What is the intention of another certificate?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come back to that. If a company, for any reason, want to change that certificate; rather than amending the certificate, the best way to do it is to revoke the original certificate and issue a new one.</P>
      <P>The section makes a technical amendment to section 39 (a) of the Finance Act, 1980, which provides that certified trading operations carried on in Shannon Airport qualify for the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax.  The trading operations which qualify for the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax must be specified in the certificate.  The operations of the company are specified in the certificate.  At present, the Minister for Finance is not empowered to revoke a certificate he has given to the company unless the company ceases to trade, has gone out of existence, has failed to comply with any conditions in the certificate, or that any activity of the company has had or may have an adverse effect on the use or development of the airport, or is otherwise inimical to the development of the airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a company has a certificate which requires amendment for any of those reasons, as opposed to a certificate which is having something new added, it can be technically difficult to issue a supplementary certificate to the company. For example, occasions may arise where it is necessary to amend the range of qualifying activities specified in an existing certificate to cover activities which may not be simple or straightforward, or to amend or clarify conditions attached to a certificate.  Where somebody wants to clarify why they were given certain conditions in the first place, their type of operation may have changed, or something has occurred in the airport and there is an argument that it is inimical to the future of the airport, it would be administratively more simple and legally more obscure to be able to revoke the certificate and replace it with a new one. <Col N="1555" /> Accordingly, section 52 provides that in addition to the existing circumstances in which certificates may be revoked, the Minister for Finanace may be empowered to revoke a certificate where both he and the company have no power to revoke it except that there is agreement between the Department and the company, it must be a two way process, to which the certificate was given or agreeable to its revocation and replacement with another certificate.</P>

      <P>Sections 53 to 56, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 96, before section 57, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;57.&mdash;(1) In this section&mdash;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;agency&rsquo; means a charitable body providing development aid or emergency relief in developing countries and designated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs by order made under this section;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1557" />&lsquo;tax&rsquo; means income tax or corporation tax, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>(2)  This section applies to a gift of money which, on or after the 6th day of April, 1990, is made to an agency and is not deductible in computing for the purposes of tax the profits or gains of a trade or profession or is not income to which the provisions of section 439 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, apply.</P>
    <P>(3)  The Revenue Commissioners may consult with an agency in relation to any question which may arise in connection with subsection (2).</P>
    <P>(4)  Where a person proves he has made a gift to which this section applies and claims relief from tax by reference thereto, the provisions of subsection (5)  or, as the case may be, subsection (6)  shall apply:</P>
    <P>Provided that in determining the net amount of the gift for the purposes of those subsections, the amount or value of any consideration received by the said person as a result of making the gift, whether received directly or indirectly from an agency or any other person, shall be deducted from the amount of the gift.</P>
    <P>(5) For the purposes of income tax for the year of assessment in which a person makes a gift to which this section applies, the net amount thereof shall, subject to subsection (6), be deducted from or set off against any income of the person chargeable to income tax for that year and tax shall, where necessary, be discharged or repaid accordingly; and the total income of the person or, where the person is a wife whose husband is assessed to income tax in accordance with the provisions of section 194 (inserted by the Finance Act, 1980) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, the total income of the husband shall be calculated accordingly:</P>
    <P>Provided that relief under this Act shall not be given to a person for a year of assessment if the gift (or the <Col N="1558" /> aggregate of the net amounts of gifts) made by him in that year, being a gift or gifts, as the case may be, to which this section applies, does not exceed £100.</P>
    <P>(6)  Where a gift to which this section applies is made by a company&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the net amount thereof shall, for the purposes of corporation tax, be deemed to be a loss incurred by the company in a separate trade in the accounting period of the company in which the gift is made, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the references in subsection (5) to a year of assessment shall be construed as references to an accounting period of the company.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It fascinates me how this recommendation can be in order when an earlier recommendation of mine was not because they both seem to impose a charge on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to allow gifts of overseas development aid by individuals and the corporate sector to be eligible for tax relief at the relevant level.  This does not require a lengthy explanation.  Our television screens and radios carry stories daily of tragedies around the world, whether in Somalia, Yugoslavia or Central Africa.  There are problems all over the world.  Successive Governments have reneged on their responsibility in terms of official Government contributions to ODA.</P>
    <P>As a country we have always been extremely generous both as individuals and on a corporate basis &mdash; the private sector generally &mdash; towards overseas development aid relief of one kind or another.  It is time that non-Government organisations were recognised for the enormous work they do, and that individuals outside this House, outside the official sector, who contribute either on an individual or corporate basis, would be allowed claim tax relief on whatever gift they donate in this particular area.  I urge the Minister, without going into a detailed explanation, because the case <Col N="1559" /> makes itself, to accept this recommendation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Senator's concerns about the plight of people in the Third World.  This year £43 million has been allocated for official development assistance, representing 0.17 per cent of GNP.  This amount includes grants for educational, agricultural and infrastructural projects on a bilateral basis, mostly in Africa, as well as contributions to multilateral agencies, such as the UN. It is true that this year's allocation is slightly lower than last year's.  However, there were particular circumstances, mainly associated with the Gulf War, which boosted our ODA estimate last year.  The 1992 provision will enable us to meet all the mandatory commitments for this year and also to maintain the value of our bilateral aid in real terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Senator is aware the Government's policy remains one of commitment to the maintenance of expansion of overseas development aid as soon as economic circumstances permit. However, the continuing budgetary and economic problems facing our own country makes it impossible for the Government at this stage to expand the aid programme to the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP.  I would also remind Senator Doyle that the revised Programme for Government contains a commitment that the Government will undertake a planned programme of increases in Ireland's official development assistance so as to achieve a higher ODA-GNP contribution by the end of 1994.  While our overseas aid contributions have been given in the form of financial assistance we should not forget the great unofficial contribution made by many Irish voluntary workers overseas as well as the voluntary contributions made by the Irish public.  However, the Government have reached the limit of what we can afford as of now and to give tax concessions of the type suggested would represent a very real additional <Col N="1560" /> cost to the Exchequer which cannot be afforded at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will ignore the trail of red herrings left there, the coat trailing that was going on.  I regret the Minister's response but I think it is very important that this recommendation was moved.  I know that the Minister is a humane man but I am astonished by some of the comments he made in his reply, and I hope this information was prepared for him and did not originate in his own head.  A figure of 0.1 per cent of GNP for ODA is not something we can congratulate ourselves on.  The United Nation's target is 0.7 per cent of GNP.  Our GNP was up to 2.3 or 2.6 per cent about four or five years ago and we are moving away from the United Nation's target.  It astonishes me that the Minister can speak of proposed increases in GNP when our percentage is dwindling away all the time.  I know this country is in a difficult economic position, that the Minister is doing everything possible to set this position straight and that he has the support and encouragement of all the Irish people across party boundaries, but I have to say it is never opportune to be poor in this country and that it is certainly never opportune to be poor in a global sense. We are either the 26th or 27th richest country in the world, yet we can only afford to contribute a continuing shrinking of the resources we devote the ODA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also let slip the very telling <Col N="1563" /> phrase &ldquo;we must not forget the voluntary contributions of the Irish people&rdquo;. The Department of Finance in which I have many friends and where I have found great assistance in my mathematical calculations about the tax position in the inner city, would not let you forget that point.  Why would they? Government after Government have traded mercilessly on the generosity of the Irish people and every time the voluntary organisation &mdash; Live Aid, Gorta and so on &mdash; collect money, the calculation is made that we can afford to trim in this area.  I think that is a great pity and I really do not think that the Minister's response is adequate.</P>
    <P>May I say that although I agree with Senator Doyle, it was to a degree surprising that this recommendation survived because I would have anticipated it would have been ruled out of order technically on the basis that it involved a charge on the Exchequer.  I have seen far more tendentious rulings in a matter like this where even a remote hypothetical charge was sufficient to cause the falling of such a recommendation but it does not represent a direct expenditure, it is merely a provision against tax and there is no real major loss to the Exchequer. There is, on the other hand, an encouragement to companies large and small, including multinationals, who like to have a good image and who may balance some of the repatriation of their profits &mdash; which is a thorny point &mdash; against some good image which they can buy in this country, whether there is a high public awareness of the need to support overseas development aid, by operating the tax breaks in order to support something which the Minister admitted is not being adequately supported by the Government despite the rhetoric he has engaged in.  This is understandable because he is a politician and it is necessary for him to make the best case he can.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would reiterate that the allocation of 0.17 per cent of GNP for ODA is a further shrinking from the 0.7 per cent which is still a tiny fraction. <Col N="1564" /> We are talking about tax exemption, not capital transfer from the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>What Senators Doyle and Norris are seeking to achieve here is laudable given that the Government could afford to attain the targets they are setting themselves.  It is quite easy for people in Opposition to make suggestions regarding the amount of money that can be set aside, but if we consider the figure involved here &mdash; £43 million &mdash; it is not an insignificant sum of money. While it is 0.17 per cent of GNP it is a significant figure, it represents the Government's commitment to overseas development and while the figure may be less than last year's it should be pointed out that in relation to the Gulf War last year there was an extra commitment by the Government to alleviate hardship.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, therefore, I understand the demands from the Opposition side, but I would ask them to consider the restrictions under which a Government must operate and to appreciate that £43 million is not an insignificant sum of money, particularly as a higher contribution would involve an extra burden on the taxpayer at a time when we are trying to reduce the existing burden.</P>

      <P>I consider it grossly unfair of Senator O'Keeffe to make the case, we are making the point only because we are in Opposition.  When we were in Government the contribution for overseas development aid increased and since we left office it has been decreasing.</P>

      <P>You will have every opportunity of giving it if you want to. The figures are there to prove my point, that successive Ministers forgot about the voluntary contributions to the Third World, they seem to rely increasingly on these.  When they are challenged with regard to the reduced Government contributions to the Third World, they seem to look towards the voluntary contributions, <Col N="1565" /> a figure that is basically unknown but one we are told is increasing. That is the wish of the Irish people and there is a message in that for the Government that they should increase their contribution.  The Minister should cease referring to the voluntary contributions. People will stop giving voluntarily because these contributions give the Ministers an excuse to reduce the Government's contribution.  I ask the Minister to seriously consider this matter.</P>
      <P>We all know of the organisations that make voluntary contributions and the individuals who collect weekly on their behalf.  They should be encouraged but their work should not be used as an excuse for the Government to reduce their contribution.  This is not a levy on the taxpayer.  We ask the Government to recognise that these contributions are being made and to allow tax exemption in such cases, in the same way as travel or clothing expenses are tax exempt for a firm.  It is time that successive Ministers whom I have heard over the years referring to the voluntary contributions, stopped holding them up as if they were their contribution.  It is having the reverse effect in that people are now beginning to take stock of the contributions they are making to voluntary organisations.  I am sure many will consider reducing their contributions because of utterances from Ministers for Finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">

      <P>The Minister has been reminded that in official OECD ratings we are the 26th richest nation on the basis of income <i>per capita.</i>  I know, and no one knows better than the Minister, the difficulties we have both socially and economically in this country.  There is a very high rate of unemployment and major difficulties stem from that social problem and there are many other problems. Having said that, in section 56 the Minister is allowing the tax relief from corporation tax for donations made by companies to The Enterprise Trust Limited. Tax relief is being allowed for donations made by companies in our own country to help areas of unemployment. Yet, in countries that do not rate on any <Col N="1566" /> OECD list, where there is starvation and deprivation of all kinds in the Third World, the Minister is refusing to allow tax relief on corporate donations to these countries.  There is no consistency in this treatment.  The Minister allowed this and did not question the losses to the Exchequer in relation to section 56 on the tax relief to The Enterprise Trust Limited.  I support the Minister on that, but I believe he should extend the generosity he showed to the difficulties in our country which is relatively affluent compared to the Third World, and extend to the Third World the same tax relief that is given to corporate bodies in respect of gifts.</P>
      <P>Given our relative affluence and for all the problems we may have, they pale into insignificance compared to those of the Third World.  Therefore, the Minister must accept the recommendation which extends the same treatment in respect of gifts to the Third World as section 56 extends to The Enterprise Trust Limited which helps the problem areas at home.</P>

      <P>When we talk about generosity and request the Minister to provide more funding for the Third World, it is the taxpayers who will pay.  Everyone on this side of the House feels as strongly as Senator Doyle, but the bottom line is who will pay for this generosity?  In the past Governments were over-generous and we are still paying for their mistakes. It is grand to be generous if you do not have to pay, but it is the taxpayers who will have to pay for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make a couple of comments on that remarkably ungenerous <Col N="1567" /> speech from Senator Honan.  I know there is a degree of partisanship and that is inevitable, but this is a more serious problem and not one that should be treated on a strict party basis.  The generosity of the Irish people is not confined to Independents, Fine Gael or Labour.  The vast majority of the political electorate would have a degree of sympathy at least with Fianna Fáil, and they are the people who pay as well.  There is a racial memory in this country of famine and the kind of arguments I have just been hearing, that we cannot afford it, and that generosity has led us into this state, are similar to what was said in the 1840s during the famine debate.  When we say that £43 million is a wonderful amount of money, it makes me think about Queen Victoria and her alleged £5 for the Irish famine, in fact, it was £5,000, and £5,000 in 1846 was about the equivalent of £43 million today.  We are giving this pittance and tossing it out as if it was generosity.  It is not generosity.  May I point out that we made a present of £161 million by way of the export credit guarantees to the beef deals of Saddam Hussein, against the advice of some Senators in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It has plenty to do with this; perhaps you cannot see the connection but it is there.  We are also prepared to spend millions of pounds on tribunals and inquiries into every possible scandal until one might think that we should establish a Euro-scandal centre in Ireland as a development industry and have a Euro-scandal contest.  That might make some money and we certainly are qualified to contribute in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contributions are voluntary.  Who will pay for it?  Senator Honan says that the taxpayers will pay for it.  I am glad to say I am a taxpayer, probably everyone in this House is a taxpayer.  I speak with some feeling on voluntary organisations because I have been involved with a considerable number and, like the majority <Col N="1568" /> of people I am prepared to put my effort, money and enthusiasm into these voluntary organisations.  However, it would be appreciated if, in addition to that, the Government would not travel away from the internationally required target of 0.7 per cent.  We were travelling towards that target.  In the past we got to about 0.3 or 0.4 per cent of GNP and now the figure is reducing all the time and we are listening to paeons of praise for the generosity of the Irish Government.  I do not believe this.  This is a serious matter.</P>
    <P>By taking a moral lead in issues like this, Ireland would establish a position of influence and importance for herself as a State with newly developing countries and because of our past we should have a special sensitivity.  The Minister will know &mdash; I cannot recall the exact name &mdash; that there was an advisory council on development aid, and it cost about £75,000 per year.  Its purpose was to advise with regard to the allocations and how this money could best be spent but it has been abolished to save a measly £75,000.  This reminds me of the abolition of some other agencies in the domestic sphere.  I cannot recall their names but there were some agencies of the State whose purpose was to advise citizens about their rights under the social welfare schemes and they were also abolished three or four years ago.  I remember protesting about the matter.  I thought it a particularly mean cut at the time because it was not the saving to the Exchequer that was directly involved but that people would be kept in ignorance of their entitlements.  It is a perversion of language to suggest that these cutbacks coupled with the abolition of the Advisory Council on Development Aid, represent generosity.  They do not.  In view of our history, we should be especially sensitive to these people who are deprived.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the discussion and I know Senators' views.  I am not sure if the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill is the most appropriate debate for a discussion on development aid policy.  I am not sure if corporation tax relief should be singled out as the best aid mechanism or if, within the budgetary figures we could go to a higher figure.  I have stated the Government's intention in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the years 1987-90 there were decreases in Irish overseas development aid as all areas of Government activities were subject to cutbacks &mdash; and I am not denying that there were cutbacks.  There were also cutbacks in many other important areas.  The amounts provided were sufficient to maintain a basic framework of assistance and to meet our commitments. <Col N="1571" /> The Government remain committed to reaching the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP devoted to ODA and intend to move towards that target as economic and budgetary circumstances permit.  In the review of the Programme for Government, the Government are committed to achieving a higher ODA-GNP contribution by the end of 1994.  In addition to our allocation for ODA, the Government are providing financial assistance for Eastern Europe.  This is part of Ireland's contribution to the European Fund through the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, which will be about £1.4 million this year.  Current events in Eastern and Central Europe highlight the importance of all European countries in providing aid.  The figures are not as high as we would like; indeed, Senators on all sides of the House would like them to be higher.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to argue the point regarding The Enterprise Trust Company, I have been trying for some years thorugh the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to make the partnership area work.  In areas of high employment where there is social deprivation, and in some cases lawlessness, drug abuse and other social difficulties, we have set up the area based strategy companies with the help of voluntary organisations, the Federation of Irish Employers, the CII, the CIF, the ICOS, other bodies and business people who have voluntarily given their time to make these companies successful. The companies have now been established and there is a need to create employment and training opportunities in these areas.  That seems to be the only way to raise money.  It is very difficult to raise money for activities at home; it is easier to raise money to help people abroad.  Some of the area based strategies do not get much media attention; they do not have internatinal film crews making programmes about them so they have to find other ways to attract attention.  If <Col N="1572" /> every group sought relief from corporation tax to fund their cause, we would have no opportunity to help enterprise companies.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris lives in the heart of the city and he will know the people I am talking about.  There are areas in the city where there is no employment, very little assistance and they should be the priority for the tax relief areas.  We must help raise money for these people, many of whom have never worked; they live in very small accommodation often without proper sanitation; they do not have adequate educational facilities and the business community do not have an interest in assisting them.  While I have a great interest and commitment to the people in ODA, I also have a great interest and commitment to the people living on my doorstep.  It is not a case of choosing one against the other.  In this debate Senators appeared to be saying that if I support one I must also support the other; they are two different issues. The tax relief is for The Enterprise Trust Limited.  The Government are committed to increasing ODA in the years ahead.  As budgetary circumstances permit we will try to achieve the UN target and, hopefully, in better times we can go beyond that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised the comparison of what this recommendation is trying to achieve and what section 56 is trying to achieve in relation to The Enterprise Trust Limited because I want to point up the comparison and the relevance of what we are talking about.  Relative to the problems, the poverty, the famine, the unemployment and all the other issues in the Third World, our difficulties, bad as they are in terms of the European Community average, are insignificant.  If the Minister can forego revenue to the Exchequer for corporate gifts to The Enterprise Trust Limited, surely he can extend that same logic and generosity to corporate gifts for Overseas Development Aid.  That is all we are asking him to <Col N="1573" /> do.  If he can justify foregoing Exchequer revenue for the former, he can for the latter.  I urge the Minister to consider it and, perhaps, restrict it to gifts made between 1 April 1992 to 31 March 1994 to see how the scheme works.  I cannot understand the Minister's closed mind in relation to this proposal because it makes a great deal of sense.  I urge him to at least consider it, even as a short term measure, until March 1994, as in the case of the relief in relation to The Enterprise Trust Limited in section 56.  Will the Minister give us a commitment that in the autumn Finance Bill he will incorporate the sentiments of this recommendation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if section 56 will cost the Exchequer any money.  I have long experience in this regard.  I was involved in the negotiations on the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> with the Congress of Trade Unions, the action groups for the unemployed, the Combat Poverty Agency and others.  A conference some years ago in relation to the quays which was attended by Senator Brendan Ryan was, to the best of my recollection, addressed by Senator Norris.  At that conference I was asked to introduce such a measure.  At that time the Government did not do this, but, as Minister for Finance, I was able to introduce it.  I do not know if it will cost the Exchequer anything.  It is very difficult to obtain money for places such as South Hill, Seán MacDermott Street, west Tallaght or other disadvantaged communities, but this is an effort to get our companies involved.  If it is opened up for one project the scheme will be ruined before it has started.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are going to argue about Overseas Development Aid let us do so and I will put the Government's position on the record.  However, a comparison is being made; my comparison, in the short term, would be in regard to the tax base on the enterprise area because these are difficulties that are on the doorstep of <Col N="1574" /> Dáil Éireann.  We have a 21 per cent unemployment level.  More than 100,000 people are long term unemployed and approximately 5,000 people leave the education system every year.  My commitment and effort as far as this tax relief is concerned is to see if we can work on the conscience and kindness of the corporate sector.  It is another way of asking them for funds.  The argument about Overseas Development Aid is a separate issue and if budgetary circumstances permit we will deal with it.  It would break face with all of the bodies, groups and organisations who fought for this for so many years if I extended that scheme now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept it has been a long and gruelling day and we all appreciate the fact that the Minister, and his advisers, spent a long time giving detailed replies to the matters raised.  I have not been here all evening but I have been watching the proceedings on the monitor and I came in when something of particular interest to me arose.</P>
      <P>I welcome the sentiment of what the Minister said because he appears to be moving towards a commitment to expand Overseas Development Aid although, as he said, this is not the proper context.  It may not be, but he sees a context in which it is possible to make a legitimate demand on the Government.  I will not press this too much.  He also used phrases like &ldquo;when budgetary constraints permit,&rdquo; but, in a way, they never really permit. It is a question of political decision and political will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke with great sincerity and feeling about the problems of unemployment in the inner city and he knows them at least as well, and probably a great deal better than I, but living where I do I am aware that there are levels of unemployment in this city of 80 per cent. Of course, the Minister is perfectly right to give this situation urgent priority.  It is, as he said on our doorstep.  On the other hand, anybody who has a radio or <Col N="1575" /> television set will realise that the starvation and deprevation in the world &mdash; I am glad to see the Minister nodding, I would expect nothing less of him &mdash; are also on our doorstep.  The Horn of Africa is closer to us now than the whole of Ireland was to Westminister during the famine.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the fact that the House wishes to move on, but I want to make one point about some confusing remarks, made by Senator O'Keeffe on the subject of tax dodging.  I was not here when the issue of tax dodging was being discussed in a favourable light.</P>

      <P>I am aware of that but you will recall, a Chathaoirligh, that Senator O'Keeffe made lengthy references to it and I would like to place on the record in reply to that, that I would urge the Minister to introduce his crack down, not next year, but straight away.  If it proved that substantial sums of money were generated from it, perhaps there could be some allocation, as conscience money, from that towards Overseas Development Aid.  I accept the Minister's bona fide remarks in this regard and I would like to see them being acted on by the Government.  I am glad he gave certain indications in the nuances of what he <Col N="1576" /> said which I hope I am not being over-optimistic in interpreting positively.</P>

      <P>Nobody wants to stay here any longer than is necessary, but I would make a last appeal to the Minister to make a commitment, as suggested by Senator Doyle, that this matter will be dealt with in a future Finance Bill.  The Government find it extremely difficult to increase their allocation to ODA in this way, and the Minister could divert millions of pounds to the Third World.  I do not think that is an over-statement.  What he stated regarding the Enterprise Trust Limited is commendable; we agree with everything that is happening there and nobody wants to minimise the problems in that area.  However, no matter what money goes into the company I doubt that it will save a life.  It will bring more comfort to many people and that is commendable but if the Minister accepted this recommendation or made some provision for this aid in the near future, he could save lives.  I know the Minister is a compassionate man, and he is known as being reasonable in negotiation and debate.  Therefore, I ask him to give a commitment to make provision for such aid.</P>

      <P>Could I ask the Minister to put on the record of the House the continued justification for the exemption from corporation tax of certain net income.  I accept this exemption was introduced in 1988 and it applies to income arising to the company from a contract for the supply of natural gas to Irish Fertiliser Industries Limited.  Given this is a non-renewable, finite national resource can we justify, in the face of the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, this inefficient use of such a valuable non-renewable fuel?  On what basis can we continue this exemption?  The Minister quoted from the Culliton report on other sections and I now offer him that report for my view on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">

      <P>In 1987, NET transferred their fertiliser manufacturing operations to Irish Fertiliser Industries Limited &mdash; IFI &mdash; a joint venture company of NET and the ICI of the UK. NET were left with a debt of approximately £167 million which is State guaranteed, and in order to help NET service the debt the Government, under section 39 of the Finance Bill, 1988, decided to grant NET a corporation tax exemption for five years on their trading profits from the business of selling gas purchased from Bord Gáis Éireann to IFI.  The exemption is due to expire on 31 December of this year.  NET have not been able to up to now to reduce their debt which is now in the region of £180 million, which is the statutory limit on their borrowings, and, unfortunately, there is little indication of improvement in the forseeable future.  A liability to tax would result in funds used to pay the tax being diverted from paying the interest on the debt or reducing the debt.  In those circumstances, the existing statutory State guaranteed limit would have to be increased and, more likely, given NET's precarious financial position, the Exchequer could be called up to assist NET directly.</P>
      <P>To avoid such a situation, the corporation tax exemption to NET is being extended for a further seven years, until 31 December 1999.  This date was selected as it is the expiry date of contracts governing the price of gas between BGE and NET and between NET and the IFI.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied.  Basically, the Minister is telling us he and his Department do not want to pick up a tab of £167 million, therefore, the lesser of two evils is to continue the procedure he has outlined.  I am not sure if we can, on a strictly environmental basis, justify this any longer.  Given recent proposals to connect with the UK gas grid and from that to the European mainland gas grid, there is no reason to believe that in 1999, this relief will not be further extended if it protects the Government of the day from having to honour a guarantee they gave in relation to NET if they are unable to trade themselves into profitability. Can the Minister honestly say that the improvement in the trading profitability of NET, since this exemption was introduced in 1988, justifies it being continued at all or are we just postponing the evil day?  Can we continue to abuse in this way a finite natural resource which could be used far more efficiently in many other ways?  In my view this cannot be justified <Col N="1579" /> any longer and the Culliton report pointed this out, and various other sectors have done likewise.</P>

      <P>There is a debt of £167 million which is State guaranteed and present NET contracts run up to the end of 1999, but long before that the Government will be able to review the position. The company are already in a precarious financial position.</P>

      <P>I regret having to delay the Minister for Finance after his long gruelling day on the Finance Bill.  I am happy that it is the Minister for Finance who is here tonight to hear my plea because I have already discussed this with three successive Ministers for the Environment.  As we all know, it is the Minister for Finance who makes the allocation to the Minister for the Environment so perhaps tonight I will get a better result from the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raise this matter to highlight the importance and urgency of providing a swereage scheme at Williamstown, County Galway. It must be nearly 50 years since the idea was mooted.  Down the years many efforts have been made to get the scheme off the ground.  There were many reasons for the delay.  Let me say, right away, that the delay has not always been the fault of the county council or the Department of the Environment.  There were problems in acquiring land but thankfully this problem has now been resolved and the consultants have finalised their reports.  Those will be lodged with the Department in the very near future.  Provision has been made in the plans for a small extension to the original scheme.  That has all been finalised now. <Col N="1581" /> I ask the Minister to give me a firm commitment that the money will be provided for this scheme to allow it to start.</P>
    <P>All I am looking for is a sum of roughly £500,000 which is not a great deal in the context of the overall allocation to the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>The situation is so bad that in summer time the raw sewage runs out onto the streets.  As well as being unsightly it is a serious health hazard.  Indeed, the stench in warm weather is unbearable.  This happens because the septic tanks which service local households are built on non-porus ground as a result of which they fill up and oveflow very quickly.  This has been a recurring problem over the years and the residents have been very patient but their patience is running out.  The local primary school which caters for all the children of the parish has had very serious problems because of their septic tanks overflowing.  This should not be allowed continue.  The town cannot develop to any great extent unless it has the proper infrastructure.</P>
    <P>One of the first things that should be provided is a good sewerage scheme so that young people in the parish can build houses in their own local town.  I ask the Minister to give very sympathetic consideration to their case and allow them to proceed.  Now that the plans for this scheme have been prepared and the consultants were ready to submit their report to the Department, the money should be sanctioned as soon as possible to allow the scheme go ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Hussey for raising this important matter.  I know it is late in the evening but the Senator has waited patiently for several hours so this could be aired in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A total of £72.5 million has been made available by the State to fund the water and sanitary services programme in the current year.  On 19 March, the Minister allocated some £63.4 million to local authorities to fund the existing construction programme and this will ensure that construction work on schemes will <Col N="1582" /> be maintained at a high level in 1992. This level of allocation demonstrates the Government's commitment to maintain progress in the development and implementation of this important programme.</P>
    <P>Some £26 million has been allocated towards new and improved water supply schemes.  This is in line with the objectives of the environment action programme which specified the need for investment in water supply schemes to ensure that the stringent standards for drinking water set by EC directives are fully and consistently met.</P>
    <P>More than £37 million has been allocated to providing modern sewerage collection and treatment systems throughout the country.  This high level of investment is directed mainly at the elimination of pollution at both inland and coastal locations.  It will allow for the development of our natural resources for tourism, recreational and amenity purposes.</P>
    <P>Since 1989, over £277 million has been provided by the Exchequer towards the overall water and sanitary services programme. During this period local authorities in Galway received their fair share of this provision, with allocations totalling over £17.8 million.</P>
    <P>I understand that there is no existing public sewerage scheme in Williamstown and premises are served by septic tanks. Senator Hussey has outlined the difficulties involved.  These arrangements are not effective due to the poor percolation qualities of the soil in the area. This creates a nuisance especially at times of heavy rainfall.  The preliminary report for a public sewerage scheme to serve Williamstown was submitted to the Department by Galway County Council in May 1986 and was approved in March 1987.  This allowed Galway County Council prepare contract documents for a scheme that would serve 51 houses and provide secondary treatment.  This scheme was designed to eliminate the problems associated with the use of septic <Col N="1583" /> tanks and to allow for effluent to be treated to a very high standard before discharge to a local watercourse.</P>
    <P>Galway County Council recently submitted proposals to the Department seeking approval to extend the scope and capacity of the approved scheme.  They have been requested to submit further documentation in order to allow the matter to be further evaluated.  The council's revised proposals will, of course, be <Col N="1584" /> given detailed consideration when they are received.</P>
    <P>I assure Senator Hussey that the contents of his statement will be brought to the attention of the Minister for the Environment in the morning.  Both he and I will discuss the matter.  I thank the Senator for raising the issue.  I will convey the Senator's request, on behalf of the people of Williamstown, to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 11.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 22 May 1992.</P>
