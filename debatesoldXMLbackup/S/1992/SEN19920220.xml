      <P>I have notice from Senator Norris that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to accede to the expressed wishes of Seanad Éireann and Dublin Corporation by making a substantial cash grant from lottery funding for the rebuilding of the Hirschfeld Centre in Dublin.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Doyle of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to provide funds for the provision of permanent residential accommodation for the old and infirm of Wexford town and surrounding area.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Haughey of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to outline the current situation regarding the report by his Department's inspectors, and other reports into the collision between two ships near the entrance to Dublin port on 21 November.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Costello of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="734" /> The need for the Minister for Education to rescind the decision to means test ESF grants for students enrolling in the regional technical colleges and Dublin Institute of Technology colleges.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to recognise and deal with the urban deprivation and absence of opportunity for life which is contributing to the high levels of urban crime in sections of our cities and towns.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Norris, Doyle, Haughey, Costello and Neville as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Norris's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Doyle, Haughey, Costello and Neville may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take item No. 1 for two hours, with ten minutes for the spokesperson of each party, and five minutes thereafter.  We will have a sos from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. and we will take item No. 2 until 4 p.m.</P>

      <P>May I thank the Acting Leader of the House for having arranged the debate on request and also for broadening it out to include anybody who wishes to speak in the debate?  It is a good start.  In view of the very incomplete answer given by the Taoiseach in the other House on the establishment of an all-party committee on foreign affairs, may I ask the Acting Leader of the House to convey to the Taoiseach our view that in any plans which are being drawn up, this House would expect to have full representation on an all-party basis on such a committee but also that we will press very hard for the establishment of such a committee?</P>

      <P>May I ask the Acting <Col N="735" /> Leader of the House three questions? First, what is the present situation in relation to the Milk (Regulation of Supply) (No. 2) Bill and are negotiations in progress between the Department of Agriculture and Food and the people who work in the Dublin and Cork Milk Marketing Boards?  Second, what is the situation in relation to the Control of Dogs Bill and can we expect that in the foreseeable future?  Third, what is the present position in relation to the promised debate on the banks?  Is that debate any nearer than it was last week?</P>

      <P>Is it envisaged that the municipal election will be held this year and will the promised legislation, as envisaged in the Barrington report, be introduced before those elections? Second, will the review of the constituencies, outlined in the <i>Programme for Government 1989-1993,</i> be carried out in the near future?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Acting Leader of the House intend to bring to the attention of the Taoiseach the views that will be expressed here over the next two hours in relation to Article 43.3.3º of the Constitution, particularly in view of the expressed wishes of the Taoiseach to consult widely in relation to this matter? Second, may I ask the Acting Leader of the House, in view of the official statistics announced yesterday relating to the trading figures, which showed an excess of exports over imports of more than £2 billion, will a debate on unemployment and job creation be brought forward considering our unemployment is increasing all the time while our economy seems to be booming in terms of exports surplus?  Third, may I refer to a matter I raised yesterday in the House &mdash; item No. 47 on the Order Paper which seeks a Presidential pardon for Nicky Kelly? The Minister for Justice indicated to this House in October, four months ago, that he was seeking the advice of the Attorney General on the matter and, as yet, has made no statement on either receiving advice or what that advice is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="736" /> The Acting Leader of the House indicated to me yesterday that I could put down that motion in Private Members' Time.  The last time I attempted to bring forward a motion within a six month period in relation to An Post I was ruled out of order, and I have again raised this matter within a four month period.  Will the Acting Leader come back to the house with a response from the Minister for Justice as to the advice he received, if any, from the Attorney General?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go over what I said yesterday.  The Acting Leader had the foresight, and I believe it augurs well for the future, that instead of having clamours for debates here he will anticipate the current debate issues.</P>
      <P>May I go back to a long-standing request of mine?  I do not want a debate on industrial policy, but I want a debate on how we treat the unemployed today. That is something that can be dealt with now.  We may not be able to end unemployment but when the State persecutes 300,000 people week after week with meaningless qualifications, when it picks on women in particular in the way it operates the social welfare system, then we should talk about that now and not fudge it by talking about other issues, which are important, but I would like a debate on how we treat the unemployed. I suggest that we should talk about not unemployment but the unemployed.  We should have statements on the 300,000 people who are unemployed and who suffer every week from the way this State treats them.  That is what I would like us to talk about, not industrial policy or job creation, but what we do every day to 300,000 people.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that this debate has been granted.  It is a very wise and politic move and I am sure it will be an informed and important debate.  I am sorry it will be restricted to two hours because, as I understand it, the first four speakers will have ten minutes, and that simply allows 14 speakers.  Perhaps that is enough but I would like to ask the Acting Leader, if a significant number of <Col N="737" /> people wish to speak even at the end of the two hours, could the time be extended a little to accommodate everybody? It may be that there is sufficient time but we will be making statements rather than having a debate and I wonder if there is any provision for a Government response or will the Acting Leader undertake to convey the sense of the House to the Government and seek a response which can be given to the Members concerned privately or to the House in public?  I would also like to thank you, Sir, for taking the Motion on the Adjournment on the Hirschfeld Centre. I am sure the Business of the House will extend to 4 o'clock because I am lecturing until almost 4 o'clock, but I will be here at 4 o'clock.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>May I join in the thanks to the Acting Leader for making time available for statements on Article 40.3.3º. of the Constitution.  My question has already been covered by Senator Norris, that is, in view of the gravity of this matter, in the event that there are people offering at the end of the two hours, could there be any arrangement made to extend the time?  My other question has been covered by Senator Upton. When is it intended to take the Committee Stage of the Milk (Regulation of Supply) (No. 2) Bill, Item No. 6 on the Order Paper?  When does the Acting Leader propose to debate item No. 8 &mdash; the report of the Industrial Policy Review Group &mdash; where I believe we could also cover employment and unemployment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Acting Leader give time for a debate on the figures which were leaked yesterday regarding the increase in crime?  We understand <Col N="738" /> there was an 8 per cent increase in crime last year, a fact we were telling the previous Minister for Justice over the last year and which he refused to believe.  It is important that we have a debate on that issue.</P>
      <P>May I also ask the Acting Leader of the House if he will give time for a debate on the civil law dealing with defamation? I asked this last week and I am sure he has had time to consider the issue.  It is an important issue which the media and events over the past 12 months have highlighted; I have in mind issues which should be raised in the national media but could not be raised here and were raised elsewhere.  The freedom of the press is vital to democracy and we should have a debate on this very important issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's request that the pressure for instituting a joint committee on foreign affairs be maintained.  We want to let the Taoiseach know that his initial response is simply not good enough.  There was a suggestion that such a committee might be a rival jurisdiction to Foreign Affairs and to the Government Administration. That smacks of paternalism and I was disappointed about that.  I hope the pressure is kept up in that regard.</P>
      <P>I note that Senator Fitzgerald is wearing his earphones.  I hope the various dialects, including my Cork patois, are being adequately translated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously it is not intended to have the Government represented in the House during statements. I, like other Members, welcome the opportunity of this debate but I believe that, even at this late stage, a request should be made to have a Government presence in the House.  It is an extremely important debate and while I have the greatest faith that my colleagues across the floor will carry to their colleagues in Government what takes place here &mdash; indeed the record will be there &mdash; it is very important that we should have a Minister present in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>First, may I thank the Whips and party leaders for agreeing the arrangements for this morning's debate. I hope everybody will feel that in no way is this side of the House trying to stifle a debate or statements.  I am sure that should the situation arise that there are people who would like to contribute, the House can accommodate them.  As it is we will proceed with the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>Before the debate starts I would like to make two points.  The Taoiseach was keen that the House would have an opportunity to debate this issue.  He, the Government and all agencies associated with Government are doing everything humanly possible to find a solution to this problem.  In no way were President Robinson's comments, made yesterday, in any way contrary to the views of the Taoiseach, the Government and all parties in the House.  I hope that is the way the debate will go, that all of us using our wisdom will find a solution to this tragic problem.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning and others mentioned a foreign affairs committee.  The former Leader made several attempts to ascertain from the former Taoiseach the possibility of that committee being formed and to ensure that this House is represented.  I will carry on those efforts.</P>
      <P>As regards the milk Bill and other legislation mentioned here this morning, I have contacted the Ministers and asked them what timescale they would like for the legislative programme before them. I will come back to the various Senators who mentioned legislation.  With regard to local election reform and constituency revisions, I will leave that for another day.</P>
      <P>As regards item No. 46 I will certainly contact the Minister for Justice and express the views Senator Costello outlined. Regarding industrial policy, I would welcome a debate on policy, jobs, unemployment and I hope we will have that quite soon.</P>
      <P>Finally, I will ensure that the views expressed here this morning are conveyed to the people concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, as Justice spokesman, I wish to put on record the sincere sympathy of this side of the House for the young girl and her family in the trauma and tragedy they have suffered. It is a regrettable occurrence and we feel very deeply about it.</P>
      <P>Arising from the Taoiseach's statement in the Dáil yesterday, he has taken the initiative of requesting meetings with the leaders of the Opposition parties, the Fine Gael Party, Labour Party and The Workers' Party.  A series of meetings have taken place with the leaders of these parties over the past 24 hours and they have been broadly satisfactory and helpful. We on this side of the House would like to place on record our congratulations to the other parties for taking a very sensitive and sensible approach to this ultra-sensitive matter.</P>
      <P>The main aim of these meetings was to avoid any divisiveness on this issue.  We are all aware of the trauma this girl and her family have suffered and it was the intention of the Taoiseach and the Government, in an effort to avoid further trauma, to avoid divisiveness, to avoid politicisation of this issue, to meet with the leaders of the other parties.  I gather these meetings are ongoing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of us will be acutely aware of the 1983 referendum which enabled this amendment to Article 40.3.3º to the Constitution to be made.  The memories of this referendum are still fresh in people's minds.  The main consideration of the Taoiseach and the Government is to avoid any further trauma or problems for the family and the girl in this tragic situation.  It is the intention of the Government and the Taoiseach to have ongoing meetings with the leaders of the Opposition parties to explore various avenues and to exhaust all possibilities. They will cover the legislative position, and what role, if any, the Oireachtas can play.  Secondly, they will explore the <Col N="741" /> constitutional implications of the recent development and thirdly they will examine what, if any, the international commitments and the international position will be <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Maastricht Treaty and the implications on the ongoing situation.</P>
    <P>I hold the view &mdash; and it may be a personal view &mdash; that it might be prudent to have this case tested in the Supreme Court so that this avenue can be fully exhausted and we can say that the highest court in this jurisdiction had an opportunity to examine the full legal aspects and implications of the court decision. Some commentators believe the Supreme Court must uphold the decision of the High Court. That is not so.  I would like to see that aspect explored.  Should the girl or her family decide to appeal to the Supreme Court, the Taoiseach and the Government have made it quite clear they will put no obstacles in the way of such a course of action.  For example, it is quite clear that no costs will be levied on the girl or her family and that all available Government services will be put at her disposal to help in the matter. The Government are anxious that should this course of action be taken it would be expedited and no delays would occur.  It has also been made clear by the Taoiseach and the Government that all possible services will be made available to the girl such as pre-natal and post-natal services and psychotherapy.  The Government are fully committed to doing everything possible to help the girl and her family, including counselling.</P>
    <P>To reiterate the point made by the Acting Leader on the Order of Business, it is important to note for the record of this House that the comments of President Robinson are not contrary and do not conflict with the views of the Taoiseach and the Government.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Government and this side of the House are working around the clock, and have been since the matter arose, exploring all avenues to try to come to a satisfactory solution of this problem.  I would like to congratulate the Opposition parties in this House for their sensitive approach yesterday and their agreement to discuss and explore <Col N="742" /> all the avenues in respect of this very tragic case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>There must never be another case like this.  Whatever we must do as legislators, it must now be done to ensure that no victim of rape or sexual abuse, or no victim's family, will in future be confronted by the trauma of the appalling court proceedings we have recently had to witness.  My thoughts are with that tragic girl, and indeed with her family. We need broad political agreement on the steps necessary and if that involves a referendum &mdash; and, regrettably, I believe it will involve a referendum &mdash; that must be faced up to immediately.</P>
      <P>I have never witnessed a case to convulse the nation, especially the women of the nation, as this one has done.  There is palpable anger in all sectors of the community.  We need light, not heat, to resolve this issue.  But what business have we, as legislators, or indeed, through us, the Judiciary, interfering with the decision of the girl's parents, a decision they have come to taking everything into account and having got the best possible advice available to them?  I put it to Senators that we have absolutely none and that is the only absolute in this issue. There are no legal absolutes and particularly no moral absolutes.  How can it be moral to force a 14-year-old to carry the child of her rapist if physically and mentally it will impair her for the rest of her life?  Every effort could be made to persuade this girl, and indeed similar victims of rape, to carry a child to full term. It is justifiable to make those efforts.  All options must be discussed and considered in detail but in the end this child, and indeed any other woman or young girl who finds herself in a similar position, must be listened to and their families must be listened to, because it is their families who know best in their own case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no moral absolutes.  Where were the moral absolutes in the concentration camps in the Second World War when 2,000 women had the choice of facing an abortion or being shot if found pregnant?  Being shot would have <Col N="743" /> killed the mother and the foetus, the abortion just killed the foetus.  Who is to condemn those women for the choice they made?  Who is to say what they did was wrong?  I am totally opposed to abortion on demand.  I cannot speak for others but I do not think any of us here supports it.  However, neither I nor any other legislator can dictate to an individual in a tragedy such as we are now witnessing.</P>
    <P>There are no legal absolutes.  The text of the Eight Amendment does not support absolutist interpretation.  One has only to look at the expression &ldquo;equal right to life of the mother&rdquo;, which is embodied in the amendment.  Does the expression &ldquo;right to life&rdquo; only mean the right to be preserved from death?  I contend that it does not.  Does it allow for a reasonable level of physical and mental well being? In crunch cases rights are not equal.  The amendment refers to: &ldquo;due regard to the equal right to life of the mother&rdquo; and the expression &ldquo;as far as practicable&rdquo; is used.  Some abortions are lawful under the terms of the existing amendment.  How can one have an absolutist view?  It is not a question of all being right or all being wrong.</P>
    <P>How can the court support the injunction given the very strong view that there is no legal absolute in this issue? I find it hard to accept the injunction handed down in this case, preventing the child from travelling abroad although I know I must accept it.  It is for those who have a better interpretation of the law to comment on this.  I do not criticise the Attorney General nor the Judiciary involved.  Theirs is but an interpretation of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>There is no clear reason why some of the provisions of the Constitution such as this one, are enforceable without legislation while others such as the equality guarantee and the prohibition of religious discrimination are not.  Why the enthusiasm of the courts to restrain the actions of a private citizen under this particular provision in the absence of any legislation? This question is especially valid as the constitutional protection of the unborn <Col N="744" /> only operates &mdash; and under article 40.3.3º &mdash;&ldquo;as far as practicable&rdquo;.  That expression does not equal &ldquo;as far as possible&rdquo;. How could it be considered practicable to police a ban on women travelling abroad for an abortion?</P>
    <P>With my very limited understanding of the law, and even less experience, I cannot see how it could be considered practicable to ban women travelling abroad for an abortion.  Surely, in considering practicalities, what is at issue in the Eight Amendment could only concern the policing of a ban on abortion in this State.  In 1983 a PLAC lawyer, Mr. O'Neill, in a question and answer booklet for canvassers, in relation to the amendment, stated that a court would never grant an injunction to stop an Irish woman going to England for an abortion because it would be totally impracticable. He used the very words that we were then envisaging incorporating in the amendment.  From that side of the argument, they contended, in 1983, that a woman would never be stopped from travelling abroad for an abortion.  I can assume that those who, perhaps, have a slightly different view, but who have the same goodwill as all of us to resolving this dilemma, are with us on this issue. The amendment as it was intended, never envisaged preventing women travelling abroad for abortion.  It is totally impracticable. I agree with the PLAC lawyer. Let us all get back to where we thought we were going in 1983.</P>
    <P>The Government added a special Protocol to the Maastricht Summit last December stating that nothing in the Treaty on the European Union or in the Treaties establishing the EC should affect the application in Ireland of Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution of Ireland.  We must remind ourselves that this Protocol will only come into force if all member states ratify it.  It will then form an integral part of the EC Treaty.  The Court in Luxembourg will have the final say on its interpretation.  The Court of Justice insists that exceptions to fundamental principles are very narrowly interpreted and, as such, the Protocol would never <Col N="745" /> cover the situation when an injunction impedes free movement from one member state to another.  An injunction preventing a woman from getting a lawful abortion in another member state goes beyond the domestic application of the Eighth Amendment by attempting to give it extra-territorial effect.</P>
    <P>There is also the awful prospect of a referendum on the outcome of Maastricht, due shortly, being lost because of the confusion and concern being created by this particular issue. While that is for another day, I feel we must keep the Maastricht referendum quite separate from the resolution of this particular tragedy.</P>
    <P>It must be obvious that the consequences of the High Court judgment were not the stated intention of most of those promoting the pro-life amendment in 1983.  They said at the time that the amendment would not alter existing laws.  The amendment has altered existing laws.  I welcome the all-party approach to resolving the tragedy before us.  I can only pray that God will grant the tragic 14 year old and her family the mental and physical strength to come through this relatively unscathed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the announcement by the Government that all the services of the State are at the disposal of the family and that any financial cost that this family incurs in appealing to the Supreme Court, if they decide on that course of action, will be borne by the State.  That suggestion was made yesterday by Deputy Bruton to the Taoiseach when the party leaders sat down together.  I welcome the fact that the Taoiseach has taken Deputy Bruton's suggestion on board.  Please God we will resolve this dilemma and never again have a case like it.</P>

      <P>Over the past week we have seen the most extraordinary and disturbing events taking place in our country.  They have cast a cloud over the whole country and undermined much of our faith in our ability to care for the people properly.  These events must make us question our Constitution and <Col N="746" /> the interpretation of that Constitution by the letter of the law.  We have witnessed an appalling circumstance where a victim has become victimised further by the law enforcement service of this State.  The effort of distraught parents to protect and cherish their child, who has been through unimaginable trauma, has been threatened by the interpretation of the 1983 pro-life amendment to our Constitution.</P>
      <P>Every parent must be appalled at what has taken place and must ask what they would have done in the same circumstances. What are we doing?  What message is this sending out to our children, our society and to the world at large?  I am the mother of two young girls &mdash; the eldest is just in her teens &mdash; and this is why I feel so strongly about this issue.</P>
      <P>I wish there was something I could say to this unfortunate family.  Is there anything we can say to alleviate the suffering of the innocent in this case?  Of what have they been guilty, for they have been punished?  There is real fear now among women in our society that the self-appointed moral policemen of our State will now take a more pro-active role.  We know that at least 5,000 women go to the UK for abortions every year.  That has been true in recent years and by all accounts it is increasing not decreasing. They wonder what they will experience now.</P>
      <P>There is no tradition in this country of seeking to impose our moral laws on those people leaving this State.  Is it the case now that where women are leaving either the moral policemen or the principal law officer of the State will feel that they have the right to stop them?  How far will this go?  This is the type of action that has up to now been associated with the totalitarian states of Eastern Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need not wonder about the implications for rape victims.  This most heinous of crimes will in many cases go unreported now, unless something is done and done quickly.  All the good that has come about in relation to the reporting and prosecution of rape cases may be in jeopardy.  The willingness of a victim to report had always been the <Col N="747" /> major difficulty in combating this crime, not least because of what the victim has to endure in our courts.  We have made a great deal of progress over recent years but, still, only 30 per cent of cases are reported.  Will the crime of rape disappear as an unreported crime must surely be deemed not to exist in law.</P>
    <P>I ask the Attorney General what way this type of interpretation of our laws will proceed.  I say this in all humility.  I am no lawyer; I am talking about fears that have been expressed to me and I wish to communicate those fears to him.  You could ask, flippantly, if the Attorney General is made aware that someone is going to London to see a banned film, would he seek an injunction to stop them?  Of course that is ludicrous.</P>
    <P>What has caused so much pain, anguish, death and destruction in one part of this country has been the inflexible moral certitude of a minority of people who feel they are entitled even to murder for their cause.  I know that the Attorney General and all right-thinking people in this country are against and abhor the violence and destruction taking place in Northern Ireland, but there is a certain irony in the preparedness to inflict a strict and unbending interpretation of the Constitution on a young girl and consequently on her parents.  It is a tragedy that the person whose office should be that of guarantor of the citizen's freedom should have felt obliged to act in this way.  Here, we have a responsibility.  I know he has the best of motives but tragedy can be the result of even the best of motives.</P>
    <P>This poor victim and her family now have two choices.  They may appeal the case to the Supreme Court, although I suggest the horror of that might prevent them from doing so.  I wish they would do so.  They could, alternatively, take the law into their own hands and disregard the decision of the High Court.  As a legislator I could not condone the breaking of law by any individual, but given the tragic circumstances in this case, is there anyone who could not understand if such a decision were taken by this family? <Col N="748" /> Does this not demonstrate how wrong the legal situation is in this context.</P>
    <P>Our responsibilities as legislators are very clear.  We have to act urgently to ensure there is no repetition of this tragic case.  It may yet prove that this can be ensured through legislation, but I doubt that.  Unpalatable as it may seem, a new referendum to amend the Constitution may be necessary.  Nobody will relish returning to the bitter and divisive campaign we saw in 1983 but it may be our responsibility to do so.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's remarks. He has sought a consensus of approach on the matter.  He is acting as best he can under appallingly difficult circumstances. I hope that the concern shown by all sides will result in agreement but are the real fears of women being alleviated?  I hope we have learned the lessons of 1983 and that we will never again see our Constitution used as a battering ram against any traumatised child.</P>

      <P>I would like to express my sympathy with the unfortunate family involved in this very tragic case.  I welcome the initiative of the Taoiseach in making himself available for general consultation because there must be consensus on this occasion.  I have no doubt that there must be an amendment to the Constitution now.  That is quite clear. The leading article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> made the point that is often argued that hard cases make bad law but in fact it is clear from this case that bad laws make and invite hard cases.  Here we are in the very hard case that many of us, on the anti-amendment side, predicted would inevitably come about.  It behoves every political party and every individual to behave responsibly and to move towards consensus because politicians are morally responsible for this disastrous mess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The predictions of people who were also caring and compassionate have been fulfilled.  The virtues of caring and compassion do not solely reside with those who have appropriated for themselves titles such as &ldquo;Family Solidarity&rdquo; and so on.  Our reservations were made clear <Col N="749" /> and were ignored.  It is important to note that the Church of Ireland, the principal Protestant church in this country, made it clear that where pregnancy resulted from rape, abortion, however regrettable, was morally defensible.  What we have in Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution is nothing other than blatantly sectarian law.  I say that as one of three Members of the Oireachtas who are members of the Anglican Church.  However, it would be wrong and unfair to characterise the people who took the opposite position with regard to the amendment and who are still firmly against abortion as being uncaring or inhuman.  Because of the very bad international publicity that has emerged, I wish to state my continuing conviction that the vast majority of the Irish people, regardless of what newspaper headlines in other countries may say, are caring, compassionate and tolerant people.</P>
    <P>The Government have behaved unwisely on a number of occasions.  It is extraordinary that there should be this obsession with the private lives of individuals. I understand Deputy Collins scuttled off to Maastricht to secure a derogation from the Maastricht Treaty in regard to abortion.  I wonder why he did that?  He did not seek a derogation with regard to Articles 2 and 3 which are clearly violated by the Treaty of Rome and the Maastricht Treaty.  No such derogation was attempted.  It casts a very curious light upon the Government's priorities in this matter.</P>
    <P>Article 41.1 of the Constitution states that:</P>
    <P>The State recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.</P>
    <P>In the light of that Article of the Constitution I cannot understand how the Attorney General can presume so grossly to violate the family unit and interfere with the decision that was so carefully and so painfully taken by this tragic family.</P>
    <P>With regard to injunctions, it is now, <Col N="750" /> possibly, open to any informant or busybody to injuct any citizen of this State leaving for a purpose that is deemed to be criminal.  A number of Members of both Houses have travelled abroad to seek divorce.  Legally and technically they stand in danger of injunction by a busybody.  There is no question that the Attorney General in that instance would have no capacity for manoeuvre at all. This is a very regrettable state for us to have allowed ourselves to get into.</P>
    <P>I am very glad Senator O'Donovan referred to the sensitive, caring and dignified statement of President Robinson last night.  I believe most people in this country no matter what position they take on abortion, are grateful that we have somebody in the highest office of the land who can express the pain and confusion of the Irish people at this time.</P>
    <P>I believe an amendment to the Constitution is necessary.  I take this very seriously and, with the assistance of some legal friends, I have drafted a Bill which would have the effect of amending the Constitution.  There should be no delay. However, I have looked into the Constitution and it appears that a Bill to amend the Constitution cannot be introduced in the Seanad; this must be done in Dáil Éireann.  I would therefore like to make available to the Acting Leader of the House a copy of the Bill I have had prepared so that he may add this into the discussion for consideration.  I hope he will consider this a positive gesture.</P>
    <P>One must listen to the voice of women. I am very glad that two of the previous speakers spoke very feelingly from the special position of women.  The special position of women is recognised in the Constitution and I read with great interest the story in the <i>Irish Press</i> this morning of a woman who was raped.  At the moment this young child is only the victim of an alleged rape.  The woman referred to in the article was raped and we must listen to what she has to say.  She disagrees that an abortion after being impregnated by a rapist is another act of violence.</P>
    <P>I disagree with that.  I think to force <Col N="751" /> someone to bring a baby to full term which has been conceived during rape is an act of violence.  I think a lot of people forget that the young girl, as I was, is at school and that she has to carry a baby like that full term, for nine months.  I think that is a miscarriage of justice.  It is so unfair... I was only a child, I had no idea what to do.  I was making myself sick worrying about it. I had to tell someone, there was nothing I could do.  To be honest I think this country has placed far too much emphasis on the right of the unborn foetus to life.  There is also the right of the quality of life of the mother.  A foetus at eight weeks is the size of a 10p piece.  Some people consider it to be alive.  You can abort without even knowing you have aborted at eight weeks pregnant, a lot of women do and it is just like a heavy period.</P>
    <P>This is the voice of a person who has been through this trauma.</P>
    <P>With regard to the equal right of life of the foetus, that is the most astonishing insult to have in the Constitution.  It must be removed.  Do none of the people here in this House or who proposes this kind of amendment feel for their wives?  I have to thank God that I am not a woman, I am not heterosexual and I am not married to somebody who, after 25 years of marriage, would value me equally with a fertilised ovum, a microscopic form of potential life, whose potentiality for life I respect.  Can any person tell me that he values somebody he loves, with whom he has shared his life, equally with something that has the beauty and potential for life, but is only potential?  To me that is a blasphemy against life.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that, in this judgment, the State is giving the right to a man to force a woman to have his child.  Her liberty will be restrained and anybody who tries to prevent such enforced motherhood will be imprisoned.  The female's right to choose who shall be the father of the child, the essence of natural selection, is denied by the Constitution. If there should be a crazed man who <Col N="752" /> kidnaps a girl and artificially inseminates her, she is now condemned to carry that child.  If this is copperfastened, any woman who goes for a pregnancy test could be reported to the Attorney General. Is it true that the Attorney General has instructed the Garda to report cases where anybody proposes to leave the country with the intention of having a termination?</P>
    <P>Another important point is the question of identification of the father by genetic fingerprinting.  I understand that DNA from an aborted foetus would not be allowed as evidence.  This has the effect of preventing women from taking the necessary step.</P>
    <P>If, for example, medical treatment of a kind other than abortion became necessary, in Belfast for example, would this girl be allowed to travel?  Can she do so without seeking the permission of the Attorney General?  It is astonishing to me that, in the light of the evidence that this girl's psychological health was devastated, she is still to be forced to continue this pregnancy to its conclusion. Think of the effect this will have on victims of rape.  Can they have the confidence now to go to a clinic, to ask for advice, to report the rape, without the suspicion that they too may be injuncted? This is a most pitiful thing and all our hearts go out to those involved in this tragic case.</P>

      <P>I join with my colleagues in sending my deepest, sincere, sympathy to this girl, her baby and her family.  It is not a morning for raising voices.  This is a very serious subject.  I am delighted the Taoiseach and the party leaders behaved so well yesterday.  This is not the time to play party politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Senator deeply regrets what happened.  I understand the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, is meeting representatives of the Council for the Status of Women and also talking to the Women's Rights' Committee this morning. It is only by keeping cool heads that we may in some way help.  I understand that only the family of this girl have the right to appeal to the Supreme Court.  I <Col N="753" /> noted with interest that my colleague, Senator O'Donovan, a distinguished lawyer, stated that he would like to see the family take this appeal to the Supreme Court.  The Taoiseach made it clear that if there is an appeal to the Supreme Court the family will not have to bear the cost.  The Government and all political parties will give the support that is needed to have the case heard as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I heard somebody saying last night that we were again faced with another referendum, and that we were &ldquo;on a war footing&rdquo;.  Such talk sends shivers through all of us.  I would worry about another referendum, about the split and the divisions it would create.  Senator Doyle stated that, if we were to have this referendum it could be confused with the referendum on Maastricht.  As a former colleague of our distinguished President, I am glad that her stand and that of the Taoiseach are at one on this matter.</P>
    <P>As a mother and a grandmother, I find it difficult to express my thoughts to this family on this very sad occasion.  I hope the political parties will keep their heads and behave responsibly in order to solve this problem.</P>
    <P>When we were taking a major Criminal Bill here I had strong views on capital punishment in certain cases.  I wonder, a Chathaoirligh, is capital punishment adequate to deal with anyone who would create the problem that family are facing today?  Is capital punishment appropriate for the crime that has been committed?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to share my time with Senator Costello.  The appalling human tragedy which has been visited on this 14-year old girl and her family clearly illustrates the stark implications of the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution. The Irish public are now gripped in what the Europeans call &ldquo;a confrontation with reality&rdquo;, the full logical consequences of the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision of the High Court has illustrated frightening implications of the Eighth Amendment.  It can restrict freedom to travel in a new unprecedented <Col N="754" /> manner.  It raises questions about the reporting of rape lest such reporting restrict the liberty of the rape victim.</P>
    <P>The public outcry in this case goes a lot further than Dublin 4 liberals and vocal women's groups.  The most relevant question raised is, whether the outcry is large enough to provoke a referendum which will, of necessity, allow a change from the implications of the 1983 constitutional amendment.  This is one case where an Irish solution to an Irish problem will not work.</P>
    <P>The Government alone are powerless to take effective and immediate action to resolve the crisis.  It now seems as if the best legal opinion holds the view that a further amendment to the Constitution will be needed to resolve the situation. Nobody involved in the 1983 campaign would relish a replay of the bitter debates and rancorous attitudes adopted by some of the protagonists in that debate.  In 1983 the Labour Party warned against an eventuality such as the present one.  I do not wish to adopt the attitude of &ldquo;We told you so&rdquo;.  I am anxious that a solution be found to this terrible dilemma and in that regard I welcome the efforts by the Taoiseach to seek out a consensus so that all-party agreement can be obtained in pursuit of such a solution.</P>
    <P>If the legal opinion stating that a new referendum is required to solve the present dilemma is correct, it is imperative that such a referendum should proceed with the support of all parties in the Dáil.  In the event of a referendum the Irish people will have to face up to exceptionally difficult questions that run right to the core of morality, liberty and justice, the way in which these interact with one another and which of them takes precedence over another in varying circumstances. The option of fudging the matter or of walking away from it is no longer available.</P>
    <P>I express great concern about the possibility of a referendum being held in the absence of a widespread consensus across the political spectrum.  There are many elements in Irish society who have been conspicuous by their silence so far in this debate.  Some of these elements have <Col N="755" /> already shown themselves to be exceptionally powerful and remarkably resourceful in achieving a vote which will sustain and enshrine their views of morality. Nobody who watched their performances in the 1983 and 1986 referenda should have any doubts about their capacities to flex their political muscle.</P>
    <P>There is little value either in protagonists on the other side of the case flying off the handle.  Anger and shrill statements will do little to reach a solution when the solution will involve a change of decision reached nationally less than a decade ago.  Demands from various protagonists that politicians act decisively should not be made without realising that in this case the politicians' hands are tied; they are copper-fastened by the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution and this amendment was passed by two-thirds of the Irish people who voted.  Some politicians who opposed its wording paid a high political price for the position they adopted at that time.  At the following election some of those who took difficult and dangerous positions were quietly deserted by many of the people who encouraged them vigorously to take those positions at referendum time.</P>
    <P>The Government should set out whatever options are available in this matter. It is important that meetings between the Taoiseach and Opposition leaders should continue and meetings arranged between Deputy Kitt, the Minister with responsibility for Women's Affairs, and women's groups and other interested parties are welcome.  It seems to me that the only route out of this impasse will be by consensus. If a confrontation arises I feel certain that stalemate will result.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the consensus approach of the Taoiseach in approaching all party leaders to try to resolve this terrible tragedy.  I also welcome the dignified statement made by the President last night in relation to the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a terrible situation for anybody to be in.  The most intimate details of the <Col N="756" /> problems and sufferings of the pregnant girl and her family have been splashed across the media here and abroad.  When we speak we should bear in mind the degree of suffering involved for the girl and her family at present.</P>
    <P>I have always considered the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution was an Irish solution to an Irish problem, an attempt to resolve a problem in a limited way to our satisfaction.  By erecting a wall around the country we would not allow any form of abortion to take place here but we would turn a blind eye to what might be happening elsewhere.  We have always adopted that approach but it is not feasible now.  We may be an island but we cannot insulate ourselves against this situation.  The same situation arose in relation to the Maastricht Protocol where we sought to ensure that Community legislation would not interfere with cosy arrangements here in Ireland.  That approach is less than adult and it is inevitable that we would discover problems arising from possible implications of this ill-thought out constitutional amendment.</P>
    <P>We have before us a classical dilemma where the crime of rape appears to have been committed although it has not yet been proved.  That is now to be compounded on the one hand by the possibility of an abortion and on the other hand by the possibility of the forced bringing to term of its unwanted result.  No matter which way we look at it, we are faced with a dilemma which draws out the deepest of emotions and feelings.  We have two sets of evil, the crime of rape and its possible consequences.  There is no easy solution.  Eventually we will have to make a choice as to where we stand in relation to the mother and in relation to the foetus.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General has not taken full account of the constitutional provisions in relation to the mother and the family.  Neither has he exploited his full discretion in relation to the amendment because there are considerations regarding the right to life and health of the mother included in the amendment.  In Article 41 of the Constitution the special <Col N="757" /> position of the family is asserted and in Article 42 the natural and imprescriptible rights of the child are asserted.  Do not forget that we are talking about a 14 year old girl who is legally a child.</P>
    <P>The High Court has created an appalling vista arising from the decision of the Attorney General where this young child is compelled to stay in this country for a period of nine months.  Her right to liberty, to freedom and her right to travel have been curtailed.  We face the possibility of a moral police force being established to stop people boarding boats or planes on the information of a citizen. The fact that this is a matter of civil rather than criminal law does not resolve it.  I suggest that the Supreme Court be appealed to which could be done within a short space of time by representatives of the young girl.</P>
    <P>It would be difficult to regulate by law where the law would be subject to appeal to the courts; we must look at this matter in the context of the Constitution, and adopt an amendment to the Constitution or initiate a review of the Constitution itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I extend my sincere sympathies to this family in their terrible time of trauma.  I do not wish to go into a long and sterile debate.  At issue is whether this young 14 year old girl should be allowed to leave Ireland in order to have her foetus aborted in England.  Enshrined in our Constitution the foetus has a right to life and the Attorney General had no option but to protect that right.  Had the young girl and her parents said they were going abroad for a holiday, this matter would not have arisen but they did not, it has, and we have to do something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must act with compassion; I am sure we are all agreed on that.  I am particularly pleased to hear the Taoiseach make clear that in the event of the appeal to the Supreme Court no cost will be borne by the family, the Government will give their full support to the family and will ensure that such an appeal be expedited.  They will also pay for any specialist counselling necessary.  That is <Col N="758" /> compassion in action and we must be compassionate.</P>
    <P>There are those who would have us believe that acting with compassion would mean helping the young girl to have an abortion.  I cannot understand how helping a young girl to destroy the life in her womb could be seen as a compassionate gesture.  A terrible wrong has been done to this young girl, a terrible hurt has been visited on her, but surely the destruction of part of herself can only add to this hurt.  Life is the first step towards a greater similarity to God and whenever we destroy life we directly attack Almighty God.</P>
    <P>The President has spoken and called on us to have the courage we have not always had to acknowledge that this is a problem we must resolve.  The Irish people have always had courage and displayed it when they overwhelmingly voted to amend our Constitution in order to protect the life of the unborn.  They continue to display courage in standing up and defending the right to life of the unborn and do so in the face of the combined pro-abortionist forces.  Soon we will be entering into European Union where abortion, the wilful destruction of human life, is defined as a service.  Even here courage will not be found wanting.</P>
    <P>The task that lies ahead of us is to continue to protect the life of the unborn without making prisoners of women.  As a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights I am aware of the traumas and discrimination faced by women in all aspects of their lives.  I echo the feelings and thoughts expressed by Senator Keogh; there should be no ban on the right to travel.</P>
    <P>I also believe, although many may not agree with me, that there should be no ban on the right to information.  It is a farcical type of law: one can find a number in a phone book which one is not allowed to obtain in another book.  Once we get into that type of dealing we are going down the wrong road.</P>
    <P>There must be a solution to these problems and I hope that we can have all-party agreement on whatever measures need to be taken.  I do not look forward <Col N="759" /> to the prospect of another referendum, yet that may be the only way.  Any attempt to remove from the Constitution the right to life of the unborn will be resisted by the people of Ireland with considerable vigour, but we must find some way forward and the only way forward is by consensus.</P>
    <P>There are too young lives at risk here: one is 14 years of age and the other is approximately 11 weeks.  Surely we can get together as legislators and find some way out of the impasse which will allow both to develop and live happily in their own country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The only way this problem can be resolved is through a referendum.  It is not just the most straightforward or the cleanest way, it is the only way out of our present crisis.</P>
      <P>This is a problem that we cannot tinker around with, we have to face it square on.  A nightmare situation that many people in 1983 warned would happen has now happened.  Unlike Senator Lydon, I would like to see this Article removed completely from the Constitution.  I said in 1983 and I still believe that this particular amendment was unnecessary; it has created a myriad of problems and solved none.  Senator Lydon referred to some of the problems which have arisen from it &mdash; the ban on information and the apparent ban now on travel are problems which were foreseen and could have been avoided.</P>
      <P>The greatest safeguard of any country against the legislation of abortion is the strong, unshakable moral conviction of the vast majority of its people that it should not be legalised.  That is the conviction, I believe, of the overwhelming majority of our people and is a far greater safeguard than any constitutional provision will ever be.  For that reason this problem is best tackled by the straightforward deletion of this amendment which has given little support or protection to the unborn and which has caused the problems we now face.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody wants to go back to the nightmare of 1983 when madness gripped the <Col N="760" /> country and when fanatics on both sides held us all in fear so that normal debate became virtually impossible.  The wells of discourse were poisoned during that debate.  Nobody would want a re-run of that situation.  We have learned lessons from 1983 and the debate need not follow the same poisonous channels again.</P>
    <P>A great deal of talk has come with sincerity from all sides about the need for a consensus approach which I support.  I have to say, however, with a certain degree of bitterness, that when Deputy Garret FitzGerald asked for consensus in 1983 he did not get it; when he pointed out that the present wording could lead to this situation the Fianna Fáil spokesperson, Deputy Woods, accused him of being devious.  There was little generosity from the Opposition in 1983.  I say that not for vindictiveness but as a fact that must be remembered.  The Government today will receive generosity from the Opposition parties; we will attempt to approach this in a sane, balanced, reasoned and humane way.  Let us learn from 1983 the consequences of not having a consenus approach and the Opposition will not be found wanting in generosity on this occasion.</P>
    <P>Let us also look back at some of the promises made in 1983.  During that debate there were promises that if this referendum were passed there would be no shortage of back-up services and those who had to face the choice of an abortion would find advice, help, counselling and support at home.  We have seen little extension of existing services over the past number of years.  We behaved as we often do, not with courage or humanity but passed a law, put it on the Statute Book and then hoped the problem would go away.  If this present crisis forces us to look back at the promises made in 1983 some good will have come out of it.</P>
    <P>One other lesson remains to be learned from 1983 which is, if we are to move we should move quickly.  The last thing the country needs is a long festering debate laced with bitterness, reopening the wounds and bringing back the poison of eight or nine years ago.  If it is to be done let it be done quickly. <Col N="761" /> I believe that the simple straightforward honest way to proceed now is to remove this amendment completely from our Constitution.  We are told this can be done without opening any floodgates and without making the legislation of abortion any more likely in this country.</P>
    <P>The greatest barrier to the legislation of abortion in this country is the strong unshakable moral conviction of the vast majority of people of all parties that it should not be legislated.  That is our greatest safeguard and if we have courage and belief in ourselves then the dangers people talk about will not be realised.  On that note, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, I ask for a reasoned debate, a quick and straightforward decision in the matter and that the debate be kept at a level of civility and reason which all in this House have shown this morning.  We must accept the enormous responsibility placed upon us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure an Leas-Chathaoirleach will agree that it is most unfortunate and disturbing that we should have to discuss such a profoundly unhappy situation.  I am sure it is the fervent desire of all Senators that a solution be found which will make it unnecessary for us ever to have a debate of this nature again.  Those of us fortunate enough to occupy a seat in this House have imposed upon us very serious obligations and responsibilities.  It is very rarely that we are so starkly confronted with the extent of those obligations and responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find the responsibility of having to arbitrate on the merit of differing and conflicting human rights to be a very difficult and distressing responsibility.  The distress which I and other Members of the House feel is infinitesimal and extremely minor compared to the trauma and the heartbreak of the 14 year old rape victim and of her family.  They are paying a high price for having such regard for the laws of the country.  It is a supreme irony that had they disregarded the law this debate would not be taking place at all, although I suspect that sooner or later the matter would have surfaced.  The family have <Col N="762" /> done the State, to coin the phrase, some service.</P>
    <P>I share the bewilderment, unhappiness and the sense of shame and frustration which I am sure is widespread within our society and which was so eloquently expressed yesterday by our President.  As legislators we have a responsibility to do everything in our power to find an answer to some very difficult and delicate questions. Now is a time for courage and for leadership.  Every effort must be made to achieve all-party agreement on the way forward to remove this matter from the party political arena.  It has been suggested, here and elsewhere, that the only way forward is by referendum.  Unfortunately that would not solve the present problem of the girl and family in question. While we may or may not need a referendum, every option must be carefully examined in the search for a consensus which embodies compassion, respect and charity and which will demonstrate the ability of this Oireachtas to act responsibly.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear to this House that in common with the vast majority of the citizens of this country I am opposed to abortion on demand.  However, as someone who was not in public life in 1983, I deeply resent the representation that one is in favour of abortion if one was opposed to the original wording of the 1983 amendment.  I know of one particular case where somebody stood for election subsequent to that referendum and had their character assassinated because they opposed the wording of the amendment without ever being in favour of abortion.</P>
    <P>Language can be very deficient on occasions like this and it is probably fair to say that deficiencies in language have brought us to this impasse.  I would say to those who represent themselves as the self-appointed custodians of the conscience of the State or as protectors of what they perceive to be their religion's teachings that they need to reflect carefully on the dominant values of the gospels which should characterise a Christian society.  Those values are love, forgiveness, compassion and charity.  I <Col N="763" /> would say to any Senator in this House who would demand tolerance that he should demonstrate it in return.  I hope we can be guided by those values in finding an equitable solution to this highly unsatisfactory and sad situation.  My final words would be, &ldquo;Judge not lest ye be judged&rdquo;.</P>

Under the most unpleasant circumstances imaginable we are compelled to reopen an issue that was closed but not finished with, manifestly, ten years ago.</P>
      <P>I was here in the Seanad during the debate; I was in the middle of a Seanad election at the time.  I got a phone call from a person whose identity I believe I know but will keep to myself.  She said to me &ldquo;Many of us are concerned that you are not too precise on this amendment&rdquo;. I said, &ldquo;How many of you?&rdquo;.  She would not say.  I said I was against it.  She said she was sorry, astonished and shocked that somebody with my record in the Simon Community would be anti-life.</P>
      <P>I do not want those allegations to surface again but I do not want us to go on winking somehow at the easy solution to our moral dilemma represented by the boat and the plane to Britain.  What I have had to confront in the last week and what every thoughtful compassionate Irish person has to confront is the fundamental question &mdash; we should not interfere with someone travelling 50 miles of water to take a course of action they believe necessary or justified by their own circumstances &mdash; on what do we form the moral basis for our prohibition on their taking the same course of action here?  That is a profound and difficult moral dilemma and our President articulated it succinctly yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My ideal solution to this present controversy would be a simple explicit unambiguous repeal of that amendment to the Constitution, to recognise that, to <Col N="764" /> be most charitable about it, it will never do what it was supposed to do, namely to reduce the incidence of termination of pregnancy by Irish women.  The truth is that our rate of abortion <i>per capita</i> is not very different from most other European countries.  We might fool ourselves in a clould of confusion that because it is done elsewhere we are somehow different.  I am not sure the sense of moral superiority we claim because it does not happen here makes us morally superior to countries who tolerate legal abortion.  In the other House, Deputy McGahon represented the view of all of us who have young daughters when he said we could not be prepared to stand with our hands on our hearts and say that if it happened to our children we would take a clear moral position on the absolute right to life.  I cannot say I would be prepared to insist upon it for my own family, nor do I have a right to pretend that there is some safe, moral and absolute distinction which I can impose on other people's families.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of the present controversy is the spectacle of a child being confronted with the power of the State.  I am not convinced that the Attorney General had no choice.  I am not convinced that this is a principle successive Attorney General have applied universally where similar breaches of the Constitution were envisaged.</P>
    <P>As a father of two daughters my heart goes out to the family.  Difficult and hard though it may be, the only option is to delete the section of the Constitution which is causing this problem.</P>

      <P>Like other Senators, I feel a deep sense of sympathy and shame at what had happened in this case, shame because I am part of that process &mdash; although I opposed it &mdash; which passed the 1983 amendment to the Constitution. What is happening here is that the chickens are coming home to roost.  The hypocrisy of those who supported the referendum in 1983 is being exposed in these tragic, ironic circumstances.  A blind dog could have told us at the time of that referendum that a situation like <Col N="765" /> this was possible; it is extraordinary that it has not happened before now.  We were happy as a nation, and many of us as politicians, to rush through an amendment like this to satisfy an extreme group who represented the forces of darkness and hypocrisy.  The result is what is happening here today, which is a personal tragedy for the family concerned.</P>
      <P>The Irish Constitution, the Irish people and the Irish way of life are being mocked throughout the world.  I say that in measured tones because the coverage this case got on world television has been dramatic, degrading and has portrayed this country as primitive and barbaric with many of its laws dictated to it by forces outside the Legislature.  Unfortunately, that is the truth; that is the raw truth which we must accept today.  We are confronting a situation in which the Legislature allowed others dictate the terms of our own Constitution.  We must look again, not just as this clause in the Constitution but at the nature of the Constitution. If the nature of this clause and others is denominational, we cannot pay lip-service to liberalism and pluralism while we remain primitive.</P>
      <P>While there is hypocrisy on this issue, there is also hypocrisy on other issues. There is hypocrisy in relation to divorce, which is also a denominational clause in our Constitution.  The Unionists must be laughing at us and saying I told you so.  I have not read the Northern press reports on this issue but I have no doubt that it is being used to paint us as being hierarchy-ruled and that our Constitution represents a single denomination.  I say without any equivocation or hesitation that those who point the finger at us on this issue are correct and we are faced with it in all its reality here today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a similar problem in relation to divorce where the State nods and winks, and allows people to get divorced and remarried outside the State when it is against our Constitution.  That is State hypocrisy.  On this issue, the State made an anti-abortion amendment to the Constitution knowing well that thousands of Irish girls would go overseas to have abortions.  Yet the State allowed that to <Col N="766" /> happen.  That is total hypocrisy and is an issue we must confront.</P>
    <P>We must also ask ourselves a particularly hard question, and it is not one which I have heard answered with great frankness.  Do we believe that that girl should have been allowed to go abroad and have an abortion?  As Senator Brendan Ryan so eloquently said, I do not believe that in our hearts we can say that if it was our own child or a child of any Member of this House we would have stopped her.  If that is out attitude to our own children, we cannot in all conscience &mdash; and that is not a word I use lightly in this House &mdash; allow the State to behave differently towards its other children.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that a referendum would be the end of this matter.  A referendum would be a start to reverse the wrongs of 1983 but we need to change the denominational clauses in the Constitution so that nothing like this is repeated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended to make any personal statement, but this seems to be a time for identifying the positions we would take in this terrible situation.  I have no hesitation in saying that if my daughters had been in that position at that age I would have supported the decision that family made.  I would not have been as honest and upright as that family were in making contact with the Garda authorities.  I suspect that the attitude Senator Ryan, Senator Ross and I represent is that attitude of a majority of the people of Ireland at this moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the spirit that has prevailed up to now of a non-partisan constructive approach to this problem, I want to say there is no point indulging in futile recriminations about what happened in 1983.  As a Party politician reminded me last night, it is very easy for an Independent to pontificate on these matters. It is difficult for an Independent to put himself in the position of a Head of Government or a head of a large Opposition party subjected to the kind of pressures they were subjected to in 1983. However, they have learned their lesson <Col N="767" /> now; this misfortunate case will surely have taught them a lesson.  Therefore, I am not going to make any recrimination like that.</P>
    <P>When I reproached Senator Norris yesterday for taking what I described as a sexist line, what I had in mind was that, at the fringe of this controversy, there is an unfortunate lurid tendency on the part of some rabid feminists to start a sex war on this issue.  That is totally uncalled for and unhelpful.  I was extremely moved this morning by the contributions of the women Senators.  Indeed, the President's remarks yesterday would not have been half as telling if she was not a woman.  As a woman she brought solace to the people with one single statement.  The vista raised by this issue is truly appalling.</P>
    <P>The Maastricht Protocol, which represents another caving-in to pressure from fringe groups, will raise another horrendous spectre in the months leading up to the referendum.  In effect, we are reaping the grim harvest of all those decades when the State acted at the behest of clerics and clericalists.  We are now reaping the fruit of the identification of Church and State, of the immaturity of churchmen and politicians who would not trust people to behave and who foisted on them this kind of paternalism which has taken on such a monstrous manifestation. I do not believe there is any solution but to remove the clause in the Constitution.  There is no possibility of replacing it with some other clause or amending the existing clause.</P>
    <P>Dr. Margaret Fine-Davis, an expert on women's studies, who reported to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on this matter, indicated in <i>The Irish Times</i> today that when people are asked detailed questions about abortion in many cases their answers are very different from the blanket &ldquo;no&rdquo; or &ldquo;yes&rdquo; you get in a constitutional amendment.  In other words, a constitutional clause is much too crude an instrument to reflect the whole range of nuances that are involved in this question.  The only answer is to remove this clause but the problem will not stop there.  This morning <Col N="768" /> on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; a Family Solidarity spokesperson expressed general and I would say, smug satisfaction at the way the amendment has been working up to now because anybody wishing to have an abortion conveniently went to England.  This hiccup apart, he hopes that will continue to be the case.  Consider the hypocrisy of that.</P>
    <P>We are opening up another implication here.  If the Church of Ireland, for example, believes abortion is permissible in certain circumstances and is moral in certain circumstances, why do people have to go to England to have an abortion? Not alone must we remove that clause from the Constitution but we must examine the further degree of infringement of personal freedom involved by the present abortion laws.  That is something we were not thinking of last week.</P>
    <P>Out of this appalling situation I can only hope that good will come.  I welcome that all party approach to this matter and hope it will be observed on a whole range of issues.</P>

      <P>I accept it will not be of any great comfort to this family that each of us offers our sympathy, concern and prayers for the tragic circumstances in which they find themselves.  However, I want to add my voice to those sentiments. I welcome the Taoiseach's acceptance of Deputy Bruton's suggestion that the Government should assist this family in whatever way possible.  I urge the Government to offer assistance to anybody who has been raped.  It is an appalling situation for any girl to find herself in and it is compounded if the result of that rape is a pregnancy.  It is a nightmare most of us cannot imagine and we cannot comprehend how these people are suffering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time of the 1983 referendum, solemn assurances were given that back-up services for the family would be extended and counselling and advice services would be provided for rape victims. I have seen little evidence of that over the years.  The Government should assist the voluntary bodies who help these people.  They should ensure that <Col N="769" /> adequate services and an education programme are available to any girl who is raped.</P>
    <P>I am the father of two daughters and if either were raped and a pregnancy resulted, I would be extremely disappointed if they suggested having an abortion.  I want to put it on the record that I would do everything in my power to prevent them having an abortion.  I am here because my mother chose not to have an abortion.  I hope the Government and the Opposition parties work together on this issue and not to assist anyone to have an abortion or to do away with life, either born or unborn.</P>
    <P>We have many fundamental rights; we have a fundamental right once we are conceived.  We do not have power over a foetus but there is a Power above who knows, and that fact should not be overlooked. I am proud of the fact that abortion is illegal here and I sincerely hope that all the legal, medical and political minds will come together and resolve this problem without legalising abortion here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, I want to express my sympathy for this tragic family and young girl who have been brutalised by these circumstances. Whether this child has or has not an abortion, she will never get over the effects of the rape she has gone through. One of the most horrendous things about this case is the fact that other women who are subjected to rape are now going to be extremely apprehensive about reporting it to the Garda who are supposed to be the protectors of the rights of the people of this country.  Women will not want it to come to the notice of the Garda lest they have the attention of the Attorney General, the full force of the courts and the law turned on them as they were turned on this girl.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must bear this in mind because it is a cause of great distress to women, not only to women who have been raped but women who go to England because they decide to have an abortion.  A number of associations and societies here, while not favouring abortion or encouraging <Col N="770" /> women to go to England to have an abortion, nevertheless counsel them if they suffer trauma afterwards.  Presumably, that counselling will be discontinued because no woman will want it to be known she had an abortion.</P>
    <P>I am certain that the 67 per cent of people who voted for the referendum in 1983 did not envisage a situation where the State would be legally active against women seeking abortions outside this country, and particularly the tragic circumstances of this young 14 year old rape victim.  This is a very complex and legal situation.  I do not have legal training; I wish I did.  There are many grey areas and the one which perplexes me most is the freedom of movement and the right of people to go abroad.  What power does the Attorney General have to take it upon himself to take action against somebody going to another country to have an operation that is legal in that country?</P>
    <P>Senator Keogh referred to the case of an Irish person going to England to see a film which is banned here.  For instance, gambling in a casino is banned here. What action will the Attorney General take against somebody who goes abroad for that purpose?  The amendment to the Constitution states that the State guarantees in its laws to respect, and as far as practicable, by its laws to defend the right to life of the unborn.  Does anyone here believe it is practicable that the Garda will monitor the airports and seaports to see if pregnant women are going abroad and question them as to why they are going?  The same applies with regard to freedom of information.  This cannot be construed as being practicable.  It is ludicrous to think we can take injunctions against women going abroad.  It is one thing to have laws banning abortion in this country but to invade the privacy of a family who decide to take their child abroad to have an abortion is different. To imprison women here for nine months and to have them in contempt of court if they go abroad cannot be condoned.</P>
    <P>I hope there will be an appeal to the Supreme Court and that this matter will be settled beyond doubt.  The Supreme Court should be forced to give a <Col N="771" /> judgment with the same urgency as they did in the case of the beef tribunal where they were able to give a decision within one or two days.  Surely this case is far more urgent and must be resolved immediately.</P>
    <P>Prior to having another referendum we should go through all the processes, to the Supreme Court and, if necessary, to the European Court, to have the situation resolved.  If we must have another referendum, so be it.  I welcome the consensus, all-party approach, the non-confrontational, non-political party attitude on this issue.  The country has shown that, to an extent, it has grown up and I hope that the restraint which has been shown on all sides will continue.</P>

      <P>This unfortunate scenario of the 14 year old girl who was prevented from having an abortion which resulted from the most heinous crime of rape is nothing less than tragic.  The true tragedy of this is that all of us in our own way are contributing to the immense anguish by playing out this drama in the public forum.  As a mother I sympathise with the parents of the young girl who must be devastated by the nightmare they and their daughter are facing.  I do not wish to intrude on their privacy any further. I am sure the parents in taking the difficult decision they had to take felt they were acting in the best interests of their child at the time.  As a woman I feel that a quick and decisive solution must be found, whether legislatively or otherwise, to ensure that this debacle never happens again.  The Taoiseach with other party leaders must explore every avenue to find a way to help this unfortunate girl without allowing either side of the abortion debate to exploit the situation to their own advantage at the expense of this girl.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As legislators the solution may lie in a consensus approach while, at the same time, being sympathetic towards women and girls who are faced with the problem of an unwanted pregnancy.  Nothing is purely black and white but the onus is on the politicians to legislate for all in a just <Col N="772" /> and humane manner.  There are no easy solutions but we hope that in this case the girl and her family will be given every support, be it legal, financial, or medical. This awful trauma must be resolved soon and we as legislators must do our utmost to ensure that this situation never happens again.</P>

      <P>A cloud of depression and shame has descended over this country and everybody has felt it over the past few days since this appallingly sad story broke.  Public opinion and support are behind this young girl and her family. President Robinson's call for courage to face up to the problem and resolve it sums up the overwhelming similar feelings of all people in this country.  She used words like hurt, bewilderment, anxiety, frustration and helplessness of women.  She spoke of the need for a more compassionate society and this is not the first time we have sought compassion especially when we delve into moral issues.  The President said we must all work together and make progress in this difficult area and nobody could have said it more eloquently.  Surely her call is one that nobody can ignore.</P>
      <P>If we could imagine the most horrific circumstances a girl or woman could find herself in, then this must be the definitive situation.  It is painful even to comtemplate the plight of the girl and her family, a girl who has suffered sexual abuse and rape, who has been traumatised by pregnancy at a time when young girls of her age are going through what are considered normal and natural changs of puberty but which all mothers know can be a most difficult and bewilering time.  As one who campaigned in 1983 and did not wish to have the amendment inserted in the Constitution, I still reel from the venom, hurt and divisiveness we were confronted with during that time. Many eminent lawyers spoke out at that time about what might happen in the future and I am surprised it has taken this number of years for such a case to come before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="773" /> The implications for women are enormous. Where is the concern for the quality of life for women?  Where is the concern for the mental, emotional and psychological needs of women?  Are they being recognised?  Where is the protection for the family unit that we speak so strongly about in this country?  Where really is the concern for the rights of the child?</P>
    <P>The pressure, fear and guilt that women will experience from feeling they may be informed on and be prevented by injunction from travelling may have effects which will totally undermine the original purpose of the Constitutional provision.  It will inhibit and stifle discussion. Women will not seek help or talk with their best friends.  They will not look for guidance at a time when sympathy and caring will be most necessary.  It will lead to an unwillingness on the part of women or girls to report rape, incest or sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>Every one of us here today has welcomed the consensus approach of all parties,. There is need for urgency and for immediate action.  The case, as Senator Doyle said, has legal, constitutional and international implications.  Three options have been mentioned taking legal advice on the possibility of introducing legislation to balance the effect of the constitutional amendment as interpreted; the question of a Maastricht Protocol which might limit the application of the amendment banning abortion to within the jurisdiction of the State; the possibility of holding a referendum amending the Constitution, which possibly may be the only option before us.</P>
    <P>I hope the family have the strength to go forward and appeal the case to the Supreme Court so that every avenue is explored.  I pose the question: can we really legislate for the morals of people and should we be looking now at a total overhaul of the Constitution, line by line, Article by Article?  For the last number of years we have been looking at the Constitution and at the legal implications of some decisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the expression <Col N="774" /> of heartfelt sympathy for the family and the victim in this case.  The first thing that must be clear in the debate is that the original amendment to the Constitution was a bizarre mistake and clearly an error of judgment.  While there were some sincere players on the pitch that time, there were some people who, with the benefit of hindsight, must be seen to have played a particularly cynical role.  However, that is history and we are now faced with the reality of this tragedy.</P>
      <P>What is clear is that we will ultimately have no choice but to remove the amendment. This case has implications for freedom of movement.  We cannot allow a policing network to be set up that would literally police women leaving this country. That would not be acceptable in any society.  It would have shocking implications for rape victims and could prevent them reporting rape.</P>
      <P>All rapists are perverted and sinister but a really bizarre case would be if someone took out an injunction against the victim of a rape preventing that person from leaving the country or if they reported that person to the law officers and thus prevented them leaving the country.  People who are the victims of rape pose a particular problem in relation to abortion and the same ground rules cannot apply to such victims.  In any humanitarian, caring society that would seem to be the case.  It would also seem to me &mdash; this point was given some attention in the constitutional amendment the last time &mdash; that the life of the mother in all cases must take precedence.  These two situations do not lend themselves to black and white solutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people might be tempted, through the kind of national hypocrisy for which we are famous, to feel that the matter would be resolved if we deleted the amendment and still allowed boatloads of women to go to England for abortions.  We have no option but to rectify the existing situation in favour of this girl and in favour of similar cases in the future.  We cannot turn a blind eye to the number of people who leave this country annually for an abortion. <Col N="775" /> I do not believe in an imposed morality. Morality should come from within the individual, the family unit and society.  Let us be clear.  This is the time to employ pro-life strategies and introduce proper support systems for the victims of rape and those who have unwanted pregancies.</P>
    <P>We know that every day since the passage of the amendment large numbers of women have left this country on a very lonely journey.  It is time to deal with the matter in hand; there is no getting away from it.  When we clear that up, we must look at our thinking, first, in the case of rape victims in general, secondly, in cases where the life of the mother is threatened and, thirdly, in relation to women leaving this country for abortions.</P>
    <P>This debate will have to go on for some time.  I am fully in favour of a consensus attitude but we cannot flinch from the range of issues we could easily discard once we get over this little problem.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that in a debate like this a speaker can range over a very wide area but I intend to confine my remarks to a few items in which I am interested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, our society is facing great challenges.  The huge numbers out of <Col N="776" /> work demand an exceptional employment performance and the Government must therefore, make every effort to safeguard existing jobs and encourage the creation of new jobs.  At the same time on the European scene great changes have taken place in recent times and are still taking place.  The Iron Curtain and the Cold War no longer exist.  The Berlin Wall has disappeared and Germany is reunited.  The last bastions of the Communist states has disappeared and Communism, as we knew it, has disappeared. The European Community is embarking on historic ventures &mdash; the creation of a Single Market from January 1993 and the establishment of political, economic and monetary union.  All this will present us with tremendous opportunity but it will equally test our policies and attitudes to European affairs.  If we make the right decisions now we can share in the economic prosperity that a Single Market will create and make progress in regard to employment which is the single and greatest social problem facing the Government at present.</P>
    <P>The overall package contained in the budget which was introduced recently will give a considerable stimulus to employment.  In consultation with the social partners the Government have undertaken a series of special initiatives to confront the problem of rising unemployment and to accelerate the provision of new employment.  Substantial funds will be provided by the European Commission from 1 February for a new employment subsidy scheme and a new in-company training scheme.  Under the employment subsidy scheme, a subsidy of £54 per week for 12 months will be provided for 15,000 additional employees who have been on the unemployment register for at least two months.  The incompany job training scheme will also provide training on the employers' premises for up to 10,000 people who have been on the unemployment register for at least two months.  This is a very important development and will perhaps become a permanent feature of the Irish training system in the future.</P>
    <P>Overall expenditure on those two <Col N="777" /> schemes is estimated to come to £70 million in the years 1992 and 1993.  Of this, the European Social Fund will contribute up to some £60 million with the remainder coming from Irish employers and the Exchequer.  The schemes will undoubtedly help us to improve our unemployment situation and there will be other schemes also put in place by public agencies and, hopefully, some impact will be made on the unemployment figures during the years 1992 and 1993.</P>
    <P>We have the problem in rural areas of farmers leaving the land because of the appalling fall in their incomes in recent years.  Those farmers are forced to seek employment and compete with others in the labour market.  We saw in the recent census of population the serious imbalance between one part of the country and another.  The population in the west has declined drastically while the population in the east has increased.  That trend will continue unless the Government and the people in the west take drastic action to stop it.  This was highlighted recently by the bishops at meetings which have been held all over the west and which have been very well attended by people striving to find a solution to this problem.</P>
    <P>We in the west are disadvantaged in many ways.  We are far from ports and airports and it costs more to transport goods across the country.  We do not have the infrastructure or the road system they have in other parts of the country nor do we have an industrial base.  Is it any wonder that we are worried about the GATT and Common Agricultural Policy negotiations taking place in Europe?  The outcome of those negotiations will have very far reaching effects on our farmers. If the United States proposals were implemented, Irish farmers would stand to lose £900 million per year.  It would drive thousands of farmers on to the dole and create all kinds of social problems for them.</P>
    <P>The family farm, as we know, is part and parcel of our social structure and must be preserved at all costs.  We have 70,000 low income farm families.  Some <Col N="778" /> of them are struggling to survive on an income of £2,400 per annum and less. What is to happen to those farmers if the Americans get their way and all subsidies are phased out by 1996?  Europe must defend its family farm structure against the current onslaught by the factory farms and the agri-food conglomerates of the United States of America.</P>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy has served the European Community well over the past 20 years.  We have a continuous supply of the best food in the world at a price that is at an ever decreasing percentage of the household budget. Ten million people are employed on the land of Europe.  The removal of subsidies as demanded by the United States, would drive millions of farmers off the land and create social problems.  In spite of what the Americans say, their agriculture is highly subsidised.  According to the OECD report, the United States spent, $21,000 per farmer in 1988.  This compares with $10,000 for the European Community.  To add to this, the United States Secretary for Agriculture announced a $10 billion write off for some United States farmers recently; the farmers affected each get $50,000.  Why then are the United States complaining about subsidies paid to European farmers?  If Irish farmers are to survive they will have to be subsidised.</P>
    <P>I hope that in the near future we will see the export markets to the Middle East opened up for our cattle and beef trade again. This would ease the current situation in the cattle trade.  I compliment the Government, the farming organisations and all the agencies who are trying hard to have this market reopened.</P>
    <P>In the Estimates for Public Services, 1992, Vote 32 &mdash; Agriculture and Food &mdash; I am pleased to see that this Estimate has increased from £452.3 million to £472.8 million, an increase of 5 per cent on 1991.  I sincerely hope that all outstanding grants due to farmers will be paid shortly.  We know that some of those grants are due for quite a while and that farmers are anxiously waiting for the cheque to arrive.  I hope the Minister will take advantage of the increased Vote for <Col N="779" /> Agriculture and Food in the Estimate and that those grants will be paid in the very near future.</P>
    <P>During this year also, many farmers will benefit from extension and reclassification of their lands.  For the first time 13,000 farmers will benefit from the extension of the less favoured areas and a further 16,000 farmers will benefit from the reclassification of their areas.  This, when one considers the higher rates of grant paid should be an attractive bonus for those farmers.</P>
    <P>Agriculture, as we all know, is our main industry and it is important that every effort be made to prime the engine and ensure that our farmers are given the standard of living to which they are entitled, like every other section of the community.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased that the former Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Woods, gave a commitment that the research centre at Belclare and the agricultural college in Athenry will be maintained.  It would be criminal if either of these were closed down when there is such need at this time for research.  I am delighted he gave that commitment.  He visited those two centres and was very impressed.  He listened to the pleas from public representatives on all sides of the political divide not just from Galway but from Mayo and Roscommon because these counties use those two centres.</P>
    <P>I hope Teagase will maintain their centres at Headford, Gort and Loughrea.  It is very important they do so and provide a better service for the farmers of County Galway.  I am very pleased that in the budget £1 million extra was allocated to Teagasc and this should help them overcome the serious financial problems they faced at present.</P>
    <P>We all know that good technical and financial advice is of critical importance to small farmers to help them remain competitive.  The provision of an extra £1 million for those services will help to do that.  The Minister re-affirmed his commitment to protect and safeguard the advisory, training and research services. It is important that farmers have access <Col N="780" /> to such services in these difficult times when prices are falling and there is a surplus of produce.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset we were now facing great challenges.  We have a new Government and I wish them every success.  I believe they have the will and capacity to face the challenge that confronts them. Difficult decisions will have to be taken if we are to participate fully in economic and monetary union and reap the benefit that will flow from it.  We will be faced with a referendum later this year.  The Government will ask the people to endorse the decisions taken at Maastricht. It is very important for us and for Europe because it would affect the whole of Europe and the decisions taken at Maastricht could not go ahead.</P>
    <P>The Government have an enormous task facing them and we have seen some unexpected problems arise in the last few days.  I know they have the will and capacity to tackle those problems.  I hope the year ahead will be successful and fruitful and that we will see a big dent made in the frightening unemployment figures that are the cancer in our society at present.  I hope the Government will spare no effort in trying to resolve that serious social problem because it tears the heart out of families to see their young people emigrating.  We know this recession is hitting not just Ireland but America and other great nations such as England where Irish boys and girls were almost guaranteed jobs.  Now those countries are finding it just as difficult as we are to overcome the unemployment problem that faces them.</P>
    <P>I wish the Government every success and hope, for all our sakes, that they will make every effort to tackle the serious problems facing us at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, to the House and wish him well in his new role.  The set of financial proposals before the Oireachtas are unacceptable for a number of reasons including their failure to tackle or come to terms with the demographic problems here.  We have a very <Col N="781" /> serious population crisis.  Over the past 60 years, the population of County Leitrim has fallen by 60 per cent.  That frightening statistic must pose a shocking challenge to any legislation.</P>
      <P>The second frightening statistic is that the population of Cavan, Mayo and other north western counties is down by 40 per cent.  That is an average figure.  In my own county, Cavan, the population in the western part of the county, which is that bit more remote from major urban centre, is particularly depleted.  Over the past ten years 27,000 people left the western part of this country.  During the period 1981 to 1986, 20,000 people left. Sixty per cent of the children who were in their early teens in 1981 in isolated regions of this country have now left. Over the period I am discussing, the population of Leitrim fell by 6.4 per cent; in Roscommon it fell by 5 per cent; in Mayo it fell by 3.9 per cent; in Sligo it fell by 2.3 per cent and in Galway, excluding the city of Galway, it fell by 1.5 per cent.  As I pointed out, the population of Cavan radically declined over the 60 year period and the western section of that county has had a particular problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously there is a case of rural decline and that poses a major problem. There are a number of contributing factors to his rural decline.  The first is that in many parts of the west of Ireland &mdash; this is a frightening statistic and it is backed up by eminent professional people who have done research &mdash; the family farm net income can be as low as £50.  That is a frightening figure.  Small enterprises at the moment in the west of Ireland are finding it more difficult to get grant aid.  Just as there has been a general centralistion towards urban centres, particularly towards the eastern part of the country and Dublin specifically, there has also been concentration and centralisation of the social services which has had an effect on population patterns.  In recent times there has been amalgamation of schools, the end of some rural post offices, which is particularly dangerous, and the closure of local Garda <Col N="782" /> stations.  All of this is contributing to the depopulation of rural areas.</P>
    <P>I had occasion to visit the area where I was reared at Christmas and I was looking at the structure of population in that area.  There are some very frightening factors there.  Many of the young people are now outside the country or they were visiting home from towns and cities in the country.  Rural society in this country is under threat, it is in real danger of extinction. It is not being unduly alarmist to say that unless we reverse the trends and patterns much of the west and the north-west of Ireland will literally be a forest in the next 20 or 30 years.  That is the pattern that is developing.  If you drive through any of these regions at the moment you will notice a much greater concentration of forestry than at any time in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset that it is because the Appropriation Act for this year, and indeed subsequent financial arrangements in the budget, have not come to terms with this problem that I am opposed to them.  For example, one thing that I think was glaringly necessary in my home area of Cavan-Monaghan was the inclusion of that entire area in the severely handicapped areas.  There was a compelling case on the basis of income, of population trends, of soil type, on every imaginable basis, for the complete inclusion of Counties Cavan and Monaghan in the severely handicapped areas. Large tracts of land in those areas have been left out of the severely handicapped areas.  I am concerned about that and I ask the Minister, Deputy Treacy, who is from the west to take that question on board.  I know there is a major national input into deciding what areas are classified or otherwise, because when our proposal regarding classification is sent to Brussels it tends to gain acceptance.  It is completely unacceptable that over 40 per cent of County Cavan is left out of the severely handicapped areas.</P>
    <P>The last thing I would want to do in this House, or any responsible Member of this House would want to do, would be to engage in any petty begrudgery or any attempt to introduce distinctions or <Col N="783" /> differences between areas but one cannot avoid noticing that all of the Counties of Roscommon and Longford are in the severely handicapped areas.  It cannot be argued that there is a more compelling case for these counties.  I accept that Roscommon and Longford should be in the severely handicapped category and I am totally in favour of that but what I cannot accept is that there is a less compelling reason to include all of Cavan and Monaghan.</P>
    <P>The reason I have focused on the question of the severely handicapped areas is that a large segment of the funding comes from Europe, that there is a low level of national input and a great proportion of the money put in by the Government will, in fact, return to State coffers through taxation because the money will go into circulation.  I also view the severely handicapped area payments, the headage payments, as an effective device to maintain the fabric of rural Ireland and to fight the haemorrhage of population that those areas are suffering.  I am anxious to hear the Minister's response in that matter and to hear that action will be taken on it.  I am anxious to know if that will be included.  There have been a number of appeals submitted from County Cavan, and indeed from County Monaghan, concerning their non-classification. I would urge that those appeals be taken very seriously and be acted upon.</P>
    <P>To go back to my original point, I urge that it is time an emergency stategy and an emergency package of measures be put in place literally to save rural Ireland, to save the north-west, the west and the mid-west of Ireland.  Obviously reclassification to severely handicapped status is one thing ut I also think it is necessary to support small enterprises.  It is also necessary to take a second look at the over-concentration and centralisation of the social services.  It is essential that, very vigorously and in a united fashion as a people, as a country, as a Legislature, and indeed with the co-operation of the social partners we go back to Brussels and Strasbourg and renegotiate the proposed <Col N="784" /> alterations in the Common Agricultural Policy, because ultimately they threaten the very existence of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am not one of the people who is confident that the package of handouts associated with the Common Agricultural Policy reforms will necessarily last; they are not articles of law, they will depend on the largesse, on the goodwill of the European Parliament, of the European Commission, at a given time.  To my mind &mdash; and this is a view supported by Professor McNulty of the Agricultural Science Department in UCD &mdash; it would be much more realistic, logical and wholesome at every level were the mandarins of Brussels, and indeed Commissioner MacSharry, to focus their attention on factory farmers on the mainland of Europe, on the huge farmers for whom farming is a mega-business, rather than focusing their attention on the subsistence of small farmers.</P>
    <P>When you look on the question from an environmental and sociological point of view, from the viewpoint of the maintenance of a way of life, from every conceivable point of view, there is no logic in seeking to reduce European agricultural output by extinguishing the small farmers. I do not think that is the way to go about that nor do I think it is sensitive or sensible, and we have to vigorously oppose it.  I am concerned that the trade union movement have not become sufficiently involved in opposition to that package.  That package poses a major threat to at least 16,000 employees in the agri-food industry, in the food processing sector and in farm related employment. Their jobs must ultimately be threatened. It is absolutely necessary that everybody in this country would see the present proposals as a real threat to our way of life and do something about them.</P>
    <P>If we have a crisis with rural depopulation &mdash; and I have clearly illustrated that that is the case &mdash; arising from that we obviously have a major emigration problem.  I am one of those who accepts there can be some benefits when people emigrate voluntarily, they gain experience and their lives are enhanced <Col N="785" /> by that experience and they will add considerably to society if they return.  Unfortunately a great deal of emigration has not been voluntary, it has not been a creative experience, but rather people have emigrated from sheer necessity and face very adverse circumstances in their new country.</P>
    <P>I was told the other day by a returned emigrant &mdash; and this is not being fanciful, this is not a fable, this is a true story &mdash; that at the moment young Irish lads in England are queueing up at Camden town and Kilburn High Road from 5 a.m. to wait for subcontractors to give them a day's work on building sites, and while they used get £30 or £40 a day they are now being offered £15 to £20 a day.  That is a frightening scenario and is something we have to deal with as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Related to the question of the depopulation of the rural areas and the massive emigration must be the unemployment issue.  Unemployment clearly is the biggest challenge facing us.  I have to put it on the record that it was my party and my Party Leader who put the unemployment issue at the top of the political agenda over the last year.  We questioned the efficacy of the original <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> not on its pay elements but on the fact that it did not come to terms with the unemployment issue, that it did not have a coherent strategy to deal with unemployment. We subsequently suggested that a national jobs forum be put in place as a matter of urgency.  The objective of that jobs forum would be to draw together the entire genius of the nation to deal with this very extraordinary and difficult problem.  Nobody is suggesting that <i>deus ex machina</i> a panacea to unemployment can be arrived at.</P>
    <P>What we are suggesting, and what is consistently being suggested by Deputy John Bruton, is that we must immediately tackle the issue of unemployment and treat it as our primary national objective to deal with it.  That is why we are so concerned that the nation's attention has been so wrongfully distracted from these <Col N="786" /> issues over the last six months.  We recognise that the solution to the unemployment problem is difficult.  We believe that central to it must be a shift of taxation from the human resource within industry, within the services area, to plant, machinery and other areas.  I would not say that there is not some merit from the point of view of equity in what has happened in the taxation system in the recent budget but it is not necessarily the case that the kind of adjustments made in the taxation system will lead to increased employment.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of fundamental flaws in the argument put forward that one immediately creates jobs by adjusting the PAYE system.  The obvious fundamental flaw in that argument is that most of the money the consumer has for discretionary spending as a result is spent on imported goods.  If one is trying to make the option of going into employment a more attractive proposition than long term unemployment, the place to make those radical changes are at the lower end of the PAYE system.  That is where one needs so that there will be a clear advantage to somebody in being involved in work.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced that that issue was properly addressed in the recent budget. I have no evidence to date other than a set of aspirational remarks by the new Taoiseach which I hope will be translated into reality, that the Government have taken the question of unemployment on board as the most serious national priority.  What is necessary is a rounded taxation strategy to deal with unemployment, a major shift of taxation, and a radical overhaul of our education system to deal with unemployment.  That is clear from the Culliton report.  That it is a welcome report containing many meritorious recommendations.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the Culliton report that they were unhappy with an existing education system that is too concentrated in the academic area.  The report bemoans the fact that even our vocational schools are shifting from the vocational to the academic.  That is very wrong.  I believe the vocational school system should not <Col N="787" /> be diluted from its original objectives.  I welcome what the Culliton report says on that.  It is also interesting that the Culliton report makes the point that there is a lack of skills in our country generally compared to other areas.  I believe our education system will have to put more emphasis on entrepreneurial skills, on teaching people how to create jobs.  For too long we have assumed that our very bright students should automatically follow an academic career.  It is unfortunate we have not concentrated sufficiently on building on the capacity, willingness and imagination to create jobs within that group.  There should be an enterprise programme within our schools system that would have students visiting local factories and places of enterprise, doing project work on possible enterprises within their community and having a school co-op.  There is no reason why a co-op in any secondary school could not buy the school books for that school and provide a service to students, thus giving the pupils an experience of managing a business.  It is a simple device that could be used to create greater entrepreneurial consciousness in our pupils, side by side with project work and feasibility studies within their areas.  If that kind of experience were given to our young people it would have a beneficial effect on the unemployment situation.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that we must tackle unemployment urgently.  There are differing views among economists about this.  Some go so far as to say that by the year 2,000 we could have as many as 500,000 people unemployed if present trends continue.  Others are more cautious and suggest it will be something over 300,000.  Either figure is unacceptable and frightening and will result in a shocking level of dependency by the year 2,000.  If we have mass unemployment and an increase in the number of older people seeking State aid there will be a highly dependent population and a shrinking productive sector.  That will have horrendous economic consequences.  We should address that as a matter of urgency.  If that is added to the <Col N="788" /> level of cynicism, as reflected in MRBI polls, in politicians and the political system, they make a very dangerous mix for the future of democracy here.</P>
    <P>This House is the place to address this question in a reasoned fashion now before it is too late.  I do not think it is unduly alarmist to say that if we do not come to terms with our unemployment crisis and make an impression on it in a very short time we will have a dangerously cynical young population.  Only the Lord knows what form that cynicism will take and the alienation those people will experience from Government.  We must address that.</P>
    <P>One of the obvious strategies to deal with unemployment is to boost our tourist industry.  It is one sector that has potential for growth.  There is no doubt that it experienced some growth in recent years and that it would have considerably more growth were it not for the horrendous events in the North.</P>
    <P>People who travel abroad say there are parts of the world where Ireland is seen as another Beirut because of the atrocities shown on television screens from Northern Ireland.  Those atrocities are a major threat to our tourist industry but notwithstanding that there is immense potential for tourism.  I am not convinced that we have taken seriously the potential of the tourist industry or that we have tried to harness it properly.</P>
    <P>I will be parochial for a moment and say that I am not happy with the marketing of my county of Cavan as a tourist location.  I am not happy that in Bord Fáilte publications and marketing campaigns our county receives an adequate projection for the foreign visitors.  I do not think those brochures, and the marketing campaigns, satisfactorily project the natural beauty, or the cultural and wealth of tradition of that county.  I am concerned about that.</P>
    <P>We should focus more on the potential of cultural holidays.  I am convinced that as the years go by &mdash; it is already a developing phenomenon &mdash; there will be less interest in the sun holidays.  There is already medical evidence that sun holidays are not necessarily good for people. <Col N="789" /> As the interest in them diminishes and as Ireland opens up after the Single Market there will be great potential for cultural holidays here.  What I mean by cultural holidays are holidays centred around local literary and musical figures and others within our artistic tradition.  I had occasion to organise in my county of Cavan a Percy French festival a few years ago.  That festival was attended by a large number of visitors.  Percy French had a long association with County Cavan and he had associations with County Roscommon, Senator Finneran's homeland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>He visited Cavan on a few occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Being a man of good taste he decided to spend the greater part of his life in County Cavan.  Our festival commemorating his association with County Cavan was a great success.  That experience clearly brought home to me that the notion of cultural and heritage holidays had great potential.  I do not think they are being properly explored.</P>
      <P>Help from central Government and a direction from the relevant Department are needed to get them off the ground.  I would be interested to hear the Minister's response to that suggestion to deal with unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the greatest disincentives to tourist and industrial development in rural areas and the development of the agri-business was the complete breakdown over the past number of years of our county roads structure.  Cavan &mdash; I am not pleased to say this in a House of Parliament &mdash; has to be the most glaring example of this.  It is the county that has the worst road structure in Ireland, a completely broken down county roads structure.  It is not unduly colourful to compare some of the roads in Cavan to the Tibetan passes.  It is no more colourful, either, to regard some of the potholes and craters on the roads of Cavan as places that would offer potential for fishing expeditions.  The sad reality is that we have a broken down network of county roads.  The county engineer, who is a very distinguished professional, experienced <Col N="790" /> in local Government, did a major analysis of the road structure of the county and of the investment that would be needed to deal with it.  Using the most conservative of estimates, it is his professional opinion, in a published report, that it would take £8 million per year for the next five years to rectify the county road structure of Cavan.  Also, a number of roads in the county need to be upgraded to primary and secondary road status.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister today to take this problem back to Government.  It poses a tremendous threat to local agriculture, to the delivery of the social services in the area, to local industry and to tourism in one of the most beautiful parts of Ireland. This matter is important and must be dealt with as a matter of urgency and I ask for a very specific response from the Minister.  I ask him to acknowledge to the House that a change in the road structure and a major programme of work is a priority for all the economic and social reasons I have outlined and I ask him to assure the House that there will be a real financial commitment to doing that.  It must be one of the most urgent requirements at the moment.</P>
    <P>I do not question the efficacy and importance of building ring roads around cities.  I am well aware that, if we are to bring our economic and industrial performance into line with mainland Europe such roads are necessary.  We must reduce the time it takes for goods to go from A to B.  Flyovers and ring roads around our towns and cities are critically important, but, because of the condition of county roads in places such as Cavan, Connemara, parts of Kildare, Sligo and Roscommon we must consider, in the short term, suspending all other activity on primary roads, ring roads and so on until we address the question of our county road structure.</P>
    <P>I know much of the money coming from Brussels for roads is targeted for specific works, but given the economic and social necessity to change the country roads structure, the Government could easily convince the mandarins of Brussels <Col N="791" /> and Strasbourg that a change should be made.  Regional and Social Funds are spent in this country to achieve what is known as cohesion, but I see no reason these funds cannot be spent at the discretion of our Government.  We should go back to Brussels and tell them we will allocate the moneys coming for roads, as we see necessary, in the short term, to deal with an immediate and pressing county road problem.</P>
    <P>No amount of colourful language, no description could convey to this House the dreadful position of the people who live in isolated roadways in County Cavan.  Many new houses have been built there by enterprising young people but those houses are devalued because of the condition of the roads that lead to them. The pride those people have in their new homes is diminished because of the state of the roads.  This is a further factor in the exodus of population.  It is good that some remain behind and those who remain should be encouraged to stay.</P>
    <P>People who are cushioned by living in urban centres near taxi ranks, bus stations and the DART train line may find this a little remote, a little abstract and may consider it an exaggeration.  I can assure them that people living in isolated rural places, trying to go about their farming business, getting their milk out of a milk tanker, getting the public health nurse to call in to visit their old relatives, having the doctor call to see them, having their priest or minister of religion call, suffer because of cratered and potholed roads.  I appeal to the Minister to take emergency steps to deal with the matter.  I ask him to assure this House that he will convey their problem to Minister Smith and that he himself will take it up as a matter of extreme urgency.</P>
    <P>As party spokesperson on Health I want to address the health aspect of the Appropriation Act and health policy in general.  As yet, there has been no discernible acceptance on the part of Government that we have a major problem in the health services and there is no plan of action.  I accept that some worthwhile committees, commissions of <Col N="792" /> inquiry and study groups have been and are in existence but I am frustrated and anxious about the fact that we are not acting in the area of health in a sufficiently vigorous fashion.  My party are unhappy with the performance of the Government in the health area and with what the Appropriation Act proposes in that regard.  Hospital wards are still closing.  Nurses are taking holidays to suit ward closures.  My opposite number here today could, perhaps make a more educated observation on this because of his direct experience of the health services, what is happening is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>There are still waiting lists, as I and as any other practising politician knows, from the number of representations we get at clinics and at home.  We know there is still a waiting list for eye treatment, for cataract treatment.  Only recently I came across the case of a single man living alone &mdash; he is also the victim of some of the other deprivations I mentioned earlier.  His last appointment at the Eye and Ear Hospital was five or six months ago.  He was told then he would be called for a cataract operation.  His right eye is now virtually without sight and the cataracts have been ready for removal for months.  That is not acceptable, and could not be acceptable.  We also still have a queue for hip replacements and we have a major problem in the orthodontic area.  I know it is difficult to get qualified orthodontists but we have a crisis in the orthodontic area.  We have not dealt, either, with the question of mental and physical handicap.</P>
    <P>In the eight health board areas last year there were significant cutbacks of investment.  There is still a scarcity of funding.  The North-Eastern Health Board area has an expenditure of £39 per head lower than the second lowest region in the country.  We have a lower <i>per capita</i> expenditure on health than any other health board region.  To me, as a representative from that part of the country that is obviously a cause for concern. However, that does not obviate the necessity to introduce adequate funding in other areas as well.</P>
    <P>Last year there was a shortfall in the <Col N="793" /> North-Eastern Health Board area of £1.4 million; in the Southern Health Board area there was a shortfall of £4 million; in the Mid-Western area it was £2.3 million; in the North-Western region, £1.5 million; the Western Health Board had a shortfall of £3.25 million, and the SouthEastern Health Board £1.38 million. What is depressing about those statistics is that they manifest themselves more in waiting lists than in any other way.  In other words, the people who bear the brunt of those shortfalls are invariably the patients queueing for the various surgeries. That is a cause of concern.</P>
    <P>A couple of years ago my party suggested a very simple strategy to the Government to make a fresh start on health care.  We proposed that, on a temporary basis, a large proportion of national lottery funding should be frozen to eliminate the waiting lists.  That simple device did not involve extra health expenditure overall.  It would have eliminated the waiting lists and the incredible agony suffered by many people.</P>
    <P>I am the first to acknowledge that many of the projects supported by the national lottery are worthy, I am the first to believe that it is worthwhile to build community centres, provide GAA pitches and to establish swimming areas, where possible, but I would argue that because of the extreme gravity in the health area, where so many people are suffering because they are waiting for a hip operation, a cataract operation, etc., health should take precedence over any social project, no matter how worthy, for a very short time.  That was a positive form of opposition.  In any democratic society seldom are Opposition parties so constructive as to state the problem and offer the solution at the same time.  Out of a sense of concern for the well being of our people and the country we proposed that simple proposal.  I once more propose that strategy.  I urge the Government to take this opportunity, now, and to do something about using national lottery funding on a once-off basis to eliminate waiting lists.</P>
    <P>I accept that there must be a major rationalisation of the health services, that <Col N="794" /> all areas that deliver health services must be looked at.  I would not argue that we necessarily need to increase the percentage of GNP we spend on health, but what I would argue is that we should focus the use of that money directly on patients in need.  We have, at the moment, unquestionably, a two tier health system.  There is the private health system, focused on the Blackrock Clinic and other institutions, and there is the health system for the people who must queue and wait for surgery.  I know of an individual in County Mayo who has been waiting two years for orthopaedic treatment. He is in excruciating pain.  On his last visit to his consultant at his clinic, he could not get a specific date when he would have the necessary surgery.  I can supply the data to back up that case. There are many such cases throughout my own county of Cavan which I could cite if the Minister wishes.</P>
    <P>There are waiting lists in a very critical area, that is, people waiting for heart by-pass surgery.  You do not need to know much about medicine to realise that waiting for a by-pass operation would not be the most relaxing situation.  It would not be very reassuring for the person providing life cover for that individual either.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence to date that the Government have seriously tackled the health question.  I repeat, they should eliminate the waiting lists by using national lottery funding on a once-off basis.  Having done that they should look at rationalisation, at delivery of services and cost cutting exercises in the health service.  This will, ultimately, mean that the shift of expenditure will be towards the patient, that the money will be spent at the coalface rather than anywhere else.</P>
    <P>A frightening fact is that rural society is dying and family farms are being replaced by forestry.  None of our legislation addresses that matter.  Neither have we addressed the question of unemployment, of the huge and shocking spectacle of lengthening dole queues.  We have not introduced proper taxation strategies to give an impetus to job creation, or even looked at the imaginative proposal of a national jobs forum, or at <Col N="795" /> our educational system where investment might act as an incentive to job creation.</P>
    <P>We have not coped adequately with the question of emigration or accepted that involuntary emigration, which we have at the moment, means people are destined to stand waiting for subcontractors on street corners in London from 5 a.m.  We do not even give an adequate support service to our emigrant communities abroad or to the organisations caring for them.  We have not dealt properly with the health question and the need for major change in the health area.  I am not happy that the appropriations are adequate to effect any improvement in our county and national roads structure.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the thrust of the Appropriations Act and with subsequent action in the budget.  I urge the Minister to take on board the suggestions I have made to him and to give this House an assurance that something realistic will be done as a matter of urgency to deal with unemployment.</P>

      <P>I just wanted to explain that I was paired for yesterday and today. I was not aware that we would be dealing this morning with the unfortunate case of that little girl of 14 years of age.  Had I known I would, of course, have been here and I would have expressed my sadness at what happened to her.  There are two innocent parties in this, the young girl, who is the mother, and the child.  Rather than take advantage of the short time the Chair has allocated to me, I would like to say, abortion is not the answer.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="796" /> Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Minister, Deputy Treacy, here and to congratulate him.  He is welcome back again in the post he held previously.  I also congratulate the Minister for Finance on the excellent work he is doing.  It is not an easy job in these days.  Everybody is asking for more services and more money and, at the same time, saying we must pay less tax.  It is difficult for him to satisfy all sectors.</P>
      <P>As other Senators have said, one of our biggest problems at the present time is unemployment and the depopulation of rural Ireland.  It seems always to have been a problem.  Many years ago Thomas Davis wrote: &ldquo;The silence of unlaboured fields lies like a judgement in the air.  A human voice is never heard, the sighing grass is everywhere.&rdquo;  He continued, &ldquo;Where are the sun-dark faces now, the ones that held the quiet heart, the hands that held the speeding plough.  Grasslands and lowing herds are good, but better human flesh and blood.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This problem was already serious when men of the calibre of Thomas Davis penned those lines.  Having grown up in the thirties and forties when unemployment was even worse than it is now, and at a time when there was less social aid to meet those problems, I always believed there was no need for anyone to emigrate.  I never emigrated.  I stayed in the old country and I am pleased to say I was never out of work for a day.  When I had to leave my job as a result of a foolish accident, which happened on a Sunday when I was out enjoying myself, I still refused to accept dole or handouts. I had two jobs at the same time for a while.  One necessitated my being on the <Col N="797" /> road at 5 a.m. delivering milk door to door and I would finish that job at 2 p.m. I worked in Tuam and in the Minister's area of Galway, selling milking machines.  It was hard work but it had to be done.</P>
    <P>We are demoralising society today.  We are always telling people everything is there for the asking.  We must have a pride in ourselves and in our ability.  We have a good education system, the country has done so much for us and after that we must do something for ourselves.</P>
    <P>I was delighted when Senator O'Reilly spoke about vocational education.  I am a graduate, as I am always proud to say, of a local vocational school.  We need two types of education.  We need good institutions and convents for those who are academically minded and, we need good education for those who are good with their hands, who have trades and skills in mind.  The great majority of our technicians and electricians are graduates of colleges such as Bolton Street, Dublin, and the humble technical schools around Ireland.  I oppose the conversion of those schools into secondary schools.  There were many brilliant men in the Department and some of them were responsible for denuding Ireland of its population, because they sent buses out around the country.  Their catch-cry was that every child in the country was entitled to the best possible education and if they had to be brought into cities and towns, so be it.  We created an atmosphere where people were encouraged to leave.  In my village we held on to our tech, by fighting a tough battle to retain it.</P>
    <P>When I went into public life 25 years ago I looked for an advance factory for my village and could not get one, so I built a small factory myself and rented it out and today in my village of 500 people, 200 people are permanently employed. One of those firms has recently been awarded a large export contract for which it competed with a firm in Milan.  Grange won the contract and is now building another extension.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="798" /> There are seven factories now in Grange, one of them owned by a Longford man.  I was delighted to encourage him.  Six of the entrepeneurs are graduates of the local tech in which we had a schoolmaster named Mr. Forde who believed in an education for life, and in fostering pride in oneself and one's locality.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to see the media cause so much demoralistion in society.  The radio comes on at 8 o'clock in the morning with nothing but hour after hour of hard luck stories.  While travelling to Letterkenny recently I listened to a popular radio programme where seven members of a family from Leitrim scatered all over the world spoke on radio to their parents at home.  I gave a girl a lift and told her I was sorry for not talking to her when she got in but that I was very interested in the radio programme.</P>
    <P>She told me she was one of a family of ten; I come from a family of seven.  I asked her where they were all working and she said they were all working at home.  &ldquo;I am the last one, she said &ldquo;and I got a job in Sligo&rdquo;.  All large families do not have to leave the country to find work.  I thought I would write to the programme concerned to tell them about the coincidence and ask them to send some of their research team to my village to see what a small village with a population of 500 people could do for itself.  My letter was not even acknowledged.  If my letter dealt with heartbreak or the dole mentality or with the downgrading of society, they would have asked me hotfoot to come on the programme.</P>
    <P>I am sorry we do not have more pride in ourselves and in our country.  We have education now.  John Fitzgerald Kennedy said that many Irish people left Ireland with a mixture of hope and agony.  Thank God, they leave today with hope and a good education, capable of entering the mainstream of any city or country they go to.</P>
    <P>I think we have gone over the top with education; one of the factories in my <Col N="799" /> town was looking for six extra employees and had quite a job to get them.  The last to be recruited came home from England on Wednesday and was working on Thursday morning.  He said he could not have got a job quicker anywhere in the world.  However, a clerical job in Sligo attracted 140 applicants.  We have an abundance of educated people but in many cases not suitable for the work available.  Our education system has been geared towards white collar work and pen pushing.  I am glad to see that the Minister, Deputy Brennan, in today's paper made it clear he is going to take more interest in vocational training.</P>
    <P>Our techs will no longer have metal work or woodwork; some years ago these subjects we described as metalwork and woodwork theory, now they will be termed metal and woodwork technology. What does that mean in simple language? A teacher of the subject told me, that a bicycle will be turned upside down and students will be shown how to take off a wheel and put it on again.  If that is what we are going to teach children and then expect them to take pride in the country and get jobs, what road are we going down?  That must be corrected.  My teacher in the tech had a saying, small things make perfection but perfection is no small thing.  We must follow that pertinent guideline.  We must at all times ensure that we are educating people to play a full part in Irish life.  We cannot all be doctors, consultants or teachers; we are part of a chain and must be able to complete a cross section of tasks.</P>
    <P>I do not think the answer is to educate people for jobs we have not got.  For too long many people in the political arena decried speculators who made large amounts of money and said they should not be allowed to do so.  If speculators do not create jobs, we may not have jobs.  I often think that if 20 per cent of the energy spent in protesting and objecting <Col N="800" /> could be channelled into positive thinking which would create jobs, we would have a great country.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to create jobs today and I sympathetise with anyone trying to do so.  We are lucky in my village because nobody objects to anybody doing anything; we are delighted to see people coming in to build.  One of our factories is a meat factory and it is amazing how many people ask why we let a smelly factory into the village.  Occasionally there may be a smell but as I say to them, 40 people are employed in that factory; and 40 families live close to the village as a result.  You have to suffer some unpleasantness if you want to attract industry.  One cannot expect to have sitting room conditions and jobs at the same time.  If we could there would be a huge market for rocking chairs and everyone would be in the sitting room rocking; they would not need to work.</P>
    <P>We must realise we are living in a real world.  I think the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for the Environment &mdash; given the amount of new EC money coming in to Ireland &mdash; should put all their moneys into one pool and say to every local authority to create jobs, and give everyone a proper wage.  We waste much money on inspectors trying to check the black economy, although there is no doubt that it exists.</P>
    <P>I am in a dilemma on this matter.  I admire the person who works.  One person may be entitled to £100 a week unemployment money; draws it and goes down to sit in the pub.  Another person entitled to £100 a week, draws it and goes out and does some &ldquo;nixers&rdquo;.  The second person is an asset to society, is building up a home, is helping his family and is working hard.  I am always in a dilemma with this problem.  I do not think the answer is to penalise the second person.</P>
    <P>I was annoyed when I heard of a man with a young family who was on the dole and lived by the sea.  He went out on days when one would not put a dog out, picking and piling up sea rods and as soon <Col N="801" /> as he sold his sea rods he got a bill from the Department of Social Welfare for repayment of his dole money.  To me that was criminal behaviour by that Department; I know they acted within the law but I do not think we should have rules like that.  That person could have been sitting around the fire, but instead went out and worked and was penalised for it.</P>
    <P>If we gave everybody a card enabling them to work, we would reduce the unemployment figures given the high numbers drawing unemployment benefit today.</P>
    <P>I admire the person who works.  To create jobs for everyone we should put all the money into one pool, and pay for training &mdash; training seems to be a catch cry now.  I know of people who avail of job training and back to work training and have no notion of going to work.  We are wasting money on all these courses; they serve no useful purpose.  The money should be put into job creation and given to local authorities and voluntary groups to try to get people working.</P>
    <P>I was doing rate collecting in the fifties. Times were bad then.  When I went into a house to collect rates in my part of the country they did not want to see me. Rates were only about £2 or £2.50 but people did not have the money.  Bushes and weeds were growing up near the door, in many cases the hens were sitting on the windowsills waiting for food.  Then things started to improve and people got work.  As soon as they had a few weeks' work they were delighted to see me coming as they could pay the rates.</P>
    <P>I could see an improvement in people's houses as they became more hopeful and lost that demoralised attitude.  Those of us who went into business hoping that the chain would not break, getting money from one in order to pay another to keep the bank manager happy, know what it is like to try to keep the wheel turning and to keep everyone from the door. When someone comes to the door with a bill and one does not have the money to pay it, the caller is not welcome.  It is <Col N="802" /> good to be able to pay bills when they are due, but life was not always like that for me.  For many years I ploughed a deep furrow but thankfully I was rewarded at the end of the day.  A colleague of mine on the county council, a one-armed man also, of the opposite political persuasion, often sat down with me and we wondered whether we were wise or foolish.  If we made use of our handicaps we could make more money than we made working, but we would not have been happy that way.  We liked the challenge of getting out and working.</P>
    <P>We should be encouraging this attitude and encouraging more people to get out and work.  One of the biggest mistakes we made was to get rid of small schools. We went into the big school system and I do not think it has worked out as well as the bureaucrats thought it would.  The more people we keep in every village, the more fires we keep lighting and the more the village lives; the more people we take away, the more the village dies.</P>
    <P>It is encouraging for villages and gives them a sense of pride in themselves to be involved in the tidy towns competition. It gets them out to work together and creates a great community spirit.  I believe in the value of pride and love for one's country.  Unfortunately, the word &ldquo;patriotism&rdquo; has been badly misinterpreted; too many people equate patriotism with fighting and in many cases dying for one's country.  That is not my interpretation.  Patriotism is love, love of one's home first, then love of one's village, one's county and one's country. We should endeavour to instil that into our citizens.</P>
    <P>How many schools in Ireland today hang the Tricolour or tell people what the Tricolour is about and how to hang it?  None or very few.  I am pleased that in my parish the Catholic flag is flown on one side and the Tricolour on the other side of the chapel.  That shows pride in one's country and love and respect.  This is Ireland and we are proud of it.  That <Col N="803" /> pride, love and encouragement should be instilled into our youth but sadly, is not.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is certainly our biggest and most difficult problem today, but it could be solved.  There are millions in the EC to buy our products.  It is encouraging to read in today's newspapers that our exports are greatly outstripping our imports.  We are making progress, but the news is contained in a small column only.  Will those people who are exporting be interviewed on radio or television? There will not be a word about it, but if an export order was lost it would be covered by the media; everyone would want to know why it was lost and would like to blame someone.</P>
    <P>We are slow to give praise.  There is an old sean fhocal which says &ldquo;Mol an óige agus tiocfaidh sí&rdquo;.  Praise the youth.  We need praise but we do not get it.  We are being attacked and demoralised.  We should get constructive criticism where it is justified but not negative criticism.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Reilly spoke about tourism. Cavan-Monaghan are now joined with Sligo under a good tourist officer.  He was in Sligo but is now taking in Cavan and Monaghan and giving a good service.  His name is Dan O'Neill.  A Fianna Fáil Government started restoration work on the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal and Seán Quinn is providing many jobs in Cavan as a result.  The Slieve Russell Hotel is one of the best hotels in the world.  I have seen nothing like it in America, on the Continent or here.  The proprietor is creating hundreds of jobs. Let us not always be critical because it is bad for growth.  We ask why there is not more employment, why can we not attract people here.  There is no fairy godmother to bring anything in but if one keeps criticising everything and saying there is nothing in this part of the country, who will want to go into a shop with nothing for sale?</P>
    <P>We must create the impression that we have good facilities but that we want to make them better.  They are reasonably <Col N="804" /> good and from Cavan to Dublin is only four hours by truck.  To get to Mullingar from Dublin takes two-and-a-half hours because one has to get through the Dublin traffic.  I would like to see our main arterial routes being improved; the N4 contains numerous bottlenecks and I am amazed that it has not been improved before now.  They are working on it now and an improved road would make access to the west much easier.  Galway city is the third largest city in the country and I feel sad when I hear people saying there is nothing in the west of Ireland.  They are not looking at the west in the proper way.  It is not a dead end but a vibrant, healthy unit that is progressing well.</P>
    <P>I am sad that many people setting out to save the west at present are projecting an incorrect image of it.  It is not a wilderness. We have good roads, there is hardly a house in the west now without a water supply.  All these developments took place over the last quarter of a century. Every house has electricity and most villages with an industry can get three-phased electricity.  The west is not a dead end; we have reasonably good roads leading to the main arteries and if we keep telling people there is nothing in it, what will an industrialist say?  That there is not much point going there; he has no business going there because he cannot use snipes: one would think the west of Ireland was snipe land the way some people talk about it.</P>
    <P>That is an unfair and unjust representation and I would say that the people in the west are doing well but we want to do better.  My first public work was with the Fr. McDyer team in the &ldquo;save the west&rdquo; campaign and the attitude the late Fr. McDyer always encouraged in the co-operative movement was &ldquo;Help yourself, we have the facilities, we can improve the infrastructure, we can make life work in Glencolmcille.&rdquo;  That was his attitude but many people working to save the west today declare &ldquo;We have health cuts; we have no hospitals.&rdquo;  That is a lie. <Col N="805" /> I heard a bishop say that between the bridge at Bunduff and the bridge in Colloney there was only one football team.  I have been told since that there are two, if not three, teams there but it may have been a statement of fact at the time.  The impression he was trying to give was that there were no people in that area.  There are more intermediate and junior GAA teams now in the north Sligo area than ever before.  There are more soccer clubs in that area than ever before and five sports complexes in that area and possibly more that were not there years ago, and anyone who makes a statement giving the impression that there is nothing in that part of the county is giving false information.  It is immoral to do so. The west of Ireland is not the dead area it is portrayed to be; let us be honest about that.</P>
    <P>As Chairman of the North-Western Health Board, having been involved in health for the last 17 years I can say we have a healthy health board.  We went into this year with balanced books and we have always lived within every budget.  We have also the best health board and health services in the country for all to see.  We had a terrible accident at Mullaghmore in Sligo.  We condemned out of hand the killing of the late Lord Louis Mountbatten, but the incident led to an enormous loss of tourism.  When the best medical experts in London arrived here they said they could not get better facilities in any private hospital in England and that we had looked after the injured well until they were fit to travel to England.  We could not have done better.  That is the kind of tribute one hears little about, but it was paid to Sligo General Hospital.</P>
    <P>We have a vibrant society in the west of Ireland; it is not dead.  We want to make it much better but we certainly will not improve it with this béal bocht attitude that we have nothing to offer. There is an old sean fhocal which says &ldquo;Mura bhfuil ach gabhar agat, bí i lár an aonaigh&rdquo;&mdash; if you have only a goat be in <Col N="806" /> the middle of the fair.  Let us realise that and instil it into our youth; it will be up to them to use their talents to create jobs.</P>
    <P>When we started to provide free education &mdash; I am disappointed in this and I was a great advocate of it &mdash; we were told that an educated people would save us money in the long run; they would create the jobs.  Now we have educated people saying why not give us jobs, why can you not create jobs for us?  We cannot create jobs for them yet no Government worked harder than this Government to create an environment for creating jobs.  The right environment is there, certain industries are exporting and if anyone wants to see a vibrant village, I will welcome them to Grange to see what local people can do for themselves.  Their success could be repeated throughout Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is a market for products and I am pleased to see greater emphasis placed now on training people in sales techniques.  Lack of sales skills left Ireland at a disadvantage in the past: A producer had to produce the goods, package them, export them and sell them.  It is great that our colleges and third level institutions are promoting marketing because if this country wants to create jobs, we need good people to sell what we can produce.</P>
    <P>We have the people and we can produce the goods, but we need people to sell them and the more sales people we have to work in the marketplace the more demand there will be for our products.  We will never create jobs unless we can produce goods and sell them.  Doing that will also create a bigger population and the more people we have the more services will be needed.  People live off each other and if any of us was left on an island in the morning we would not exist for long even if the Bank of Ireland were with us.  If there is nothing to buy what good is money?  We have to create an atmosphere to facilitate production and marketing.</P>
    <P>Mr. Ray MacSharry is doing a good job on the agricultural scene although <Col N="807" /> people may not agree.  After the Maastricht Summit is sorted out it will be seen that Ray MacSharry is working hard to put an end to the big factory farms on the Continent, which are killing agriculture today.  When we went into the EC, Germany was the biggest importer of agricultural products; today it is the biggest exporter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the new Minister of State to the House.  It is a great pleasure for me to do so because we served together on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights.  I am aware of how sensitive and caring the Minister is.  I say this without prejudice to the outcome of the debate of which obviously I am uncertain.  The track record of the Government has not been great up to this in this area.</P>
      <P>I contacted members of the other parties and groups in the House today and they indicated to me their full support.  Senator Manning indicated he would speak for Fine Gael and Senator Conroy indicated he would be in a position to say a few words in support for Fianna Fáil. They also indicated that other duties may detain them and they may not be able to speak.  I make the point at the outset that I have once again secured support for this motion from all sections in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure if this Minister has had an opportunity to look at the previous debates but he would notice there that I had letters from the Leaders of all the <Col N="808" /> parties, with the exception of Fianna Fáil although I had a very positive and strong letter from the then Tánaiste, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  I would say first, to put it in context, that there is a considerable body of support in the Oireachtas for this and it makes it rather an unusual situation.</P>
    <P>This matter has been twice debated in Seanad Éireann at my instigation.  It was supported on those occasions by all parties and groups.  The rebuilding of the Hirschfeld Centre has twice been approved by Dublin Corporation for a grant of £50,000.  This, however, was twice rejected by the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Padraig Flynn, on the grounds that no money was available &mdash; a proposition which I challenge and will do so using figures from the lottery allocation which will show a disturbing sense of priority on the part of the Government.  This is despite the fact that there has been full public acknowledgment by churches, Government Ministers and people active in social work, community work and, very significantly, in AIDS prevention.  There has been full public acknowledgment and recognition of the range of services provided by this important community centre in the total absence of the provision by Government, either at local level in Dublin or nationally, of the kind of services provided by the Hirschfeld Centre, which is a centre of national importance and is so regarded in many responsible quarters.</P>
    <P>The history of the centre is briefly as follows.  After a difficult period in the movement towards social change which I was involved with others in pioneering and which had its difficulties &mdash; I am sure the Minister will sympathise with this and I think it was Brendan Behan who said the first item on the Irish agenda is always a split and true to type we had our split but it was not the first item, it was the second item &mdash; I established a two part machine.  Under that money would be generated for social purposes, counselling services, advice, a telephone service, a service for young people and their parents to assist in the trauma for families <Col N="809" /> and so on which would be funded from the provision of recreational facilities, in other words, discotheques.  This raised considerable revenue which was channelled back.  As a result of division between the people running this operation the initial premises was lost and I retired entirely into the political arena and founded the campaign for homosexual law reform with no resources except a drawer and a filing cabinet.</P>
    <P>As a result of approaches from people, and these were young people, mature people and the parents of young gay people, I went into operation again by taking a lease on No. 10 Fownes Street Upper in the Temple Bar area in 1978 in order to establish another community centre for gay people located in Dublin but operating on a national basis.  The centre catered for the recreational, counselling, educational and medical advice needs of gay people and their families. The Hirschfeld Centre was the focus of the first attempt to counter the spread of the AIDS virus here.</P>
    <P>The Minister may be interested to know that I was in constant communication with the United States of America because of their civil liberty approach to this whole issue and I received fortnightly bulletins from the principal gay organisation in Los Angeles and San Francisco.  By 1982 an unusual constellation of diseases was beginning to manifest itself in the gay community. It included pneumocystis carinii and Kaposi's sarcoma, which is a very rare tumour normally found in elderly men in subtropical Africa.  The gay community generally became rather alarmed by this but they did not know what it was.  At that point in 1982, which I am sure the Minister will agree was very early, I established a system where we had leaflets published, lectures and information made available on sexual hygiene.  It subsequently became what is now known as safe sex techniques.  We brought over medical authorities from <Col N="810" /> San Francisco to give public lectures in the Hirschfeld Centre on his subject.</P>
    <P>The Minister will know that the profile of the disease in Ireland is slightly different to most other European countries.  I attribute part of this to the successful operation of the Hirschfeld Centre.  From the Hirschfeld Centre, virtually every significant voluntary organisation attempting to cope with the onset of the virus in Ireland has sprung and I can point to virtually every single one.  It may not appear to be the case for certain rather interesting reasons that indicate the degree of repression here.</P>
    <P>Through the Hirschfeld Centre, first of all the gay community and subsequently the rest of the population, were alerted to the risks of infection by the AIDS virus.  Two hundred and fifty thousand leaflets &mdash; one quarter of a million leaflets &mdash; were printed and distributed dealing with the virus, outlining the dangers and advising on safe sexual techniques and sexual hygiene.  We did that at a time when I had to inform the then Minister for Health, Deputy Barry Desmond, that we were actually breaking the law in publishing this information but we did so. We alerted the Minister to the fact that we were doing it and I am very glad we did.  This prompt, efficient and responsible action had a major impact on the profile of the disease especially in the gay community here.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to people in the gay community because it did not stop selfishly with the gay community.  People within my community learned of the disease, learned how to handle it, how to cope with the medical, social and family aspect of the disease and, with extraordinary generosity and decency, reached out to other sections of the community such as those using drugs and haemophiliacs in order to make their expertise available.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that in discussions with the Danish Minister for Education, Mrs. Dottir Bennedson, I discovered that the Danish Government made available to the gay community in Copenhagen <Col N="811" /> 750,000 Danish kroners to assist directly in their campaign against AIDS.  The important point is that the Danish Government, four years ago, made precisely twice that amount available to the gay community for the provision of a community centre in the centre of Copenhagen. The reasoning, if we were to draw any kind of moral reservations from this subject, is quite simple although perhaps a little sophisticated at first but very illuminating.  The Danish Government fully understood that in dealing with AIDS, where there is a life threatening insidious disease, attacking, first of all a community that is diffuse, disparate and difficult to reach, spread throughout all regions of the city and country, all social, educational classes and religious groups who have only two things in common &mdash; sexual orientation and a special vulnerability to the first wave of the infection &mdash; it was absolutely essential to have an efficient method for the distribution of information and communication.  That must be registered by the Government. The Danish Government understood the situation and gave 750,000 Danish kroners for the AIDS project and they gave twice that amount to found a gay community centre because they understood the necessity for a mechanism of communications.  This responsible attitude on the part of central Government has not been followed in Ireland.  Indeed, my consistent experience has been that it is virtually impossible to attract any funding from Government whatever to organisations associated with the gay community.</P>
    <P>For this reason, many of those marvellous people working in the front lines reaching out to all those from whatever section of society who are threatened by the onset of the disease are reluctant to disclose their own sexual orientation for fear that funds will dry up.  This attitude has been confirmed to me privately by senior civil servants in at least three Government Departments.  In other <Col N="812" /> words, if people who do the work acknowledge publicly that they are gay, the money dries up.  If that is not discrimination I would very much like to be informed what it is.  I have personal experience of this.  I am not relying on hearsay, I know it to be true.</P>
    <P>When the Hirschfeld Centre was being set up I took the responsible step of forming a limited company in which since I put up all the initial capital, I assumed responsibility for a majority shareholding distributing the remaining 40 per cent of shares to other board members who were prepared voluntarily to serve the community. Company records have been kept scrupulously and are open for inspection.  All taxes and rates have been paid and to date over £120,000 has been paid to the Revenue Commissioners in tax revenue.  No profit whatever has been taken by any individual or group working within or controlling the centre.  No member of the board has received a fee, expenses or anything else.  None of us objected to working for nothing.  None of us objected to paying the State the taxes due, unlike many entertainment projects in the city either gay or straight. I know a lot of discotheque owners do not pay any tax but we paid every last penny.  It came as an unpleasant surprise to us to discover, after the building was destroyed by fire, that simply because none of us had taken a penny profit we were surcharged for tax on the basis of what the Revenue Commissioners called non-distribution of profit.</P>
    <P>I have already consulted lawyers with a view to transferring my interest into a trust fund, which I still intend to do, and I also hope to persuade the other directors to do likewise and seek charitable status.  I was advised, however, that because of prevailing prejudice it was highly unlikely that charitable status would be accorded to us.  As I have already said, I do not object to working for nothing, I do not object to paying taxes but, on the other hand, I object most strongly to receiving no recognition <Col N="813" /> whatever for the work we have done in the way in which it matters, which is financial terms, because at the end of the day it comes down to money.  The Government rely on voluntary agencies all the time.  We were hit by an act which may have been malicious or may have been an accident but the building was destroyed and we have received no assistance from the Government so far.  Perhaps the Minister will have some good news for us today.</P>
    <P>I most vehemently object to being subjected to further crippling taxes precisely because we work for nothing.  It seems mad.  We did work which the Government complimented us on.  We work for nothing and we pay for the privilege. Then we are charged more because we do not take a profit.  I do not understand the logic of that.</P>
    <P>The site of the Hirschfeld Centre in the heart of the Temple Bar area of Dublin gives another clear example of the nebulous way in which prejudice still exists in this country.  When I took the lease of 10 Fownes Street in 1978 &mdash; by the way, we have bought the place now through our own efforts &mdash; the area was derelict and life in the area virtually extinct.  All that existed were a few run down pubs, a barber's shop and on the extreme fringes of the area the Project Theatre of which I was a board member and which was threatened with closure and demolition by Dublin Corporation because it dared to sponsor a sensitive and significant play on the subject of homosexuality.</P>
    <P>Through the Hirschfeld Centre we ran discotheques not just for gay people but for women's groups, green groups and environmental groups.  We fed and watered those engaged in the Wood Quay Viking site protest and so on.  Every week at its peak more than 1,500 people, gay and non-gay, young people and their families and friends, passed through the doors of the Hirschfeld Centre.  It was the vital presence of this community centre in the heart of the Temple Bar that alerted many of those who subsequently started <Col N="814" /> small businesses in the area to the opportunities that existed.  There is no question that it was the Hirschfeld Centre, before any member of Government was aware of the existence of Temple Bar, that created the special atmosphere that is today acknowledged in that area.</P>
    <P>I sometimes smile a little cynically when I read in newspaper after newspaper, and hear in broadcast after broadcast, about the Left Bank of Dublin in Temple Bar, about the Bohemian atmosphere, about the Latin quality of the area.  I have, however, yet to hear, see or read any reference whatever to the existence of the Hirschfeld Centre which was responsible for this rejuvenation. Where in God's name do these people think the Bohemian atmosphere came from?  It did not just pour out of the sky or float down the Liffey in a bubble.  The Left Bank Bohemian atmosphere came from the dynamic work of the volunteers in the Hirschfeld Centre.  Nevertheless the Hirschfeld Centre seems to be specifically excluded from any of the benefits which it helped to create.  This is tangible though subtle discrimination.</P>
    <P>I have been involved in programmes to revive the inner city of Dublin, not only in the Temple Bar area but also in other areas of the inner city, such as North Great George's Street.  I have made it my business to understand how the European Community funding works.  Fifteen years ago I appointed myself as ambassador extraordinary and envoy plenipotentiary from North Great George's Street to the European Community and I visited the Berlaymont Building in pursuit of funds for the north inner city.  I believe I now understand reasonably well how the European machine works.  I am well aware of the fact that in attracting funds from the Community one of the key factors that must be promoted by Government is assistance to the disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>To me it is extraordinary that a self-reliant, though disadvantaged, group like the gay community should have, by their <Col N="815" /> own efforts, created the energy leading to the rejuvenation of a inner city area and subsequently be deprived of any assistance whatever from central Government.  I believe that were I but to raise the phone to Brussels now and draw the attention of the relevant commissioners to the situation obtaining in Temple Bar I could raise an important question mark about the continuing availability of European funds to this area, but I will not do so.  It is not in my nature to be a dog in the manger. However, it is now high time that the generous, responsible and unpaid work of the gay community was properly recognised.  It is quite unacceptable for me to sit in Seanad Éirenn and be told yet again, that no funds are available.</P>
    <P>The last time I was told this I checked the allocation of lottery funds in the city and county areas of Dublin.  The results of such an examination are quite revealing. It is impossible to find money for the Hirschfeld Centre, a centre of national importance but it was possible to find page after page in which there was an allocation of funds to golf clubs, GAA clubs, football clubs and local community centres.  In the same allocation that on the last occasion the Hirschfeld Centre was refused even one miserable pound of Government money, to which we had contributed £120,000 in taxes, no less than £40,000 was made available for a scout hut in Marino.  The total allocation from lottery funds to the Catholic Boy Scouts of Ireland in the greater Dublin area was £165,540 and not one penny was given to the Hirschfeld Centre.  It is not my intention to be unpleasant, contentious or begrudging but this suggests a strange sense of priorities on behalf of the Government.</P>
    <P>On the question of lottery allocations, I strongly feel that it is in the interests of everybody, including the Minister, that the allocation of lottery funding should be removed from the personal discretion of the Minister.  The Government gave <Col N="816" /> an undertaking that the distribution of funds would be made by an all party committee.  I understand perfectly why the GAA get so much money; it is because they are perfect politically and are very important and valuable social community centres.  It is a wonderful way of buying votes.</P>
    <P>My last point deals with the very interesting attitude of Deputy Collins whose heart bled for Glór na nGael in Belfast.  They squawked about discrimination because of a cultural centre. I am sure they are wonderful people. I know one of them was subsequently arrested on an IRA charge, but one cannot smear the whole group with that. There was great enthusiasm by Deputy Collins for Glór na nGael but he was not too keen on the Hirschfeld Centre, and neither was the previous Minister for the Environment.  Perhaps it will be third time lucky.</P>
    <P>I will raise the funds anyway.  I am damned &mdash; if that is not unparliamentary language &mdash; if I will get out of Temple Bar when we created the resurgence in the area.  If I have to go on tour as a kind of circus act with my James Joyce show or my Frank O'Connor short story show, so be it.  I hope the Government will be a little more generous and at least leave the door open.  I would be very happy to talk to the Minister for the Environment, who I know is a decent man as is the Minister for State, or any other Department when they suggest we would get some assistance.  Whatever happens, the centre will be rebuilt.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Norris for his kind remarks and good wishes in my appointment as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment.  This is my first opportunity to speak as Minister of State.  I am glad of this opportunity to explain to the Seanad the position on the amenities recreational facilities grants scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is as well to make one thing quite <Col N="817" /> clear at the start; all the money provided under the amenities recreational facilities grants scheme has been allocated.  In effect, the 1991 scheme is finished and it only now remains for the grants that were allocated to be paid.  The full list of projects which were allocated funds is in the Oireachtas Library.  There is no money available for this or any other project which is not on that list.</P>
    <P>The local authorities recommended over 3,600 applications, worth nearly £282 million, to my Department for funding under the 1991 scheme.  The total amount sought in grants was £121 million. There was just £4 million to give out and this was allocated to 982 of the recommended projects.  It was inevitable that there would be a great many disappointed applicants and, indeed, that many of those who were successful in obtaining grants would be disappointed at the amount they received.  It is understandable in the circumstances that questions would be raised as to the criteria used in allocating the grants or that a case would be made for a particular project, especially as so many perfectly sound, worthy projects failed to secure a grant.</P>
    <P>As I said, over 3,600 applications were sent to the Department.  Given the situation I have outlined, making decisions on grant allocations was anything but easy particularly when the amount available for distribution formed such a small part of the amount sought.  It was necessary to distribute the money on the fairest possible basis.  Associated with this was the question of assessing the actual amount of cash which ought to be made available for each successful project.  I assure the House that the allocations were made in as fair and equitable a manner as possible, starting from the assumption that all projects were eligible and worthy ones since they had been examined and recommended by the local authorities.</P>
    <P>In making allocations under this and previous schemes, the objective which was stated over and over again in this <Col N="818" /> House, in the Dáil, in the media and elsewhere, has always been to ensure that each part of the country got a fair allocation of the available resources having regard to the following criteria: the size of the area; the amenities already existing there; the need for particular projects; the ability of those involved to execute the projects; the cost effectiveness of projects and the effects of projects on employment.</P>
    <P>A lot of time was devoted to the alloctions last year.  The criteria which I have just outlined were applied but it was still a most difficult task because there was so many projects of equal merit.  I have no doubt but that somebody else might have chosen different projects but that does not mean to say they would be more correct.  Everybody could point to projects which should have been included but I do not think anybody could point out a project which should not have been included.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Hirschfeld Centre project, I am aware that the application for a grant of £50,000 to assist the reconstruction of the centre had been recommended by Dublin Corporation to my Department under recent schemes.  In the event, a grant was not allocated to this project under the 1991 scheme.  Reference was made on a number of occasions to the fact that the counselling and medical advice services which were provided by the Hirschfeld Centre were an important factor in the application for national lottery funds.  I must point out that the purpose of my Department's schemes is to assist projects of an amenity, recreational, leisure or environmental improvement nature, other than projects primarily of a commercial nature.  The Hirschfeld Centre's application must, therefore, be judged on those criteria rather than others. Additional activities such as counselling, no matter how laudable they may be in themselves do not advance the application. The application can only be considered from the point of view of the <Col N="819" /> recreational, leisure and amenity content of the project.</P>
    <P>As Senators will no doubt be aware, the review of the <i>Programme for Government 1989 to 1993</i> states that in future all amenity grants under the national lottery will be allocated by local authorities.  The detailed arrangements to give effect to this will be decided by the Government if and when funds for a new scheme are made available.  It would, of course, be open to the project sponsors to submit a fresh application for a grant in the event of any future scheme.</P>

      <P>I normally rise to thank the Minister.  I cannot thank him.  I wish him well.  I very much regret that he has been forced to parrot such unmitigated tripe and waffle.  I am reminded of the novel &ldquo;Murphy&rdquo; by Samuel Beckett in which when a comment was made which was complete nonsense, merely replied &ldquo;uric acid&rdquo; to which I would like to add my own flourish &mdash; equine excrement.  I am sure the Minister can translate for himself.</P>
