      <P>I have notice from Senator Doyle that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to provide funds for the provision of permanent residential accommodation for the old and infirm of Wexford town and surrounding area.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to extend the coal ban to Bray town and its environs.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Jackman of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications to outline her plans for the retention of the Shannon stop-over.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Brendan Ryan of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Social Welfare to clarify, in the light of recent reports, the interpretation by his Department of the requirement that recipients of unemployment assistance <Col N="1470" /> and unemployment benefit be genuinely seeking work.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Raftery of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to provide protection to creditors in the meat trade, similar to that provided to the clients of auctioneers and estate agents which protects sellers and purchasers of property and livestock.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator O'Keeffe of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister to request health boards to be more enterprise conscious and to introduce an element of self-financing in their affairs.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator S. Byrne of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to clarify the position with regard to the Teagasc office in Tipperary town threatened with closure.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Doyle, Ross, Jackman, Ryan, Raftery and O'Keeffe as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Doyle's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Ross, Jackman, Ryan, Raftery and O'Keeffe may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>
    <P>I regret that I have had to rule the matter raised by Senator Byrne as not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the grounds of repetition.</P>

      <P>Before giving the Order of Business I would just like to clear up some matters and give the House as much information as possible, as will be my intention as we proceed.  We will have the Greencore debate next week.  I say that on the basis that the Minister is keen to deal with the matter in this House next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to our discussion on the Supreme Court decision of last week we agreed that, when the wording of the <Col N="1471" /> amendment to the Protocol was available, this House would be given an opportunity to debate the issue.</P>
    <P>I mentioned last week that we would take the Social Welfare Bill on Thursday and Friday, 2 and 3 April 1992.  Regarding United Meat Packers, it was agreed that, if there were more speakers in that debate, time would be made available in the House this week for that purpose, which can be arranged with the Whips. We had the Minister in the House last week when he gave us his views and various speakers had an opportunity of contributing.  It was agreed that if additional speakers wish to contribute to this most important issue, we would make time available tomorrow.</P>
    <P>Regarding the sittings for the next few weeks &mdash; 25 and 26 March, 1, 2, 3, 8 and 9 April &mdash; we will discuss them later. We will take Committee Stage of the Electoral Bill in about two weeks time. There will be a further announcement with regard to legislation to be initiated in the House in respect of which I hope to be in a position next week to give some further information.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Items Nos. 1 and 2.  Item 2 &mdash; Statements on the cost of Motor Insurance &mdash; will be taken until 6 p.m.  There will be a sos between 6 p.m. and 6.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>Would this House be in order in expressing our pleasure at the outcome of the South African referendum? I think we should note its outcome and look forward to the way ahead that has been opened up, congratulating all those involved, particularly Mr de <Col N="1472" /> Klerk and his regime on having put the question to the people and the people on replying.</P>
      <P>I should like to thank the Leader of the House for clarifying the confusion that existed 20 minutes ago in relation to statements on United Meat Packers.  The information I had was that it had been concluded last week at 6 o'clock.  I am delighted it has been agreed to allow additional speakers.  May I ask the Leader to confirm to the House that the Minister will be with us tomorrow because, with the news today of the 900 redundancies and the devasting effect in the west, in Charleville and in my constituency of Wexford, there will be many people offering to contribute and seeking a proper two-way discussion between the Minister and all in this House, on the outcome of this issue and the direction we now take.  I would like it confirmed that the Minister will be present and that we will spend all day tomorrow on this vital issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Out of courtesy I wish to inform the House that as part of the continuing process of expansion of the Independent Group, we are happy to announce that Senator Pól Ó Foighil has joined our group.  I will be so informing you, Sir, officially this afternoon.  We have got word of some disaffected Members on the far side of the House and we hope to be entering into negotiations with them.  At this stage we do not wish to state anything further and we will make the announcements in dribs and drabs.</P>
      <P>There has been a long standing commitment from the Leader to facilitate a debate on the banking system.  Now is as good a time as any to consider this. Senator O'Keeffe, to his credit, raised this issue which is now more appropriate than ever.  Will the Leader indicate when he would consider it appropriate to have a debate on the banks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend to raise in the House each week the number of people who have died, who have been murdered in the North since we first started to ask for a debate on developments in Northern <Col N="1473" /> Ireland.  I believe that what we have to say on this issue is very important in view of the worsening situation in the North. I appeal to the Leader to facilitate a debate on the North.</P>
    <P>May I remind the Leader that on his first day in this post he gave a commitment to reform the Seanad?  He not only did that but made the fatal error &mdash; as some would say &mdash; of advising us that some of these changes would be in place by &ldquo;the end of March&rdquo;.  We are very close to the end of March and I am sure the Leader is happy that I have reminded him of this because he does not wish to breach his commitments.  We look forward to him delivering on the first stage of the continuing series of developments.</P>
    <P>I wish to put on record that I appreciate that the Leader has cleared the working arrangements for the next number of weeks.  This is very useful.  Will he indicate what new legislation the Government intend to initiate in this House over the next six sitting days?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader for outlining the programme of work over the next couple of weeks and in particular for the opportunity to discuss the UMP crisis tomorrow.  May I express my dismay at the announcement today that 900 people are to be made redundant? I now call for immediate Government intervention to try to limit the damage. It is particularly important that something is done now because each day things will get worse.  Unless we begin to take a long term view of the food industry we will see more and more of these crises unfold.</P>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's request for a debate on the banking system.  I noticed in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> that the banking charges were referred to as a &ldquo;mysterious phenomenon&rdquo; for which you would need a specialised course in banking manoeuvres to be able to understand them.  It is highly appropriate that we have the &ldquo;O'Keeffe initiative&rdquo; on banking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the flexibility the Leader has shown with regard to the UMP crisis.  It reflected well on the House that time could be found to debate this very urgent matter.  If we are to be relevant, it is important that we discuss matters of this nature as they occur.  May I ask the Leader to make time available tomorrow to continue this debate?</P>
      <P>I join with Senator Doyle in welcoming the developments in South Africa, albeit a referendum of the white electorate &mdash; we have to remember this &mdash; and I hope this will be an important forward step in initiating true multi-racial democracy and that they will be able to return to the international fold.</P>
      <P>When is it proposed to take item No. 6, the report of the industrial policy review group, the Culliton report?  We have repeatedly called for statements or a debate on this subject since we returned after Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome what the Leader said about debates on legislation over the coming weeks.  I thank him for giving us an outline of what will be taken. Following Senator O'Toole's point about Seanad reform, and the various proposals to extend the Adjournment debates, grievance time and special debates, may I ask the Leader, in line with the commitment he gave some weeks ago, to outline his proposal in this regard as soon as possible?  Some months ago we changed protocol to allow a distinguished visitor to address the House, and I wonder if further consideration has been given to whom we might invite?  Finally I noted what Senator O'Toole said in relation to the addition to their ranks. Will he confirm that he is in charge of the group now?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with my colleagues in saying well done to the Leader of the House for the programme he outlined <Col N="1475" /> and his willingness to take on board many of the suggestions made, from time to time.</P>
      <P>I want to raise two issues with him on the Order of Business.  While I welcome the undertaking to continue the debate on the United Meat Packers crisis tomorrow, I believe that debate should be extended or, alternatively, will he consider giving time soon to debate the economic crisis in the west?  The loss of 900 jobs is only an indication of the underlying crisis that will have devastating social and economic consequences in the west.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>As you can appreciate, Senator and as you know, a speech is not permitted on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not attempting to make a speech, I simply wanted to emphasise the need to have this matter discussed in the Chamber and to get an indication of Government policy on this issue.</P>
      <P>My second query relates to the first, but it may be a separate issue.  Will the Leader give me and the House an assurance if not a debate, on whether the Government are prepared to concede to a well heeled selfish Dublin lobby and cause further desolation in the west by undermining the trans-Atlantic status of Shannon Airport?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not appropriate on the Order of Business.  There are other avenues where you can raise that matter, in fact, the matter for the Adjournment refers to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying, Senator Howard, it is not appropriate to the Order of Business of this House today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cathaoirligh, may I respectfully suggest that there might be a slight misunderstanding between us?  I <Col N="1476" /> am asking the Leader to set aside a day for a debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but you continue to make a speech on the matter.  If you wish, you may ask the Leader for a debate, but I do not want a speech, as I outlined previously, on that particular matter, or on any other matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, may I rephrase my question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>First, will the Leader extend tomorrow's debate on United Meat Packers or, alternatively, set aside a date for a debate on the economic crisis in the west?  Second, will he set aside time for a debate on the status of Shannon Airport?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Leader of the House refer to the Minister for Industry and Commerce an extremely important matter in relation to the Companies Act, that is the role of the Examiner.  I think most of us understood that any transactions undertaken by the Examiner would be paid for in full.  Following the difficulties in United Meat Packers it now appears that this is not the case and, therefore, the impact that the Examiner will have on the trading position of any company under his jurisdiction will be reduced.  This is a very important issue which I would ask the Leader of the House to take up with the Minister for Industry and Commerce at the earliest possible date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I also ask the Leader of the House if he envisages having a debate on education in the immediate future?  It is particularly important to have a debate pertaining to third level.  While I understand a debate on the Culliton report is listed on the Order Paper, education merits a debate in its own right given that here in Ireland we have about half the number of start-up businesses other EC countries have and that we are still hostile in educational circles to technological emphasis in education.  It would be a <Col N="1477" /> worthwhile debate and I exhort the Leader to allow it take place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to refute that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Leader of the House, in relation to the United Meat Packers issue, to refresh his memory that last week when we spoke for a couple of hours in relation to that subject it was agreed between the Whips that that debate of approximately two hours was merely the start of a major debate which would be continued during this week and that the time which we had intended devoting to the Greencore business would this week be given up to the UMP issue if, as the Leader of the House said, &ldquo;there are others offering&rdquo;. My understanding is that there are a substantial number of speakers offering, and today there is the matter of liquidation and massive redundancies.  Again, as requested by one of the Members who spoke before me it is crucial that the Minister for Agriculture and Food attends the debate which should take place throughout tomorrow because of the critical situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support what Senator Howard said about the west of Ireland.  For a number of months I have consistently sought a debate in this House on issues dealing with the west where there is a vocal lobby and major meetings have been convened by the bishops and I think it is past time that this House showed its respect for that issue, given what is happening in Ballyhaunis, Arigna and elsewhere west of the Shannon.  A major debate should take place in this House on regional <Col N="1478" /> development and the west of Ireland and I request him to arrange that.</P>
    <P>I suggest this House send its best wishes to the people of South Africa, both black and white, because today was a momentous step in democracy in that a massive majority of the order of about three to one of the whites in South Africa voted in the polls for a new democratic structure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I call Senator Brendan Ryan.  Before he speaks I emphasise that it is entirely at the discretion of the Chair as to who speaks. Furthermore it is not in order to challenge the Chair's ruling in this matter and any Senator who does so can be, in my opinion, regarded as being disorderly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Your discretion is absolute, a Chathaoirligh.  There are ways of offering in this House other than by raising one's hand, something, incidentally, I ceased doing when I left school. However, I acknowledge you are in control and I have no problem with that.  As regards apologies I should like to make it clear that last week I apologised to the House, not to the speaker whom I was happy to interrupt.</P>
      <P>Together with my colleagues, I am happy to record our pleasure at the outcome of the referendum in South Africa. I am pleased particularly at the triumph of the African National Congress.  After 75 years South Africans are on the way to a non-racial democracy.</P>
      <P>I am in agreement with my colleagues that we should have a debate on the banks dispute.  I am disappointed that Senator O'Keeffe forgot to mention it. The fact that the IBOA&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are having a speech.  I would ask the Senator to put a query to the Leader of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Leader of the House change the tone of a debate on the banks now that the IBOA have abolished bank charges for the intervening period? May I also ask him whether we could have a debate on industrial relations <Col N="1479" /> given the unprecedented fact that trade unionists are being sacked for implementing the directives of their union?  That is not something we are used to in this country but is, perhaps, something which the AIB have learned from their American experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>And from RTE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps from RTE, too. It is not something that will do this country any good: it is not the way we do business.  We need to look at industrial relations legislation to protect the rights of workers to work through the trade union structures, to look after themselves. What is being done in this instance is alien, something which I do not think any of us in this country wants.</P>
      <P>I support my colleague in welcoming a debate on the United Meat Packers situation.  Perhaps the debate could be extended to the apparent prevalence of what I can only describe as intervention junkies at the head of most of our food processing industries.  The universal problem of our food industry is that it is far too willing to accept the quick fix of intervention rather than deal with the realities of the market.  I am not the one who should be giving this House a lecture about the nature of the market economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly we do not want it on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join with my colleagues, too, in asking for a debate on the devastation of the west of Ireland, first, because of what it is and, second, because it might persuade my colleagues here to reintroduce, both in the media and elsewhere, the critical aspects of Maastricht which appear to have been suspended.  What is happening in the west is a model of what will happen to us if we continue without having a critical debate on Maastricht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I appeal yet again, with my colleagues, for an open-ended debate on Northern Ireland.  That is something this House, and Irish politics, desperately <Col N="1480" /> need.  The vacuum is being filled by those outside the democratic process.  I ask the Leader of the House to inquire from the Minister for Industry and Commerce as to why, unprecedentedly, the back-up documentation to the Culliton report which we will be discussing in this House is not available to Members.  I was informed by the Minister's office that I could purchase the material at the Government Publications Office.  This is the first time a Minister has refused me access to Government publications.  I do not know whether that is Government policy, Progressive Democrats policy or whatever but perhaps the Leader would ascertain the reasons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the information the Leader of the House has given us in relation to the business of the House for the next few weeks.  I am particularly glad to note that further legislation is being initiated in this House.</P>
      <P>I welcome what appears to be a landslide victory in South Africa in relation to the referendum.  This underlines the view of the vast majority of the white population that the dismantlement of apartheid should proceed apace.  This is an historic moment, perhaps it is the last time there will be an all white referendum in that country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Leader of the House allow time for a debate on the banking system?  It is becoming more and more necessary to have such a debate given the events which have taken place in recent days, including the deplorable suspension of workers in the AIB, and the information reproduced in the newspapers today, taken from the Consumers' Association of Ireland Limited magazine &mdash;<i>Consumer Choice</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Finally, would the Leader allow a debate on unemployment and job creation given the news that there are to be 900 redundancies at United Meat Packers, 135 redundancies as a result of Express Courier Services going into liquidation and the threat to 215 jobs at Dublin Cargo Handling Limited?</P>

Bhí mise ag réiteach mo mhála le dul abhaile agus chonacthas dom gur tugadh deis do bheirt Sheanadóir ón taobh eile den Teach, an cheist seo a phlé idir 5.30 p.m. agus 6 p.m.  Ba mhaith liom míniú a fháil, cén fáth gur leanadh leis an díospóireacht tar éis an ama a bhí socraithe.  Ba mhaith liom a iarraidh freisin, ní amháin go bpléimis ceist an UMP ach go mbeadh díospóireacht chomh maith ar uimhir a sé den chlár seo, is é sin an Culliton report, chomh luath agus is féidir, mar gur ábhar é seo a bhaineann go dlúth le hiarthar na hÉireann.</P>

      <P>My next point relates to a debate on education.  I am somewhat alarmed that Senator O'Keeffe is now calling for this debate.  I hope it will not be like the request for a debate on the banks dispute, which we have been seeking for a long time.</P>
      <P>When the Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Rourke, was Minister for Education we saw her in the House.  Since her departure from that Department I have not seen either of her successors in the House.  I am sure we would have had a Green Paper on Education if Deputy O'Rourke was still in charge of the Department of Education.  I hope a commitment will be given to introduce a Green Paper.  Alternatively we should have a debate on Education in the House. That would eliminate the frustration we feel about such debates.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Brendan Ryan's call for a debate on industrial relations in the banks.  I have received numerous calls from junior assistants in the banks who state that they have been subjected to intimidation in the signing of orders to deduct 20 per cent of their salaries&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I support the call Senators Howard and Honan for a debate on the Shannon stop-over issue.

I would welcome a debate on this issue, and I appeal to the Leader of the House to allocate time for it.</P>

One of the first criticisms I heard here was that we were not able to deal with topical matters or matters of national importance.

      <P>We agreed to have further statements on the issue tomorrow.  This can be agreed between the Whips after the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Keeffe referred to the various implications of the Companies Act in connection with this file.  I understand the Minister is looking at this at present.  Some Senators asked for an extention of the debate on the beef industry. A commitment has been given in the House to have a further debate on this issue.  I do not think it would be in the interests of the industry if we extended the debate to the entire beef industry. We will leave that for another day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1494" /> I also welcome the results of the referendum in South Africa.  I wish everyone in that country well in the aftermath of the referendum.</P>
    <P>With regard to a request for debate on the bank strike, a commitment has been given to have that debate.  As an industrial dispute is taking place I do not believe it would be proper to have a debate on this issue in the House.  As soon as the dispute is concluded successfully this House will have an opportunity to debate the banking system and the role of the banks in our economy.  A debate on the Culliton report will be held on 8 or 9 April.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole referred to new legislation. As I said, I will soon have information on this.  I have met with the new Government Chief Whip and I know that at least two Bills will come before this House.  I hope shortly to have definite information on these.</P>
    <P>Many Senators referred to the Green Paper on Education.  We will await the publication of the Green Paper before we have a debate on education.  I have no doubt that previous Ministers' for Education were more than willing to come into the House to debate educational issues.  I am sure the present Minister will be more than willing to come to the House to debate educational issues of importance.</P>
    <P>Senator Lydon and others referred to the need for a debate on the Maastricht Treaty and its implications.  I understand that a White Paper on this issue will be issued either this week or next week.  This House will then be ready to debate this matter.  I gave a commitment last week that a debate would be held on the western economy and regional development.  The wording of a motion on this issue will be formulated with the agreement of the Whips.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole was worried that reforms would not be introduced by the end of this month.  I am more than hopeful that the points raised by Senators O'Toole, Cosgrave and others in regard to reform will be discussed at the next meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  Hopefully there will be <Col N="1495" /> all-party agreement to these reforms.  I understand that the proposed amendments to Standing Orders which were sent by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to the various parties have been agreed.  These relate to Private Members' time, motions on the Adjournment, a fixed time for the Adjournment of the House, statements to the House, matters of concern to Members, research facilities and Standing Order 29.  I sincerely hope these reforms can be put in place in the not too distant future.  I gave a commitment that these reforms would be introduced during March and it will not be my fault if this is not the case.  I hope the Committee on Procedure and Privileges will ratify the reforms so that they can be brought before the House as soon as possible in the interest of the efficient running of the House.  I think everyone will agree that spending one hour debating the Order of Business is not in the best interests of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was in the House about two weeks ago but did not get the opportunity to congratulate the Cathaoirleach and the new Leader of the House.  I should like to do so now.</P>
      <P>I propose to make regulations, entitled the Friendly Societies Regulations, 1992. These are designed to allow an improvement in the operation of certain friendly societies.  As required by the Friendly Societies Acts, 1896 to 1977, a draft of the regulations has been laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  Each House must pass a resolution approving the draft before I can make the regulations. The Dáil passed the necessary resolution on 28 February.</P>
      <P>The effect of the proposed regulations would be to allow friendly societies registered under section 8 (1) (b) of the Friendly Societies Act, 1896, which operate loan funds under section 46 of that Act, to increase the limits for the taking of deposits and the making of loans, last set in 1896; to allow increases in certain other financial limits applying to friendly societies registered under section 8 (1) of the 1896 Act, and to require all the friendly societies due to benefit from the increased loan and deposit limits to appoint supervisory committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A little social historical background information on the current legislation governing friendly societies will help us all to understand better the purpose of these regulations.  The current legislation governing friendly societies goes back to 1896.  However, the 1896 Act is actually <Col N="1497" /> legislation that consolidates earlier Acts going back as far as 1875.</P>
    <P>The basic friendly society was set up, as its name implies, to provide for the relief of members of the society or their families or close relatives at times of illness, birth of a child or death of a relative. Cash was provided by voluntary subscription of members plus any donations that might be made.  It was a different time and a different milieu in which people lived, yet the family and social crises remain the same today.  The societies also gave help to members who were seeking work and they had special regard to the difficulties that could face fishermen. A form of fire insurance was also provided.</P>
    <P>Other kinds of friendly society provided insurance against loss or death of livestock.  There were also societies set up for charitable purposes, to assist or bring about social contact, to provide help in crises and to make loans.  Against that background, the friendly societies regulations of 1988, raised loan and deposit limits for a category of friendly society called specially authorised loan societies, usually known as SALS, fixing £5,000 as the maximum for a single deposit and £2,500 as the maximum loan that could be made.  That was done in order to update limits set in 1896 to more realistic levels in line with prevailing money values.  There are 11 specially authorised loan societies registered with the Registrar of Friendly Societies, with total assets of about £2.4 million and a total of 13,000 members.  The increases in limits allowed in 1988 meant, of course, that those friendly societies covered by the regulations then had the capacity to handle considerably larger sums of money, so closer supervison of operations was obviously required.  The 1988 regulations, therefore, required the specially authorised loan societies to appoint supervisory committees and also required all friendly societies to have proper accounting and auditing procedures.</P>
    <P>In the years leading up to the finalisation of the 1988 regulations approved by the Oireachtas there was no representation <Col N="1498" /> that friendly societies other than specially authorised loan societies needed updated deposit and loan ceilings. However, since 1988 it has been represented that there is such a need. The matter has been considered in consultation with the Registrar of Friendly Societies and officials of my Department. It is accepted that there is a case for the increases proposed.</P>
    <P>The regulations I am now proposing will extend the scope of the increases in deposit and loan limits allowed in the 1988 regulations to a limited further group of friendly societies comprising those societies registered under section 8 (1) (b) of the Friendly Societies Act, 1896.  There are 22 societies registered under section 8 (1) (b) within an overall total of 130 registered friendly societies. Those 22 societies are engaged mainly in the provision of assistance to members at times of financial pressure arising from the birth of a child or from a death in the family, with the provision of a loan fund being secondary to their main activities. In fact, only 15 of those 22 friendly societies operate a loan fund at present.</P>
    <P>When I spoke in the Dáil on this matter the debate developed into a discussion about the role of moneylenders.  Concern has often been expressed about the activities of illegal moneylenders and I share that concern.  Indeed, as I now have particular responsibility for the area of consumer protection, I should like to inform Senators that I have had consultations with interested parties on this very issue. While these regulations are limited in scope, and are not intended to provide an answer to that problem, the Minister for Industry and Commerce will in the next few weeks seek Government approval for a comprehensive set of measures in relation to various forms of consumer credit.  Those measures will implement the EC directive on consumer credit, will deal specifically with illegal moneylending and will generally curb abuses in the whole area of consumer credit.  I know that the Cathaoirleach, and all Members of the House, realise that this is an important area.  The matter has come up constantly for debate and is <Col N="1499" /> an issue of very great concern.  All of us, when dealing with people in our constituencies, have come across the activities of illegal moneylenders.  The matter is now my responsibility and I look forward to coming to the House and debating the whole issue when the legislation is ready.  The legislation will be comprehensive and this issue will be a component within it.</P>
    <P>As the societies will be handling larger sums of money, the regulations, as in 1988 for specially authorised loan societies, will require them to have supervisory committees.  I am conscious that these societies are mutual help bodies serving social needs in a limited area and I do not intend to change their basic nature. I am proposing these increases as the limits under which this kind of friendly society operates at present are £200 maximum for a deposit and £50 maximum by way of loan to any individual. Those limits were set in 1896 and are quite clearly in need of updating.</P>
    <P>The extension of higher limits for deposits and loans, already permitted by the Oireachtas for specially authorised loan societies since 1988, is being limited, as I mentioned, to a small further group of friendly societies where the need has been established to my satisfaction and where the Registrar of Friendly Societies has indicated his satisfaction with the proposal.</P>
    <P>The proposed regulations, will also increase certain benefits that may be paid by friendly societies to more realistic levels by today's standards, updating the figure of £10,000 set by the 1988 regulations. Members should not confuse the benefits with what can be granted, which is a separate issue.  The benefits will, obviously, be benefits to members. Again, the Registrar of Friendly Societies had no difficulty with the proposal.</P>
    <P>I ask the House to approve the draft regulations, which are largely technical in nature.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and wish here well in her new <Col N="1500" /> position.</P>
      <P>I find the concept of friendly societies, and even the expression, &ldquo;friendly society&rdquo;, endearingly quaint in this day and age.  I cannot profess to have a great knowledge about them or about the way they operate, but I am fascinated about how they knit into overall credit facilities. We have the banking system, credit unions, trustee savings banks and other credit facilities and the friendly societies. They are a quaint concept but I imagine many thousands of people still get a tremendous service from them.  I have no difficulty in dealing with the regulation before us.  Will the Minister expand on the EC Directive on consumer credit and say how close it is to ratification here? The Minister said in the course of her introductory remarks that the Minister for Industry and Commerce will seek Government approval of a comprehensive set of measures within the next few weeks.  Are we likely to discuss the directive in this House or will it be discussed in the Dáil in the immediate future?  How will its provisions impact particularly on the vexed area of moneylending? Anyone who is driven to a moneylender does so as a last resort despite the exorbitant interest rates they charge, particularly the illegal moneylenders. Most people caught within the grasp of illegal moneylenders are not conscious of their exorbitant interest rates; they really do not understand how the interest rates are calculated.  Therefore, it is usually as a last resort that they approach a moneylender, perhaps for money for a major family occasion, or to pay off another debt and so the circle continues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no number on the statutory instrument before us.  What is meant by paragraph 5 which simply states that regulation 3 of the 1988 regulations is hereby revoked?  I have to admit ignorance and say I do not know what is in the 1988 Regulations.  Lest there is anything ominous or interesting being revoked about which we do not know perhaps we could have on the record what is regulation 3 of the 1988 regulations now about <Col N="1501" /> to be revoked.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty with this motion and will not delay the House.  I would like the Minister to expand on the implications of the EC Directive on consumer credit, to inform us how that will impact on the different areas of credit here, particularly on the problematic area of illegal moneylending.  Will the Minister comment on the genesis of the concept of &ldquo;friendly societies&rdquo; also, their relevance in this day and age, and where they, as a particular segment, fit in with all our other credit organisations?  In regard to paragraph 5 of the statutory instrument which refers to the regulation before us, will the Minister tell us what exactly is being revoked?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the Minister to the House, to congratulate her on her appointment and wish her well.  From past experience and my knowledge of her I have no doubt that she will perform these new duties in the same exemplary capable manner she performed her duties in other ministries. She has been a very good example to all of us of how Ministerial duties should be undertaken.  Always she was amenable to us for discussion of subjects of concern to us in our constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome these regulations.  It is appropriate and timely that they be updated, all the more so since legislation governing friendly societies dates back to 1896, which Act consolidated the legislation dating back to 1875.  This alone highlighted the need for change.  As the Minister said the purpose of friendly societies was to fulfil a type of socioeconomic need in society, in times of special family needs, for example, when there were weddings, funerals, First Communion ceremonies or even in circumstances in which farmers might have had livestock disasters, when fishermen might have experienced problems in meeting their requirements.  These needs were very obvious when the legislation was introduced originally.  I suppose it is a sad reflection on all of us that these needs and special requirements obtain a century and a half later.  Equally, it <Col N="1502" /> highlights how important it is that we work together to endeavour to make life easier and better, improving family economics so that families will no longer be required to avail of such services.</P>
    <P>The Minister and Senator Doyle adverted to moneylenders.  It is particularly satisfying to note that such friendly societies at short notice can provide responsible essential needs.  Otherwise people would be forced to go to legal and/or illegal moneylenders.  Indeed, there is very little difference between the two categories; they are all vultures and parasites in our society, their exorbitant interest rates are criminal, to say the least.  I am glad the Minister, and the Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce will take special note of consumer requirements and protection in the future since to date these parasites have lived off the poor, those in dire need, in our society.  Indeed, they have used all sorts of methods, ranging from physical and mental violence to intimidation.  Therefore, I am glad the friendly societies, to some extent, replace the need for such people.</P>
    <P>Looking at the titles of friendly societies to which the Minister referred one sees clearly that they are almost all parochially-based and were started by communities endeavouring to satisfy their needs.  There were, for example, the Mill Sawyers Friendly Society; the Shamrock Friendly Tontine Society; the Ballsbridge Christian Burial Society and so on, all parochially-based.  It was good that communities saw the clear need to help their citizens.</P>
    <P>Nowadays many of the functions of friendly societies have been taken over. In fact it is true to say that their obligations and functions have been subsumed almost completely by the credit unions, marvellous community-based organisations transcending all levels of society and providing a truly nationwide service.  I am glad to note that these friendly societies and credit unions work together but also independently in filling a clear need in society.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note also that the Minister <Col N="1503" /> has ensured there will be adequate supervision of these societies last they overstretch themselves, by the Registrar of Friendly Societies and supervisory committees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome these regulations. It was absolutely necessary that they be updated since 11 small societies had not been brought within the full control of the Registrar of Friendly Societies. The regulations before us are confined to a limited number of small societies and I believe they will not only protect the societies concerned but the public in general. There is a great need to have proper auditing and accounting procedures as this did not always apply in the past. From experience we know people did not always behave correctly and submit reports regularly.  Even if this was not the case in particular societies, we are entitled to assume that the Registrar of small societies was less vigilant in the past.</P>
      <P>Updating the regulations is very welcome. Many but not all, small societies got into difficulties, perhaps as a result of bad management or sharp practice, and some people absconded with the money, leaving some unfortunates penniless.</P>
      <P>We do not have the opportunity often to discuss regulations, as they are usually passed quickly.  I am delighted the Minister has given us this opportunity and it will not be her fault if we do not have a full debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Supervisory committees were established under the 1988 regulations and together with the Registrar of Friendly Societies will play a very important role in regulating friendly societies.  They will be vigilant on our behalf and as a result more effective auditing and accounting procedures will be put in place.  The likelihood that money may be misappropriated will be substantially reduced.  Nobody can guarantee that things will not go wrong, but these regulations will ensure that this will become a remote possibility.  In saying that, I am not sure that I am interpreting the regulations correctly, but if not, I am <Col N="1504" /> sure the Minister will correct me when replying.</P>
    <P>The regulations provide the Registrar with the power to intervene.  I am not suggesting that the regulations guarantee absolutely that we can safeguard everybody's money, but will the Minister confirm that in the event of things going wrong people will be compensated by the State?  If her reply is in the negative, will she state that the possibility of losing one's life savings or substantial sums of money will be treated in a proper manner?  We must believe this is the case but I would like to hear her views.</P>
    <P>It is vital that small societies are not allowed to over-reach themselves.  It is also important that they are watched so that they are not prosecuted because of their failure to submit annual returns to the Registrar of Friendly Societies.  Since we are aware of the failures to handle money in a proper manner, we must be ever vigilant.</P>
    <P>The regulations provide for an extension of the limits for loans and deposits, but is there not a danger that the activities of the societies may develop beyond the membership arrangement by the societies looking for more business?  I am not arguing about them looking for more business but in such an event, greater vigilance is required on the part of the Minister and the Registrar.  I am not sure that the regulations go far enough to be totally effective where expansion takes place and protection becomes less effective, I hope the Minister appreciates my concern about this.</P>
    <P>A great many smaller societies are controlled on a perpetual basis and, without wishing to have a go at them, may I say they are controlled by a group with a clique mentality.  They may be friendly but nobody gets inside the clique.  We all know in politics that when cliques get together, difficulties arise.  If the societies go out and look for business what parameters will be set?</P>
    <P>I would be the last person to deprive people who find themselves in difficulties of the opportunity of going to their friendly society to look for assistance. Nevertheless, from experience we know <Col N="1505" /> we must be careful and we must do everything possible to protect people's interests.  I believe the regulations as they stand are not adequate; if the smaller societies get into difficulties as a result of expansion, it may be necessary to look at the regulations again.  The Minister may not agree but I would like to hear her reaction to that point of view.</P>
    <P>We must recognise the value of these small societies.  The credit union and these small societies form a bulwark against illegal moneylending and, therefore, must be given the fullest possible support to give a service to those in need of short term assistance.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for giving us this opportunity to discuss the regulations.  I look forward to the Minister taking on these illegal moneylenders.  I am sure she will be tenacious and successful in tackling this problem.</P>

      <P>The regulations we are discussing today are not earth shattering but it is appropriate that I refer to two issues, first, the question of the availability of money and, second, the Friendly Societies Acts and regulations in general.  Consideration must be given to the problems posed by the shortage of money, particularly the whole question of credit to people who do not have ready access to money from high street banks and so on.  Very often I meet people who have borrowed money, quite legally, at rates of 25 and 30 per cent.  This is a heavy burden on them and often puts them in the position where they cannot meet the repayments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have witnessed the growth of credit unions, which are a form of society under the Registrar of Friendly Societies. Credit unions provide a very valuable source of funding at reasonable rates of interest.  These regulations are another step in that direction.  However I would quibble on a very small point, that is, that perhaps the limit of deposit could be raised to £6,000 in line with the sum that applies in credit unions.  There is huge <Col N="1506" /> potential for mutual societies to provide credit where necessary.  Considering the number of societies involved it appears that this mechanism has not been sufficiently explored or developed.  Certainly when compared with credit unions, these societies have not reached their potential.</P>
    <P>As a person who works in the development sphere I realise that we lack some type of society which would channel money within communities for productive purposes.  I accept that this is not the role of the credit unions.  We should consider in the future the possibility of extending the role of these societies to make available reasonable sums of money, sums in excess of what we are talking about here, to young people to develop small businesses.  If a structure was set up whereby money could be kept within communities, some system of bonding would need to be in place.  One of the great strengths of the credit union movement is that they provide for bonding. Perhaps it would be possible in the future to set up a similar system under a structure such as that provided for here.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the law governing friendly societies.  As chairman of a co-operative who are governed by the Registrar of Friendly Societies I have had dealings in this whole sphere over a long number of years and I have made the case that the law dealing with mutual societies, co-operatives and so on is out of date.  The operation of returns and so on dates back to an era which is a century old.  I would ask the Minister, in her new role, to see whether the regulations governing co-operatives, friendly societies and so on need updating to deal with the realities of modern life.</P>
    <P>I was very disappointed to see the ordinary co-operatives go the way of the plc. I understand that this was done for business reasons, within the rules of societies in general, but it was a perfect example of the lack of expansion, which is necessary to survive.  The lack of proper definitions of co-operatives and friendly societies and of detailed regulation which would ensure that societies are run in a proper fashion and that membership is <Col N="1507" /> widespread and open needs to be addressed. Community based organisations in particular should have a legal standing. That would go a long way towards tackling the financial crisis and unemployment, particularly in rural communities.  The creation of properly bonded structures could be one of the greatest ways of recycling money within communities, thereby ensuring that the whole principle of self-help is adhered to and developed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute briefly to this matter. I would first like to welcome the Minister to the House.  I wish her well in her new portfolio.  I know she will carry out the work with dedication, as she did in her previous portfolios, and I wish her every success.</P>
      <P>The matter before us is quite limited and brief.  However, as other speakers have mentioned, it raises matters which, if not addressed here, should receive further thought and discussion.  First I would like to pay tribute to the various friendly societies who have done tremendous work down the years in local areas.  I would ask the Minister whether she is satisfied with the existing safeguards.  I pose that question particularly in the light of recent events both here and abroad in relation to pension funds, moneys that went missing and certain matters relating to the setting up of banks and societies. While the safeguards have been improved I wonder whether the Minister is entirely happy that breaches and loss of savings can be prevented.  Perhaps investigations, audits and checks need to be carried out by her Department. Obviously some of these matters are the responsibility of the Department of Social Welfare but perhaps the Minister would address the issues that come under her Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is great concern about the security <Col N="1508" /> of moneys invested.  Obviously the whole question of the development of friendly societies and the rules and regulations governing them must be addressed. One aspect which should be considered is the whole question of borrowing from moneylenders who charge exorbitant rates of interest, resulting in great difficulty for many families.  I know this matter does not come under the regulations but I am sure the Minister is concerned about it.  Perhaps she and her colleague in the Department of Social Welfare would consider the matter at an early date.</P>
    <P>It has been said here that various organisations have benefited but I do not know if that includes fishermen and fire insurance.  Perhaps the Minister of State would update the position.  There are also people who want to borrow relatively small amounts &mdash; and for whom borrowing is a matter of life and death &mdash; who do not want to put literally everything into the bank as collateral.  Even for relatively small amounts the bank wants to ensure that they either have deposits, title deeds or guarantees to ensure that those sums are repaid.  Provision should be made for those who wish to borrow relatively small amounts from time to time to help them over an interim difficulty.  I do not think the regulations should concern us unduly.  I would ask the Minister of State to examine the matters I have raised and in particular the safeguards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Members who have contributed, Senators Avril Doyle, Sean McCarthy, Jack Harte, Éamon Ó Cuív and Liam Cosgrave.  As in the Dáil the debate turned into an interesting one of social concern and I thank the Senators for so expressing it.  Senator Avril Doyle asked about the EC directive on consumer credit, when and where it would be available and if legislation was necessary.  I explained that in my opening speech and I reaffirm that the memorandum for Government and various matters relating to Government are being <Col N="1509" /> considered at present in the Department and I would hope that will be completed in a matter of weeks.  Then the necessary legislation which will, of course, take some time will be framed.  It is my intention that it should proceed with all haste. The EC directives on various consumer matters are also in the process of being studied here and are receiving very careful attention within the Department.  I expect to be able to attend to them shortly.</P>
      <P>Senator Avril Doyle drew attention to regulation 5 in the draft regulations.  That is a matter of technical definition as laid out in original Acts and regulations.  She also asked about the history of friendly societies.  As the name and the dates of the legislation implied, they were set up within a parish, as Senator Sean McCarthy said to deal with people in difficult circumstances who did not want to go to large, anonymous institutions, who perhaps would not entertain them anyway or their needs.  They were set up in that spirit of intimacy whereby people felt comfortable going to their neighbourhood friendly society.  The friendly societies were established over a century ago but, as Senator Sean McCarthy said, the issues which concerned people in their daily lives &mdash; bereavements, expense of the time of a birth, a farming loss or fishing loss &mdash; still remain the daily concerns in a more sophisticated environment.  I imagine that is how the term &ldquo;friendly societies&rdquo; came about. They were there to serve in our hour of need and you went to them and expected to see a friendly face, hear a friendly voice and receive some help.  That may sound like a fairytale now.  There is increasing need for constant checks and supervision on all matters of lending, be they small or large because they are all open to abuses of one kind or another of which the registrar is aware.  The Registrar of Friendly Societies works with the Departments to ensure there are no abuses and, and I said earlier, supervisory committees are being set up.</P>
      <P>Senator Sean McCarthy welcomed the introduction of the regulations as did all of the Senators who spoke on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1510" /> He listed the various societies, which I had spoken about in the Dáil, The Mill Sawyers Friendly Society, the Shamrock Friendly Tontine Society, St. Canice's Mortality and Tontine Society &mdash; all kinds of societies to give help at times of bereavement and birth.  Marriage is not mentioned as having been expensive but I am sure people sought money to tide them over the marriage feast, even though their needs were simpler then than now.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte spoke about the need for supervisory committees.  I am glad to say there was a general tightening up of all of that due to the natural concern of the registrar.  This led to the 1988 regulations which are being constantly examined. Furthermore, a working group composed of representatives of the Department, the Registry of Friendly Societies, the Irish League of Credit Unions and the Credit Union Advisory Committees are studying the up-dating of credit union legislation, and the Registrar of Friendly Societies is examining the updating of the Friendly Societies Act.</P>
    <P>Senator Jack Harte expressed legitimate concerns about supervisory committees and asked if people would be compensated if their money vanished. The task of both the Registrar of Friendly Societies and the supervisory committes, of which I spoke, is to ensure that that will not happen.  I believe the supervisory committees will operate satisfactorily and that the wishes of the registrar will be carried through, but it requires constant vigilance to ensure no wrong is done through the operation of these friendly societies.  I am satisfied that the regulations we have put in place plus the intergroup committee of which I spoke have this matter in hand.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Cuiv asked about the safeguards and I think they are addressed in what I answered to Deputy Harte.  He referred to the co-ops and the idea of self-help.  He welcomed the regulations and indeed he wished the thresholds and the limits of the money to be paid out could have been raised.  Coming as he does from a background of work in the self-help, co-operative area, knowing as <Col N="1511" /> he does how that ethos &mdash; that spirit of get-up-and-go, with people working together within parishes and communities &mdash; can ignite a local community, the Senator had every right to express his concerns.  On the Order of Business today there was much talk of the need to help the west of Ireland and the need to have such a debate in this House.  Senator Ó Cuív said people with a project should be able to go to a local institution which would listen to their idea and grant them the necessary funding to get started on it.  I would like to think that the spirit and ethos will be embodied as well in the legislation being prepared on consumer credit.</P>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave broadened the debate to ask if I was satisfied about the safeguards in relation to pensions in the light of the disquiet caused for himself, other members and the public by such issues.  These regulations will not address that matter which obviously needs to be tightened and looked at.  I will bear this in mind when I speak to my colleagues in the Department of Social Welfare both about this matter and the moneylending issue which was addressed also by Senator McCarthy.  He spoke of the near desperation for people from time to time in relation to the operations of illegal moneylenders as distinct from legitimate and registered moneylenders.  At the outset I said all of us have great and grave experience of such matters.  I referred to the worry and desperation caused for people in relation to the operations of illegal moneylenders.  As I feel very strongly about this matter I intend to address it within the ambit of the proposed legislation.</P>
    <P>I thank Members for their interest and attention.</P>

      <P>I am, therefore, contributing to the debate, without any knowledge of what previous speakers said.  I understand my colleague, Deputy Ahern, was present on that occasion. When I leave the House I will study the debate.  I note the concern of Members of the Seanad and the other House in relation to the cost of motor insurance. It is unfortunately one of those issues which appear to be forever with us and for which there does not seem to be a ready answer.  Great concern has been expressed about it.</P>
      <P>The fundamental causes of high prices for motor insurance should by now be well known.  Indeed, they were discussed as recently as 13 November and 20 November last in this House.  During the course of those debates a comprehensive list of measures to improve the environment for all categories of motor insurance, identified by the inter-ministerial group on motor insurance, and subsequently endorsed by Government, was given.  The measures announced by the various Ministers, including the introduction of necessary legislation by the Ministers for the Environment and Justice, are being given priority attention. Senators will appreciate that questions about road traffic legislation and legislation in relation to the courts are properly addressed to the Ministers for the Environment and Justice.  However I will take note of whatever points are put to me by Senators.  That would be the correct procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measures identified by the inter-ministerial group on motor insurance have the objective of improving the environment for insurance, particularly <Col N="1513" /> motor insurance.  The extent to which this objective is achieved will depend on the timing and the scope of their implementation and the impact which implemented measures will have on the frequency and cost of insurance claims.</P>
    <P>The recent publication of the Coopers and Lybrand Review of Motor Insurance costs in Ireland and the United Kingdom confirms what the Minister for Industry and Commerce has been saying for the past number of years regarding the level of motor insurance costs here.  In particular, I am glad to see the review reiterates the need to examine the level of awards for pain and suffering here and also the present mechanisms for resolvingn personal injury claims.  It also draws attention to the level of professional, including legal, fees in Ireland and the late settlement of some claims.</P>
    <P>The report concludes that personal injury claims costs in Ireland are over four times higher than in the United Kingdom &mdash; I accept that Senators spoke about this recently and it may sound as if I am lecturing them when they know all the facts but it is necessary that I read them into the record &mdash; and that the proportion of motor insurance claims which include personal injury compensation here, is five times higher than that in the neighbouring jurisdiction.  Of course we have to ask the question: why is this so?</P>
    <P>Are we more susceptible to injury in motor accidents and when injured do Irish people suffer more serious injuries than their counterparts in the neighbouring jurisdiction?  Are our compensation levels too high and are our mechanisms for the resolution of personal injury claims too complex and too costly?  We need as a society to seriously examine these fundamental questions. We cannot continue to claim more often for personal injury as a result of accidents, to accept compensation levels far higher than in other countries and at the same time hold a view that our motor insurance premiums should be on a par with those of other countries.</P>
    <P>I should add that in the context of the inter-ministerial group on motor <Col N="1514" /> insurance the Minister for Justice agreed that his Department would carry out a review of the levels of compensation awarded by the courts in the State in personal injury cases, and in particular the amounts awarded as general damages for pain and suffering and loss of amenities of life in the light of a 1991 survey by Davies Arnold Cooper which suggests that personal injury compensation levels in Ireland are much higher than in other EC member States and the report now published by Coopers and Lybrand.</P>
    <P>There are 33 non-life insurance companies authorised to carry on motor insurance business here.  It is not the function of the insurance supervisory authority to tell those insurers how to run their business or to interfere in their rights to accept or reject risks, or to dictate the terms applicable to any insurance policy, or to interfere in their rights to charge realistic premiums in the light of their underwriting experience.</P>
    <P>Legislation is now being prepared to give effect to the EC Motor Insurance (Services) Directive, which is due to be implemented into law by the end of May 1992 and comes into force at the end of November.  This directive will allow EC insurance companies to offer motor insurance cover, on a services basis without being established, in a uniform manner throughout the EC, subject to certain criteria, depending on the size of the risk undertaken.  I attended a meeting in Brussels recently on the internal market at which insurance costs and the liberalisation of the market were discussed and agreement reached.</P>
    <P>While the opening-up of the Community market may intensify competition on price, cover and quality of service, it should be noted that there is already a substantial foreign presence in the Irish insurance motor market.  Over 70 per cent of non-life insurance undertakings operating in Ireland are foreign-owned. Increased competition may not necessarily lead to a reduction in costs here. Prudent insurers, indigenous, EC established or Community services must set their premium rates to match the compensation payout.  The compensation <Col N="1515" /> levels existing in each member state should determine the premium rates charged by both established and services insurers.</P>
    <P>Unless and until the claims experience, including the claims frequency and levels of compensation, in Ireland matches that obtaining in other European countries there will be divergences between motor insurance premia in Ireland and those applying in other countries.  While I may be repeating what has been said already &mdash; one might say <i>ad nauseam</i>&mdash; there is no getting away from what is stated in the last paragraph of the report.  Until the claims experience, including the claims frequency and the levels of compensation, here matches the norm in other European countries, it follows that motor insurance premia in Ireland will be higher than those obtaining the other countries.</P>
    <P>While we all await the end of 1992 and all the directives we sometimes speak of it as if it will be an El Dorado or a Valhalla towards which we will all travel with great expectations &mdash; it is often better to travel hopefully than to arrive, to quote the old Chinese proverb.  The two factors I mentioned are those which cause the disproportionate level of premia in this country.  The sooner we all grasp that fact, work on it and have an educative process, the better it will be for all concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a most important debate.  While I know it is one we have had before, until we get further action or a reduction in the cost of insurance particularly for our many young people, it is a debate we should continue to have monthly, if necessary, and certainly every couple of months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all aware of the very high cost of insurance.  The Minister outlined various aspects of it but the matter will not be resolved until the Minister can give a greater commitment than she has done in relation to certain action that she can take.  I remember some years ago it was said in relation to the other half of the profession of which I am a member that <Col N="1516" /> if you did away with or cut down on the number of barristers, all our problems would be solved.  The &ldquo;two senior barrister&rdquo; rule has been done away with and often now just one barrister does most of the leg work.  While there may be, at times, a smaller fee payable to a junior in drafting proceedings, by and large now only one barrister is involved, particularly in relation to the bulk of a fee in a case.  Many of the cases are settled, but we have not seen a corresponding reduction in insurance.  How much of the costs in recent years have been eaten up either excessive claims or processing claims?  There has been an increase in the number of claims in relation to whiplash motor accident cases.  Unfortunately, this is a growing industry.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House would support any action reducing the cost of motor insurance to the public and, in particular, to young people.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave a brief résumé of the position and I am sure she could have said a lot more but although this is probably the responsibility of her colleague, the Minister for the Environment, I would have liked the Minister to address the whole question of uninsured driving.  Various figures are bandied about, but the message from this House should be total condemnation of people who daily drive without insurance.  I know it has been put forward that the high cost of insurance is a disincentive to be insured and I applaud some district justices who, in relation to second offences, make it their policy to jail offenders.  I have had clients who will do anything to avoid appearing before certain district justices.  These offenders who drive uninsured are akin to murderers. It is not acceptable for Senators to say that some drivers cannot afford insurance.  Greater detection is necessary. The cars of uninsured drivers should be confiscated and sold and the money put into the Motor Insurance Bureau to help the many innocent people who insure their cars.</P>
    <P>The whole question of the cost of motor insurance must be looked at.  The Minister should have discussions with the <Col N="1517" /> insurance industry into how they conduct their business.  At times &mdash; I know this from dealing with it at first hand &mdash; some claims could be settled more quickly. There can be delays on both sides &mdash; the legal profession are not without sinners in this regard &mdash; but the question of some cases being processed more quickly should be discussed.  I have dealt with cases which did not require a barrister. While some cases can be settled quickly, obviously cases involving serious injury must go to court because it would be imprudent and probably negligent to settle them quickly as the whole question of injuries and the prognosis for the future must be established.  However, we have often heard about three or four people involved in a crash, thankful that they are not injured, but then stiffness, whiplash and other injuries set in a couple of months &mdash; or a couple of hours &mdash; later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  Years ago people were involved in crashes and would be thankful they were unhurt. People might slip on a floor in Bewley's, for instance, pick themselves up and go about their business, probably more embarrassed that they had been seen fall as it might be thought they were under the influence of alcohol.  Nowadays the big thing is the &ldquo;compo&rdquo; mentality.  Members of this and the other House must look at this aspect.</P>
      <P>The issue with regard to the cost of repairs must also be examined.  I am well aware of people going to garages not being asked about the damage to the car but whether it is an insurance claim or if the person is paying for it.  I do not want to refer to quotations for repairs and car replacement.  Recently I was speaking to someone involved in this business and he said the exorbitant costs they have to pay to insure their fleet makes people looking for a quotation for hiring a car think they are buying the car.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned quite a good report by Coopers and Lybrand in relation to the difference between claims <Col N="1518" /> and the higher frequency of claims here as distinct from the United Kingdom and how there have been significant underwriting losses in recent years.  Expressed as a percentage of premia income, the Irish losses have been exceedingly greater in the years 1987-90.  These are figures quoted in the March issue of <i>Insurance Update,</i> the most up-to-date source.  The losses for that same period, 1987-90, in Ireland were 31.7 per cent compared to the United Kingdom losses of 19.2 per cent.  There is no doubt the whole question here of accident claims, people claiming for next to nothing and looking for exhorbitant amounts must be looked at.</P>
    <P>Will the whole question of the change in the jurisdiction make a difference because the bulk of claims were roughly, within, the old Circuit Court jurisdiction and in a region of £5,000 to £25,000?  As regards the questions of whether there should be a review, obviously some judges are very realistic.  I recently heard of a case where people said if things worked in their favour they could clear their mortgage, would have the money for their children's education and would probably be able to take a holiday.</P>
    <P>More has to be done on this issue and I think the Minister is fully aware of this. He knows that many young people are finding it almost impossible to get insurance, that extremely heavy loadings are placed on young drivers and that the cost of hiring a car is very high.  The people involved in the insurance industry need to take a hard look at exactly how they are doing their business.  There also has to be greater monitoring of the insurance disc system.  If the Garda or road traffic wardens did a tour of car parks I wonder what percentage of cars would be without an insurance disc. These discs are meant to help reduce the high cost of motor insurance.  This question has not been satisfactorily dealt with.  Some of these issues are probably the responsibility of the Minister's colleague, the Minister for the Environment and I am sure the Minister will consult with the relevant Departments because it <Col N="1519" /> is not just a question of one Department being responsible.</P>
    <P>As I said, there is a &ldquo;compo&rdquo; mentality in this country.  We used to hear that American laywers were &ldquo;ambulance chasers.&rdquo;  I think Irish lawyers are ahead of ambulances in terms of getting business. There has to be a rethink about the high cost of motor insurance, particularly for young people who are grossly discriminated against in this area.  Consideration should be given to the introduction of a national policy or to increasing the price of petrol.  This would sort out some of the cowboy operators. We should ensure that the full rigours of the law are brought to bear on these people.  I am sure that like me, many people support justices who impose mandatory jail sentences on offenders, particularly second offenders.  Consideration should also be given to the confiscation of cars.</P>
    <P>I hope some of the points I have raised will be taken on board by the Minister.  If they are not her responsibility, I ask her to refer them to the appropriate quarter. This is an on-going debate.  Many Members of this House are concerned about the high cost of motor insurance, the high level of claims and the need to do something about this problem.  Hopefully this debate, the ongoing measures which will be taken and the changes in our road traffic laws will lead to an improvement in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat what the Minister said about the high cost of motor insurance.  No matter how often we talk about this issue, people still seem to be confused and do not understand why there is such a big difference between the cost of car insurance in Ireland and in other EC member states.  Even though we have to implement EC Regulations and Directives, almost every week which dictate what we have to do in certain areas, we do not seem to be able to put in place measures which will control the high cost of car insurance.</P>
      <P>Looking at the issues which confront the insurance industry at present, the predominant issue is the high cost of car insurance.  The insurance industry have received a lot of adverse publicity over the past year, particularly in relation to the cost of car insurance.  Uninsured vehicles &mdash; my colleague, Senator Cosgrave, referred to this at length &mdash; account for approximately 8 per cent of total registered vehicles in Ireland while in other European countries they account for only 1 per cent of total registered vehicles, a difference of approximately 7 per cent.</P>
      <P>Last year was particularly bad for the insurance industry.  The deterioration in the underwriting results in the general insurance area was estimated to be £167 million.  In 1990 motor insurance amounted to £137 million.  That is a fairly high figure considering the number of motorists there are in Ireland.  I question who is at fault here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past decade the number of claims increased and the population has become very aware of the large amounts paid in compensation.  We must ask if the courts are too generous and lenient in granting awards for damages.  Some of my colleagues may not agree with me. The task of reforming the legal system and reducing the high cost of settling claims in Ireland is very difficult.  I <Col N="1521" /> remember a debate on the abolition of the jury system in such cases.  I and a few others in the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party felt very strongly that the jury system should be left in place and time has proved that we should have been listened to.  Perhaps this issue can be looked at again.  As I said, we have to ask if judges are too lenient and awards too high.  Awards here seem extraordingly high compared to those granted in other member states.  I know it is dangerous to go down the road of commenting on judges at present but I am well known for making comments at awkward times.  Extraordinary levels of compensation are paid for small injuries, including injuries over which I would go so far as to say there is a question mark. The Chairman should not be lifting his eyebrows.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair is meant to be non-partisan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that one complaint made against the insurance industry is that insurance costs in Ireland are much higher than those in other member states.  Therefore we must ask whether Ireland has more accidents per head of population than other European countries.  We pay substantially more in compensation to accident victims than do other countries.  These amounts, of course, are determined by the courts and the standard are set by the courts.  Ireland has the highest number of uninsured drivers in Europe.  This whole area must be considered.  I welcome the Minister's comments in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aside from the increase in the number of claims, particularly fraudulent claims, the main reason insurance costs are so high is that the level of damages awarded to accident victims in Ireland is much higher than elsewhere.  It is clear that policy holders are happy enough to see accident victims being paid large amounts, and I have no problem with that.  I am not saying that someone who is entitled to compensation should not get it but I am focusing on the number of claims and the high compensation paid, <Col N="1522" /> which results in higher insurance costs for everyone.  This matter must be considered.</P>
    <P>The predominant issue concerning the insurance industry in Ireland is the high cost of insurance.  Insurance companies have received much adverse publicity over the past few years and, therefore, it is understandable that people are concerned about the high cost of insurance. The insurance industry shares this concern and would like to bring about a reduction that would benefit all of us.</P>
    <P>In families where two or three members own cars insurance costs could amount to thousands of pounds.  I understand the concern of the Minister and the Government, but this issue will have to be tackled.  It would be naïve of us to think that foreign companies who come here would swallow up Irish insurance companies.  In her speech the Minister stated that 75 per cent of such companies are already in the Irish market.  What insurance company would want to insure people when they may have to pay extraordinary amounts in compensation?</P>
    <P>I would like to conclude on a more optimistic note.  There is deep concern in the insurance industry &mdash; I know the Government, the Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, and the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, are also deeply concerned &mdash; at the extraordinary high insurance costs. This is a very complex matter but I know it will be tackled.  It would be in the interests of insurance companies, policy holders and, indeed, the Government to take the necessary steps to reduce the cost of insurance.  The insurance industry should be able to provide insurance for all its clients at a rate in line with that in the rest of Europe.  We hear much about European rules in 1992, 1993 and 1994. This is a complex issue and insurance companies, the Government and the legislators should, in the future, provide for reduced insurance costs, safe driving and reasonable compensation.  As Senator Cosgrave said, there is an extraordinary consciousness among Irish people with regard to compensation claims.</P>
    <P>I hope I did not come down too hard <Col N="1523" /> on one side or the other this evening. This matter has been discussed over and over again and much can be said about it.  In her speech the Minister referred to knowledge and so on, but people are still confused as to why we, as legislators, do nothing to reduce the cost of car insurance.  It is unacceptable that three or four people in one family should have to pay nearly £2,500 a year in insurance costs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Honan with regard to claims against insurance companies.  Awards may be exorbitant but there is much more to the story.  It is sad that a great number of young people drive without insurance cover, not because they want to but because they cannot afford it.  One could say that the cost of insurance is beyond the reach of young people on an average wage.  It is almost impossible for these people to get insurance cover.  It is sad that, because of financial constraints, people cannot do the lawful thing.  Most of these people would prefer to operate within the law but cannot afford to pay £15 or £16 a week out of a modest income for insurance.  We cannot say that the high cost of insurance results from huge awards against insurance companies. Insurance companies are usually involved in other business and make very substantial profits.  In my view they are not open and above board in this regard. For example, in the UK and other EC countries young people can get insurance for about £150 to £200 per annum.  It is extraordinary that it is almost impossible for our young people to get insurance. It is a different matter if older people earning a decent wage break the law regarding insurance cover.  It is wrong for anybody to break the law, but there must be some understanding with regard to young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all remember Deputy Brennan, as Minister, introducing a Bill to this House which was discussed at length.  The Minister went out of his way to facilitate the insurance companies and we were all very impressed with the way he handled the <Col N="1524" /> matter.  He outlined assurances, which he believed to be genuine, the insurance companies had given him.  At the time an insurance lobby, one of the most powerful in the country, persuaded the Government of the day that high insurance costs resulted from high compensation awards. They tried to blame everyone except the insurance industry.  One of the best examples of that occurred during the discussions about the proposal to abolish juries in personal accident claims.  It seems that the industry had the mistaken belief that the end result would be a lowering of awards.  As we know, the abolition of juries has not reduced the size of awards and insurance premiums have continued to increase.  The industry previously said that if certain things were done everything would work out well for them but, in fact, that has not been the case.</P>
    <P>Down through the years we have heard insurance companies complain about making losses on motor insurance.  However, we have not heard much about the companies' overall profitability. Insurance companies are probably the only businesses in which profit and loss are measured together on a by-product basis.  I am not aware of any other industry in which that system operates.  Supermarkets and ther big companies such as Guinness do not operate that system; if there is a loss in some aspect of their business they do not take that out on the public and say they will not provide a product because they are making a loss. Insurance companies make substantial profits but they break down their business on a product by product basis.  They then argue that motor insurance operates at a loss; totally ignoring the high profit margins enjoyed on their overall activities.</P>
    <P>To me, the proposal to abolish juries in personal accident claims was an example of the way the industry can gain a lot of sympathy by heavy lobbying.  The Government and the Minister, Deputy Brennan, not only tried to facilitate the industry but he tried to bring about a decent insurance system that could be <Col N="1525" /> respected.  The Government really believed the industry's plea to abolish juries in the case of personal accident claims.  I know I fell for that argument hook, line and sinker.  However, the end result was not that predicted by the insurance industry.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House as there are probably other Senators who would like to contribute to the debate. However, I do not consider that the problems with insurance companies can be put down to the high amounts of damages awarded by courts.  There is something amiss when a young person in the United Kingdom or other EC country can obtain insurance for £150 to £200 per annum while the cost is much higher here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, to the Chamber.  I congratulate her on her appointment and wish her every success in the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>Today's debate is very important from many points of view but particularly for the motoring public.  In recent years the cost of motor insurance has been a subject of debate in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Many reasons have been put forward to explain the huge increases in premiums.  New legislation was enacted in the hope that changes made to our law would succeed in keeping down insurance costs.  However, as we all know, that has not happened.  The situation has now deteriorated to such an extent that insurance is out of the reach of many people, and particularly young people.  Since many young people cannot afford to pay the premiums quoted, unfortunately, they drive without insurance.  In doing so they are, of course, breaking the law and are a risk to other road users.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent report by Coopers and Lybrand on the comparative costs of private motor insurance in the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom sets out some of the contributing factors of the comparatively high cost of motor insurance in Ireland.  One key factor they point to is that Irish claims costs are significantly higher than those in the United <Col N="1526" /> Kingdom.  It is noted that personal injury claims are 2.5 times more likely to arise in the Republic of Ireland than in the United Kingdom; non-comprehensive claims are five times more expensive and comprehensive claims are three times more expensive here than they are in the United Kingdom; personal injury claims are four times more expensive and damage claims are twice as expensive in Ireland; the fatal accident claim rate in Ireland is 2.5 times the rate in the United Kingdom; the serious injuries claim rate is 1.25 times higher in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Another contributing factor was the cost of spare parts.  Spare parts cost as much as 33 per cent more in the Republic of Ireland than in the United Kingdom. Car repair times are longer in Ireland also.  The authors of the report conclude that if the differential on motor insurance rates between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom is to be reduced, any action plan must address the main factors leading to the huge difference in claims costs, that is, the value and frequency of personal injury claims.</P>
    <P>The authors of the report highlighted the following issues they felt should be given priority attention: the number of claims, high accident frequency, standard of road system and maintenance of roads, standard of road traffic law enforcement, value of claims, level of awards for pain and suffering, an issue referred to by many speakers in the debate this afternoon, the level of professional fees and the late settlement of some claims.</P>
    <P>All those issues are within our competence and could be put right if we had the will to tackle them.  We certainly have the competence to tackle the issue of roads.  I am sure the state of the roads contributes to the number of accidents. The standard of road traffic law enforcement is something else that we can do something about.  The level of awards for pain and suffering seems to be enormously high here in comparison to the level of awards in other countries.  I hope something will be done about that because the level of payment seems to be out of proportion.  The level of awards paid in any other country is not as high <Col N="1527" /> as that paid here.  In that regard, I do not know whether the fault lies with the courts, whether the insurance companies are too lenient or if there is some other reason.  The size of an award here is well beyond what could be paid after a similar accident in any other European country.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased to note that a Cabinet sub-committee are now examining this serious problem and I hope action will be taken before too long.  It is time to tackle the fundamental issues highlighted in the report of Coopers and Lybrand.</P>
    <P>There is no way Irish motorists can continue to pay premiums for comprehensive cover that are on average 48 per cent higher in Ireland than in the United Kingdom and 133 per cent higher for non-comprehensive cover.  The position is even worse for young drivers in that the majority of insurance companies will not even give young drivers a quotation; and companies which do quote for young drivers make their prices prohibitive.  I have personal experience of that.  I run a small insurance business and every week young people try desperately to get car insurance.  Some of those people would be working in Galway, some 35 or 40 miles away.  They are trying to drive in and out of Galway. But in many cases they cannot because none of the insurance companies with which I do business would even give quotations for drivers under 25 years of age. Therefore they are left with a choice between the PMPA and the Guardian Royal Exchange, the only two companies that will give them a quotation.  Indeed I have seen some such young people being offered insurance at a premium of £1,500, £1,200, even £1,700 while, in most cases, the car they seek to insure is worth only about £1,000.  They will probably have bought the car for that amount but it may be worth even less.  Therefore, such insurance premiums are totally unreasonable.</P>
    <P>I have suggested that all insurance companies should be compelled to insure a certain percentage of young drivers.  If such share-out were possible it would <Col N="1528" /> open up the market to young drivers, enabling them to be insured at a competitive rate rather than be confined to two insurance companies only as is the case at present.</P>
    <P>I believe one company engages in 95 per cent of the business in regard to motorcycle insurance, thus young people have no chance of obtaining cheap premiums. Indeed in recent times such premiums have been increased.  Young people starting off in life, trying to get established in employment &mdash; and it is hard enough to obtain employment in these times &mdash; are being discriminated against in every sense, whether seeking insurance cover on a motorcycle, car or whatever and cannot obtain such cover at a competitive rate.</P>
    <P>Recently the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities discussed a proposal for a third Directive on non-life insurance, which proposal will complete the internal market in the non-life insurance sector.  This means that an insurance company, with a head office licensed in any member state, will be able to operate throughout the Community on the basis of branch establishment or cross-Border provision of services. Under present Community legislation supervisory control is exercised by member states where branches are established or where insurance services are sold.  Under the present proposal supervisory control will be exercised by the State in which the head office of the insurance company is located, that is the home country.  The present proposal will supplant the second non-life insurance Directive &mdash; which was reported on by the same Joint Committee and implemented by the EC Non-Life Insurance Regulations, 1991, Statutory Instrument No. 142 of 1991 &mdash; which represents partial implementation of the single licence concept.  It is intended to complete the process to provide for single licence home country control and harmonisation of measures to safeguard consumers. If that third Directive is adopted it will provide a single market in insurance, enabling all European citizens <Col N="1529" /> to shop around for the kind of non-life insurance, including health, whereas the second Directive allowed only the choice of law in respect of certain large risks.  It is now proposed to extend this facility to all insurance contracts.</P>
    <P>In that regard the Department of Industry and Commerce generally welcome the concept of single licensing. However, as over 80 per cent of the non-life insurance sector is foreign-owned &mdash; of which 60 per cent is on a branch basis &mdash; the new proposal would entail a change of administrative control over a substantial segment of the market.  Freedom of capital movements within the Community will mean insurance companies will have greater freedom to invest their assets to best advantage within the Community.</P>
    <P>Therefore we can look forward at the end of 1992 to considerable changes in the insurance business, to which the Minister referred earlier this afternoon. However, I remain uncertain that that will mean cheaper insurance for Irish motorists.  We all know that premium rates will be dictated by the amount of claims.  Unless something is done about such claims, we cannot expect to see cheaper insurance for quite some time to come.</P>
    <P>For insurance purposes our small country is divided into different areas.  For example, the rates obtaining in Dublin are much higher than those in the remainder of the country.  Indeed there are certain areas in Dublin where companies will not provide insurance cover at all which is terrible.  Cover in Galway is cheaper, and cheaper again in the southern part of the country.  It is unfortunate that people are faced with this ever-increasing burden of insurance, whether it be house insurance, car insurance or public liability insurance.  It is all occasioned by the huge increases in claims in recent years, many of the reasons for which have been spelled out by the Minister and by other Senators today.  For all our sakes I do hope something positive will be done about this in the very near future.  We are fast reaching the stage at which people will be unable to insure <Col N="1530" /> their property or cars because of the high premiums, which would be disastrous for everybody.</P>
    <P>The Garda did an excellent job in their blitz on drunken driving over the Christmas period.  Some such exercise will have to be engaged in as regards uninsured motorists.  We have been told here this afternoon that 7 or 8 per cent of our motorists drive without insurance cover, leading to an ever-increasing burden on those prepared to pay for insurance cover.  I hope something positive will be done about that.  It places the community at large at terrible risk if somebody involved in an accident with such an uninsured driver is injured.  I hope that in the very near future something positive will be done to address the huge costs of insurance cover here, about which there has been much discussion.  It is now time for action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously the critical aspect we must examine is the shocking position obtaining in relation to our young people seeking car insurance cover.  We cannot overstate or sufficiently emphasise how bad that position is.  In fact I would see the cost of car insurance for many young people as being a tax on work, in that a car is essential for that purpose, particularly in areas where there is no DART, rail network or immediate bus service.  Effectively then car insurance premiums are a tax on work and must be a disincentive to young people in the lower income categories to engage in work at all, bearing in mind the amount they receive in social welfare, and as against their wages in a low-paid job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must confess to being somewhat more cynical about insurance companies than some of my colleagues.  I would appeal to the Minister to carry out a root and <Col N="1531" /> branch examination of insurance companies, how they function and the bases of their claims.  When I consider the number of insured drivers who pay the high premiums and do not have accidents I am not convinced that all the crying and whinging of the insurance companies is justified.  That is worthy of a second look. I would certainly need to have the facts established very clearly.</P>
    <P>I am not inclined to believe the public relations blurb from the insurance companies. It is worth examining whether the companies are in the difficult position they purport to be in.  Controls need to be introduced so that they could not decide willy nilly to insure one sector and not another sector of the population or engage in any arbitrary practices.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is going too far to suggest that the subcommittee of the Cabinet should examine the issue of providing a State insurance system as an alternative to private insurance.  The proposal is worthy of consideration.  My point is that the existing level of insurance premiums cannot be allowed to continue. Options worth considering are a State insurance system or, perhaps a levy on petrol, but they would need to be examined by a committee dealing with this question.</P>
    <P>We can do a number of things in addition to asking the insurance companies to reconsider their positions. Speed is a contributory factor to accidents and this has to be given more consideration than has been the case to date. It is correct and proper that the blood alcohol level has been dealt with.  We need to focus on speed as a contributory factor to accidents.  Politicians at all levels say that our road network is not suitable for the speeds at which vehicles now travel.  More speed checks are needed if we are to reduce accidents.  I suggest that a national system of speed checks be put in place as a priority.  Reducing speed on our roads will be a major contributory factor in reducing the number of accidents. I was very impressed by the recent radio advertisement.  There is a very effective advertisement on radio at <Col N="1532" /> present on speed causing deaths.  The issue should be dealt with immediately.</P>
    <P>Obviously the campaign on alcohol should continue and the breathalyser campaign must remain a priority.  That campaign is in place and not much more can be done about it.  I should like to raise a point which is not necessarily relevant to this debate &mdash; I know it has been mentioned by one backbencher TD of the Government Parties &mdash; and it is a difficulty of which Senator O'Brien and the Cathaoirleach would be acutely aware.  There are difficulties in isolated areas where people, particularly those living alone, have no social outlet other than their local bar or lounge.  In fact that is their only human contact.  It is not ideal but that is the reality.  There is the added difficulty that they do not have a rail or taxi service.  It is very difficult to know how to get around that problem but certainly they cannot be allowed to drink excessively and then drive.  Discretion will need to be used in instances like that. The point is that the campaigns on speed and alcohol must continue to keep down accident levels.</P>
    <P>My colleague Senator Cosgrave addressed the question of the role of the legal profession.  That was helpful because of his first hand experience.  I would be cynical of insurance companies and their pleading that all is right in their houses and they need to charge high premiums. We must bear in mind the point made by Senator Harte that their other operations are particularly profitable.</P>
    <P>However, I question also the role of the legal profession in this.  It needs to be examined.  Just as we have to have a preventative system for accidents, and keep the hands on the insurance companies, equally, the legal profession cannot be allowed to continue, as in some cases they do, to charge very high fees, for protracted cases which cost a fortune.</P>
    <P>Obviously the number of claims is very high.  There is some validity in the point that people suffer from delayed whiplash or all sorts of delayed syndromes.  The compensation mentality may set in.  That is unfortunate.  The way to deal with that is through an education programme, on <Col N="1533" /> the values to be instilled in our young people.  In our primary schools, we will have to instil a value system in our young people and highlight how wrong are unjustifiable claims.  I know it is not particularly germane to this debate but I am convinced that it is not lucky in the long run to make a fraudulent claim. I hold the old-fashioned view that this cannot bring great fortune to the claimants. The logic of that can hardly be got across to them.  The number of claims is certainly a problem.  The only answer to this is an education programme; and that idea may have potential.  The level of awards is obviously too high in a number of cases and that needs to be tackled.</P>
    <P>It would be churlish not to welcome the fact that a Cabinet subcommittee are working on this problem.  The solution will have to be radical.  It is among the most urgent matters facing the country at present in that it affects the cost of young people's car insurance.  It is a tax on their work, as well as on their way of life.</P>
    <P>Radical solutions are needed.  We will have to reduce accidents by curbing speed and continuing with the breathalyser campaign.  We must look at the role of the legal profession and their charges; the way claims are processed; the number of lawyers involved, and the arbitration system.  The amount of awards will have to be examined again and, I suggest, the insurance companies should be examined.  They should not be allowed continue with arbitrary practices such as deciding to insure one sector and not another.</P>
    <P>Finally, if it is not too fanciful &mdash; I am not in a position to go through the figures &mdash; we should look at the suggestion of establishing a State insurance system as an alternative to private insurance systems. This matter deserves a worthwhile debate.  It is my view, and the view of a number of Members, particularly new Members, that we need to hold debates that are relevant to people.  It will make this House more meaningful to all if we have more of this type of debate.  This is an urgent problem and I hope solutions will be found quickly.</P>

I remember when canvassing, particularly young people, in 1987 one of the questions I was asked was what in my view could a politician achieve.  One of the things that was on the top of my agenda at that time was that something should be done about the cost of car insurance here.  When they asked me whether I thought it was possible, I said it was but that for every decrease in price there would have to be a corresponding cost in dealing with some of the abuses of the insurance system as we know it.</P>
      <P>The booklet, a copy of which most of us received recently, dealt with insurance particularly from the point of view of the frequency of claims, etc.  We have to recognise a few facts: first, we have a very high level of claims in this country; second, awards are astronomically high; third, we have very high car costs and car repair costs which are exacerbating the problem; and finally, legal fees, delays and days in court add tremendously to the cost of insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to address myself to the insurance companies.  We were told that the problem was with the juries and that if we abolished the jury system premia would be reached.  The juries are gone but the premia have increased.  Later still we were told if we could reduce the number of barristers from three to two that would do the trick.  I understand that was implemented but we are still at square one &mdash; in fact, we are going backwards.  The next time there is a reform of the system insurance companies should be forced to give a firm undertaking of a percentage decrease in return for changes in the system.  If we do not achieve that, the public will be cynical about any tightening up the law or any reduction in the pay out in claims. This is one of the most urgent problems, particularly in rural Ireland where we do not have anything approaching a public transport system.  Cars are a necessary method of transport for young and old alike.  Many young people need cars to get to work and the average insurance cost is in excess of £1,500 a year &mdash; and <Col N="1535" /> it can be as high as £2,000.  I have a constituent, a young man of 28 years of age, who is sensible, no claims have been recorded against him and yet he was asked for a premium of £1,500.  He works as a forestry harvester and needs a car to get to work.  It is not reasonable to expect somebody who has paid his tax to pay that type of insurance premium.  It is also not reasonable to penalise somebody who has never had an accident.</P>
    <P>I wish to address the question of loading. Certain people &mdash; actors, entertainers, etc. &mdash; are often loaded because of their profession.  Unless it can be proved that theirs is a high risk profession, that type of loading should be banned.</P>
    <P>As regards loadings on young people, I would like to say a word in defence of women.  There is a good case to be made &mdash; and statistics will probably prove it &mdash; that the rate of accidents, particularly among young women, is no higher than among the older population.  I would be the first to admit that there is probably statistical evidence to show that young people in general and particularly young men have a higher rate of accidents.  It is a well documented fact that women drivers are considered low risk.</P>
    <P>Let us address ourselves realistically to the risk factor involved with young men. Where young people have been involved in prosecutions for reckless driving, dangerous driving, speeding, drunken driving, etc., I have no objection to loading. However, it is unfair to put severe loading on young people who never had an accident simply because a general statistic shows that, on average they have more accidents than older people.  If they are considered to be a high risk group, an analysis should be made of the time of day and the circumstances in which they are a high risk.  I believe young people normally are a very high risk at night time.  If we were to examine their driving to and from work during the day I am sure it would be proved that they are no more a high risk group than older people.  Therefore, a case could be made to insure young people, particularly those <Col N="1536" /> who need cars to get to and from work and whose livelihood depends on a car, between certain hours.  For example the insurance would not be valid between midnight and 6 a.m. which is, I understand, the high risk time for people in that age group.  In that way young people would not be penalised and out of jobs because they could not afford the insurance premium which is loaded to cover the more reckless young drivers.</P>
    <P>As regards the legal profession, the court and the cost of insurance, I have known cases where, even in minor accidents, there have been wrangles month after month as to who was responsible in the typical 50/50 accident which occurs all too frequently, where there has been no Garda involvement, no prosecution, and the damage was limited to vehicle damage only.  To me, this is to engage in semantics.  When you go on the road you are like a footballer going out on a football pitch risking injury in an accident. The question of liability should not arise. In other words, I am arguing in favour of a no fault system, except in the case of a prosecution being taken against one of the drivers.  In that case &mdash; and that would be only in the most very serious accidents &mdash; I see good reason to ascertain who was the responsible party and the question of liability should be ascertained.  The cost of legal fees in all the other cases does not justify the cost involved and a uniform saving to all insurance holders would result if, in ordinary small car accident cases nobody tried to establish liability. This would be a big advantage.  Furthermore, if we continue with the court system to sort out disputes &mdash; and there is a good argument for not doing so &mdash; I argue that the lower courts should be empowered to grant high sums of money in line with money values of today.</P>
    <P>Damage, particularly for pain and suffering, should be assessed on a professional basis.  The idea of a court deciding not only where responsibility lies but on the amount of damages leads to the type of lottery with which we are all too familiar.  This area should be looked at and action taken.  There is no way money can compensate for pain and <Col N="1537" /> suffering and to try to do so is futile. Payment for pain and suffering should be kept to a reasonable level.  Insurance claims and insurance awards have become a form of lottery, even bigger than the national lottery.</P>
    <P>In relation to enforcement of the rules of the road, I hold fairly strong views. We should be honest and admit that we are not strict enough when it comes to applying the rules of the road.  It would be fair to say that we have enough rules. If these were applied, we would bring the whole country to a halt.  We have reached the ridiculous situation where even though everyone knows that the national speed limit is 55 miles per hour &mdash; I understand it is to be increased to 62.5 miles per hour &mdash; nobody keeps to it.  It must be a national joke.  We should have laws that are capable of being applied. We should have speed limits on our roads that people feel are reasonable and the ordinary citizen, in his own careful way, would adhere to.  Those rules should then be applied.</P>
    <P>In relation to transgressions such as speeding, we should introduce a system of on-the-spot fines.  If those fines were reasonable, it would be much easier to apply them and operate them as a deterrent. It is my experience that if penalties are too draconian there is a temptation not to apply them to the letter of the law because the penalty at times seems to be too great.  Therefore I would like to see laws that are slightly more liberal, penalties which are capable of being applied, where possible on-the-spot, and applied rigidly.  Resources should be made available to ensure that the rules of the road are applied rigidly and to ensure compliance, with particular reference to speeding, drunken driving, cars in poor mechanical shape etc. &mdash; the danger areas.</P>
    <P>An analysis should be carried out to determine the high risk periods of the day.  Many accidents appear to happen between 12 midnight and 6 a.m. when people are returning from discos and dances etc.  We have to be realistic about this.  It is my understanding that the chances of speed limits being enforced or <Col N="1538" /> someone being breathalysed at 3 a.m. are relatively small.  That matter is a source of concern for me.  Not only has this led to the position being exacerbated in relation to insurance costs but we must be honest and say that it is also costing lives.  Nobody wants to see the carnage continue every weekend, particularly when young people's lives are at risk. While I would like to see this problem tackled, it has to be tackled in a tough way because there are no easy answers. If we want to reduce the cost of premia, we will have to reduce the size of awards and bring about a reduction in the number of accidents.  I hope that by having this debate we will encourage every party involved to take firm steps to address this problem.</P>
    <P>In the context of the free market come 1993, given our insurance costs, the cost of vehicles here, our peripherality and our dependence on the motor car, I shudder to think of how we are going to compete with our more cost competitive neighbours.  I hope therefore that after this debate we will see radical action being taken and hard decisions being made on all sides.  I hope also that the vested interests &mdash; there are vested interests who are making money under the present system &mdash; will be met head-on and challenged and that, where necessary, steps will be taken to ensure that the cost of allied services is reduced.  To return to a subject I mentioned at the outset, we are all aware of the cost of court cases.  Barristers &mdash; we now know how much they can cost &mdash; engineers, witnesses, medical experts etc. can wait for days on end before court cases are heard which are then settled out of court. Everybody knows this happens but to date it is a scandal that has not been met head-on.  Unfortunately, the people have been made to pay the price.  There has been a lack of uniformity in relation to awards and this has also led to the position being exacerbated.  Many people feel it is worth their while taking cases to court because the awards are greater than if they setle out of court.</P>
    <P>All these matters will have to be addressed, and I am sure that the Minister <Col N="1539" /> of State in her new portfolio will do so.  I know she is aware of the problems, particularly those facing young people, in this sphere.  I wish her well in tackling ths area.  I should say to her that the person who cracks this particular chestnut will certainly earn the gratitude of the Irish people, in particular our young people.  I have no doubt that they would pay the price, in terms of restrictions, enforcement of the rules of the road and lower awards, in return for a reasonable, modest insurance premium that they could afford.</P>

      <P>Like other speakers, I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate, which is both timely and important.  It is important that, as a nation, we are able to compete in Europe.  We must realise that anything that increases our insurance costs also places high cost on industry and on services which are in competition with our friends in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Coopers and Lybrand report is enlightening.  Figures now available show that the cost of comprehensive insurance is 59 per cent higher here than in the United Kingdom while the cost of non-comprehensive insurance is 151 per cent higher.  This indicates the damage which has been done in relation to our competitiveness <Col N="1540" /> and the cost to industry in that area.</P>
    <P>In relation to claims frequency the rate is lower here than in the United Kingdom.  The level of claims in respect of accidents, especially where injuries are minor, and in respect of thefts in the United Kingdom are higher than is the case here.  Indeed it is interesting that in general people in Ireland do not make claims in respect of minor damages whereas in the United Kingdom claims are made in respect of all damages. Despite this there is greater consciousness of litigation in society.  The percentage of claims awarded here in respect of personal injuries is approximately five times higher than in the United Kingdom.  It is interesting also that notified claims in respect of personal injuries make up 20 per cent of all claims here whereas in the United Kingdom they make up just 4 per cent of all claims. The cost of awards for damages in respect of comprehensive cover is three times higher here than in the United Kingdom and five times higher in respect of non-comprehensive cover.  It is also of concern to learn that we have two and a half times the number of road fatalities relative to the United Kingdom and 1.25 times the number of serious injuries.</P>
    <P>The need to look at our road system and to improve it has been debated at length but it bears repeating.  We also need to improve our county road system, we are carrying out improvements with EC funding to our primary road system in some areas, That should be stepped up and I hope that under the new Structural and Cohesion Funds the improvement to the primary road system can be increased.</P>
    <P>It is also interesting to note that the number of Irish people who ensure that their vehicles are mechanically in order is much lower than that of the UK, it is interesting to learn that one in 12 accidents is due to defects in vehicles, this should be highlighted.  The cost of spare parts in Ireland is between 8 per cent and 33 per cent higher than in the UK and I do not understand why that should be the case.  Most of the parts are imported from <Col N="1541" /> outside both islands, therefore, I do not understand why they should be dearer here which, obviously, makes it more expensive to repair cars.  We should look at the level of awards for pain and suffering which is far in excess of other countries I will draw attention to that later on.</P>
    <P>Our professional fees are 20 per cent of the cost of the total payments, that sounds very high.  It has been mentioned in the debate already.  Obviously there is a good industry around all this where legal people and other professions are obviously making a very good living out of motor accident and injury litigation.  I do not understand why it should sometimes take up to four years to settle claims.  I have discussed this with barristers who say that if there was a will to improve the system it could be done in a much shorter time with less cost involved.</P>
    <P>The difficulties with the high loading on young drivers have been highlighted, too many young drivers are forced to drive without insurance.  It should not be tolerated, but the premiums are prohibitive, £1,000 to £2,000 are the usual quotations for young drivers.  As Senator Ó Cuív said at the last council election it was one of the issues mentioned at the doors on quite a few occasions during canvassing.  There should be a system of incentives to reduce the level of accidents involving young people.  There should be a system of licensing for driving schools and we should introduce a specific driving tuition scheme targeted at new, inexperienced young drivers, the insurance company should introduce substantial discounts to young drivers who take such a course and who have completed a test of competency in the rules of the road and in driving itself.</P>
    <P>The Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland paid out £18 million in 1990 in personal injuries claims to victims of uninsured drivers, about £20 per insured driver.  The cost of damages to property is not included and in too many accidents innocent victims suffer loss with no compensation because the drivers are not insured.  It is necessary to clamp down on the whole area of uninsured drivers.  We <Col N="1542" /> welcome the European Court ruling that Ireland was acting illegally in keeping out competition, competition from overseas is welcome but again the insurance company will say that because of the level of claims and compensation we are not attractive to outside competitors in the insurance industry.  I hope time will prove them wrong in this regard.</P>
    <P>Insurance companies should also look at the efficiency of their own systems. The growth and management expenses for insurance companies over the past number of years has been 20 per cent per annum, which, on average is 1.75 per cent the rate of inflation over the same period of time.  We welcome the report by Coopers and Lybrand but it did not refer to certain costs, in fact the management expenses of the UK companies are less than two thirds of those of the Irish companies.  What can we do about it?  As well as improved efficiency in the insurance companies there is also a need for better services to the customer.  There should be more access for the customer to information about the terms of his policy, the structure of premiums and the level of commission and services charged so that the consumer can shop around freely with full knowledge.  There should be a code of practice for brokers and agents to protect customers from unfair selling practices.  The insurance industry should establish an insurance Ombudsman to provide a simple mechanism for settling complaints by clients about the treatment by insurers, a scheme that is run cheaply and effectively in Britain.  We should remove the practice that unfairly victimises particular groups.  Insurance companies have different groups of people whom, for various reasons, they load, for example, disabled drivers still face a 10 per cent loading where there is no actuarial foundation for doing this. Even more unjust is the fact that victims of untraced drivers receive much lower compensation than the compensation paid to victims of drivers of uninsured vehicles.</P>
    <P>Premium structures should be tailored to give bonuses to those who are willing to improve their safety standards on the <Col N="1543" /> road.  The abolition of juries did not reduce the level of settlements, which was very disappointing.  Fine Gael have proposed that there should be a book of quantum damages to guide judges in making awards and to standardise, as far as possible, the levels of such awards. This would tend to reduce the recourse to court hearings as the level of damages in a particular case could be predicted in advance.  One must recognise that damages will vary in particular cases.  The loss of a limb or a faculty would have different effects on different persons depending on their occupation; there should be regular conferences of judges themselves.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann expresses its deep concern at the decision of Dublin Port and Docks Board to liquidate the Stevedoring Company, Dublin Cargo Handling and to privatise stevedoring in the Port and Docks; and calls on the Board and the Marine Port and General Workers Union to resolve their differences at the negotiating table so as to ensure that no jobs are lost, that the Port and Docks can operate to maximum efficiency and that the future of the Port and Docks is not in jeopardy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I welcome the Minister of State to the House and congratulate him on his appointment.  I regret that the Minister for the Marine is not present to deal with this very serious matter which will lead to the loss of some 219 jobs if the liquidation goes ahead as seems to be the intention.  The Government have put down an amendment to the motion.  I am totally opposed to the amendment which proposes to delete all reference to the proposed liquidation and privatisation of Dublin Cargo Handling Limited.  This is not acceptable because, by implication, it means the Government are in favour of the liquidation and privatisation. They do not seem to be concerned that liquidation leads to a loss of jobs &mdash; once a company go to the wall jobs are lost.  This unfortunate amendment calls for the &ldquo;taking of whatever steps may be necessary&rdquo;.  That is a very bald statement when one considers that what we require is to protect people's employment and a guarantee for the future of their families and for the inner city of Dublin.</P>
      <P>Today's happenings in the Dublin Port and Docks Board were unfortunate as was the decision taken to petition the High Court on Friday to appoint a liquidator because it is putting the gun to the head of the workers.  There is absolutely no opportunity to have meaningful negotiations between now and Friday.  As strike notice has already been served the only outcome I can see at present is that the strike will take place.  The precipitated action that has now taken place is jeopardising the jobs and future of the port.  The application to the High Court two days after the taking of the decision by the Dublin Port and Docks Board amounts to a <i>fait accompli</i> and makes industrial action inevitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to give some background to the issue.  It is ironic that Dublin Cargo Handling Limited were established to <Col N="1545" /> eliminate what is now being proposed. They were set up to get rid of the myriad of smaller stevedoring firms that existed in the past and to consolidate them into a single body who would establish better structures and ensure that the port operated more efficiently.  This fragmentation of private operations was rationalised into a single operation in a wholly owned subsidiary of Dublin Port and Docks Board with the intention of improving the services.  It is now intended to put in a liquidator, sell off the licences and allow a number of private operations to take over, precisely what Dublin Cargo Handling were set up to abolish.</P>
    <P>Dublin Cargo Handling Limited employ 215 people directly &mdash; dockers, checkers and administrative staff &mdash; while Dublin Port employ 500 people directly. Over 5,000 people are employed in the port and in port-related businesses. Thousands of others are employed in the wider arena of the business &mdash; haulage, goods and service, agency work, brokerage work, etc.  It has been estimated by the Dublin Port and Docks Board that some 7,500 jobs are created for every 100,000 tonnes of exports dealt with through the port.  Obviously they are a very important existing and potential employer both in the port area and in the broader ancillary services.</P>
    <P>We export 70 per cent of our produce. As an island nation 99.8 per cent of our trade is dealt with through the nation's port Dublin.  Therefore, our port and docks facilities are extremely important and the future of our premier port must be of concern to all of us.</P>
    <P>Dublin Port and Docks Board put forward their rationalisation proposals on foot of the fact that Dublin Cargo Handling Limited have been loss-making for a period of time, almost since their inception in 1981.  Various figures have been bandied around, from £16 million to £20 million and the figure that has been thrown out today, £22 million.  Because of the present situation the Dublin Port and Docks Board wish to reduce the number of dockers by roughly a third &mdash; restructure the company and improve efficiency.  The proposal is to reduce the <Col N="1546" /> number of dockers from 129 to roughly 80; that work would take place at permanent identifiable locations which is not the case at present; that casual labour would be available for certain types of work; that there would be no compulsory redundancies &mdash; the package would allow for a flexible relationship; that all pensions would be protected; that those who remain would be employed for life and that there would be an £8,000 lump sum for those who stay in the company.  This would create the environment for expansion of the port and ensure that the port is profit making.  Overall, it was inevitable that, irrespective of whether this package of proposals in terms of rationalisation was accepted, privatisation of the port would take place.  That does not seem to have been in question with the Port and Docks Board; irrespective of any agreement, the company will be privatised. That seems to be the thin end of the wedge in terms of their proposals.</P>
    <P>Against that, Dublin Cargo Handling and the Marine Port and General Workers' Union have pointed out that the figure quoted &mdash; £20 million &mdash; is grossly misleading.  Over £9 million went towards previous redundancies and approximately £3 million is involved in terms of the present rationalisation.  An agreement between the union and the Port and Docks Board was negotiated in 1990 for a four year period.  That agreement is being broken unilaterally by the Port and Docks Board despite the fact that only 18 months to two years have passed since the agreement was made. Stevedoring charges have not increased since 1988, while port and docks charges to the subsidiary have increased constantly. Therefore, it is not one-sided by any means.  The Port and Docks Board are very generous when it comes to setting charges for the hire of their cranes, etc., to their subsidiary, but stevedoring charges have not increased over a number of years.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to sell off Dublin Cargo Handling main asset &mdash; their licence which lasts for 70 years.  That is why the process of liquidation is taking place.  The board are flexible when it comes to work <Col N="1547" /> practices in terms of casual labour, identifying work areas and so on.  However, the crunch comes with the question of privatisation.  The board are adamant that, irrespective of what negotiations are entered into and what the outcome of the negotiations may be, their precondition is that the work done at present by the subsidiary of the Port and Docks Board will in future be done by private firms. That is an unreal precondition because it is putting the gun to the head of the union and workers; it is an impossible starting point.</P>
    <P>The union and the workers propose a reasonable compromise, that is a share equity scheme where, rather than have the present work practices or the extreme of privatisation, a compromise could be reached that would allow for involvement by the workers.  In addition, the £8,000 lump sum could be translated into a share option so that they would automatically be participants in the company; they would have a vested interest in the company; they would have a say in the profits and obviously, in that context, they would have a major interest in the future development, prosperity and expansion of the Port and Docks Board.  That seems to be a most reasonable proposal and that is the road the Minister should go down in responding to the two sides in the context of the impasse.</P>
    <P>The implications are that job losses will be treated in the same way as those in UMP.  Once the receiver is called in, the jobs go.  We should remember that 90 per cent of the jobs in the deep sea docking area have been lost over the last 20 years. The people who work on the docks come from the inner city.  If they lose their jobs their families will be devasted and the companies providing services in the area will lose out.  We have seen how Sheriff Street, built in the forties and fifties to house dockers has been detenanted and is in a state of dereliction.  Now the remaining dockers are going to lose their jobs increasing the already very high unemployment levels in the inner city.</P>
    <P>Privatisation is not the solution. Vested interests, including people in the <Col N="1548" /> Port and Docks Board, are already trying to get some of the licences and avail of the EC grants for building the infrastructure under the EC programme on peripherality. A strike is inevitable in the present circumstances and if that happens it is not likely to be limited to dockers. Because employees are members of other unions &mdash; the AEU and SIPTU &mdash; it would cripple the entire docks area and the future of the port would be at stake.</P>
    <P>The Minister should ask the Dublin Port and Docks Board to allow breathing space for meaningful negotiations before the application for the liquidator is processed on Friday.  A compromise should be considered in terms of bringing certain work practices more into line with those of our competitors.  The dockers should be brought in from the cold eliminating the adversarial system that has operated up to now.  There should be share equity which would allow for participation by workers in the company.  The Minister for Labour and the Minister for the Marine should directly intervene to resolve this matter humanely.  Having done that, they should consider the restructuring not only our premier port but our trade with other countries by ensuring that sufficient capital is provided for the development of the port structure.  This happens in other countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I congratulate him on his appointment and wish him well in his new position.</P>
      <P>Any difficulties in the docks has to be a matter of major concern, particularly when it relates to the country's foremost port, namely, Dublin Port.  By any standards, Ireland has a very great dependency on external trade.  Within the European Community, Ireland has the third highest level of dependency on external trade and exports more than 70 per cent of the overall production.  It is for such reasons that we particularly depend on the efficient and harmonious working of our ports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Down the years Dublin Port has been at the receiving end of considerable neglect. Investment in infrastructure has <Col N="1549" /> been very small compared to the level of infrastructural investment in the ports of our direct competitor countries.</P>
    <P>The port is very important in the immediate docks area.  About 500 people are employed there &mdash; 215 by Dublin Cargo Handling.  Those people are now faced with the prospect of being forced to join the dole queues.  The port has a wider contribution to employment.  Five thousand people are directly employed in port related activities and many more are employed in ancillary and peripheral activities.</P>
    <P>The port has enormous potential for development and has a central role to play in the economy.  The present dispute has to be a matter for great concern because of the immediate effect it will have on those who work at the port and the manner in which it will inhibit the development of the potential of the port area.  There is potential there for considerable expansion in tourism activities and for development of facilities to allow a greater number of car-driving tourists to enter the country.  There is a potential for the development of water sports complexes and account should be taken of the interaction between the port and the proposed national sports complex.  There is also the possibility of meat plants and provender milling in the area.</P>
    <P>The kind of disputes that have gone on in the past few days, and particularly today, will militate very much against the development of the port and the achievement of its potential.</P>
    <P>The industrial relations history of the port leaves a great deal to be desired.  I see no value in tracing that history, or in trying to apportion blame or responsibility for the present position.  We must begin to look to the future.  We must try to find solutions and see what can be done to foster a climate in which harmonious industrial relations can develop.  Such a climate will arise only by taking a negotiating approach to industrial relations problems.</P>
    <P>For me it is a matter of considerable <Col N="1550" /> regret that the Dublin Port and Docks Board have today decided to take precipitate action by announcing their intention to liquidate the Dublin Cargo Handling Company.  Inevitably, such a step will only force people into further levels of entrenchment.  People will be forced to develop attitudes that will make the resolution of the problems considerably more difficult than might have been the case had people been prepared to adopt a more conciliatory attitude to the problems at Dublin port.</P>
    <P>There are a few points I particularly wish to draw to the attention of the House.  Those points relate to my party's motion and to the amendment in the name of the Leader of the House, which is, I presume, on behalf of the Government.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting some of the differences in the terminology used in both motions.  Both begin by expressing concern &mdash; in our case &ldquo;deep concern&rdquo; and in the case of the Government &ldquo;serious concern&rdquo;.  We would all agree that that difference is of no great significance. However, when one considers what is to be done in relation to the resolution of the problem, one realises that the original motion very clearly proposes that the resolution of the problem be based on negotiation between the Marine Port and General Workers' Union and the Dublin Port and Docks Board, but the Government, have seen fit to delete that ideal.  I can only conclude that they are opposed to that objective because if they were in favour of the objective, there would be no reason not to include it in their amendment. It follows that the Government are not concerned about the proposal to privatise the stevedoring work carried out by Dublin Cargo Handling.  Again, the Government have seen fit to omit that objective from their amendment.</P>
    <P>There is an ominous ring, a menacing tone, to the term &ldquo;whatever steps are necessary&rdquo; in the amendment.  Such terminology seems to be a coded way of saying that privatisation is on the cards, <Col N="1551" /> let the battle cats of industrial relations loose, let the issue run its course.  I very much regret the tone of such language. Ultimately, a solution will have to be found and language, which encourages entrenchment &mdash; language that is to some extent the coded language of war &mdash; is highly undesirable in this context.  I ask Government speakers to spell out what precisely is meant by &ldquo;whatever steps are necessary&rdquo; and I ask them also to make clear what is excluded, in other words, what kind of measures will not be part of the implications of &ldquo;whatever steps are necessary&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>Today has been a black day for employment in Ireland.  There have been announcements of more than 1,000 job losses &mdash; albeit the Dublin Cargo Handling element of those job losses will be postponed.  It is imperative that we seek agreement on this problem and that we move away from using such terminology as &ldquo;whatever steps are necessary&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I formally second the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the Chamber.</P>
      <P>My part will be putting the motion to the vote because the amendment excludes the provision to seek the assistance of the Minister to resolve a matter, which is not normal practice.  Another reason is that we know that what is meant by &ldquo;whatever steps are necessary&rdquo; is &ldquo;go ahead and privatise&rdquo;.  That is not the way the Government have operated on the issue of privatisation.  Previously, the Government carried out a detailed and close examination of proposals for privatisation. In this instance the issue is being shoved through rather than being the subject of debate at any level of political importance.  Consequently, we say that this is contrary to the Government's attitude to privatisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin port has many features.  It is Ireland's premium port and offers easy access.  Because Ireland is an island economy, it is heavily dependent on imports <Col N="1552" /> and exports.  The port is an essential and integral part of the national economic infrastructure.  With the coming of the Channel Tunnel in 1993, Ireland will be the most remote country from the trading centre of Europe, which will make it very difficult for us to take up trading opportunities in a market of 320 million people. The coming of the Channel Tunnel means that in 1993 Ireland will be the only country in the European Community without a land link to Europe. We will be almost totally dependent for trade on our shipping routes and ports. That makes the present very serious issue of national concern.  Ireland's exporters, who are already faced with a difficult task, will have to strive very hard to capitalise on our links with the market of 320 million.</P>
    <P>Figures for 1986, the most recent available, show that Dublin Port contributed £2,178 million to the Irish economy, in other words, 13 per cent of gross national product, generating some 174,231 jobs; Dublin port accounted for £715 million of Government income, Dublin port always financed their capital development and has not received subsidies or grants for such development, for example, they spent £80 million from their resources on capital development over 20 years.  We must remember we are talking of an overall area of 260 hectares.  It would be difficult to over-emphasise the importance of Dublin port to our economy.  That is one side of the argument.  But, when one hears of media claims that many abuses are occasioned by the labour force, and that they are generating problems, one is forced to ask how could the port authorities have achieved so much without the assistance and co-operation of their workers over the years?  Here, I speak with the benefit of experience since I worked on the cross-channel side of the docks for 13 years, on Guinness boats, having worked on the ocean pier and deep sea end of the docks unloading and discharging hops.  It is hard work, as is the case with most work on docks.  Without <Col N="1553" /> the co-operation of workers the achievement to which I referred would not have become a reality.  Management alone cannot do so, they must enlist the co-operation and understanding of workers.  Management have received assistance and co-operation, but they contend that the labour force are being awkward, that the company should be privatised, split into five in an attempt to tame the workforce, this seems to be the attitude, and it is not good enough.  If the workforce were as disruptive as was claimed on the &ldquo;Pat Kenny Show&rdquo; this morning, or as the management of the Dublin Port and Docks Board have claimed, how could they have achieved the developments to which I have referred. Indeed, there is much more evidence that could be produced of workers contributions. This is not the way to treat them.  The Minister for Labour has an obligation to intervene, to put them back to the negotiating table.</P>
    <P>The Government amendment excludes the Minister being given that opportunity, detracting from the attitude the Government have adopted so far in privatisations where they took a special interest and they took their time about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;express&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;its serious concern at the ongoing difficulties in the Deep Sea Section of Dublin Port and, in the interest of employment, trade and economic growth both in the Dublin region and the national economy generally, calls for the taking of whatever steps may be necessary to ensure that the Deep Sea Section will be in a position for the future to operate on a viable, competitive and sustainable basis and urges that all the parties involved work towards that objective.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with many of the points made by the three Senators who have contributed. It is a very sad day for the inner city of <Col N="1554" /> Dublin whose port traditionally has been a great employer and supported many families over a very long period, the workers themselves having supported and developed the port.  When the dockers meet tomorrow or Friday, I hope they will agree with the proposals &mdash; a very attractive package which will secure their futures &mdash; put to them by the Dublin Port and Docks Board.</P>
    <P>I disagree with Senator Costello when he contended there had been no breathing space.  There has been a great deal of breathing space in these negotiations. One could blame management as well as Dublin Cargo Handling, but the regrettable aspect is that there has not been one area of common ground between both sides.  It is indeed sad that these negotiations have continued for so long, yet they could not find one common area within which they could agree any of the proposals.  Unfortunately, the company is now going into liquidation and many people will lose their jobs.</P>
    <P>It is not correct to contend that the circumstances are confrontational, or that there has been no breathing space. Everybody would agree that a huge amount of time was spent negotiating, with endless meetings with various areas of the port, in an endeavour to resolve this problem but they have not been successful. I hope the package to be put to the dockers this week will be accepted.</P>
    <P>Among the Twelve, Ireland has the third highest dependency on external trade.  The volume of our imports/exports exceeding GNP by twice as much as the United Kingdom and West Germany, and more than five times as much as Japan.  We are an island economy, exporting 70 per cent of all our produce, relying on seaports for the movement of 99.8 per cent of our trade.</P>
    <P>In recent years Ireland's peripherality has been referred to frequently within the context of our membership of the EC. Because we are at a great disadvantage, it is vital that our ports, particularly our main one, run in a smooth, efficient manner, so that people can come in and out of the port, and get their goods in <Col N="1555" /> and out of the country, as the case may be.  That is vital for the future stability of our economy.  It is sad that such confrontation should take place.  In other European countries huge amounts of money have been spent on ports' infrastructures. Senator Upton was correct in that assertion.  For example, Belfast port, Dublin's main competitor, received generous grant aid for port development, as has Warrenpoint.  We could rightly criticise many of our Governments on not investing as much as they should in Dublin port.  However, that does not detract from the point that we cannot afford to run a port at a loss.  We cannot afford to lose £16 million, £20 million or £22 million or whatever.  The result of all this has been &ldquo;excess capacity&rdquo; in most ports of Northern Europe, including Belfast.  Belfast has a well developed infrastructure and handling facility. Dublin must keep pace.  The key words are &ldquo;excess capacity&rdquo; which mean that a port can avail of business at short notice. That cannot be lost, something Dublin port has not done over the years, for the reasons Senator Upton and I have mentioned.  That was a grave mistake.</P>
    <P>On the labour aspect rationalisation was legislatively imposed in the United Kingdom, resulting in a dramatic increase in productivity and an even more dramatic change in the commercial potential of the ports.  That the Dublin Port and Docks Board and Dublin Cargo Handling reach agreement on labour rationalisation is crucial to the future profitability and development of Dublin port, employing more than 500 people, with an additional 250 employed in the board's wholly owned stevedoring subsidiary, Dublin Cargo Handling.  In excess of 5,000 people are employed in the port area in port related business.  A substantial number of people are employed outside the port in business related directly to the port and its activities. Therefore, growth in port activities will result in a spin-off growth in all these <Col N="1556" /> other areas.  Already inadequate port facilities and bad labour practices are seriously impeding growth.</P>
    <P>An economic impact study of Dublin port carried out in 1988 defined precisely for the first time the economic importance of the port.  Some of the findings of that study were that exports through the port generate 174,000 jobs and that every 100,000 tonnes of exports generate 750 jobs.  Accordingly, a more cost competitive, efficient port with good infrastructure and handling facilities would facilitate and accelerate growth in exports leading to increased employment.</P>
    <P>The Chamber of Commerce commissioned a report called <i>The Corridor of Competitiveness,</i> which estimated that the trade diverted to the Northern corridor represented a loss of £56 million to our economy.  The advantage to employment growth of winning back that trade is self-evident.  Furthermore, it was contended that if Northern trade could be attracted South, through improved port capacity and lower charges, employment could be further enhanced.  Dublin port has an excellent deep water harbour, being ideally situated with central corridor lines to Liverpool and Holyhead and regular scheduled services to north European and Mediterranean ports.</P>
    <P>In promoting industrial development the IDA stress the advantages of the Dublin region, industrial sites, water supply, energy, labour resources and transport facilities.  The availability of a major deep water port is a significant attraction to industrialists.  The IDA acknowledge its value as a selling point but they are also conscious of a number of basic weaknesses which need to be addressed including labour relations in the port.</P>
    <P>Perhaps Senator Costello, who is a member of Dublin Corporation should look at the question of access to the port. Over the past number of years we have debated road infrastructure and the need for a port relief road to link up with the <Col N="1557" /> eastern by-pass.  Many people objected to the eastern by-pass and questioned it on environmental grounds.  During the local elections the proposed eastern by-pass was put in abeyance and the city councillors decided to await the environmental impact study report before making a decision.  One of the compromises the Labour Party proposed during the local elections was that there should be a designated truck route in the city because of the importance of access to the port for industry.</P>
    <P>Recently I read in a newspaper &mdash; unfortunately I was not at the meeting to point this out &mdash; that the Labour Party councillors, including Senator Costello, voted against this compromise deal.  I wonder how serious Senator Costello is about the future of the port when one considers the Labour Party voted against something as important as that.  Everybody, even those who were opposed to the eastern by-pass, recognises the importance of access to the port but the Senator recently turned down a good proposal.</P>

      <P>This is relevant to the overall development and future viability <Col N="1558" /> of the port.  People have to be able to get in and out of the port as easily and efficiently as possible.  There was a very good compromise put forward but the Senator opposed it.  I question the sincerity of Senator Costello's concern about the future of Dublin port.</P>
      <P>I do not believe Senator Upton's assertion that the language in the amendment is wrong.  The Minister is leaving it over to the trade unions and the Dublin Port and Docks Board to try to resolve this dispute.  The sad thing &mdash; and we all agree on this &mdash; is that a company like this is going into liquidation.  This is a black day for Dublin's inner city.  Nobody can say that enough time was not given to negotiation.  Meeting after meeting has taken place.  The most negative aspect of this is that they could not agree on even one area.  That is a sad reflection on both sides.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I thank Senators opposite for their remarks on my appointment.  With regard to Senator Costello's comments about the absence of the Minister for the Marine, the Minister is on official Government business outside the country. That point has to be made.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Marine has been informed by the board of Dublin port of their decision today to present a petition to the high Court on Friday, 20 March 1992 for the liquidation and winding up of their wholly-owned subsidiary company, Dublin Cargo Handling Limited, this decision is primarily a matter for the board in accordance with their statutory duties.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Marine, however, fully supports the board in their efforts to develop a viable and competitive port service in the deep sea section of Dublin port.  This is vital for the future of the port generally but it is also critical to the future economic development of the Dublin region and to the competitiveness of Irish trade and commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1559" /> With the serious financial losses which have built up and with the major and growing diversion of trade to other ports, the existing position of the deep sea section of Dublin port is unsustainable. The issues involved must be faced sooner or later.  These problems have evolved over a long period and it may be of help if I explain the background.</P>
    <P>The importance of our commercial seaports to Ireland's economy cannot be over stated.  The level of the State's total trade in both volume and value terms handled by Irish seaports, including Dublin port &mdash; 79 per cent and 64 per cent respectively &mdash; underlines the importance of ports to the economy and expansion of trade.  Commercial ports handled almost £17 billion of our total trade of £26 billion in 1990 and over £9 billion of Ireland's total export trade of £14 billion in the same year.  It is clear that ports must therefore operate as efficiently as possible and service their customers in a cost-effective and competitive manner.</P>
    <P>Dublin port is of vital importance in terms of its throughput of trade and its contribution to freight traffic in the central corridor.  In 1991 its trade throughput by all modes of freight was 7.7 million tonnes with the deep sea sector accounting for some 2.1 million tonnes.  In value terms Dublin port accounted for £8,692 million or in percentage terms 64.3 per cent of the £16,753 million trade handled by Irish sea ports.  The total port revenue for Dublin in 1991 amounted to £25.2 million with the deep sea sector accounting for some £6 million of that revenue.</P>
    <P>Dublin port, and all other ports operating under the Harbours Act, 1946, are expected by the Government to operate efficiently, economically and competitively and provide the level of service demanded of modern ports today.  I should, however, stress that port management and in particular industrial relations matters and the rationalisation of stevedoring services in Dublin port <Col N="1560" /> and other national ports is primarily the responsibility of the port and docks board and harbour authorities and the companies and employees involved.  In the case of Dublin port, I am advised that the board decided that it was absolutely essential that the operational structures, including those for the dock labour force, be streamlined so as to provide a modern competitively priced service.</P>
    <P>The establishment of Dublin Cargo Handling Limited in 1982 was an initial attempt to rationalise labour in the deep sea sector because of a chaotic situation which had arisen with nine stevedoring companies operating independently of each other and their financial viability being quickly eroded by rigid labour practices.  Dublin port held 50 per cent of the shareholding in Dublin Cargo Handling in 1982 with the remainder held by the then largest stevedoring company in Dublin port, Associated Port Terminals.</P>
    <P>Dublin port was left with a 100 per cent shareholding in 1985 following the withdrawal of Associated Port Terminals in the face of heavy losses.  Dublin Cargo Handling have continued since then to suffer heavy losses.  From their establishment to end 1990, accumulated losses, together with redundancy payments of £7.6 million, reached a total of £16.2 million.  Dublin Cargo Handling incurred losses of approximately £1.5 million in 1991.</P>
    <P>In the face of these continuing losses the board and management of Dublin port and Dublin Cargo Handling took the view that the loss making situation in Dublin Cargo Handling was not sustainable. Dublin port considered that a quality service could not be provided for customers unless restrictive practices were eliminated and normal industrial working conditions introduced in the port.  A major study was therefore commissioned by Dublin port in 1990 on the organisation of stevedoring in the port and was completed by Stokes Kennedy Crowley in May 1991.  The study recommendations were adopted in principle by <Col N="1561" /> the board including proposals on a labour rationalisation programme.</P>
    <P>The Stokes Kennedy Crowley report concluded that the effect of Dublin Cargo Handling's losses limited the capacity of the port authority to fund capital development and discouraged the growth of trade through the port.  I should mention that in order to deal with the financing requirements of its dock labour rationalisation programme, Dublin port has had to defer expenditure on its £8 million plus South Bank Quay Lo/Lo Terminal development project.  The settlement of the rationalisation programme could facilitate an early resumption of the suspended capital works.  The Stokes Kennedy Crowley report identified a range of problems including, overstaffing at all levels, high absenteeism/sickness, low average utilisation of dock labour, inefficiencies, poor labour allocation systems and no prospect of profitability.  The lack of choice for ships which have to use Dublin Cargo Handling and the high cost of services were also highlighted.</P>
    <P>The need for a more efficient port infrastructure was clearly identified in the recently published report of the industrial policy review group.  As an island nation dependent on its ports, inefficiency puts all the nation's firms at a disadvantage. The competitiveness of Dublin port was a matter of serious concern to the review group with low frequency of services and short opening hours being particularly highlighted.  The report cited the loss of business to ports in the Republic and pinpointed the considerable costs imposed on Irish industry, relative to what is clearly attainable if the efficiency of Larne could be replicated in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The requirements of port users is also a key factor in any restructuring of stevedoring operations in the port.  I understand that Dublin port had extensive discussions with representatives of all current Ro/Ro operators, with representatives of the Irish Ship Agents Association and with Dublin Chamber of <Col N="1562" /> Commerce in order to fully understand their needs.  These discussions highlighted port users' concerns on costs and service and disclosed a profound lack of confidence in the existing stevedoring structures.  This lack of confidence on the part of port users is reflected, in the diversion of traffic from the central to the northern corridor and the benefits, estimated at £56 million in lost trade, accruing to northern ports such as Larne.</P>
    <P>In view of the history of the port, the extent of losses incurred in the ports cargo handling operations since 1982, the deficiencies identified in the Stokes Kennedy Crowley study and reiterated by the industrial policy review group and the serious disruptions of trade, it is disappointing that recent discussions under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission have failed to yield progress.</P>
    <P>There have, as is well known, been ongoing industrial relations difficulties at Dublin port for some considerable time. Both the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission have been actively involved on numerous occasions in resolving various industrial relations issues at the port.  The more recent difficulties centre on the need to bring operations at the port into line with modern practices so as to ensure the future viability of the port in the face of stiff competition.</P>
    <P>A six week unofficial strike took place at the port last December and January. Arising from intensive discussions between both sides, involving the Labour Relations Commission, a formula for a return to work on 20 January was agreed.</P>
    <P>This return to work formula involved provisions for further discussions between the parties, with the help of the Labour Relations Commission, to bring about a negotiated settlement to the issues of increased flexibility, involving a restructuring of stevedoring operations. In view of the fact that little progress in these talks was being made, the Dublin Port and Docks Board decided on 19 <Col N="1563" /> February that Dublin Cargo Handling should be put in liquidation from 18 March unless the situation could be resolved.  The Marine Port and General Workers Union has served strike notice on Dublin Cargo Handling in the event of the liquidation proceeding.  As stated earlier, the Board of Dublin Port decided today that a petition will be presented to the High Court on Friday 20 March 1992 for the liquidation and winding up of Dublin Cargo Handling.</P>
    <P>Further intensive discussions took place at the Labour Relations Commission between Dublin Cargo Handling management and the dockers union in recent days but no agreement has been reached to date.  Even at this late stage and with the liquidation of Dublin Cargo Handling imminent I would urge the dock labour force and its union to think again.  The port clearly cannot continue to suffer losses in its cargo handling operations and to ignore the drift away of freight traffic to more competitive and efficient ports including ports outside the State.</P>
    <P>The issues involved are complex and historic but, having regard to all the implications, I would call on the parties to make further efforts, even at this late stage, to reach a settlement.  In this regard, the services of the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court remain available to all parties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>First I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, on his recent appointment and welcome him to the House.  In the short time available to me I just want to cover the salient points. I would like to stress that the Republic is highly dependent on exports and consequently shipping and sea ports.  For example, in 1990 Ireland imported 21.5 billion tonnes of goods, 82 per cent of which was transported through Irish sea ports.  In turn we exported 9.1 billion tonnes of goods, 78 per cent of which went through Irish sea ports.  In terms of <Col N="1564" /> total value of trade in 1990 £17 billion out of a total of £26 billion of trade or 64 per cent of the total went through Irish sea ports.  Similarly £9 billion out of £14 billion worth of exports utilised Irish sea ports.  I make those points to highlight the importance of Dublin Port and all the other ports to us as an economy.</P>
      <P>This island operates three principal shipping corridors.  They comprise the northern corridor, the central corridor and the southern corridor.  The Northern corridor involves shipping services from the posts of Larne, Warrenpoint and Belfast to ports in Scotland, Liverspool and Holyhead.  The central corridor involves shipping services from the ports of Dún Laoghaire and Dublin, usually to Liverpool or Holyhead.  The southern corridor involves port traffic from Rosslare, Waterford and Cork to Fish-guard or to Pembroke in Wales.  Shipping services for freight and passengers operates from the central and southern corridors directly to the continent.  I would like to stress that we are losing significantly on the northern corridor because we are not cost efficient and are not in a position to compete.</P>
      <P>It is absolutely essential that four basic requirements are met <i>vis-á-vis</i> shipping: efficiency of operation, cost competitiveness, reliability of service and flexible service.  Unfortunately, those conditions did not exist in the Dublin docks in times gone by.  Nobody is to blame for that.  A series of events have led to the existing situation but we must now look very quickly at what we have to do.  As I see it there is a clear lack of an integrated transport policy involving road haulage, port operations and shipping services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a lack of investment in ports resulting in inadequate facilities, under capacity and inefficiency.  We are operating under outdated legislation, having failed to reform the Harbours Act, 1946, and the Pilotage Act, 1913.  This restrains port management and leaves us with an integrated and outdated framework <Col N="1565" /> within which ports must operate.  Industrial relations issues are far from what they should have been in the various Irish ports over the years.  I agree with those who have said that today has been a very sad day for Ireland and, indeed, for Dublin where we have this massive addition to our vast unemployment list. It is horrific to note that in excess of 300,000 people failed to get jobs in the past 12 months, that is, including those on the live register and those who have emigrated.  I wish to make the point very forcefully that Dublin Cargo Handling Limited have a monopoly.  However, I am not so sure that they have served Dublin port well.  It has been argued by some that the practices and procedures adopted in some ports, such as Dublin, are more relevant to the forties than the nineties.  However that is a matter for another debate.</P>
    <P>Many questions have been raised. While reference has been made to levels of pay and abuses of the system I wish to ask some interesting and relevant questions. Am I correct in saying that it costs £400 to unload 2,000 tonnes of grain from a vessel during the weekend in Dundalk while the figure for Dublin is £4,200? Why have Dublin Cargo Handling Limited lost £16.5 million since 1982?</P>
    <P>There are, unfortunately, many weaknesses. There has been a lack of rationalisation and planning and these lie at the root of many of our problems.  If we are not cost-effective we cannot hope to compete with ports such as Larne and Warrenpoint.  As everybody knows, Dublin port has lost a great deal of trade in recent years.</P>
    <P>I have the greatest sympathy for those directly involved in Dublin port, particularly those facing unemployment, the dole queue and so on.  It is regrettable that we have reached this situation.  We must make sure, therefore, that there is greater planning, better management and arrangements to prevent a recurrence because one could not justify the differential in costs to which I have <Col N="1566" /> referred.  Indeed, there are several other figures I could give but time does not permit me to do so.</P>
    <P>Unless we can ensure efficiency, can compete with the next person and are both reliable and flexible, we cannot guarantee the survival of any operation, let alone in Dublin port.</P>
    <P>Like everyone else, I am sad about this development.  I sincerely hope, therefore, that those directly affected will be accommodated and, even at this very late stage, that something can be done to alleviate the position for the workforce. In the final analysis it is all very fine for Members of this House, or the other House, to talk about this matter because it is those who are directly affected that will suffer the most.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I welcome the Minister of State to the House, congratulate him on his appointment and wish him every success.  I thank him also for presenting the facts and the sobering realities in a very stark way in his address to the Seanad this evening.</P>
      <P>It is essential that the Seanad discuss this very important issue this evening because the ongoing difficulties at Dublin port, which are there for everybody to see, are a source of concern for us all. Already we have had a six week unofficial strike at the port and, because of this, activities there are at a standstill.  It is fair to say that the economic and commercial life of this city depends on the efficient operation of Dublin port.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe in the future of Dublin port and it is important that I say that.  The port has a vital role to play in the commercial life of the city and of the country in general.  It should be facilitated and encouraged in every way.  However, not everyone believes this.  Already experts have brought forward proposals to relocate the port no less in north County Dublin.  This is utter nonsense.  It is appalling to think that such ideas are being put forward, because such a move would lead to the manufacturing sector in the city <Col N="1567" /> centre and indeed all types of industries being devastated.</P>
    <P>It is important that I state that I am committed to Dublin port because others, by their actions, do not seem to be.  Senator Eoin Ryan mentioned, as I will, the port access route.  The reality is that goods cannot be transported to and from the port in an efficient way due to traffic chaos.  We have, therefore, got to put our heads together to sort out this problem.  It is important that goods can be transported quickly and efficiently to and from the port if it is to be competitive. While the question of access to the port is a matter for another day nevertheless it is relevant.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party Senators this evening are calling on the Dublin Port and Docks Board and Dublin Cargo Handling management to resolve their differences with the Marine Port and General Workers Union at the negotiating table.  That would be welcome. However, the fact is that intense negotiations have been taking place for the past four weeks at the labour relations committee.  While the deadline is 18 March I understand little progress has been made.  In fact, the parties concerned are nowhere near agreement despite the fact that the deadline of 18 March was set and despite the involvement of the labour relations committee.  Therefore this issue did not just come out of the blue; it has been like a time bomb.  Unfortunately, the difficulties and the differences have not been resolved.</P>
    <P>While there is still time for negotiations I am not hopeful.  It is very serious that 220 jobs are now at risk at Dublin port in Dublin Cargo Handling Limited.  A petition will go before the High Court on Friday for liquidation.  However there would still be a further ten days or so during which further negotiations could take place.  I appeal to all the parties involved to get together, to negotiate and compromise to have this issue resolved. The Labour Party Senators have called <Col N="1568" /> on the Minister to intervene.  If that would help it should certainly be considered. However, this can be determined as the negotiations proceed.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil amendment calls for the operation of the deep sea section on a viable, competitive and sustainable basis.  That is the key to our amendment. This is the core of the problem and many Senators have referred to it.  Dublin port is now a high cost port; business is being diverted to other ports as a result.  In this regard I refer particularly to the northern corridor, especially in Belfast.  The port will have to become competitive if it is to survive.  If Dublin port is ready for the completion of the Single European Market and European union, it must be asked if Ireland is ready for European union and all that involves.  We are not ready.</P>
    <P>Exports are vital to our economy. Many Senators have said that we are an island nation, dependent on foreign trade and on exports for our very survival as an economy.  New concepts, new ideas and new technology in the management of the port are needed if we are to survive. Management have clearly stated that Dublin port is overmanned and that it cannot afford this.  Dublin Cargo Handling Limited suffered losses of £22 million since their establishment 11 years ago and any negotiations must take these realities into account.</P>
    <P>There was a reference today in the local media to so-called &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; and restrictive practices which are underway in the running and management of Dublin port.  Quite frankly the general public cannot understand these so-called &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; practices.  They do seem unbelievable to the lay person. including myself.  I would have thought that paying people for jobs that simply are not being done cannot continue.  I say that as a lay person.  I do not understand the subtleties involved but these do-called &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; practices are difficult to comprehend.  In any negotiations I understand that redundancies would be voluntary, which is <Col N="1569" /> essential.  There should be no question of compulsory redundancies.  I hope that any proposed redundancies will be kept to an absolute minimum and there is scope for compromise on both sides.  That is something which should be looked at very carefully.</P>
    <P>I also gather that the whole question of the privatisation of Dublin Cargo Handling is now a <i>fait accompli,</i> that the five separate parts of the organisation will be sold.  I understand that that is not under negotiation.  I assume, therefore, that we have to accept that.  I know that the Dublin Port and Docks Board are a democratic organisation.  I know that there are representatives of the local authority, the Dublin Chamber of Commerce and ministerial appointments on the board.  I would have thought that, as far as companies go, the Dublin Port and Docks Board have a very democratic base, accountability to the public and elected representatives on the board.  The board this morning took a decision by vote, I assume, to go ahead with the petition to the High Court on Friday. Presumably, therefore, the vote was taken, people were for or against it, others abstained and the vote was carried. That democratic input must stand for something.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about jobs in Dublin. I am concerned about manufacturing jobs in the centre city areas.  I am concerned about service employment, particularly in the inner city areas as well. In that regard therefore, I want to raise also the recent decision by Irish Continental Line to award a tender for the overhaul of the <i>m.v. Leinster</i> to an English company, Wright and Veyer, which was a disgraceful decision.  I appeal to the Minister for the Marine to examine it and to take the issue up with Irish Continental Line to ensure that further ships are not sent abroad for servicing and overhaul. This is something that is crucial to the question of jobs in Dublin.  The Cathaoirleach will know that I raised this issue in <Col N="1570" /> the Seanad already on Wednesday, 26 February on the Adjournment.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about the future of the port.  I believe in Dublin port and I am concerned about jobs and the economic and commercial life of this city. This matter must be sorted out and there should be compromise on all sides. Redundancies must be kept to an absolute minimum.  There must no question of compulsion in relation to redundancies and, at all costs, a strike must be avoided. The last thing we need is for confidence to be undermined in Dublin port and in the commercial and economic life of this city. Again, I thank the Minister for his presentation. It makes for very stark reading and presents the issues in black and white.  I appeal to all sides to try to get a solution to the problems of Dublin port.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators and the Minister for their contributions.  I am glad Senator Haughey agrees that there should be ministerial intervention.  It certainly was not apparent from the amendment to the motion or from the Minister's own remarks that they even considered that possibility.  At least there is somebody on the other side of the House who feels that the Minister has a duty in this respect and should be available and willing to intervene.</P>

      <P>They are a party of independents who do not seem to make the same sort of statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree also with Senator Haughey.  It was a shame that, having got hold of the company, B &amp; I having been privatised <Col N="1571" /> over Christmas, the very first action of the Irish Continental Line was to send the <i>m.v. Leinster</i> to Birkenhead for overhaul, a contract of about £500,000, when the work could have been done equally well here &mdash; and had been done here over the last six years on an annual basis in the marine dockyard.  Clearly Senator Ryan has a brief only for the port and docks. Of course he is a member of the port and docks and that has come through clearly from his remarks.  It was a one sided presentation.  Indeed everything I have heard from the other side of the House was a one sided presentation which did not take the workers into consideration. They are the people who built up the port, who were exploited in the past, who have contributed blood, sweat and tears, generations of families have worked to build up the port to what it is today.  That was not referred to or even taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>The reference to the designed truckway of course was one proposed in terms of access to the port.  It proposed to go up along the North Circular Road through Cabra, an area that is already chock-a-block with traffic.  Even the Fianna Fáil members on the city council opposed it. Senator Ryan should get his facts right on that matter; it was not just the Labour members of the city council who opposed it, the members of the city council opposed it as a non-viable option.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister referred in his reply to the redundancy and rationalisation and the true cost, £16.2 million, of accumulated losses which includes £7.6 million in redundancy payments.  Quite clearly, a lot of money has been spent on redundancy payments and rationalisation and now it is proposed to spend a lot of other money on redundancies costing approximately £3 million.  We are talking about quite a valuable asset.  It seems strange that the response should now be to privatise this asset which has been rationalised and is effective and efficient. The crunch issue here is privatisation; it <Col N="1572" /> is at the heart of the problem.  It has been said that both sides have nothing in common and that the workers were not prepared to go anyway to meet the Dublin Port and Docks case.  That is not true.  The stumbling block is the precondition of privatisation.  If that precondition was removed, then negotiations would be successful.  It is astonishing for a Senator to speak about a <i>fait accompli.</i>  We have never discussed the matter.  The public are not aware that a decision has been taken and approved by the Government.</P>
    <P>Are we to take it now that the Government have unilaterally decided, without discussion and without bringing it before either House of the Oireachtas, to privatise Dublin Cargo Handling Limited? This is a very dangerous move because it seems to be privatisation by stealth.</P>
    <P>There is a hidden agenda in this.  I understand that members of the Dublin Port and Docks Board have already applied for licences.  From what I have heard here already I understand that licences are to be issued in four or five different areas.  Are the Government behind this privatisation proposal? Where is the initiative coming from?  An offer is being made which cannot be accepted because the precondition of privatisation makes negotiation impossible. How in God's name can negotiations take place between now and Friday?  Why can we not go along the road proposed by the union and the workers &mdash; that is, give the workers an equity share in the company &mdash; instead of handing over this valuable asset to the speculators out there?  We have already seen what has happened in the case of Greencore.  The speculators are waiting; they are circling around waiting for the opportunity to get at this company so that they can benefit from the financial rewards in terms of the grants and funding which will be made available from the EC in the years to come.</P>
    <P>One presentation of the case is that there are bad practices, the working practices in the port have not been updated <Col N="1573" /> and upgraded and the workers are the baddies; when there is a problem blame the workers.  The solution to the problem is to restructure, but what are we getting? Restructuring is being equated with privatisation. They are not equivalent in my mind but it is what we are getting from the Dublin Port and Docks Board and the Government.  Let us restructure the company and eliminate some of the practices that are in operation.  Let us ensure that there is agreement on the work practices and that this is done with the participation of the workforce.  The workforce should be given a stake in the company and in the future operation of the port.  If the workforce are prevented or precluded from doing this, then inevitably there will be confrontation, the adversarial activity will continue and this confrontation will lead to strike action. Indeed strike notice has already been served.  If we go down this road the port will be crippled, all sectors will suffer and the economy will suffer.  This will not just affect workers in the deep sea docking area.  As I said, members of the AEU and SIPTU will also be directly affected. Therefore, there could be an all-out strike in a very short space of time.</P>
    <P>If the Government and the Dublin Port and Docks Board are really serious about the issue it behoves them to ensure that there is a real breathing space and that a gun is not put to the heads of the negotiators on either side.  A decision should be taken not to go to the High Court for the petition on Friday.  The issue should be left open for a brief period of time so as to allow the Minister for Labour, the Minister for the Marine, the Marine Port and General Workers' Union and the Dublin Port and Docks Board to sit down <Col N="1574" /> and negotiate a compromise solution.  In order to do this the compulsory precondition of privatisation must be lifted. Privatisation is not restructuring; it is an extraneous solution that has been imposed for different reasons.</P>
    <P>As Senator Harte said earlier, the Government have always said that they will not privatise without consulting with the Oireachtas.  This is a case in point where privatisation is deliberately taking place.  We are told that the matter is a <i>fait accompli,</i> there is no opportunity to discuss it and there is no consultation.  It is a unilateral decision which has been taken with the blessing of the Government or initiated by the Government.  We on this side of the House believe the Government have not acted in good faith on this matter.  The only way the Government can show that they are acting in good faith is to open up the negotiations, make themselves available to participate in those negotiations and lift the precondition which has already been imposed.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take into consideration what we have said here about the future of the port and docks, the need for investment by the Government in the port and docks, the need to protect jobs and the need to protect communities in the north and south inner city who have already been devastated by unemployment. We believe that the problem can be solved if the participants are given the opportunity of sitting down at the negotiating table without preconditions and if the Minister for the Marine and the Minister for Labour are prepared to participate positively in the negotiations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Minster to the House.</P>
      <P>In this Adjournment Debate I call on the Minister, and through the Minister, the Minister for Health, to provide funds for the provision of a permanent residential accommodation unit for the old and infirm of Wexford town and surrounding area.</P>
      <P>The Minister is probably aware of the growing chorus of individuals, of families and of the Wexford Carers' Association pleading for the provision of such facilities in and around Wexford town.  We urgently need long-stay residential units for the elderly in that area so that they can remain close to their families and friends in their twilight years.  Wexford town and district area is the most populous area in the county and has a growing population of elderly, particularly within the borough.  There is an urgent need for long-stay beds in the immediate location of those requiring this facility.  At the moment people in need must travel either to St. John's Hospital in Enniscorthy or to the New Haughton Hospital or the Community Hospital in New Ross. Between them, those hospitals provide approximately 160 long-stay beds plus some rehabilitation and respite beds.  The hospitals give excellent care and attention to their patients.  The district hospital in Gorey supports the hospitals, particularly St. John's Hospital, with short-stay beds for patients awaiting long-stay beds.</P>
      <P>We have an excellent geriatric assessment team in our county.  While all long-stay beds are virtually always full, the team ensure that there is no undue delay in responding to the needs for a long-stay bed.  However, there is a waiting list, especially for female beds.  I suppose that statistically we live longer, so there are more women of an older age group around in need of institutional care when the family, for whatever reason, can no longer take care of them or when they are no longer able to have an independent existence of their own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The South Eastern Health Board, as the Minister is possibly aware, have a discussion document on services for the elderly.  This document is yet to be discussed and approved in part or in full <Col N="1577" /> by the Executive or the South Eastern Health Board.  The document suggests an increase in the bed units at St. John's Hospital in Enniscorthy.  I fully support that suggestion, because the beds are badly needed.  The document also points to the need to build a unit of 30 or so beds in Wexford town to provide a comprehensive geriatric service at that end of the county.</P>
    <P>Tonight I plead with the Minister for a commitment to immediate action on the provision in Wexford town of the facility I have outlined but it can be provided only if the Minister commits funding through the South Eastern Health Board specifically for such a unit.  At the moment the South Eastern Health Board have enormous demands on their annual funding.  Unless the Minister specifically earmarks moneys to give priority to what I am requesting, I am afraid we will be sitting in the queue for funds, along with the many others making demands on the South Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that Wexford General Hospital has a beautiful new surgical wing which is due to be opened shortly.  That will allow for the closure of the old surgical wing &mdash; or the old hospital as we have known it &mdash; which is a very fine, if somewhat outdated, building. Could the old hospital be converted into a unit for long-stay beds for our elderly?  I urge the Minister to seriously investigate that suggestion.  There would need to be lifts installed and the fire escape facilities updated, but it is a beautiful old stone building which, with some modification, would serve the purpose of providing a long-stay unit for our elderly.  The location of the old hospital would be ideal in that it is down town Wexford, an area quite accessible to the people in the south-east corner of our county.</P>
    <P>The Minister probably knows also of a development by Respond, a voluntary co-operative, through a capital assistance scheme under the social housing programme. The development will involve the construction of some 40 units of sheltered <Col N="1578" /> housing with communal facilities. We welcome the facilities, which will be located at Westlands in Wexford town. However, that development will cater for a different sector from the one I am talking of this evening.  I request specifically the provision of a long-stay residential unit for our old and infirm.</P>
    <P>I do not have to emphasise to the Minister either the need for family and friends to visit the old and the infirm once they can no longer lead an independent existence, and the paramount importance of that factor.  In rural Ireland we have little public transport.  Public transport is not on a regular daily basis and it is virtually impossible for people from the Killinick, Rosslare and Killanne areas of south Wexford and, indeed, Wexford town to make regular visits or visits at night to their elderly, be they in the New Haughton Hospital or the Community Hospital in New Ross or in St. John's Hospital in Enniscorthy.  In that regard, we are talking about round trips of 60 to 70 miles at minimum.  The Lions Club in Wexford provide an excellent transport service from Wexford town to St. John's Hospital in Enniscorthy.  They provide a voluntary bus every Tuesday night to allow those who do not have their own transport and cannot afford to pay for a taxi or to take advantage of the limited public transport that is available to at least once a week get to see their elderly in St. John's Hospital in Enniscorthy. The way in which we look after our elderly and our infirm is a test of civilisation.</P>
    <P>In January Wexford Corporation passed a motion which read:</P>
    <P>This Borough Council calls on the South Eastern Health Board to provide in Wexford Town a long-stay residential unit for the elderly.</P>
    <P>and</P>
    <P>That this Borough Council calls on the Minister for Health to immediately make funds available for the provision of permanent residential accommodation <Col N="1579" /> for the old and infirm of Wexford Town and surrounding area.</P>
    <P>The motions should have reached the Minister or, if not, they should have reached the new Minister for Health.  I ask the Minister to accede to the request of Wexford Corporation for the Minister for Health to receive a deputation to outline the urgent and existing need for this facility in Wexford town, having particular regard to the increasing population of elderly persons in our borough.</P>
    <P>I wish to conclude by reading extracts from just one letter I have received.  This comes from a lady in Killinick, County Wexford, and was written on 10 February of this year.  The woman writes:</P>
    <P>Dear Avril</P>
    <P>My mother is in great form and is very snug and cared for in the New Haughton Hospital in New Ross, but what I would like to know is when are we going to get a home of this kind in Wexford town or surrounding area.  It's a shame that people, all from the south end of Wexford, have to go to either New Ross or Enniscorthy.  Surely, with the new hospital opening in Wexford, a few wards could be opened up in the old hospital for the old people, to save people travelling to those other places. We can only visit my mother on a Sunday and how I would like to be able to visit her a few nights but I can't, because I don't drive a car.</P>
    <P>The letter continues:</P>
    <P>There are quite a number of people down this area, either in New Ross or Enniscorthy, and I've been talking to their relatives and they all feel the same as me.  Why shouldn't Wexford town have a home for the old folk?  Please see what you can do.</P>
    <P>I hate to see Mam so far away and I would love to visit her more often.  I know she misses us and I miss her a lot but I couldn't have looked after her <Col N="1580" /> any longer.  I'm just coming to now, getting out a bit and I'm not so tired.</P>
    <P>The woman signs off with a few pleasantries.  That lady has looked after her mother, who is nearly 90, all of her married life and for the past ten years her mother was confined to bed with Alzheimers Disease and various other complaints that elderly people often suffer from, such as incontinence.  In trying to care for her mother, the woman's own heart and health were broken.  Only at Christmas this year a geriatric assessment unit in Wexford got a long stay bed for this lady's mother.  She is not complaining. Her mother is getting excellent care in the new Haughton Hospital in New Ross.  Having had the mother live with her all her life and be able to see her now for an hour only on a Sunday afternoon is not satisfactory for either the family or the old person concerned.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that that is but a sample of the dozens of problems represented to myself and other Members of the Oireachtas; I am not unique in this.  Wexford town is the capital town of our county; Wexford town and district have a population of over 35,000 people; we have a huge visiting population, and many people from the banks and insurance companies retire to Wexford.  It is a very popular location in which to retire.  We have a growing population of elderly, particularly women, who need long stay beds.  Even though I compliment the health board, particularly the geriatric assessment team and the medical and nursing staff of the Haughton Hospital, New Ross, St. John's Hospital and the Community Hospital in Enniscorthy what we need for Wexford town and surrounding areas is a geriatric unit so that we can keep our own people in our own district, visiting them daily if possible.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister of State will have good news for us.  I urge him to ensure funds be made available to accede to this very reasonable request.  Furthermore I <Col N="1581" /> urge him to accede to my request on behalf of Wexford Corporation to meet a deputation so that our case can be put first hand to the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State for attending here this evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>May I express my personal appreciation of Senator Doyle's words of welcome to me here this evening.  I also want to take this opportunity to thank her for raising the issue and for affording me an opportunity to respond.</P>
      <P>As we are aware, responsibility for providing services for the elderly in Wexford town and surrounding areas in the first instance lies with the South-Eastern Health Board, who are currently considering a plan to develop services for the elderly, as recommended by the Report of the Working Party on Services for the Elderly, entitled <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly.</i>  I understand that a special board meeting has been arranged for 26 March at which that plan will be discussed in detail.</P>
      <P>At present, there are 255 long stay places available for the elderly of County Wexford in New Ross and in St. John's Hospital, Enniscorthy.  In addition, there are 266 places in private nursing homes, of which 42 are subvented by the health board and there are ten sheltered housing places.  According to the draft plan, there is an over-supply of long stay accommodation for the elderly in the county. The provision of long stay beds in the county, at 51 per 1,000 elderly people, is generous by comparison with the national average of 49.7 places per 1,000 elderly people.</P>

    <P>The draft plan proposed that a geriatrician will be appointed to Wexford General Hospital who would work closely with the existing assessment team for the elderly.  It proposes that the present rehabilitation unit at St. John's Hospital be increased to 34 beds to meet the norm recommended for rehabilitation <Col N="1582" /> in the document <i>The Years Ahead.</i> The plan proposes to develop a comprehensive geriatric hospital service in Enniscorthy and Wexford town.  It plans to replace existing, unsatisfactory accommodation at St. John's with two new 34-bed units.  In the longer term, it is proposed to build a 34-bed unit in Wexford town.  These units would provide convalescent, respite, terminal care and care for highly dependent patients.  These facilities will be in addition to the existing ones at the Haughton Hospital, New Ross, the Community Hospital, New Ross, and the District Hospital in Gorey.</P>
    <P>The plan refers to proposals to develop welfare accommodation for the elderly. <i>The Years Ahead</i> recommended that the elderlies' need for welfare accommodation be met in a variety of ways. One of the best ways of meeting that need is by sheltered housing schemes. These schemes are being provided throughout the county by voluntary housing groups with the help of grants from the Department of the Environment.  The South-Eastern Health Board inform me that a sheltered housing complex is being developed in Ramsgrange.  They understand that &ldquo;Respond,&rdquo; a voluntary housing agency, have plans for a further 40 units in Wexford town.  The board hope to see sheltered housing complexes developed adjacent to day centres for the elderly, with Gorey and Wexford town identified by the board as the priority areas.  I look forward to receiving the board's plan for the development of services for the elderly when finally agreed.</P>
    <P>As part of the Government's commitment to improving health services for the elderly as recommended by <i>The Years Ahead,</i> substantial additional funds were made available to the South-Eastern Health Board in 1990 and 1991.  These funds were repeated this year and amount to £846,276.  In 1990 the board used the funds to enhance community services for the elderly in line with the Minister's priorities.  The elderly in the South-Eastern Health Board area benefited <Col N="1583" /> from increased levels of home help, home nursing, day care, the introduction of a boarding-out scheme and the provision of additional paramedical staff. Last year, the board used the additional funding to open a 12-bed rehabilitation unit in Carlow, a unit for the elderly mentally infirm in Thomastown and to provide new day-care centres in Bagnelstown and Cappoquin.  This investment in services for the elderly has led to a substantial improvement in services for the elderly which I hope will be maintained.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity to point out to the Senator that for the past three years the South-Eastern Health Board have received a substantial proportion of the entire capital budget for general hospital developments, such as Ardkeen, Wexford and Kilkenny.  In 1991 the board received £17 million for projects, or 56 per cent of the national capital budget.  In 1992, the amount will be £15 million or 40 per cent of the budget.  This substantial amount of funding reflects the board's priority to improve the quality of their acute hospital accommodation.  As the elderly require acute hospital services more than other age groups, they will benefit greatly from the improved hospital services.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the substantial number of nursing home beds in County Wexford.  The South-Eastern Health Board subvent a proportion of these beds.  The Senator will be interested to know that my Department are at an advanced stage with preparations to implement the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990.  That Act provides for a new <Col N="1584" /> relationship between health boards and nursing homes.  The health boards will register nursing homes, both private and voluntary and will keep an eye on standards by six-monthly inspections.  The provisions of the Act will also enable a health board to pay a subvention towards the cost of care in a nursing home for a person they have assessed as needing nursing care and who cannot afford to pay for such care.  The Act will provide health boards with another option in meeting the needs of the dependent elderly, locally and flexibly.  It is my intention to implement the provisions of that Act later this year.</P>
    <P>Of course, I recognise that much remains to be done to improve services for the elderly in Wexford.  Health board mangement have outlined proposals to enhance services, hopefully, to be adopted by the board at their forthcoming special meeting.  I would ask the Senator on this occasion to accept the commitment of the Government to the development of services for the elderly in the south-east, as shown by the generous additional funding for services for the elderly provided in the last few years.</P>
    <P>When the board will have considered their plan that might be the most appropriate time for the deputation &mdash; as requested by the Senator here this evening &mdash; to be received in my Department. Probably it would be preferable were they to come with the plan already agreed by the board and by the staff of the South-Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 19 March 1992.</P>
