      <P>I have notice from Senator O'Toole that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The refusal of the Minister for Education to extend third level grants to those mature students who are already attending college and who were in expectation of receiving these grants which are now available to new students.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator O'Toole as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>On this day which sees the introduction of some of the reforms, I would like to wish the new experiment well.  Unfortunately, a matter has arisen which has caused great concern in, I think, all parts of the House, and may I briefly put the facts before you?  Last Thursday the Minister for Finance told the Dáil that this Chamber would be used for a new Dáil Committee on the Finance Bill; in fact, he thanked the Seanad for agreeing to this.  On the same day the Taoiseach and the Government Chief Whip told the political correspondents that the Seanad Chamber was to be used for a Dáil Committee.  I learned yesterday that the Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of next week had been planned for this Committee to use the Seanad Chamber and that the Seanad would meet on Thursday and Friday of next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Chathaoirligh, you know and we all know that the only body which can give permission for the use of this Chamber to any outside body is the Committee on Procedure and Privileges acting on behalf of the Seanad, and that in the past the Committee on Procedure and Privileges have been extremely sparing in giving the Chamber to any other group.  It happened for the British Irish Inter-parliamentary Body and it may happen soon for some committee of the European Parliament visiting this country, but in each case the decision was taken by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges acting on behalf of the Seanad.  What we have now is an apparent <i>fait accompli,</i> and a very discourteous one at that.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges have not yet met and on the only document I got about today's meeting, there is no mention of the Chamber being handed over to the Dáil for use and, even it it was, the decision taken already would indicate that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges is seen simply as a rubber stamp.  I object very strongly to this Chamber, which is the Chamber of a sovereign House of Parliament, being <Col N="735" /> used for a Dáil Committee.  I object to having the timetable of this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>You are making a speech, Senator.  I accept this matter is urgent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>It is urgent.  I think it would be in everyone's interests if I were allowed to have my say on this because the matter will not go away.</P>
      <P>I object to the timetable of this House being subverted to the needs of the other House.  There is no crisis about a committee room; there are plenty of committee rooms available in the House. There are only 14 Members on this particular committee.  Is it because there is television in this House and not in the others that we are being asked to make way for this committee?  I want to say on the record that it has been said to me that the Fine Gael Whip in the other House has agreed to this arrangement; first, it is none of his business and, second, he has not agreed to it.  I want to say categorically that there is no agreement of any sort.</P>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I am speaking to you because you are the protector of the rights of this House and the defender of its traditions.  You know that what is happening and the way in which it is happening is unacceptable to Members on all sides of this House.  I expect you, a Chathaoirligh, to oppose this proposal and I expect you to speak out on our behalf.  When you were elected, we welcomed your election.  We respect you, a Chathaoirligh, but we also have a right to expect that, on this issue, you will be the defender of this House, that you will speak for this House and that you will be joined in that by former holders of the office of Cathaoirleach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first day of the <Col N="736" /> new arrangements in this House it does not give me any pleasure to have to intervene on the Order of Business on a matter which is not relevant to the Order of Business and to appeal directly to you. I agree 100 per cent with the comments made by Senator Manning and I wish to be associated with them.  The Members of the Independent group feel the same sense of outrage.  We have a view that this not only demeans and diminishes this House in a most serious way, but it reduces and ridicules our role as an equal House of the Oireachtas and without a shadow of doubt it reduces it to a community centre.  This Chamber will be available for one thing next week; will it be available for a rock concert the following week?  One would have to question this at the end of the day.  The way it has been done has been shabby, unacceptable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Sound bite is what we are talking about here.  The only reason they are coming here is because there are television cameras here.  There are plenty of meeting rooms around the House.  I would say that this gives sustenance to those who are critical of this House.</P>
      <P>It is illogical and ridiculous that the Taoiseach can talk about extending the sitting times of the other House on the basis that he will interfere with the operation of this House.  As an elected Member of this House I would like to make it absolutely clear that if this House is operating as a Chamber next Wednesday, I will be here and I will want to know who has the constitutional right to keep me out of it.  I will certainly appeal to all my colleagues.  I am not speaking as a Member of the Opposition when I say this, I am not speaking as a Member of the Independent group, I am speaking as a Member of this House and I know there are many people on the other side of the House who share my views.  I am not sure whether they are in a position to articulate them or not but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, one of your predecessors, Senator Honan, did take a very strong stand when it was necessary to do so.  I do not want to embroil her in the argument.  I know there are people on all sides who share my view.  We will go back over the speeches of people who are standing for election who since last October have mouthed words around here on the role of the Seanad and see how this new arrangement fits in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I say at this point, before this issue is developed by any other Senator, that any request I receive for the use of the Seanad Chamber is brought before the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges?  I want to further clarify the situation for both Senators.  I have received a letter from the Minister for Finance requesting the use of the Seanad Chamber on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of next week for a meeting of the Special Committee on the Finance Bill, 1992. As both Senators are aware, there is a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges at 4 p.m. today.  That specific letter is included on the agenda for this afternoon's meeting and the matter can be decided by the members of the committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is fairly obvious from what you have said, a Chathaoirligh, that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges were simply being taken for granted by the Taoiseach and by the Members of the other House.  I want to say further that what is being proposed is, as far as I am concerned, totally unacceptable. <Col N="738" /> I think it is particularly regrettable that it happened today, the first day the new procedures are being introduced. If the reality is that the Finance Committee of the other House want to come in here simply because this Chamber has television cameras and sound facilities, it seems to me that that is reducing the behaviour and the deliberations of the Finance Committee to some derivative of show business.  I think it is extremely regrettable that a committee of the other House of this Parliament should be reduced to those terms and that those factors should be what determine where meetings are held.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Leader of the House who usurped the powers of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in indicating to either the Minister for Finance or whoever else that the Chamber would be available.  I think that is extremely important.  To my knowledge, over the years there have been three or four occasions where the use of the Chamber was sought and the House and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges resisted making the Chamber available, with the exception of one committee of the European Parliament and the meeting of the Anglo-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Group.  I am particularly aware of the fact that it is Finance who are the great usurper in our society.  They have usurped the powers of the Regional Fund and at a time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go over the same ground except to say that I could not agree more with what has been said by my collegues.  We have to <Col N="740" /> assume that the consent of the Seanad was taken for granted by the Government and that it was done so probably on the consent of a particular Senator or a number of Senators.  Despite what you have said about the Committee on Procedure and Privileges considering it, I cannot see how, after this flagrant and contemptuous disregard for the House, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges can possibly contemplate obsequiously endorsing what the Government already take as a <i>fait accompli.</i>  The position is absolutely untenable.</P>
      <P>To vary the menu somewhat, in regard to the Order of Business, I note we completed the Second Stage of the Electoral (No. 2) Bill on 4 March.  At the conclusion of Second Stage the Leader promised that the Remaining Stages would be taken in two or three week's time.  I am always astonished at the way in which legislation seems to vanish for weeks on end.  It is part of the mismanagement of legislation in this House that we have not been able to complete what is not a major Bill but one to which many of us have put down substantial amendments and are anxious that it should be dealt with expeditously.  It is two months since we debated Second Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been given an explanation.  I did not want to intervene in the debate but I came in early after Senators Manning and O'Toole to explain the position.  It is quite simple.  It will be discussed at 4 p.m. this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of that will you, Sir, as chair of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges be bringing recommendations back to this House so <Col N="741" /> that this House can decide?  May I also remind you of my own unhappy experience with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and the fact that there is a built-in Government majority which effectively makes it a rubber stamp and nothing else.  May I place on the record of the House the fact that the information that this Chamber was available was passed to the media, without the consent of the House, and that this House and you, Sir, have been treated with gross contempt by the Government.  May I place further on the record that if they want a row next Wednesday they will certainly get it, because not only Senator O'Toole but myself and many others will be in this Chamber to which we and we alone have the sovereign right of access. What occurred is either a contemptuous dismissal of the powers and role of the Seanad or an attempt to usurp the authority of the Oireachtas.  Had this happened under a former recently retired Taoiseach, there would be all kinds of talk about the threat to democracy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to tell Senator Farrell that a third teacher is about to express the same sentiments.  I welcome the Special Committee on the Finance Bill.  It is a good development, and it is a development in the right direction, but I find it totally unacceptable that there should be a unilateral decision made by the Dáil and by the Minister to presume <Col N="742" /> that they can use this Chamber on a day when we would properly be sitting.  They have compromised us; they have informed the media and there seems to have been a certain amount of co-operation and co-ordination from some sectors in this House as well.  I find that totally unacceptable.  The only interpretation I can put on the letter you have before you, a Chathaoirligh, is that that is in the form of a request or a recommendation and that it must go to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in that vein because it is up to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of this House to make a decision when and how the Chamber is to be used.  I hope whatever approach has been taken hitherto that, when the Committee on Procedure and Privileges meet at 4 p.m. today it will be left to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to make the decision arising out of the sentiments that have been expressed in this House on the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Labour Party motion No. 14 on the Order Paper &mdash; the Prison Reform Bill, 1992 &mdash; I seek leave to introduce it and to have it printed and I ask the Leader of the House to accede to that request.</P>
      <P>I would refer also to motion No. 24 on the Supplementary Order Paper.  While certain sections of that motion have been dealt with &mdash; we have raised it in the House on a number of occasions in relation to the presidential pardon for Nicky Kelly &mdash; section 3 has not been dealt with.  I ask the leader to elicit from the Minister for Justice whether he will seek to implement the findings of the Barra O/Briain and the Martin reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I wish to raise a matter which Senator Murphy mentioned &mdash; the disappearance of certain Bills from the Order Paper.  The Electoral Bill has been introduced in the Seanad and I expected that we would be dealing with it without a major elapse of time.  I wish to know where that has gone.  There are also the Education Bills: what has happened to the recent colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology Bills?  Are we going to have the Green Paper on Education, <Col N="743" /> and when can we have a debate on the matter?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Costello can only seek to have item No. 14 included in the Order of Business at this stage.  The House can only decide on the introduction of the Bill if it has already agreed that item No. 14 is to be included in the Order of Business.  If the Senator wants to pursue this matter now he should move an amendment to the Order of Business to seek to have this item included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That Item No. 14 be included in the Order of Business.&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief.  Like you, Sir, I take this House very seriously and like you, Sir, I have been here for a considerable number of years.  I hope like you, Sir, I am outraged that people would treat you with this sort of disrespect because in many ways you are the personification of this House.  Those who informed the media last week that they could apparently do what they wished in this House were treating you, Sir, with a considerable lack of respect.  I can assure you that if Members of this House made similar statements about the other House, there would be a very serious investigation and there would be threats of all sorts of punishments for contempt of Dáil Éireann, and quite correctly so. It is up to you, in the interests of the office you hold and in the interests of this House, to remind other people that this House has a constitutional standing that is not given to us by Dáil Éireann, that it is given to us by the people of Ireland, and that perceptions and presumptions that certain people may have about this House are their own private opinions. The facts are that Seanad Éireann is instituted under the same Constitution that instituted Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann has the same rights and privileges under that Constitution that the people gave us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to ask you very clearly, a <Col N="744" /> Chathaoirligh, is it a decision that the Committee on Procedures and Privileges will take this afternoon, or is it a decision to make a recommendation to this House, because it is still unclear whether the Committee have the power, or if you believe they have the power to decide to disrupt the business of this House next week by calling off a sitting of the Seanad next Wednesday in order to hand the Chamber over to another House of the Oireachtas?  I am not sure that any Committee of this House, even one as powerful and as important as the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, have the right to hand over this Chamber to another body which has no constitutional claim to it and that they can do that without the approval of this House.  I very much doubt if the Members of this House would subscribe to such a view.  It is a pity that the silence of Members opposite &mdash; many of whom are jealous in their protection of this House, life long career Senators, and who have worked hard in this House on this side when they were in Opposition and on that side when they were in Government &mdash; could be interpreted as consent to the presumption in this House that was made by Members of Dáil Éireann last week.  I would like to invite them, either now or on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, to let the views I know they have be known vigorously and to ensure that this sort of presumption is dealt with in the only way it should be, that is, with contempt and with a firm and vigorous refusal.</P>

Ceann de na fáthanna go bhfuil moill leis an mBille un Thoghcháin ná go bhfuiltear ag iaraidh Gaeilge a chur air le mise a shásamh, <Col N="745" /> de réir mar a thuigim.  Ní domsa atá mé ag iarraidh é seo ach don Teach agus do mhuintir na hÉireann uilig.

      <P>I did not intend to speak today, but since it was the first day of reform I thought the Order of Business would be much more streamlined than in the past.  We have had speeches on an issue which is yet to be decided by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and I wonder about the relevance of that debate.  That having been said, now that I have the floor I thought it would be important that we talk about reform of the Seanad.  One of the things we are trying to achieve is that the Seanad would be more streamlined and effective and that we would bring legislation on-stream much faster than in the past.</P>
      <P>I disagree vehemently with Senator O'Toole when he said that holding the Special Committee on the Finance Bill in this Chamber would liken this House to a community hall.  I think that is undeserving of this House.  I am surprised he would make that point on one of the most important Bills that will be introduced in this House.  It is regrettable that he would liken that to taking it into a community hall.  In the past we have had on many occasions the Opposition indicating to us that the guillotine had been used on legislation.  On this occasion we have a massive Finance Bill, one of the biggest ever, and the Minister for Finance has now sent to you, a Chathaoirligh, a letter asking that this Chamber would be used to facilitate the Committee Stage of that Bill through the first House of the Oireachtas.  I do not think there is anything regrettable about that.  It is something that we should look at seriously, deal with seriously and accommodate as far as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could I urge the Members of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges today, given the importance of the Finance Bill, to accommodate the other House?  I know this may discommode <Col N="746" /> many of the Independent Members here. Given that we might lose out on next Wednesday's sitting if this proposal is agreed to, could the Leader of the House give us an assurance that we will sit Thursday and Friday next to ensure that Seanad business would not be disrupted?</P>
    <P>Could the Leader indicate when the debate on air transport is likely to take place?  We in Cork find we are not operating from a level playing pitch <i>vis-a-vis</i> other international airports in this country.</P>

      <P>I wish to associate myself with remarks made on this side of the House about the implied insult to the Seanad of this decision.  It is easy to say it is going to be discussed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges this afternoon but we all know that the decision has been taken already; obviously there has been agreement.  I have accused Members on that side of being ciphers and cockatoos, and great exception was taken to it.  Could I now appeal to them to prove that that is not the case by taking a united stand on this, saying they will not allow the Seanad to be insulted in this way; then there will be no problem for any individual Senator.  I would ask Senators to make it clear this afternoon at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges that they will not succumb to the party Whip on this matter but will stand firmly against it as a united House.</P>

      <P>So much for the abbreviated Order of Business.  I support what Senator McGowan said.  It would be appropriate if this House were given a say in this matter.  I would like the Leader to reveal whether the decision of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges will be brought here for ratification or discussion; it is a fundamental question. It might have been precipitate to rule out Senator McGowan's reasonable suggestion that we discuss it in this House; I am sorry you decided to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like, a Chathaoirligh, to beg your indulgence to mention something on this matter; others have had a great deal of indulgence as well.  I remember a past official of this House who was steeped in its traditions saying to me when I asked about the political nature <Col N="748" /> of this House that the Seanad makes its own rules and decisions.  That was taught to me as the fundamental discipline and privilege of this House.  If I have learned one thing today it is that the goodwill that existed here evinced in reforms before this House, although of a minor nature, has already been sunk by the Government's contempt for Seanad traditions.</P>
    <P>I ask the Leader of the House whether he takes orders from outside this House, whether he consults with people from the other House about Seanad decisions and business and whether he takes directions from the Taoiseach or Chief Whip of the governing party as to what comes before this House.  I suspect that he does.  What we see here today is evidence that decisions about what happens and what is discussed here and when we sit are being made elsewhere; the Seanad is simply a rubber stamp for political decisions made by another House and by other Members of the Government Party elsewhere.</P>

There are two separate issues here: one is the right of the House to decide the day and time it will assemble, and the other is the use of this room.  When we debated Seanad reform here over several weeks there were repeated calls from all sides of the House to have this Chamber used more extensively &mdash; to give access to MEPs and to distinguished visitors &mdash; and if this room as such can be used to advance the legislation of the State effectively, then that should be done.</P>

I accept the Cathaoirleach's explanation of the situation as he sees it, and that the matter will be discussed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges this afternoon.  However, I am disappointed that you fell short of announcing that you would report back to this House on the decision of the Committee of Procedure and Privileges.  As Senator Dardis said, it is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to decide but this Chamber is more important than Senator Dardis makes out today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Seanad is more than a room and when a country begins to downgrade its parliament, they are on the road to anarchy. I do not want to see that happen.  I appeal you, a Chathaoirligh, to announce before the Leader's reply to the Order of Business that you will report to this House <Col N="750" /> and provide an opportunity for all Senators to debate that decision.  Let the House make the decision rather than the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. It appears to me that the decision that is going to be rubberstamped by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges has already been made.  From the offerings from the other side of the House there is no doubt that they have taken a stand already.  I will be disappointed a Chathaoirligh, if you go along with that and I am disappointed with the Government Senators who support the decision which has been taken completely out of our hands.  Will you inform the House that you will come back at 6 p.m. or 7 p.m. or at some other hour, to inform us of the decision?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn) Pádraig Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill regulates the exercise by the Minister for Justice of his power to authorise the interception of postal packets and telecommunications messages.  For brevity I shall refer to postal packets as letters and to telecommunications messages as telephone calls, though the former include, for example, parcels and the latter include, for example, telegrams and telex messages.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides that the purposes &mdash; and the only purposes &mdash; for which the Minister may authorise interceptions shall be those of criminal investigation and the security of the State.  It also sets out in detail the procedure that must be followed before an interception can be authorised, and it introduces two new provisions for controlling the exercise of the Minister's powers in this respect.  One of these is for the operation of the Act to be kept under review by a judge of the High Court; the other is for the appointment of a legally qualified referee to investigate complaints of improper authorisation by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I must first say something as to the justification for the system of authorised interceptions.  The system embodies the reconciliation of two important principles. The first is the privacy of correspondence and telephone calls; the second is the need to combat crime and subversion.</P>
      <P>Little needs to be said as to the importance of preserving the privacy of communications.  If you post a letter, you expect it to be delivered unopened to your correspondent; if you make a telephone call, you do not usually want third parties to listen to it.  Indeed, it is not too much to say that it is one of the features of life in a free country that people should be able to write to other people, or speak to them on the telephone, without their letters or telephone calls being intercepted. Interception of letters or telephone calls, except under lawful authority, is an offence under sections 84 and 98, respectively, of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it has always been recognised that the importance of combating serious crime of subversive activities is so great that it should prevail, in strictly limited circumstances, over the principle of privacy.  For example, the gardaí may have information that a kidnapping has been planned or that a large quantity of dangerous drugs, or of arms and explosives, is about to be imported or moved, and there may be good reason to believe that the final arrangements are going to be made by telephone calls between some of the persons involved.  If the telephone calls could be listened to, this might provide a link in the investigations which would enable the crime to be prevented <Col N="755" /> or detected.  In fact, the European Court of Human Rights has accepted that and I quote, &ldquo;the increase of crime and particularly the growth of organised crime, the increasing sophistication of criminals and the ease and speed with which they can move about have made telephone interception an indispenable tool in the investigation and prevention of serious crime&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is because of the conflict between the need to preserve the privacy of postal and telephone communications in general and the need to allow them to be intercepted in particular circumstances that the system of interception under the authority of a warrant by the Minister for Justice has been established.  The actual interceptions are carried out by the appropriate officials of An Post and Bord Telecom on foot of direction under section 110 of the 1983 Act, but in every case there must be a warrant by the Minister for Justice authorising the interception by reference to the address or telephone number in question.  Thus the Minister has cast on him the disagreeable duty of deciding whether the need to combat crime or subversion obliges him to authorise the official opening of people's correspondence or eavesdropping on their telephone calls.</P>
    <P>In order to reconcile the claims of privacy and the need to combat serious crime or subversion, successive Governments have laid down certain conditions which have to be fulfilled before the Minister for Justice may issue a warrant authorising an interception.  Solemn assurances have been given to Dáil Éireann that these conditions will be adhered to. The primary condition has been that a warrant should be issued only when the Minister is satisfied that the interception is required for the prevention or detection of serious crime or for security purposes and that information for the purposes in question cannot be got in any other way, but it has also been an essential condition that warrants should be issued only on an application by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána or the appropriate Army officer.  I mention <Col N="756" /> these matters in order to explain the safeguards under which the system of warrants is operated.</P>
    <P>Apart from the intrinsic merits of placing our interception system on a statutory basis, it is also necessary to do so owing to the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Malone against the United Kingdom.  The court held that the tapping of Malone's telephone was in violation of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights in that the interference was not &ldquo;in accordance with the law&rdquo;.  In order to comply with that Convention, the conditions for the authorisation of interceptions should be laid down by law; it is not sufficient that they should be the subject of undertakings by the Executive.</P>
    <P>The European Court of Human Rights held also in the Malone case that there had been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention in another respect.  This was on account of the process known as &ldquo;metering&rdquo;, which consists of the use of a device which registers the number dialled on a particular telephone and the time and duration on each call.  This process was designed mainly for the purpose of ensuring that subscribers were correctly charged, investigating complaints and the like, but the Post Office did on occasion provide the police with information obtained from metering when this was necessary for police inquiries in relation to serious crime.  The court held that the existence of the practice, unregulated by law, constituted a violation of Article 8.</P>
    <P>There is one other provision of the European Convention on Human Rights, Article 13, that I should mention, because it, like Article 8, is directly relevant to the Bill.  Article 13 reads as follows:</P>
    <P>Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in this Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.</P>
    <P>Malone submitted that no domestic remedy was available for the breaches of <Col N="757" /> Article 8 of which he complained and that, consequently, there has also been a violation of Article 13.  The court held that, having regard to its decision on Article 8, it was not necessary to rule on the issue of Article 13.</P>
    <P>The present Bill takes full account of the requirements of the provisions of the Convention on Human Rights.  First, it sets out in detail the conditions under which the power of the Minister for Justice to authorise interceptions is to be exercised and regulates the procedure for the issue of authorisations; as a result interceptions will be carried out only &ldquo;in accordance with law&rdquo; in the sense in which that phrase was interpreted by the court and, of course, only to the extent permitted by Article 8.  Second, it ensures that information obtained from metering it not disclosed save as permitted by Article 8.  Third, it provides for &ldquo;an effective remedy before a national authority&rdquo;, as required by Article 13, for a person whose rights under Article 8 are violated.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the provision of the Bill. There is a good deal of detailed explanation in the explanatory memorandum which was circulated with the Bill which I need not repeat.  I shall take the sections in order, except that I shall refer to the more important of the definitions in section 1 when speaking of the provisions in which the expressions defined occur. Also, the Bill is similar in many respects to the Bill presented to the Dáil in 1985 but which was never debated and to the Private Members' Bill presented in 1990. There are differences; some of these are no more than drafting changes and some are made necessary by the passage of time.  However, there are some substantive changes and I will explain the reasons for these when I come to the provisions in which the changes occur.</P>
    <P>The only definition in section 1 to which I need refer at this point is that of &ldquo;interception&rdquo;.  This definition is fundamental to the Bill.  Stated briefly, &ldquo;interception&rdquo; means opening a letter or listening to, or recording, a telephone call, except that in the case of a telephone call the definition will not apply in a case where either a party to the call has consented <Col N="758" /> to the listening or recording.</P>
    <P>Section 2, read with section 3, lays down the fundamental requirements of the Bill that interception of letters and telephone calls may take place only in accordance with an authorisation given by the Minister for Justice and that the only purposes for which the Minister may give an authorisation are those of criminal investigation or of the security of the State.  The reason I said that section 2 had to be read with section 3 is that the actual interceptions will, as I said they are at present, be carried out by An Post or Bord Telecom, as the case may be, in accordance with directions by the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications.  These directions are given under section 110 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, and what section 3 of the present Bill does is to provide that a direction by that Minister, if it is one requiring an interception, shall be given or remain in force only if and for so long as there is in force an authorisation by the Minister for Justice applying to the interception.  An authorisation by the Minister for Justice must be given by a written warrant signed by him except that in a case of exceptional urgency he may give it orally in the first instance, but in that case he must confirm it by a written warrant as soon as may be.  As I have already mentioned, under the 1983 Act it is already a criminal offence for anybody, whatever his position, to carry out an interception that is not authorised as mentioned in the Act; and this will still be the case when the Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>I stress the requirement that the only purposes for which an interception may be authorised will be those of criminal investigation or the security of the State. These are the same restrictions as have been established by governmental undertakings in the past.  It is also important to note that under section 2 the power to authorise interceptions will be much more restrictive against the Executive than is required under the European Convention on Human Rights; for under Article 8 of the Convention interference with the right of privacy for correspondence <Col N="759" /> is permitted if it is &ldquo;necessary in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.&rdquo;  Thus of all the grounds for authorising interception on which the Convention permits governments to rely, we shall be relying on only two &mdash; national security and the prevention of crime.</P>
    <P>Section 2 includes other provisions restricting the power of the Minister for Justice to issue a warrant.  Read with sections 4 and 5 it restricts the cases in which warrants may be issued for the purpose of criminal investigation and the security of the State respectively; this restriction is that the Minister shall not give an authorisation unless he considers that the particular conditions laid down in sections 4 and 5 respectively stand fulfilled.  Under section 2 the Minister must also consider that there has been no contravention of the procedure which under section 6 must be observed before he may issue the warrant.  The warrant will have to include a positive statement that these requirements have been complied with.  I shall speak of sections 4, 5 and 6 in a moment.</P>
    <P>First, I will mention the other provisions of section 2.  The warrant will specify the relevant postal address or telephone number; in the case of a postal address it will also limit the authorisation to particualr addresses unless the Minister considers that this would be prejudicial to the purposes of the proposed interception.  A warrant will remain in force for a maximum period of three months but may be renewed for similar periods provided that the same conditions as justified the original issue are fulfilled.  The Minister may, before deciding whether to issue or renew a warrant in a particular case or in a case of any particular class, consult the judge of the High Court who, as I mentioned at the beginning, will have the duty of keeping the operation of the legislation under review.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="760" /> Section 4 sets out the conditions which the Minister for Justice must consider to stand fulfilled in order to justify him in issuing a warrant authorising interception for the purpose of criminal investigation. The offence or suspected offence being investigated must be a &ldquo;serious offence&rdquo; as defined in section 1.  This means that it must fulfil both the following requirements. First, it must be an offence punishable with at least five years' imprisonment. Second, it must involve loss of human life, serious personal injury, serious loss of or damage to property, or a risk of this; or it must result, or be likely to result, in substantial financial gain; or the facts and circumstances must make the offence a specially serious one of its kind.  The investigations already being undertaken must have failed, or be likely to fail, to produce, or to produce sufficiently quickly, the required information or evidence sufficient for the purpose of a prosecution, and there must be a reasonable prospect that the proposed interception will help to provide such information or evidence.</P>
    <P>In the case of an offence apprehended but not committed, the last of the conditions I have mentioned will be that there is a reasonable prospect that the proposed interception will be of help in preventing the commission of the offence or in detecting it if it is committed.  In addition to these conditions, it will also be necessary &mdash; and I stress this particularly &mdash; that the importance of obtaining the information or evidence concerned is in all the circumstances, and notwithstanding the importance of preserving the privacy of letters and telephone calls, sufficient to justify the interception.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Minister for Justice will have to take a considered decision, in each case, after balancing the claims of privacy for communications and those of criminal investigation, before deciding that the needs of criminal investigation must prevail.  Only if he so decides will he have power to issue a warrant.</P>
    <P>Section 5 sets out the conditions which the Minister for Justice must consider to stand fulfilled in order to justify him in <Col N="761" /> issuing a warrant authorising interceptions in the interests of the security of the State.  In this case the Minister must consider that &ldquo;there are reasonable grounds for believing that particular activities that are endangering or likely to endanger the security of the State are being carried on or are proposed to be carried on&rdquo;.  Moreover, the section requires that other conditions, similar to those that apply under section 4 in the case of warrants for the purpose of criminal investigation must, in the Minister's opinion, stand fulfilled.</P>
    <P>Section 6 sets out the procedure that must be gone through before the Minister may issue a warrant authorising an interception. This is not a mere technical matter as procedural provisions sometimes are: on the contrary, it is vital to the legislation.  The purpose of the procedure laid down in the section, which complements sections 4 and 5, is to secure that warrants are issued only in furtherance of investigations already in existence. Neither the Minister nor officials of his Department will be able to initiate the process leading to an interception.  If the purpose of the proposed interception is that of criminal investigation, the process will have to be initiated by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.  If the purpose is that of the security of the State, the process will have to be initiated by either the commissioner or the appropriate military officer of the rank of colonel or above designated by the Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>The commissioner or the designated officer will have to make an application in writing containing sufficient information to enable the Minister to determine whether the relevant conditions stand fulfilled.  The application will be sent or given to an officer of the Department of Justice nominated by the Minister for the purposes of the Act.  An application by the designated military officer will require to be accompanied by a supporting recommendation by the Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>The nominated officer of the Minister will consider the application and make a written submission to the Minister stating <Col N="762" /> whether in his opinion the relevant conditions under the Act for the issue of a warrant stand fulfilled or, if not, then in what respects they fail to do so.  The decision whether to issue a warrant will, of course, be that of the Minister himself. Section 6 formalises the procedure for application for warrants and for the rigorous scrutiny of such applications.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides a particular procedure for the ending of an authorisation for interception in a case where interceptions are no longer required for the purposes for which they were authorised. The Minister will, of course, be able to cancel a warrant at any time and, indeed, as I will mention in a moment, he will have a statutory duty to do so in certain circumstances.  Section 7 provides for termination, without any action by the Minister, in a situation where the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána or the designated military officer considers that interceptions authorised by a warrant are no longer required.  This may be because all the information wanted has already been obtained or because the interception is not producing information of sufficient value and is unlikely to do so. If the commissioner or the designated officer considers that the interception is no longer required, he will without delay inform the nominated officer of the Minister for Justice, that officer will without delay inform the person to whom the warrant is addressed and the warrant will then immediately cease to be in force. No formal cancellation by the Minister will be required.  The procedure under the section will be another safeguard to ensure that interceptions are kept to the minimum necessary for the purpose for which the power is conferred.</P>
    <P>I now come to the two wholly new provisions which, as I mentioned at the beginning, the Bill introduces for the purposes of controlling the exercise by the Minister of his power to authorise interceptions.  The two new provisions are contained in sections 8 and 9.  These sections serve quite different purposes. Section 8 provides for a judge to keep the operation of the Act generally under review, irrespective of any complaint by <Col N="763" /> a member of the public as to how it is operated; section 9 provides a procedure under which a person who believes that his letters or telephone calls have been intercepted may have the matter investigated and may obtain redress if it is found that the interception, if it took place, was improperly authorised.  I shall now describe the two procedures in more detail, prefacing my account with a reminder that the sections deal only with interceptions where there has been a warrant issued by the Minister.  The sections are not concerned with illegal interceptions, which are a matter to be dealt with by the prosecuting authorities and the courts.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that the Government shall designate a judge of the High Court to carry out the duty, if he accepts the invitation to do so from the President of the High Court, of keeping the operation of the Act under review and ascertaining whether its provisions are being complied with.  The judge's duty will include that of reporting to the Taoiseach at intervals of not more than two years on the general operation of the Act and from time to time on any matters that the judge considers should be reported.  The judge will have power to investigate any case in which an authorisation has been given.  It will be for him to decide what numbers of cases he should investigate in order to determine whether the Act is being complied with.  For the purpose of his functions he will have access to, and may inspect, any official documents relating to an authorisation or the application for it.  Further, any person who was concerned in the giving of an authorisation or in the application for it, or has any information relevant to these matters, will be required to give to the judge, if requested by him, all the relevant information in his possession.</P>
    <P>The result of these provisions will be that the judge will be able to select for investigation, whether at random or otherwise, any case in which an authorisation has been given, that he will be able to examine all the official documents relevant to the case and that he will be <Col N="764" /> able to require any person to give him any information in his possession concerning the case.  This means that the judge will be able to examine not only the documents, without exception, concerning the case in the Department of Justice but also all those in the possession of the Garda Síochána, the Department of Defence, An Post or Bord Telecom or any other official document that may be relevant to the investigation.  He will thus be able to trace every warrant to its source, and no official or other person will be able to object on the ground of secrecy, confidentiality or any other ground to giving him any relevant information.  So the whole process will be subject at all times to scrutiny by the judge.  Under section 11 (1) all the official documents relevant to an authorisation or the application for it will have to be preserved for at least three years.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that the designated judge will make reports to the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach will be required to cause copies of all these reports to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. The reports will be laid in full except that, if the Taoiseach considers that the publication of any matter in a report would be prejudicial to the prevention or detection of crime or to the security of the State, he may exclude that matter from the copies of the report as laid, but before deciding to exclude any matter he will have to consult the designated judge, and every report when laid will have to be accompanied by a statement as to whether any matter has been excluded from it.  Apart from these formal reports the designated judge will, if he thinks it desirable, be able to communicate with the Taoiseach or the Minister on any matter concerning interceptions.</P>
    <P>There are three other important provisions designed to strengthen the supervisory role which the designated judge will play in relation to interceptions. First, section 8 (6) provides that, if the judge informs the Minister that he considers that a particular authorisation should not have been given or should, because of circumstances arising subsequently, be cancelled, or that it should <Col N="765" /> not have been renewed, the Minister shall, as soon as may be, inform the Minister for Communications and shall then cancel the authorisation.  Second, there is the provision in section 2 (7) that the Minister may consult the designated judge before deciding whether to give or renew an authorisation in any particular case or in a case of any particular class. Third, section 9 (6) gives the designated judge, in certain circumstances which I shall mention when I come to deal with section 9, the function of determining whether the Minister was right in considering that a particular offence was a serious offence as defined in section 1.</P>
    <P>Before leaving section 8 I would like to mention the differences between it and the 1985 Bill.  The reference to a judge of the Supreme Court has been deleted. On consideration it has been decided that it would be inappropriate for a judge of the Supreme Court to undertake these duties.  Also in the Bill, the President of the High Court will invite, after consultation with the Minister, a High Court judge to undertake the duties specified in the section.  If the judge accepts the invitation the Government will designate him for the purposes of the Act.  It is more appropriate that the initial invitation come from the President of the High Court rather than the Government having regard to the president's duties in regard to the allocation of business among judges of the High Court.  Having regard to the duties which would be imposed under section 8, it is the intention of the President of the High Court that the designated judge would not take part in criminal trials or appeals.</P>
    <P>Sections 9 and 10, which are to some extent interlocked and which I must admit are complicated in places, are intended to secure two objects which in the nature of things cannot be easily reconciled &mdash; hence the complications.  The first object is that, although the question whether an authorisation should be issued in a particular case must be for the Minister's decision, it is right that a person who believes that his letters or telephone calls have been intercepted and that the Minister was not justified by <Col N="766" /> the Act in authorising the interception should be able to have the matter investigated and to obtain redress if this is the case.  The second object which must be achieved is that of maintaining, as far as possible, the secrecy of interceptions.  It is obvious that persons suspected of complicity in crime or subversive activities should not be able merely by instituting legal proceedings to discover whether their communications have been intercepted. If this were possible, the whole purpose of authorising interceptions &mdash; that of combating crime and subversion &mdash; would be frustrated.</P>
    <P>Briefly, the solution adopted by the Bill is to provide that a breach of the provisions of the Act will not enable a person affected to take proceedings in the courts, except for a cause of action that is an infringement of a constitutional right to privacy.  Instead, he will be able to have the matter investigated by a legally qualified complaints referee equipped with all the necessary powers, including power to quash the authorisation and award compensation to the complainant.</P>
    <P>Senators will notice a significant difference between section 9 (1) in the 1985 Bill and section 9 (1) in the present Bill. Since the 1985 was prepared the High Court has held that the unenumerated personal rights guaranteed by the Constitution include a right to privacy in respect of telephone conversations and the right to hold such conversations without deliberate, conscious and unjustified interference and intrusion by servants of the State.  The court said that the right to privacy was not an unqualified right.  Its exercise might be restricted by the constitutional rights of others and was subject to the requirements of the common good and to public order and morality.</P>
    <P>I have been advised that, in the light of that decision, there would be a risk of a successful constitutional challenge to the Bill if it were enacted including section 9 (1) of the 1985 Bill which sought to preclude a cause of action for a breach of the provisions of the Act.  I have, therefore, amended section 9 (1) so as to make that provision inapplicable to a cause of <Col N="767" /> action where such a breach also constitutes a breach of an individual's constitutional rights.</P>
    <P>Section 9 also sets up the office of complaints referee.  In the 1985 Bill the complaints referee procedure was provided for as an alternative to a cause of action in a court for a breach of a provision of the Act.  Even though, as I just mentioned, an action for such a breach where it also constitutes a breach of a constitutional right will be possible, I propose nevertheless to retain the complaints referee procedure as a simple, inexpensive and easily availed of remedy which will be open to aggrieved persons as an additional safeguard.</P>
    <P>The holder of the office of complaints referee will be a judge of the Circuit or District Court or a practising barrister or solicitor of not less than ten years' standing.  I need not go into the details as to his tenure of office except to say that he will hold office for a term of five years and will be eligible for re-appointment and that, while he may resign at any time, he may be removed only for stated misbehaviour or incapacity and upon resolutions passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas calling for his removal. The conditions as to when the referee may be removed from office will thus be similar to the conditions for the removal of a judge from judicial office, so the referee will be wholly independent in the exercise of his office.</P>
    <P>Any person who believes that a letter sent to or by him, or a telephone call made to or by him, has been intercepted after the commencement of the Act in the course of its transmission will be able to apply to the complaints referee for an investigation.  The referee, unless the complaint appears to him to be frivolous and vexatious, will then investigate whether there was a relevant authorisation in force at the material time.</P>
    <P>If the referee concludes that there was no relevant authorisation in force at the material time, then he will simply give notice in writing to the complainant that there was no contravention of the Act <Col N="768" /> and that will be the end of the matter. As I have explained, the referee will be concerned only with breaches of the Act and if he finds there was no authorisation under the Act there will be no occasion for him to acquire whether there was an unauthorised interception because, if there was no authorisation, there was no breach of the Act.  To require the referee, in a case where there was no warrant, to go on to inquire whether there was an interception would saddle him with the functions of criminal investigation because, as I have pointed out, the interception would be an offence.</P>
    <P>If, on the other hand, the referee concludes that there was an authorisation in force at the material time, then he will have the important task of investigating whether there was a contravention of any of the relevant provisions of the Act in relation to the authorisation.  This means that the referee will have to investigate whether the authorisation was lawfully issued, whether the application for it was made and dealt with in the required manner, whether interceptions were continued in contravention of the Act after the appropriate authority had reported that they were no longer required and whether the Minister failed to cancel an authorisation after the designated judge had informed him that in his opinion it should not have been issued or renewed or should be cancelled.</P>
    <P>If the referee concludes that there was a contravention such as I have mentioned, he will notify the applicant in writing of his conclusion and make a report of his findings to the Taoiseach. He will also have extensive powers to order redress for the applicant.  He will have power to quash the authorisation and direct the destruction of all copies of the communications intercepted pursuant to the authorisation; and owing to the definition of &ldquo;copy&rdquo; in section 1, such a direction will apply also to any transcript, extract or summary of a communication or any tape on which it is recorded and to any record of the identities of the parties to the communication, for example, an envelope in which an intercepted letter was sent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="769" /> Further, the referee will have power to recommend that the applicant should be paid a specified sum by way of compensation for the wrong done to him in having had his communications intercepted, and the Minister will be required by the section to pay the compensation recommended.  Any notification to the applicant or report to the Taoiseach will have to state the effect of any order made by the referee such as I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Section 9 includes a special provision &mdash; this is in subsection (6) &mdash; in relation to the question whether, in the case of an authorisation for the purpose of criminal investigation, the offence in question is a &ldquo;serious offence&rdquo; within the definition of that expression to which I referred earlier.  The Minister will not be empowered to give an authorisation unless he considers that the offence is a serious one, that is to say, it will be for the Minister, after considering the facts and circumstances, to make a judgment as to whether this is the case.  It is an essential feature of the scheme that the Minister should be entrusted with the duty of making the judgment.  However, subsection (6) provides a special safeguard in order to enable a person whose communications have been intercepted to have the advantage of an independent judgment on the question whether the offence in question was a serious offence.</P>
    <P>If the referee considers that, although there was no contravention of the relevant provisions, nevertheless, in spite of the Minister's opinion, the offence in question was not in fact a serious one then he will refer the question whether the offence was a serious one to the designated judge for his determination.  If the designated judge agrees with the referee that the offence in question was not a serious offence, the referee will act as if he had concluded that there had been a contravention of the relevant provisions of the Act; and this will include the power to make a binding recommendation that the applicant should be paid compensation. If the designated judge disagrees with the referee, that is to say, if he agrees with the Minister's opinion that the offence was a serious one, the referee <Col N="770" /> will comply, in accordance with the scheme of the section, give notice in writing to the applicant that there was no contravention of a relevant provision of the Act; again he will not say whether there was an authorisation or an interception.</P>
    <P>Like the designated judge under section 8, the referee will have access to all the official documents relating to a relevant authorisation and the application for it and be able to inspect the documents; and again, as in the case of an investigation by the designated judge, all persons who were concerned in, or have information relevant to, the giving of an authorisation or the making of the application for it will be required to give the referee, on request by him, any information in their possession relating to the application or authorisation.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the Bill may be regarded as complementary to section 9 in the sense that it restricts the possibility of making use of legal proceedings, criminal or civil, for the purpose of discovering whether an authorisation of an interception has been issued or an application for an authorisation has been made.  To impose such a restriction is in the Government's view clearly justified because of the need in the national interest to protect the secrecy of the system of interception and because the complaints procedure under section 9 fully protects members of the public from any possible abuse by the Minister of his powers under the Bill.  Section 10 does not seek to exclude completely the possibility of raising in legal proceedings the question whether there has been an authorisation: its purpose and effect are to prevent such a question from being raised unnecessarily or prematurely.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) relates to criminal proceedings. It provides in effect that a private prosecution for an offence consisting of unlawful interception of a letter or telephone calls shall require the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions. Without this restriction a person wanting to find out whether his telephone had been tapped might start a prosecution against an official of Bord <Col N="771" /> Telecom or of the Department of Justice in the hope of compelling the accused to say whether there had been an interception and, if so, an authorisation.  If an application were made to the director for his consent for a prosecution, the director would investigate the case, and would simply refuse his consent if there was no evidence of an offence whether there was an interception.  The section would not prevent a person from issuing a summons for an offence, but he would not be able to take the matter beyond that stage and any remand without getting the director's consent.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) relates to civil proceedings. It applies to a case where a person might bring an action in respect of an interception which, if it took place and was not legally justified, would have amounted to one of the offences of unlawful interception in respect of which the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions for a criminal prosecution would be required by subsection (1).  The effect of subsection (2), subject to an exception, is that if any such civil proceedings are taken, the question whether there was in fact an interception will be determined before any question can be raised as to whether there was an authorisation.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, unless and until it is determined that there was an interception, no person who from his official duties might be concerned in, or have knowledge concerning, authorisations will be permitted to give any evidence, or be asked any question, that would tend to show that an authorisation was or was not given or that an application for an authorisation was or was not made or that proposals or steps for that purpose were or were not made or taken, nor will the defence be permitted to make any disclosure or allegation to this effect in the action before it is determined that there was an interception.</P>
    <P>If this preliminary inquiry fails to show that the interception complained of occurred, then the action will, of course, fail, but if it is determined that the interception did occur, then the action will <Col N="772" /> proceed and the result will depend on whether the interception was justified on the ground that there was an authorisation by the Minister or for some other reason.  The Court will, on the application of any party to the proceedings, allow any amendment to the pleadings that may be necessary in order that the question whether there was an authorisation may be determined; this is necessary because, as I said, the defence will have been prohibited from raising this question before it was determined that there was, in fact, an interception.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) provides another safeguard against attempts to use legal proceedings for the purpose of discovering whether, for example, an authorisation has been given.  The subsection provides that no person shall be compellable in any proceedings to give any evidence or information to a court or tribunal or any person which shows or tends to show that an authorisation was or was not given or that an application for an authorisation was or was not made or to be made.  This will apply to proceedings of any kind and not only to proceedings directly related to interceptions.  The subsection will not prevent a person from giving the evidence or information voluntarily. Whether an official possessing the information gives it voluntarily will be a matter between him and the service to which he belongs.  There will be three exceptions to the rule of non-compellability under subsection (3).  First, it will not apply in criminal proceedings for an offence of unlawful interception.  Second, it will not apply to evidence that a person has been convicted of such an offence. Third, the information will have to be given on request to the designated judge or the complaints referee.</P>
    <P>Although a person will in general not be compellable to give evidence or information such as I have referred to with regard to an authorisation or the application for one, a certificate signed by a person authorised by the Minister and giving the information in question will be admissible, under subsection (5), as evidence in any legal proceedings in which evidence of the facts stated in it is <Col N="773" /> admissible.  Therefore if, for example, a person was prosecuted for an unlawful interception, the fact that there was no authorisation in respect of the interception could be improved by means of the certificate without the need to call formal evidence to this effect.  There will, of course, be no obligation on the Minister to give a certificate, but he would naturally do so in a proper case in which evidence of the matter that would be included in the certificate could have been given orally.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides that all the official documents relating to an authorisation and the application for it must be retained for a period of at least three years after the authorisation ceases to be in force. This requirment will apply, for example, to documents in the possession of the Garda Síochána, An Post or Bord Telecom as well as those in the possession of the Department of Justice.  The documents might be required by the designated judge or the complaints referee for the purposes of their functions under the Act.  Section 11 will not apply to copies of material which have been intercepted. Under section 12 these will have to be destroyed as soon as their retention is no longer necessary.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides extra safeguards for the benefit of persons whose communications may have been intercepted. It requires the Minister to ensure that arrangements exist to limit to the minimum necessary the disclosure of the fact that an authorisation has been given and the contents of any communication that has been intercepted.  The arrangements will also secure that copies of communications that have been intercepted shall not be made to a greater extent than is necessary and shall be destroyed as soon as their retention is no longer necessary.  For these purposes &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; will mean &ldquo;necessary for the prevention or detection of serious offences or in the interests of the security of the State&rdquo;.  The adequacy of the arrangements made by the Minister for these purposes will be among the matters that will be subject to investigation by the designated judge under section 8, <Col N="774" /> and the judge will, of course, under that section, have full power to inspect all relevant official documents and to question all persons concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 13 makes a number of amendments to the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983. These are mostly technical and the only one that calls for particular mention is that contained in subsection (2).  It relates to the practice known as &ldquo;metering&rdquo; which, as I said earlier, consists of the mechanical recording of the making and duration of telephone calls.  Subsection (2) inserts a new subsection in section 98 of the 1983 Postal and Telecommunications Act.  The new subsection makes it an offence for a person employed by Bord Telecom to disclose information such as I have mentioned to anybody else unless the disclosure is made in the circumstances specified in the subsection.  Disclosure will be permissible if it is made at the request or with the consent of the subscriber; for the prevention or detection of crime or for the purpose of criminal proceedings; in the interest of the security of the State; in pursuance of an order of a court, or in the course of the employee's duty as such. I have added another circumstance to the original list, i.e., for the purpose of civil proceedings in any court.  This is to put beyond doubt that Bord Telecom could disclose information obtained by &ldquo;metering&rdquo; in, say, any legal proceedings, relating to the number of telephone calls made.</P>
    <P>Section 14 repeals section 18 of the Official Secrets Act, 1963.  The latter section empowers the Minister by warrant to require the production to him of telegrams sent to or received from places outside the State.  The section reproduced a section in the British Official Secrets Act, 1920, which applied to the State.  The power is very wide, the only condition being that the Minister should be of the opinion that production is &ldquo;expedient in the interest of the State&rdquo;. The power under the section has never been used so far as is remembered in the Department of Justice, and the Bill is a convenient occasion to abolish it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="775" /> Should Senators wish me to explain further any particular provisions of the Bill, I would be happy to do so in concluding. I now look forward to a useful and positive debate.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister for Justice to the House and thank him for his contribution which explained in detail the provisions of the Bill.  I welcome this long overdue legislation on telephone tapping and post interception. The Bill places on a statutory basis the conditions under which the existing power of the Minister for Justice can issue warrants authorising the interception of postal packages, including letters and telecommunication messages, how it is to be exercised and to regulate the procedure for the issue of such authorisation. The Bill takes account of the views of the European Court of Human Rights under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  It legalises the system of interpretation and, therefore, now complies with the European Court.  Under Article 8 of the Convention, as the Minister said, interference with the right of privacy for correspondence is allowed if it is necessary in the interests of national security, public safety or economic wellbeing of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.  In fact, two of these sections are incorporated in the Bill &mdash; that of national security and the prevention of disorder or crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The misuse of the interception of post and telecommunications by the Garda Síochána or the Defence Forces is a fundamental threat to the confidence of the people in the institutions of the State. The credibility and independence of these two institutions is vital for the survival of our valued democratic system. This acceptance by the people of the Garda síochána and the Defence Forces is a fundamental plank in a democracy and tampering with it is extremely grave. The political independence and reliability of the police force is very <Col N="776" /> important in the acceptance of the people of their role as custodians of law and order.  It is important that their duties are conducted in a fair and independent manner.  Any serious questioning of that role weakens the citizens' trust in the institutions of the State, a trust which is essential for proper conduct of parliamentary democracy.</P>
    <P>The unique relationship between the political master of the Garda Síochána, the Minister for Justice, and the Government of the day and the pressures that corrupt and unscrupulous politicians can bring to bear on the police, requires legislation to ensure the proper conduct of this relationship.  This legislation is lacking at present in the area of interception of postal packages and telecommunication messages.  This Bill endeavours to correct that very serious situation.  In this respect it is extremely important and welcome. It is important because experience has shown that this fundamental aspect has been interfered with in the past. Unscrupulous politicians have brought unfair pressure to bear on senior gardaí to use the technology of interception for crude political purposes.  Unfortunately, such pressure was yielded to and the fundamental rights of individuals to conduct their business in confidence was violated. If this can happen as it did in 1982, it can occur again.  The Bill will regulate the situation and it is welcome for that purpose.</P>
    <P>The right to privacy is a right which has been cherished by the Irish people as an integral part of our culture.  It is the citizen's right to assume that privacy is respected and will not be invaded by authority unless he or she gives reasonable and grave cause for that authority to suspect that he or she is involved in serious crime or subversion.  History has shown that such privacy has been invaded without cause.  It is our duty as a Legislature to ensure that it does not occur again, that stringent measures are in place to control the situation and that these measures are adequate and accepted by the people.</P>
    <P>It is important that there is an open approach to telephone tapping and interception <Col N="777" /> of post, that the criteria for doing so are clearly laid down in law, that there are systems of checks and balances introduced and that the spirit of the law in this area is protected and policed.  It is important that the people are satisfied that the approach taken by authorities is in line with clearly established and fair principles.  It requires the implementation of clear legal procedures to ensure that this right to privacy &mdash; the right to privacy of each citizen &mdash; is not invaded without extremely grave reasons.</P>
    <P>In our democratic system the media, written and electronic, TV and radio, play a vital role.  Responsible journalism which is investigative, vigilant and fair, oils our democratic machine.  The journalist is the representative of the ordinary citizen, the one who asks the questions on behalf of the ordinary man on the street.  The journalist informs the people of developments within our democratic process and institutions.  The interference with the fundamental right of privacy of such a person is a serious violation of our democratic system.</P>
    <P>The political masters should abhor such a suggestion.  Yet it did happen. In 1982 two journalists' telephones were tapped, not because of criminal or security reasons but for sheer political advantage by a section of a party who at that time were in sole control of the institutions of the State.  These politicians blatantly used their positions for political purposes.  The Minister for Justice at the time, and with the knowledge of the then Taoiseach, personally issued orders to tap the telephones of two journalists, Mr. Bruce Arnold of the <i>Irish Independent</i> and Miss Geraldine Kennedy of the <i>Irish Press.</i></P>
    <P>The safeguards laid down by Oireachtas Éireann by successive Ministers for Justice prior to 1982 were ignored.  This was done without any justification. The involvement of the Garda in the misuse of the system for sheer political gain shook the people's confidence in our police system.  The Garda Síochána were the object of political pressure which was heaviest on the then commissioner.  It was used for party political <Col N="778" /> purposes.  The Garda Síochána became involved in a matter in which they should never have become embroiled. If there had not been a change of Government in 1982 we might never have realised how the politicians were abusing the power that lay in their hands.</P>
    <P>The reason given at the time for tapping Mr. Arnold's telephone is interesting. He was described as &ldquo;anti-national in his outlook and he might be obtaining information from sources of a similar disposition&rdquo;. The warrant was sought for security purposes.  It was hoped to secure useful information concerning subversive activity which could not be obtained in any other way.  Excerpts from the tapes of telephone conversations dealt exclusively with party political matters and not issues of national security.  Nothing at the time justified the decision to tap the telephones of Mr Arnold and Miss Kennedy. The then Minister for Justice, Senator Seán Doherty, broke the fundamental rule that such a request must originate with the gardaí and he completely ignored the various assurances given on this point to Dáil Éireann.  This must never happen again.  A political party in power must never again use State facilities to further their own end.  In that context the Bill is extremely welcome.</P>
    <P>In this State, despite its violent birth to be able to take the role of the Garda Síochána and the Army for granted is something to be cherised.  The Garda Síochána and our Defence Forces have a record of which they can be proud.  The fundamental plank which gives such credibility to these two institutions was tampered with in 1982.  This must never happen again, and this Bill will ensure that.</P>
    <P>The officer &mdash; be it an official in the Army or a Garda officer &mdash; is expected to agree that what a Minister, or servant of a Minister, tells him to be in the national interest is so.  When the position of the Minister is misused it places the officer in an unenviable position.  It was unfortunate that such a misuse of power in 1982 destroyed the excellent careers of two senior Garda officers.  It is unfortunate that a Minister for Justice, with the <Col N="779" /> knowledge of the Taoiseach and through his misuse of power, caused this to happen.  It must not recur.  To ensure that it does not happen again, it is important that the circumstances which enable gardaí to tap telephones is clearly spelled out.  This Bill endeavours to do that.  The present law governing the tapping of telephones is section 56 of the Post Offices Act, 1908.  This does not specify the circumstances under which tapping can be carried out.  It was not until 1972 that the then Minister for Justice, Deputy O'Malley, stated a law on the matter.  He said:</P>
    <P>Only when it is necessary for security reasons or prevention or detection of serious crime and only to gather information which can be obtained in no other way.</P>
    <P>It is important that the reason for interception of post or telephones is clearly laid out in legislation, that the duration of such an authority is specified and that a laid down procedure of extension of such authority is clearly legislated for. Section 2 of the Bill outlines this.  It provides that interception may be authorised only for the purpose of criminal investigation or in the interests of the security of the State.  It provides for a limit on the duration of the authorisation to the specified period in the warrant, which must not exceed three months, and it empowers the Minister to extend the duration for further periods not exceeding three months at a time.</P>
    <P>While the Act provides an opportunity for the Minister to consult the judge appointed to review the operation, I think that this consultation should be mandatory to ensure that the right to privacy and the extreme nature of the offence suspected is fully examined by an independent authority.  A serious offence is defined in the Act as one for which an adult would be liable to imprisonment for at least five years, where it involves the loss of life, serious personal injury, serious loss or damage to property or a risk of this or of substantial gain, or where particular activities will endanger or are <Col N="780" /> likely to endanger the security of the State.</P>
    <P>The procedure to be adhered to before a Minister for Justice may issue an authorisation for interception is a key element in the control of abuse of the system.  The Bill clearly states that in every case the procedure must be initiated by an application from the appropriate authority, and that the application must be considered by an officer of the Department of Justice before it is submitted to the Minister for his decision.  The officer is obliged by the Bill to make a written submission to the Minister giving his considered opinion on whether the conditions justifying the proposed interception are fulfilled.  It is a pity that such procedure was not legally in force in 1982.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for a review of the Act by a judge of the High Court.  Its purpose is to keep the operation of the Act under review to ensure that its provisions are being complied with.  A report will be made at intervals of not more than two years and will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  For the first five years of the operation of the Act the intervals of reporting should not be in excess of one year in order to obtain the confidence of the people in the effectiveness of the working of the Act.  If a person believes that a communication sent to or by him has been wrongly intercepted, there must be a procedure to allow such a matter to be investigated.</P>
    <P>Section 9 sets up a complaints procedure and the provision to establish the appointment of a complaints referee who will be a judge of the Circuit Court, a judge of the District Court or a practising barrister or solicitor of at least ten years standing.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, but I look forward to tightening up some areas on Committee Stage.  I look forward to the Minister's Second Stage reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for Justice, Deputy Flynn, and his Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea.  I compliment the Ministers, the Government and the officials for producing this long <Col N="781" /> awaited Bill.  I concur with many of the points made by my colleague, Senator Neville, but I do not intend to dwell on the past, on something which happened ten years ago.  If it was of such paramount importance at that time, it is surprising that the then Fine Gael-Labour Government, who were in power until 1987, did not introduce this legislation.  One wonders, why this Bill, which was first brought before the Dáil by the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition almost seven years ago, took so long to be debated.  It is not for me to explain the delay during the 1982-85 or 1987 period but it is important to note that this Government have taken the opportunity and brought the legislation before this House.  It was prudent of the Government to await the decisions of the High Court and Supreme Court in regard to Bruce Arnold and Geraldine Kennedy before bringing the Bill before the Oireachtas.  I understand that because of the very technical and serious nature of this Bill the situation had to be reviewed and monitored closely by the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>I am glad Senator Neville agrees in the main with both the thrust and the contents of the Bill which is largely comparable to the initial Bill introduced in the Dáil seven years ago and to a Private Members' Bill introduced in the Dáil last year by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, Fine Gael spokesman for Justice.  However, this Bill contains some very important modifications. It deals with authorised interceptions and brings the concept of telephone and mail interceptions into statutory form with crucial statutory safeguards and requirements.  The Bill is a very prudent balance between the rights of individuals to their privacy and the prevention of serious crime or breach of State security.</P>

    <Title>Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with the prudent balance in this Bill between the rights of individuals to their privacy and the prevention of serious crime or breach of State security.  If one were to analyse the Bill closely the rights of the individual would be well favoured by the pendulum on balance of equity and fairness as against the onus to prevent serious crime or breach of State security.  I say this because there is an inbuilt mechanism in the Bill to ensure that any interception is carried out lawfully and for only the most serious and grave reasons in the interest either of State security or the prevention of serious crime &mdash; for example, the <Col N="783" /> importation of illegal arms shipments, large consignments of drugs or to prevent the serious crimes of murder, kidnapping, etc.</P>
      <P>The Bill also contains two major safeguards, first the continuous review of the operation of the Bill by a High Court judge who will have wideranging powers under section 8 and, second, the appointment of a complaints referee.  The referee will also have wideranging powers and will be either a judge of the Circuit or District Court or a solicitor or barrister of at least ten years standing.</P>
      <P>There may be a notion abroad that this Bill may easily allow for what we call interception of mail or packages or telephone tapping, but such interception can only be made by a very rigid and strict method.  If it is a criminal matter the request of application must come through the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána. He makes the request to a senior official in the Department of Justice nominated for that purpose by the Minister before it is submitted to the Minister for his decision.  The Minister obviously has the final decision.  Right down the line from the Garda Commissioner, to the senior official nominated in the Department of Justice to the Minister himself, very strict guidelines are laid down and it is only in the hope of detecting a serious crime or in the prevention of a breach of national security that a warrant would be issued.  In other words, warrants will not, as a result of the proposed legislation, issue for any frivolous reason.  If the interception is for reasons of State security the application may be made either through the Garda Commissioner or a military officer, a colonel or higher rank, designated by the Minister for Defence and the application must be accompanied by a recommendation in writing by the Minister for Defence.  The application must also be made in writing and must contain sufficient information to enable the Minister for Justice to determine whether the relevant conditions justifying the issue of a warrant are fulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation allows for no short cuts <Col N="784" /> or deviations.  There are very stringent requirements in the Bill which must be complied with before an interception warrant is signed.  It is of particular interest to me to note that this Bill provides that a High Court Judge, an independent official, will ensure that the workings of the Bill are constantly reviewed.  The judge will have wideranging powers and his supervision will be both technical and tight, which must be welcomed.  The High Court Judge will be appointed by the President of the High Court after consultation with the Minister for Justice.  It must not go unnoticed that the High Court Judge, when appointed, will be precluded from being involved in any criminal decision and cannot sit on any criminal trial thereafter. To an extent, by his appointment, that High Court Judge is isolated from further criminal cases, in case he would have heard, learned or received any information which might prejudice a suspect before him.</P>
    <P>I have touched on some of the main proposals in this Bill and it is important that some of the major aspects are covered in a more concise manner.  The crucial aspect is that the interceptions referred to in the Bill can be authorised only &mdash; this is very important &mdash; for the purpose of criminal investigations or in the interests of the security of the State. Subsection (2) provides that an authorisation shall be given by warrants signed by the Minister.  There is one exception; in the case of exceptional urgency the Minister may give the authorisation orally in the first instance, but it must be followed by a written warrant as soon as possible or practicable thereafter. Obviously, a case where the Minister will give such an oral decision to intercept either a telephone line or mail would be a serious matter that could affect either the security of the State or prevent a serious crime.  The Bill ensures that the Minister when giving the authorisation can only do so when all the relevant conditions laid down in section 4 in the case of a warrant for the purpose of criminal investigation and in section 5 in the case of a warrant in the interests <Col N="785" /> of the security of the State, are fulfilled and that there has been no contravention of the requirements of section 6 relating to the procedure for applications or authorisations. It is important that this aspect be noted.</P>
    <P>The procedure, as I see it, is that initially a written request comes to the Minister through either the Garda Síochána or, possibly, a colonel in the Army and before the Minister takes a decision a senior official in the Department of Justice analyses the request and ascertains whether it is a suitable request or application for an interception warrant. Having done that, the Minister then has to satisfy himself, as a further element of security, that the warrant, when issued, is for serious and urgent requirements.  It should also be noted when a warrant is issued that the natural life of this warrant is three months.  However, under this Bill the Minister may extend the duration for a further period not exceeding three months, but the same conditions which applied to the issue of the authorisation will also apply to the extension.</P>
    <P>The investigation must relate to a serious offence and the definition in the Minister's speech, and in the Bill, is that it must be one for which an adult would be liable to a term of imprisonment of at least five years, if convicted, in other words, if it involved loss of life, serious personal injury or serious loss or damage to property, etc.  I envisage, apart from a subversive threat to the State, that in the case of arson, where a life is threatened, kidnapping, abduction of a child or something of that nature, the provisions in the Bill will be brought into play only for the most valid reasons and interfering with a telephone line or intercepting a mail package would be the responsibility of the Garda or the telecommunications section of the appropriate Department.</P>
    <P>Apart from the Garda, I also envisage the involvement of the Army, possibly Customs and Excise officials &mdash; in cases where the importation of drugs is suspected &mdash; or, Navy personnel, with &ldquo;the investigation of offences ... concerning a serious offence or a suspected serious offence&rdquo; or the security of the <Col N="786" /> State.  The Minister has an obligation to look at all aspects of the request before he issues a warrant.  It is also important to note that apart from that procedure &mdash; and this is very important &mdash; the High Court Judge, when appointed, will have full rights of access to any files should he so desire.  He may review the operation of this legislation every six months or every year; he may decide to look at a case or at a plethora of cases and ask questions, see the files and ensure that the warrant, when issued, is necessary and has been issued only after the stringent regulations in this Bill are fully complied with.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill deals with the procedure for terminating interceptions when they are no longer required.  If the Garda Síochána or the military officer designated under section 6 considers that interceptions are no longer required, he will have a legal duty under this legislation to inform, without delay, the nominated officer of the Minister for Justice who, in turn, has a duty to inform the Minister of the position.  The Minister has a duty to terminate such an interception forthwith.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill deals with the appointment of the High Court Judge.  If the judge investigates a particular case, he is obliged to make his report available to both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Such a power will mean that this information will be made public, except it involves a breach of security, and there are provisions where some of this can be eliminated. By and large, the investigation by the High Court Judge and his report will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>It is important to emphasise the position of the complaints referee.  He will have power to investigate a relevant authorisation, and to ensure that the original authorisation or warrant is valid, is properly obtained and will report back to the person who has complained to him. The referee will also have power to notify the applicant in writing of his conclusion, make a report of his findings to the Taoiseach and, if he thinks fit, to quash the authorisation and direct the destruction <Col N="787" /> of any copy of any communications intercepted.  This is another independent method by which an independent referee can ensure that there will be no breach of these regulations; it is another safeguard in this very precise and concise legislation.</P>
    <P>This legislation must be broadly welcomed. It brings a statutory format to an ongoing situation where &mdash; and hopefully this Bill will become law in the not too distant future &mdash; we will have a statutory system which takes cognisance of the High Court and Supreme Court decisions.  It has also taken cognisance of the well known case of Malone <i>v.</i>  The Crown where as a result I understand of a criminal case being taken by Malone the police in England let it slip that there was an unlawful tap on his telephone. The upshot was that Malone took this case to the European Court of Human Rights and the long awaited decision of the European Court and the recommendations under what we now know as the Malone case have been taken into account by this Bill.  This is very important.  The court held that the tapping of Malone's telephone was in violation of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  I am of the view, and I think the Minister covered this point in his speech, that not alone did the current Department, the Ministers concerned and their staff deal with the Malone case, they went further because if we look closely at the provisions in the European Convention on Human Rights <i>vis-a-vis</i> the current proposed legislation, it is clear we have a much more tightly knit scene.  In other words, we have built into this legislation better safeguards than were envisaged by the High Court, the Supreme Court or the European Court of Human Rights.  This is welcome. Although it took the last three or four years for the Government to prepare this legislation, the wait was worthwhile having regard to the eventual outcome of this very technical, concise and rigid legislation that tries in a very prudent and sensible fashion to balance the rights of an individual and the rights of privacy <Col N="788" /> against the duty of the Garda or the Army to protect citizens against any serious crime being committed or any security breach as far as the State is concerned.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and trust that it will get a speedy passage through this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and, belatedly, congratulate him on his appointment.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and imagine my welcome will be widely shared by my colleagues here.  On a technical point, I take it that the main activity covered by this Bill will be telephone tapping because letters are becoming increasingly obsolete.  The Bill does not mention that great boon of modern communication, the fax machine.  I do not know whether it would be possible to intercept fax messages, or if the fax machine was deliberately omitted.  It strikes me that telephone tapping is what is mainly at issue here.</P>
      <P>Senator Neville said that the Irish people cherish their traditional right to privacy but I do not know whether this is more than a generalisation.  What is equally true on the other side is that there has been a very strong authoritarian tradition here, particularly in the history of the State, with censorship during World War II forming a centrepiece, and censorship in Church as well as in State, and a general authoritarian mentality which, I suggest, did not see anything terribly wrong about people's communications being intercepted.  It is a welcome development of our time and particularly of our judicial process that the right of the individual to privacy has been increasingly emphasised and that we are getting away from the big brother syndrome, as it were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think any particular Government can be blamed overall for this because in the seventies when the &ldquo;heavy gang&rdquo; were at work we can be sure there was a great deal of interception and telephone tapping going on that we did not know anything about.  At the same time, I was rather amused the Minister kept a straight face when he mentioned the <Col N="789" /> admirable Mr. Malone whose case against the United Kingdom has provided this Bill with the pretext for its introduction.  Be that as it may, we are all aware, of course, that the real reason this Bill is introduced are the events in 1982 and, to be fair to them, the Progressive Democrats' insistence that this forms part of the whole programme of reform.  This is a very historic and dramatic Bill since its introduction was the cause of extremely dramatic events &mdash; the sudden departure of our former Cathaoirleach from the scene, followed within a very brief period by the departure of the former Taoiseach.  The repercussions of this Bill and of its imminent introduction into the House had very important consequences, indeed.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville mentioned the Arnold and Kennedy case and I have to echo the admiration of many of us for these intrepid journalists in the case of totally unwanted attacks on their integrity and totally unconvincing reasons for interfering with their privacy.  They have been vindicated by the courts and that is a very good thing.  The hope has been expressed by Senator Neville that these events will not recur, but I want to make the point that none of us is deceived by the Minister's copy reference to Malone <i>v.</i> the United Kingdom.  We are thankful to the courts for the insistence on their right to privacy as one of the unenumerated personal rights and we see this Bill as a development of that court position.</P>
    <P>As Senator O'Donovan pointed out in detail, the Bill has all kinds of watertight sections for safeguarding privacy in communications. At the same time, we are all aware that the State has been intermittently in a security crisis from its foundation, particularly over the past 20 years.  Indeed, the events of the past week or so with the discovery of arms dumps and the increasing evidence of a big hidden Ireland network of support for subversives, will make us all accept that a proper degree of police supervision in communications is called for.  No ordinary citizen has any reason to fear this kind of intrusion on his or her privacy. <Col N="790" /> The provision for a designated judge and a complaints referee are novel and very welcome features to further safeguard this privacy.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I would call attention to the fact that we owe its existence to very grave events in our political life ten years ago &mdash; and it was not simply ten years ago, with respect to Senator O'Donovan.  The repercussions of those events came back with a vengeance just a few months ago.  If we have a new Cathaoirleach and a new Taoiseach, it is partly because the retiring officers have paid the penalty for their participation in what was a criminal interference with the rights of ordinary citizens &mdash; neither of them is any great loss.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, and I want to state clearly that on two further grounds I think the Government are living up to their obligations in producing this Bill. At least, the Oireachtas may be moving towards meeting the recriminations directed against them by a Supreme Court Judge in recent times that they have not been doing its business.  This is an example of the Oireachtas, by taking due measures for the security of the State upholding scrupulously the rights of the individual citizen.  It is I hope part of the beginning of the process of the Oireachtas doing its duty at last and not leaving it to the courts to uphold individual rights.</P>
    <P>I also hope that the Bill will help to exorcise the ghost of the 1982 GUBU.  I support the Bill warmly.</P>

      <P>I welcome this legislation and I welcome Minister Wallace again to the House.  I would like to put on record my thanks to Minister Flynn, whom I wish well in Justice.  I was sorry that in the middle of his address I had to leave for an important meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and that, therefore, I did not hear the second part of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an extremely technical Bill and you would have to be a lawyer to understand or even half understand it.  Before he leaves the Chamber, I want to comment on Senator Murphy's remarks.  The <Col N="791" /> present Government and I, as a member of that party, do not need advice, pushing or anything if good legislation is to be put in place.  I appeal to everyone to leave things that happened behind us if a Bill as positive as this is in the House, a Bill which I totally and absolutely support. Senator Murphy obviously thought I was going to make more of an attack on him, so he stood; but he left when he saw I was going to be calm.</P>
    <P>In his address the Minister said:</P>
    <P>If the telephone calls could be listened to, this might provide a link in the investigations which would enable the crime to be prevented or detected. In fact, the European Court of Human Rights has accepted that and I quote &ldquo;the increase of crime and particularly the growth of organised crime, the increasing sophistication of criminals and the ease and speed with which they can move about have made telephone interception an indispensable tool in the investigation and prevention of serious crime&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Later on he very clearly stated the position arising from the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in the Malone case, where the court held that tapping Malone's telephone was a violation of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights &mdash; that the interference was not &ldquo;in accordance with the law&rdquo;.  The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>In order to comply with that Convention the conditions for the authorisation of interceptions should be laid down by law; it is not sufficient that they should be the subject of undertakings by the Executive.</P>
    <P>Here again is an example of Europe having an effect on our legislation and of our putting in place positive legislation to deal with problems.</P>
    <P>In another part of the Minister's speech there is a reference to a warrant which will remain in force for a maximum period of three months.  I just wonder why we are talking about a warrant for three months, which can be extended if <Col N="792" /> necessary.  I am sure the Minister will answer that.  The Minister also said:</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Minister for Justice will have to take a considered decision, in each case, after balancing the claims of privacy for communications and those of criminal investigation, before deciding that the needs of criminal investigation must prevail.</P>
    <P>This is very strong legislation.  I warn our Ministers and our authorities, our Garda Commissioner and the Army, to be extremely careful that they do not make a mistake and interfere with a person's privacy.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána and &ldquo;the appropriate military officer of the rank of colonel...&rdquo;  I would ask the Minister for Justice why not the Army Chief of Staff when it is the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána?  Under this legislation it could be any colonel.</P>
    <P>The Minister put a lot of emphasis on sections 8 and 9 of the Bill.  It was at that point, unfortunately, I had to leave the Chamber for a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and I would have liked to hear him rather than trying to read through his speech now.</P>
    <P>We have involved in this legislation two Departments, the Garda Commissioner and the Army colonel.  We would want to remember that at times there are different rules in the Garda Síochána and the Army.  This point is covered in section 6 &mdash; the security of the State.  While there are two Ministers, the commissioner and an Army colonel involved, it is, I presume the Minister for Justice who has the final say.</P>
    <P>I read the explanatory memorandum with great care.  I was glad to hear Senator O'Donovan admitting how technical this Bill was, since he is dealing with this type of phraseology every day in his professional life as a lawyer.  When reading through this Bill you would want somebody beside you explaining the sections. All this is familiar to the draftsmen but I wish they would present it in an intelligible form to a normal mortal like me who has an interest in legislation.  Every <Col N="793" /> paragraph in the memorandum refers back to something else.  I said this before I was as familiar with legislation as I now am.</P>
    <P>Section 9, (2) (b) says:</P>
    <P>A person appointed to be the Referee shall be a judge of the Circuit Court, a judge of the District Court or a person who is for the time being a practising barrister, or a practising solicitor, of not less than 10 years' standing.</P>
    <P>I wonder why the Minister had to put in a choice of four for one appointment.</P>
    <P>Section 9 (2) (f) also says:</P>
    <P>The Referee may be removed from office by the Taoiseach but only for stated misbehaviour or incapacity and upon resolutions passed by Dáil Éireann and by Seanad Éireann calling for his removal.</P>
    <P>I am glad that before such an extraordinary decision is made it will come before the two Houses of the Oireachtas. I would emphasise that the House should be consulted on decisions, especially decisions as great as that one.  I presume whoever gets the appointment would be absolutely right for the job.</P>
    <P>I am one of the few people in this House who was at the receiving end of phone tapping; I did not know it for a while.  It is quite a few years ago, not 1982.  I was shaken by it, &mdash; and it is not easy to shake me.  I am glad the reasons for giving permission to tap a person's phone are so stringent.  In the early part of my contribution I avoided referring to recent years or the time of the distinguished Cathaoirleach who replaced me.  That is sincerely meant.</P>
    <P>Before I sit down I want to strike a lighter note; this happened in the days of the old phones.  One morning I wanted to contact urgently a certain Minister.  I rang a certain village and asked if the exchange would put me through to his home, but the lady in the exchange said to me, &ldquo;Mrs. Honan, I cannot put you through because he has gone to a funeral; he only left the house ten minutes ago&rdquo;. That is the lovely Ireland we have left <Col N="794" /> behind.  That Minister is not serving now. He went on to higher things.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister and the Government on bringing in this much needed Bill.  However, I hope it will not be abused.  It is excellent legislation and is welcomed by all my colleagues in the House.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, and I hope he will convey my message to the Minister, Deputy Flynn, about whose appointment I am very happy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  Members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights miss his very valued contributions.  He has been ably replaced, but his concern for the disadvantaged women in his constituency always came to the fore when we mentioned legislation that might be passed but needed a push from the committee. He is sadly missed, but I think he will bring his understanding to bear on those issues and push in the direction we would like him to go, as he did when he was a member of the committee.</P>
      <P>I am glad this long overdue Bill has been initiated in the Seanad.  It will give us the opportunity to push hard for more Bills of a similar nature to be initiated here; it is good also to put on the record that they are always very substantial Bills.  This is a good Bill but it is very complicated.  It took the Minister at least 45 minutes to read his very detailed speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to place on a statutory basis the existing powers under which the Minister for Justice can issue warrants authorising interception. He referred to telecommunications messages <Col N="795" /> as telephone calls and postal packets, as letters, post cards and parcels &mdash; perhaps, as Senator Murphy mentioned, the fax machines could be included in postal packets.  The Bill sets out in detail the procedure that must be followed before an interception can be authorised. The only purposes for which interceptions may be authorised, as was stressed by the Minister, will be those of criminal investigation and the security of the State.  Of course, if that is the case nobody will have any problems at all with that reference.  When referring to the system of authorised interceptions the Minister stressed the reconciliation of two important principles.  It is worth emphasising them again: first, the privacy of correspondence and telephone calls and, second, the need to combat crime and subversion.  It is important to stress these facts so that there is no ambiguity about what is involved.</P>
    <P>As Senator Neville said, we pride ourselves on rights of freedom, though Senator Murphy disagreed and referred to us as perhaps having come through an authoritarian system where the nod and wink has been part of our culture and, I suppose, is still there today in relation to another issue which is being hotly debated at the moment.  There is also the wish not to be perceived to be an informer.  All that is part and parcel of a cultural inheritance.  There is a balance, at times, betwen the feeling of freedom and this subtle sort of inherited attitude we might have towards the truth. I suppose it is something that has got us into trouble throughout our history, and it is something we should have exorcised at this stage.</P>
    <P>It is important to refer back to the events of 1982.  We could be very pleasant and civilised and pretend that these things did not happen.  Certain names may have been forgotten over the years, but I think the names of Bruce Arnold and Geraldine Kennedy are remembered as the journalists whose phones were tapped.  The fact that they are still extremely good journalists and working today is a credit to their commitment to <Col N="796" /> their professionalism and that they still continue to probe and to write the truth. Geraldine Kennedy has gone through a political career and has a view of politics from both sides.  This has helped her in her investigative journalism.  That is very important.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the differences between the 1985 Bill and the Bill now before us.  He stated that in the intervening years other things have come on stream which he has included in the Bill.  It is also important &mdash; and I stress this as it relates to the problems emerging today for the right of women to travel and information &mdash; that the human rights issue be dealt with and that we look to Europe and the EC Directives to ensure that we co-operative with the law at all times.  That is particularly relevant in the case that has been mentioned by all who have spoken so far.  There is the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Malone <i>v.</i> the United Kingdom where the court held that the tapping of Malone's telephone was in violation of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights in that the interference was not in accordance with the law.  That is very important.  In the hope that the Maastricht Treaty will be passed &mdash; and I think it will &mdash; it is important for us to appreciate that our legislation ties in with European legislation. I wonder how we would operate if we did not have that guiding principle there at all times.</P>
    <P>It is worth referring to Article 13 and quoting it, as the Minister did:</P>
    <P>Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in this Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.</P>
    <P>Article 8 states that it is required under the European Convention on Human Rights that interference with the right of privacy or correspondence is permitted if it is necessary in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well being of the country.  It is important <Col N="797" /> to spell this out because it has been summarised in the initial part of the Bill as it relates to criminal investigation or the security of the State, the prevention of disorder and crime, the protection of health or morals, or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.  The Minister then states that of all the grounds for authorising interception on which the Convention permits Governments to rely we should rely only on national security and the prevention of crime.</P>
    <P>Another area with which people will be extremely satisifed is the designation of a judge of the High Court to keep the operation of the Act under review, to ascertain whether its provisions are being complied with and to report to the Taoiseach. I do not intend spelling out the various ways in which this can be done. This provision is extremely welcome.</P>
    <P>The other new provision the Minister referred to is that a person who believes that his communications have been improperly intercepted will be able to have his complaint investigated by a complaints referee, again from the legal area, a serving judge of the Circuit Court or District Court or a barrister or solicitor of ten years' standing, if he upholds the complaint, who would have the power to quash the authorisation and to make a binding recommendation for payment of compensation to the complainant. Every angle has been looked at.  I applaud the detail in which the Bill brings all these things into effect.</P>
    <P>Compensation is something people demand nowadays as of right; it is written into the Bill.  The infringement of people's rights, particularly in the area of phone tapping or interference with mail, would be of such magnitude that obviously compensation would have to be paid; but I do not know if this would ever make up for the trauma suffered by these two journalists.  I doubt very much if material benefits would ever make up for the trauma of having one's phone tapped.  As Senator Honan said, it was a horrific experience for her and she was innocent of any wrong doing.  One can <Col N="798" /> imagine how one would feel in a similar circumstance.</P>
    <P>For me to go through the Bill line by line is not essential.  I accept and welcome the Bill in its entirety and hope it will have a speedy passage through the Seanad.  If there are amendments, obviously they will be taken on Committee Stage.  The implementation of this Bill should be ensured as quickly as possible despite the queues, I presume, of other legislation in the Dáil and the fact that post-18 June there will be little or nothing done in either House because of national concern about the particular issue before us.  I hope we will not have to wait to have this Bill passed.  Hopefully, we will never have illegal telephone tapping again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea) Willie O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators Neville, O'Donovan, Murphy, Honan and Jackman for their constructive and helpful contributions to this debate.  The subject we are discussing is both technical and delicate, the interception of communications, making it difficult to talk about it.</P>
      <P>The underlying purpose of the Bill is to strike a balance between protecting the fundamental public interest involved in the security of the State and the effective investigation of serious offences on the one hand and safeguarding the right of individuals to privacy of communication on the other hand.  Some degree of official interception of telephone communications is a feature of law enforcement internationally and must be accepted in order to be effective.  Any system of official interception must be accompanied by the greatest degree of secrecy that can be achieved compatible with the interests of justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With a view to achieving a proper balance between public and private interests, the Bill provides for clear but limited circumstances in which authorisations can be given.  It provides a procedure under which a complaints referee who will have full access to all relevant papers and information can investigate complaints and award compensation for improper authorisations. <Col N="799" /> More importantly, it provides for continuous supervision of the operation of this system by a judge of the High Court who will also have complete access to all relevant papers and information.  Under the Bill any authorisation can come under the scrutiny of an independent judicial authority of high standing and that is, in my opinion, the surest guarantee that authorisations given under the Act will be proper.  It is against that background of safeguards that the provisions of the Bill must be considered which, while providing a remedy for a contravention of a provision of the Act first, provides that such a contravention shall not give rise to a cause of action, although it will not affect a cause of action for the infringement of a constitutional right; and, second, limits evidence, disclosure and discovery tending to show that an authorisation was given to a stage in court proceedings where it has been determined that an interception has taken place.  It would be a very serious weakness in my view in the system of interceptions if persons, by taking legal proceedings, could find out what authorisations had been given in relation to them.  Indeed, if people could readily gain access to such information simply by the expedient of taking proceedings, it is very questionable, indeed, whether the system of interception could survive as an effective system.  The Bill proceeds on the basis that nobody has a right to know whether their phone has been lawfully tapped, whereas everybody has a right to know or to find out that there has or has not been a contravention of the Act in relation to them.</P>
    <P>I now want to deal with a number of points raised by Senators in the course of the debate.  Senator Neville thought that at first the designated judge should report every year instead of every two years as provided in the Bill.  I will undertake that the Minister will look at this recommendation before Committee Stage. Under section 8 (2) (a) the designated judge can report if he so wishes, or feels it necessary, at intervals of less than two years.  Senator Murphy wondered if it <Col N="800" /> would be possible to intercept fax messages and the answer is unequivocally yes; the term &ldquo;telecommunications&rdquo; would include fax messages.  Despite what Senator Murphy said, the Malone case was one of the issues which led to this Bill.  Moreover, it also influenced the contents of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan wished to know why the warrant is only for three months and if it can be renewed.  The three month period is in accordance with present administrative practice and is regarded as sufficiently long.  If the circumstances which gave rise to the original warrants still exist, then it can be renewed.  It is not the intention that warrants continue indefinitely until a crime is detected.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan also wished to know why the documents are kept for three years.  I presume that what she wanted to find out was why they are only kept for three years, or maybe why they are kept for as long as three years.  The answer I am informed is that three years is long enough for any review by the designated judge.  To keep the documents longer would be regarded as unnecessary and might be regarded as an abuse of authority.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan also wondered why four different categories of persons could be appointed as complaints referee.  It is really two categories, a judge or a practising lawyer.  It will simply widen the choice when the time comes for the appointment to be made.</P>
    <P>With those brief comments which I think cover most of the points raised, I thank Senators for their constructive and helpful contributions and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>(1)  That it is expedient in order to provide formal structures within the parliamentary framework for the discussion of foreign policy matters that a Joint Committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas (which shall be called the Joint Committee on Foreign Policy) consisting of seven Members of Seanad Éireann and eight Members of Dáil Éireann be appointed to review, examine and report to each House with its recommendations on all aspects of foreign policy of the State including&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  the establishment and maintenance of good relations with countries with which Ireland has commercial and diplomatic dealings,</P>
      <P>(ii)  the special relationship of Ireland with countries in the Developing World,</P>
      <P>(iii)  the welfare and rights of Irish citizens abroad,</P>
      <P>(iv)  the international dimensions of the concept of Human Rights,</P>
      <P>(v)  policy with regard to International trade,</P>
      <P>(vi)  policy positions adopted on behalf of the State in the United Nations General Assembly and other such International Assemblies,</P>
      <P>(vii)  Ireland's position with regard to neutrality and nonalignment.</P>
      <P>(2)  That the Joint Committee shall have power to appoint sub-committees and to refer to such sub-committees any matters comprehended by paragraph (1) of this resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  That provision be made for the appointment of substitutes to act for <Col N="802" /> Members of the Joint Committee or each sub-committee who are unable to attend particular meetings.</P>
    <P>(4)  That the Joint Committee and each sub-committee, previous to the commemcement of business, shall elect one of its Members to be Chairman, who shall have only one vote.</P>
    <P>(5)  That all questions in the Joint Committee and in each sub-committee shall be determined by a majority of votes of the Members present and voting and in the event of there being an equality of votes the question shall be decided in the negative.</P>
    <P>(6)  That the Joint Committee on each sub-committee shall have power to send for persons, papers and records and, subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance, to engage the services of persons with specialist or technical knowledge to assist it for the purpose of particular inquiries.</P>
    <P>(7)  That any Member of either House may attend and be heard in the proceedings of the Joint Committee or in each sub-committee without having a right to vote, subject to the prior consent of the Joint Committee or the sub-committee as the case may be.</P>
    <P>(8)  That the Joint Committee and each sub-committee shall have power to print and publish from time to time minutes of evidence taken before it together with such related documents as it thinks fit.</P>
    <P>(9)  That every report of the Joint Committee shall on adoption by the Joint Committee, be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas forthwith whereupon the Joint Committee shall be empowered to print and publish such report together with such related documents as it thinks fit.</P>
    <P>(10)  That no document relating to matters comprehended by paragraph (1) of this resolution received by the Clerk to the Joint Committee or to each sub-committee shall be withdrawn or altered without the knowledge <Col N="803" /> and approval of the Joint Committee or the sub-committee as the case may be.</P>
    <P>(11)  That the quorum of the Joint Committee shall be four of whom at least one shall be a Member of Seanad Éireann and one shall be a Member of Dáil Éireann and that the quorum of each sub-committee shall be three at least one of whom shall be a Member of Seanad Éireann and one a Member of Dáil Éireann.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, to the House. It gave me particular pleasure when he was appointed to this important Government post, it is good to have a man of principle and honour and long standing commitment to the area of foreign affairs occupying this position and he has already given certain important commitments in the area.</P>
    <P>I would not want it to be thought that this is a redundant motion, although this House has already debated it at least twice.  In 1988 I put down virtually the same motion and it was previously discussed in 1986 in the name of the then Senator Michael D. Higgins.  I do not think it is redundant because we have not yet entirely moved on, despite being slightly gazumped last weekend by a Government announcement that they intend to create a foreign affairs committee. I look forward with eager anticipation to the Minister giving us some details with regard to its establishment, its constitution and in particular whether there will be proper representation from this House.  I would like the Minister also to give us a clear timetable.  If, as I hope and anticipate, the Minister is able to be his usual clear, lucid, self and give factual information to the House on these matters, then I will be sufficiently tempted not to move my resolution to a vote, although I would regret not doing so because it is an expediency motion and if passed in this House would have certain consequences.</P>
    <P>I will listen with great interest to what the Minister has to say because this <Col N="804" /> announcement of intent was made also by the same Government under a different Taoiseach.  The offer was subsequently withdrawn because of a wrangle between the Taoiseach and a former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Lenihan, and was put on hold.  Unless there is some clear and specific information with regard to a timescale, I will reluctantly have to put the motion to the House.  I do not flatter myself that the intention of this gazumping manoeuvre was to gazump either myself or this motion in the Seanad; it was clearly aimed, as was the rest of that statement, at the Progressive Democrats and their annual conference in Waterford.  As it apparently failed to derail them, so also has it failed to derail me.</P>
    <P>In the aftermath of the previous debate on the establishment of a foreign affairs committee in 1988, I detected throughout the House general agreement that such a foreign affairs committee was an essential ingredient in the political life of a civilised State.  Everybody recognised that Ireland was virtually the only European country that did not possess such a committee. Agreement was so general that I spoke with other Members of this House and of the other House, including Deputy Michael Higgins and the present Minister, and we established an <i>ad hoc</i> committee on foreign affairs.  I am very glad to be able to remind the Minister that he attended the first couple of meetings of that committee, as did Deputy Kitt who is now Minister of State, but subsequently, with a degree of reluctance, withdrew from participation in that committee.</P>
    <P>The committee performed a useful service as a ginger group, discussed a number of important matters and received delegations from various international bodies.  I am sure the Minister's participation in our <i>ad hoc</i> committee will lend strength to his desire to have such a committee formally and properly established.</P>
    <P>I refer to the fact that this is an expediency motion and it is important that it should be recognised that it was framed specifically on these lines for technical reasons.  If it were passed by this House, <Col N="805" /> a message would be sent to the Dáil and if they consented, that would lead to the automatic establishment of such a committee. On the other hand if it were passed in this House and the Dáil refused to accept the position of the Seanad and did not decide to join the Seanad in such a committee, it would then be within the remit of Seanad Éireann to establish a separate committee of this House alone to deal with foreign affairs.  This is a salient reason it was formed as an expediency motion.</P>
    <P>The matters under consideration are listed in the preamble to the motion, including the establishment and maintenance of good relations with countries with which Ireland has commercial and diplomatic dealings because one recognises the importance of commerce in international relations.  I believe the Minister will agree that there is more to international relations than commercial considerations.  I will return to this in dealing with certain specific instances, such as the troubled question of East Timor which is being greatly neglected and with which I know the Minister is familiar.</P>
    <P>On occasions I raised issues of foreign affairs in this House and the Minister will know that this House has a particular regard for matters of foreign affairs; if you look at the Order Paper and the Supplementary Order Paper you will see again and again items dealing with foreign affairs.</P>
    <P>When I raised the beef deals with Iraq I was told from the Government side that what I was suggesting might be a moral and principled position but a rhetorical question was left hanging in the air &mdash; could Ireland afford this position?  If one telescopes those two phrases one comes up with the interesting question of whether Ireland can afford to take a moral and principled stand in foreign affairs?  We can.  One of the functions of this committee would be to determine the ideological or idealistic basis for our foreign policy.  What are the principles that should guide the foreign policy of this small but influential country?  I say with great respect to the Minister because <Col N="806" /> I do not think it is a lesson he needs to learn, that often if one takes a long term view the principled stand is also the most economically beneficial one.  There is a certain, wry smile on my face when I recall that debate on beef deals with Iraq when we did not choose to take a principled or idealistic stand because we regarded our commercial interest so highly, and yet now we are left with something like £161 million of export credit guarantee defaults.  It has cost us dear not to take a principled foreign policy stand.</P>
    <P>In our relations with Libya, it is humiliating that we did not issue stronger protests to Colonel Ghadaffi when we found that we were caught like a pawn in relations between Libya and Great Britain, when Colonel Ghadaffi in order to irritate, embarrass and prejudice the interest of Great Britain made large quantities of arms and explosives available to subversive organisations here.  At that stage I suggested in this House that we break off diplomatic relations with Libya.</P>
    <P>It is also interesting that we have apparently good diplomatic relations with Iran despite continuing human rights abuses in that country and elsewhere about which we appear to be relatively untroubled.  I am not an admirer of Saddam Hussein but when I look at Kuwait I detect a suspicious perpendicularity about its borders which indicates to me that a line was drawn around the economic interests of western industrialised countries and a small State artificially established, within which there was no concern for human rights. Nor is there concern for human rights in Iraq which brings me to what should be an important foreign policy principle towards which we should move in fora such as United Nations.  It has been clearly demonstrated throughout this century that it is not sufficient for international organisations merely to guarantee the rights of nations as established by treaty while ignoring human rights guarantees for individual citizens composing those states.  We should make concern for fundamental human rights <Col N="807" /> a directing notion of our foreign policy which I hope the Minister will accept.</P>
    <P>Time is limited, so I will move on to a couple of points about the technical text of the motion.  Paragraph 6 says &ldquo;That the Joint Committee and each sub-committee shall have power to send for persons, papers and records and, subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance, to engage the services of persons with specialist or technical knowledge to assist it for the purpose of particular inquiries&rdquo;. I hope that the Minister will include such a paragraph in the establishment of a foreign affairs committee; it is important that a committee should have power to request or, if possible, to require persons to attend so that they may be made accountable and questions directed to them to establish if the principles I have enunciated underlie our foreign policy. This would not lead to the dangerous disclosure of sensitive diplomatic material.</P>
    <P>With regard to accountability and responsibility, I was amazed to learn during the progress of the Goodman Beef Tribunal that whatever the impact of this on the other House of the Oireachtas, a private individual, Mr. Larry Goodman, was able to direct the Irish Ambassador in Baghdad with regard to what commercial policy he could take on board.  I would like to believe that this House of elected representatives together with the other House would have at least as much impact on Irish foreign policy and the conduct of its ambassadorial staff as a private individual who happens to be a captain of industry.  Accountability is a very important element.</P>
    <P>East Timor was invaded on 7 December 1975, ten days after the Independent State of East Timor had been established and before that country could attain international diplomatic recognition through the United Nations, although ten countries did so recognise it.  In 1975 on 22 December the UN Security Council unanimously called upon the State of Indonesia to withdraw.  This chimes in clearly with what I have been saying about the principles and ideals which <Col N="808" /> should underline foreign affairs policy. The cynical policy of the United Kingdom Government as disclosed in a leaked telegram from the British Ambassador in Djakarta to the Foreign Office in July 1975 indicates the dangers that prevail when principle goes out the window.  The telegram reads:</P>
    <P>The territory seems likely to become steadily more of a problem child and the arguments in favour of integration into Indonesia are all the stronger. Certainly as seen from here it is in Britain's interest that Indonesia should absorb the territory as soon and as unobtrusively as possible and that if it comes to the crunch and there is a row in the United Nations we should keep our heads down and avoid taking sides against the Indonesian Government.</P>
    <P>I end by indicating the existence also of a message from the Australian Ambassador in Djakarta which goes as follows:</P>
    <P>This Department might well have an interest in closing the present gap in the agreed sea border and this could be much more readily negotiated with Indonesia than with Portugal or Independent Portuguese Timor.</P>
    <P>I know I am recommending a pragmatic rather than a principled stand, but that is what national interest and foreign policy is all about.</P>
    <P>I know that this is not what the Minister believes it to be all about.  Can I end by saying, it is a tragic irony that this situation is worsening day by day and was critically worsening just as the Gulf War adventure was being embarked upon by the western powers in the interest of their oil resources.  Because of oil in East Timor, western powers were prepared to take a pragmatic rather than a principled stand while they dressed up their concern about the Gulf in all kinds of unbelievable statements about the defence of human rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  The establishment of a joint foreign affairs committee has been long <Col N="809" /> desired by many Deputies and Senators. There may be an element of playing games here but the aspiration is genuine. That is why we did form for a brief time an <i>ad hoc</i> committee which was obviously unsatisfactory but which Senator Norris said kept the interest alive.</P>
      <P>I can understand why there should be vested interests against the establishment of a Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs. Every profession likes to mystify itself and diplomats and Iveagh House civil servants are no exception.  There is a long standing tradition in this country according to which people are told in a patriarchal and authoritarian fashion: &ldquo;This is a bit above your heads, you would not understand this, it is not for the likes of you to be bothering your head about.&rdquo;  It is understandable that people should want to retain this closed and charmed circle and resistance to the establishment of this joint committee has been long and adamant.  The last Taoiseach contemplated the establishment of such a committee only when, for a time, it looked as if the chairmanship would be an expedient way of rewarding services rendered.  Like Senator Norris, I am glad the recent announcement has been made. I do not think it renders our motion superfluous, particularly with the Minister present to elaborate on what has been promised.</P>
      <P>I know there are sensible reasons for opposing a foreign affairs committee.  A stock objection is that foreign affairs are delicate matters and where negotiations of great and delicate importance are involved, it might not be desirable to have an open parliamentary committee discussing what could be better negotiated behind closed doors.  There is something in that, but it does not weigh against the desirability for democratic accountability in this as in every other area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In education, for example, we are beginning to have this democratic accountability in line with what I take to be the spirit of this Government and, at last, there may be Oireachtas responsibility in foreign affairs.  If we had had an Oireachtas joint committee on foreign <Col N="810" /> affairs in operation monitoring what was going on, that wretched Protocol, which is now such a headache to all of us and which was inserted through the hole and corner diplomacy which has been defended for so long in this country, would never have arisen because it would not have been accepted by a responsible Oireachtas joint committee.  That is a good example of the advantages of such a committee.</P>
    <P>I understood when the promise was made recently to set up the Joint Committee that it would subsume the existing Joint Committee on European Community Affairs, of which I am a member. I am not sure that that is a good idea because there is a world outside the European Community in which we have many interests.  If the European Union becomes a fact, then a question mark must be raised about the need for diplomatic establishments in member states ultimately.  Why, for example, should we have an ambassador in Spain, admirable person that he is &mdash; I experienced his hospitality the other week &mdash; if we are part of the same Union?  If ambassadors are people who are sent abroad to lie for their country, then according to the theory and spirit of the European Union, Spain is not abroad anymore.  Whether we should merge our European diplomatic interests with wider global interests is very questionable.</P>
    <P>Many of us fear that our wider foreign affairs interests will be lost sight of in a close European Union.  That fear stems from an unarticulated feeling that Ireland's interests are not confined to Europe, but extend to the wider world. Foreign affairs, as Senator Norris said, are not remote and arcane; frequently it is bread and butter and, above all, it is independence.  Pandit Nehru said some time in the fifties, &ldquo;Independence is foreign affairs&rdquo; and that is what Robert Emmet had in mind when he spoke about his country taking its place among the nations of the earth.  For all these reasons it may well be questioned whether we should merge European affairs with the wider interests which, I hope, we will continue to sustain.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="811" /> The motion may be optimistic in hoping that the joint committee will comprise seven Members of Seanad Éireann and eight Members of Dáil Éireann. Relations between the two Houses may well be strained in the next few weeks for other reasons, and the Dáil may not be prepared to contemplate such a large Seanad representation.  We live in hope. I ask the Minister to transcend the narrow interests of party politics and to recognise that there is considerable expertise in foreign affairs on the Independent benches; perhaps we may be represented on this committee.  I hope the Minister will elaborate on the Government announcement and I am glad to see the Minister in that particular chair.</P>

      <P>Senators may regret they gave me the extra time but I will do my best to justify the confidence they have placed in me.  It is a pleasure for me to be back in the Seanad after so many years; I think the last time I was here was in a junior ministerial capacity in 1979.  I appreciate the motion and the movers of the motion, Senators Norris and O'Toole; obviously Senator O'Toole is on other business and Senator Murphy took on his role.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that in setting up any foreign affairs committee the wisdom and experience of Independent Senators should be availed of.  In any Parliament, either Seanad or Dáil, Independent Members have a tremendous role to play and in my 27 years in the Lower House I have felt that they do not receive sufficient recognition in their roles as Senators in the House and on committees. They have not got a fair shake over the years.  That is a personal opinion and personal opinions get Ministers into trouble.</P>
      <P>As far as Senator Norris's reference to East Timor is concerned, I am well aware of the problem there.  I addressed the Indonesian Ambassador on that subject when I invited him to my Department from London some time ago to express my deep concern about what was happening there.  I expressed my views in a very trenchant fashion and left him in no doubt as to where we stood in relation to what we considered to be an attack on human rights there.  The Senator can rest easy on that one.  It is one thing to express concerns and another to take action but I am pursuing the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the possibility of the Seanad setting up a foreign affairs committee on its own is concerned, I do not think you will have to go through the procedural convulsions outlined.  I do not say that in a disrespectful way.  When they hear what I have to say, I think both Senators Norris and Senator Murphy will be quite happy that what has been called for since 1988 <Col N="813" /> will become a reality in 1992.  I am very keen to have a Foreign Affairs Committee and to spread the load of foreign policy throughout the Upper and Lower Houses of the Oireachtas.  I feel very strongly about this.  The Seanad will not have to wait too long for such a committee to be set up.  The composition of the committee, as between Senators and Deputies, would be a matter for the Whips because it will be an Oireachtas joint committee.</P>
    <P>I would like to say at the outset how pleased I am to address the Seanad for the first time in my capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I am aware that many stimulating and thought provoking debates on foreign policy issues have taken place in this House over the years and I hope that this is the first of many opportunities I will have to contribute to your deliberations.</P>
    <P>The case for the establishment of a Oireachtas Joint Foreign Affairs Committee has been persuasively made in a number of earlier Seanad debates.  It is, therefore, particularly apt that I should come before you to confirm the commitment of the Government to the early establishment of such a committee.  Consultations on the terms of reference of the proposed committee are proceeding and I hope that agreed terms of reference can be put before both Houses in the very near future.</P>
    <P>Ireland is unique among the countries of the European Community in not having had a parliamentary committee dealing with foreign affairs.  The absence of such a committee is related to our more general problem of developing structures to permit parliamentarians to have an adequate input into the formulation of public policy.  This is something which the Government are determined to correct through the package of Oireachtas reform measures announced by the Taoiseach last week.  I have been long convinced that foreign affairs is an obvious area for a parliamentary committee, particularly in view of the considerable degree of common ground that exists among members of both Houses on foreign policy issues.  Such other mechanisms <Col N="814" /> as currently exist for raising foreign policy issues &mdash; I am thinking in particular of parliamentary questions &mdash; do not always encourage the emergence of this common ground.</P>
    <P>My hope is that, in a Foreign Affairs Committee, the issues with which Ireland is faced internationally can be fully debated in a calm and rational atmosphere with a view to establishing as broad an area of agreement as possible.  Though legitimate differences of opinion are bound to emerge on certain issues, I am confident that, on most of the important issues that face us in the international arena, a considerable degree of consensus will exist.  Where such a consensus cannot be found in the proposed Foreign Affairs Committee, it is likely to be on issues where it is useful that opposing points of view be fully explored and that the Government of the day should tread carefully before coming down on one side or another of the argument.  I think that addresses in a fair way a concern expressed by Professor Murphy that there are areas in foreign affairs which would be confined specifically to the Government alone for reasons well known to everybody.  In the main, my view is that when it comes to foreign affairs, as far as possible, everything should be on the table.</P>
    <P>I believe that some of the controversies that have arisen in the foreign affairs area in the past have been at least partly due to lack of full information on both the substance of the issues and the constraints under which any Government must operate on matters which affect their relations with the outside world.  A Foreign Affairs Committee provides an opportunity for a representative group of Members, drawn from both Houses, to develop an in-depth knowledge of the issues that arise for Ireland in the international arena; this in turn is bound to lead to a more informed debate on foreign policy issues in both Houses.</P>
    <P>We already have experience of the useful work that can be done by committees in the foreign affairs area.  As has been stated by Senators Norris and Murphy, the Oireachtas Joint Committee <Col N="815" /> on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities have, for many years, provided an indispensable service in examining, on behalf of the Oireachtas, the huge volume of secondary legislation emanating from the European Communities.  The reports produced by the committee over the years have served to keep Members of both Houses, and the public at large, informed on significant issues arising for this country from implementation of European Community legislation.</P>
    <P>In their seventh report, the committee expressed the view that their terms of reference were too restrictive and did not allow them to consider broader issues arising from Ireland's membership of the European Communities.  The report, therefore, recommended that the joint committee be reconstituted as a European Affairs Committee with power to examine all proposals affecting the Community's development.  This proposal was made before the issue of a Foreign Affairs Committee was seriously on the table.  The issue of whether such a reconstituted committee could co-exist with a Foreign Affairs Committee without running the risk of extensive overlapping was, therefore, not considered in the report.</P>
    <P>With the gradual expansion of the areas of competence of the European Community &mdash; formally marked by the Single European Act and now by the Treaty on European Union &mdash; most areas of what is traditionally regarded as foreign policy will now come within the scope of Twelve co-operation under the provisions relating to the common foreign and security policy.  There is a commitment by all member states &mdash; a commitment which will be further strengthened under the terms of the Treaty on European Union &mdash; to try to reach common positions on all foreign policy issues, whether arising in relations with individual countries or within the United Nations or other international organisations.  Thus, the Twelve have evolved joint policies in relation to issues as diverse as the Middle East conflict, <Col N="816" /> Cambodia, and human rights questions arising in international fora and East Timor to which Senator Norris has quite properly referred.</P>
    <P>These policies are being constantly refined and updated in the light of new developments in a process of intensive consultation between member states. This process gives Ireland an opportunity to contribute with our particular views and outlook to the development of a Common European Policy while, at the same time, requiring us to adhere to common policies once they have been agreed on.</P>
    <P>In this situation, a broadly based European Community Affairs Committee with power to examine all proposals affecting the community's development would, in practice, have the power to examine most of the issues that a Foreign Affairs Committee at its widest would be expected to examine.  Because of this and with a view to avoiding the possibility of extensive duplication of effort, the Government favour the establishment of a broadly based Foreign Affairs Committee which would subsume the expanded mandate which was proposed for a European Community Affairs Committee. The proposed committee would thus continue the vital work of overseeing EC secondary legislation while also being free to examine at their own pace broader policy issues related to Ireland's membership of the European Community and Irish foreign policy in general.  It would be for the committee to decide how to organise their work so as to strike a balance between their detailed work on EC secondary legislation and their broader policy work.</P>
    <P>As I stated already, it is my hope that there will be early agreement on the establishment and terms of reference of the committee so that it can get to work as soon as possible.  I am sorry that, in response to Senator Norris's request, I cannot give him the terms of reference of the committee at this stage; however I can tell him that the terms of reference are with the Whips.  That is the present position and they will be produced as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="817" /> I think of how useful it would be if, for example, such a committee were already in existence and able to examine the implications for this country of the Maastricht Treaty.  A report from a broadly based Oireachtas Foreign Affairs Committee on this issue would, I am sure, command respect and help to remove some of the misunderstandings that have bedevilled the debate on the Treaty up to now and solve the problem &mdash; which I will not mention &mdash; that Senators raised.</P>
    <P>As to other areas which might usefully be examined by a Foreign Affairs Committee, I would suggest that this is a matter for further detailed consideration on an inter-party basis.  However, one example which comes to mind &mdash; and one in which I am personally very interested &mdash; is that of Ireland's relationship with developing countries.  Members of this House will not need to be reminded of the valuable work done by the Former Joint Committee on Co-operation with Developing Countries.  I believe that the committee's work helped to develop a considerable measure of agreement on what Ireland's policy with developing countries should be and that reports were a valuable contribution to public debate on development co-operation issues.  The work of the former committee, taken together with the continuing work of the EC secondary legislation committee, has established a standard against which the work of the proposed new foreign affairs committee will be judged.</P>
    <P>Foreign policy formulation in today's circumstances poses perhaps a greater challenge than at any time in our past. Membership of the European Community has obliged us to take positions on issues which, in the years before we joined the Community, might have been dealt with by us in the United Nations at a very general level &mdash; if we dealt with them at all.  The Community's deep involvement in the efforts to find a peaceful outcome to the Yugoslav crisis is a graphic illustration of the gradual extension of the scope of European Foreign policy.  In this situation &mdash; as also in the case of the disintegration of the Soviet Union &mdash; the European Community and <Col N="818" /> its member states have found themselves beaking new ground in terms of active involvement in a crisis and having to make decisions on very important issues, such as the recognition of new states, within a time frame largely dictated by outside events.  The new possibilities for joint action in the foreign policy area set out in the Maastricht Treaty, and the major events happening on the Community's &ldquo;back door&rdquo; in Eastern Europe, all point to an expansion of this type of hands-on Community involvement.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely crucial that the pressure of day-to-day events does not lead us to neglect the long term perspective which is essential in the foreign affairs area.  I believe that the proposed Foreign Affairs Committee can play a very valuable role in putting day-to-day decisions in such a long term perspective, answering the basic question: what do these decisions, taken together, mean for Ireland's fundamental foreign policy interests?  Do the decisions taken jointly with our partners in the European Community adequately reflect our national approach to international issues?  Where, in any particular situation, should the balance be struck between adherence to important general principles and recognition of the compromises that the realities may seem to impose?  In cases of conflict between the general principles we espouse &mdash; for example in relations with developing countries &mdash; and our narrow and more direct economic interest, how are we to evaluate the competing considerations?</P>
    <P>That comes down to the fundamental point raised by Senators Norris and Murphy: whither Irish foreign policy? Where are we going?  How do we state our position?  How do we articulate it?  I believe this committee will be of tremendous assistance in that regard.  In the past there have been many complaints that we do not have a foreign policy.  I would not agree with that.  We do have a foreign policy; it is important that we tell people what it is and let them know in what direction that policy is going.</P>
    <P>With regard to the suggestion that Iveagh House is a charmed place, let me say that it is populated by people of the <Col N="819" /> highest calibre and character, people who know their business; representatives of countries taking on the Presidency of the European Community come to Iveagh House arising from the experience of our Presidency.  We have people of the very highest quality there, people that Ireland can be justly proud of both at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>In the final analysis, the operational decisions in the foreign policy area fall to be taken by the Government of the day. As Senator Murphy said, it would not be appropriate or acceptable for a Foreign Affairs committee to try to curtail the necessary freedom of action that a Government must enjoy in the foreign policy sphere if vital national interests are to be protected.  It would be unrealistic, and indeed unwise, to expect that a Foreign Affairs Committee should operate without regard for this fundamental fact.  However, to recognise that constraints exist is in no way to diminish the important role that a committee can play in bringing clarity and openness to the discussion of fundamental foreign policy issues and ensuring that the matters on which a decision must be taken are fully aired and that they are understood by public opinion.</P>
    <P>In summary, I approach the establishment of a Foreign Affairs Committee in a very positive way.  I am deeply conscious of the fact that it is through our foreign policy formulation that we define our position in the world and I look forward to drawing on the advice and experience of colleagues from both houses in making the difficult choices that are so often involved.</P>
    <P>In the best interests of co-operation and the future emergence of a Foreign Policy Committee which is acceptable to all parties in both Houses I would deem it a great honour and privilege if Senator Norris would not push the matter to a vote.</P>

      <P>I extend a very warm welcome to the Minister, Deputy Andrews, on his first visit to the Seanad as Minister for Foreign Affairs.  On behalf of the Fine Gael Party I welcome his statement and his commitment to the establishment of a Foreign Affairs Committee.</P>
      <P>Over the past 19 years I have had the greatest admiration and respect for our diplomatic service and for the civil servants in the Department of Foreign Affairs.  For the eight or nine years I served in the European Parliament their input was very visible.  I agree with the Minister; we can rightly be proud of his Department.  I wish him every success in the very onerous task he has undertaken.</P>
      <P>A properly constituted Foreign Affairs Committee can make an important contribution to the policies of the European Community after European Union and the European Monetary Union become effective.  This is of the greatest urgency and importance.  We have, at present, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation, but the Minister recognises that, in the main, the vast majority of the work of that committee refers to regulations that have already been enacted.  The committee do not have an opportunity of representing the views of the plain people of Ireland or of the membership of the Oireachtas in their policy statements.  I would like to underline that by referring to the motion on today's Order Paper:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann takes note of the Reports: Developments in the European Communities &mdash; 32nd, 33rd, 34th, 35th, 36th (Irish Presidency of the European Communities, January-June 1990), 37th and 38th Reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 32nd Report covers the first half of 1988.  The 1972 European Act gave the House a right and a statutory obligation to discuss at six monthly intervals the activities, operations and developments of the European Community.  Through the whole of the last four years during <Col N="821" /> which there was so much movement, development, so many new policies and new trends in the European Community, we have had no opportunity to discuss those activities and developments.  I welcome the expanding role Europe has undertaken.  During the period of the Gulf War, there were huge changes in the Common Agricultural Policy and competition policy, and during the same period we had the second Russian Revolution.</P>
    <P>During the Irish Presidency of the Commission, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Collins, travelled all over the world and did a great job for the EC but Oireachtas representatives had no opportunity to comment on what he was doing or to say whether the policies he espoused not just on behalf of the Community but on behalf of the Irish people, were of any great interest to the people of Ireland.  The new committee will be a very important forum to which the Minister will make a significant contribution. He is a highly skilled and experienced public representative and I look forward to his taking a positive role on the international stage.</P>
    <P>Ireland is one of the very few democracies represented entirely by civil servants at the General Assembly of the United Nations each autumn.  That is not true of any of the EC states.  We have representation in the Council of Europe and the IPU, but the Western European Union must also be of some interest to this country.  There is also the Nordic Council.  While we are not in that region, nevertheless, as an exporting State and economic entity, we should be conscious of the way they are thinking.  I am aso looking very closely at the activities in the European Community.  Members of the Oireachtas could make a useful contribution to the work of different councils in Europe but they would need to specialise. If we are to go to the expense of having such representation, there must be something in it for the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a greater commercial role being played by our diplomatic service.  I know that the <Col N="822" /> Department, like every other Department, do not get enough cash.  Senator Murphy asked whether we need diplomatic representation in each of the 11 member states, but there are still some countries where we need additional listening posts.  I do not think it appropriate that we should have only one or two embassies in southern America; I doubt if that is sufficient.  Having regard to the fact that the developing countries recognise our status in international affairs, we have a greater role to play there.  Ireland's input to the Third World has been spiritual.  I do not denigrate the great work of missionary or lay volunteers whose work continues.</P>
    <P>It is a tragedy that at present there are famines in seven or eight African countries which do not warrant even a line in the newspapers.  A Foreign Affairs Committee would be able to send out small delegations to those countries to highlight the problems.  We are not even making progress towards the target of .07 per cent of GNP set for our contribution to the developing world.  We need to have a greater grasp of the necessity to make a meaningful contribution to the Third World.</P>
    <P>A Foreign Affairs Committee would be able to play a role in areas where human rights are violated, and excesses of cruelty or barbarity are carried out in the name of freedom.  The oppressed do not care if they get a kick from a left jackboot or a right jackboot.  I would like to see our country defending the basic human rights and freedoms of minorities across the world.  We have the ability to do that.  We should demonstrate our generosity by making a contribution to level the playing pitch.  We should not be afraid to take on any Government, whether perceived as friend or foe. Wherever there is cruelty or brutality, we should be prepared to take a stand on human rights.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him on the fine work he has done to date.  We have had very good Foreign Ministers but this Minister must be commended on the <Col N="823" /> magnificent impression he has made since taking office.  He is welcomed by all sides and admired.  He has a fairly rough task facing him but I am sure he will handle it admirably.</P>
      <P>If the motion needs to be seconded, I will do so.  I compliment the Government on taking this stand and agreeing to establish a Foreign Affairs Committee. The great advantage would be to permit an open and frank discussion of issues affecting our relations with other states or, as the Minister said, to explore and develop an in-depth knowledge of the issues that arise for Ireland in the international arena.  I welcome the Minister's statement that everything would be on the table; I trust that would extend to our relations with our nearest neighbour.</P>
      <P>The Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Community have done tremendous work over the years and produced many reports.  I have the impression, however, that sometimes these reports are a little late in coming forward.  I hope that any new foreign affairs committee would have an active secretariat and once information was developed, it would come forward in report form fairly quickly because foreign affairs is a very dynamic area.</P>
      <P>The Minister pointed out that if such a committee existed at the moment it would be a great help in examining the implications of the Maastricht Treaty; it might have helped the great debate.  I believe we are being sidetracked to some extent by issues which are of national importance but which are peripheral to the great debate we should be having on becoming a part of a huge union which was established to prevent war.  We have had peace in Europe since the end of the Second World War; people forget this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such a committee could examine Ireland's relationship with developing countries and eastern European countries, with whom we have just begun to establish relationships.  The Hungarian Ambassador, Dr. Istvan Pataki and his second in command Dr. Gabor Foldvari have done fantastic work since they came <Col N="824" /> here just over a year ago and they have endeared themselves to the Irish people. The new Polish Ambassador, Mr. Bryll has also done great work.</P>
    <P>A Foreign Affairs Committee could discuss many issues, for example, our relations with smaller nations like the Republic of San Marino.  We could meet with people like Lao-Sheng Huang who is the Taipei economic and cultural office representative, a marvellous man who has very warm feelings for Ireland.  We could discuss our relations with the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of Malta which exchanges ambassadors with 46 countries, though, unfortunately, not with Ireland.  This organisation does tremendous charitable work.  All these matters could be examined by the Foreign Affairs Committee.</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested in the establishment of such a committee because, although many important foreign affairs issues are discussed by Government, other important issues, such as the Order of Malta which is a juridical body in its own right, are not. A Foreign Affairs Committee would have an important role to play in advising and informing as well as recommending and studying proposals for the establishment of relationships with such bodies.  They could meet people whom, the Government for various reasons, might not be able to meet, for example, representatives from Northern Cyprus. There are problems in Cyprus at present which are not very different from the problems here.  This committee could meet representatives from both sides and, perhaps, prepare a report for the Minister and the Government.</P>
    <P>I accept that at the end of the day any committee is just a committee and while this committee could do useful work by producing reports, meeting people from foreign countries and, perhaps, visiting foreign countries, it remains for the Government to govern and the committee to do the work.  The Minister said that in the final analysis the operational decisions in the area of foreign policy should be taken by the Government of <Col N="825" /> the day.  I would not disagree with that, irrespective of the work completed by a Foreign Affairs Committee.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of this committee, in particular, the warm approach of the Minister.  He is the first Minister to contact us and say that his office will be available to help us in any way; he deserves great credit for this.  I look forward to the establishment of this committee and I am glad that the Minister has included Members from both Houses.  We have been pushing for this committee for a long time and at last our voices have been heard.  I welcome the Minister, I welcome the proposal and I hope the establishment of this committee is not too far off.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the amendment and the motion because for many years I have been seeking a Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  On many occasions, as Leader, I had to turn down motions to have this committee established. Nevertheless, at all times I was in favour of its establishment.  It is particularly important that a country like Ireland which, though small, has an influence abroad, which we should not forget, an influence we gained because we are one of the few non-colonial countries in the European Community.  It is of great significance when travelling to Third World countries and to countries outside Europe and the United States that we are accepted as a non-colonial country.  It is important when we are trying to help, whether in peacekeeping missions, in the reduction of tension or in bringing conflicting parties together, that we show that we do not have an axe to grind; our aim is to create an atmosphere in which people can sit down and resolve their problems peacefully as we would like to see all problems resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of this committee because a political input into foreign affairs is extremely important.  I am not suggesting that there has not been a political input into foreign affairs in the past, but that input has been at Government and ministerial level, and, for the <Col N="826" /> most part, there has been a professional input from Department officials.  While they are well versed in the areas for which they have responsibility, nevertheless, they are not politicians, they are not perceived as politicians and the professional answer is not always the correct one; there has to be a political answer as well as a professional one.  The input of politicians is extremely important in foreign affairs matters and in the establishment of relations with developing and developed countries.  When travelling abroad, especially to developing and Third World countries, politicians are more respected than civil servants although the reverse may be true in certain areas.  Public servants, here are more respected than politicians and in some cases, they have a better standing in society.  Nevertheless, we must accept that politicians prefer to deal with other politicians.</P>
    <P>When establishing commercial relations with foreign countries we should not forget that many business people prefer to deal with politicians than civil servants.  The input of politicians in international trading policies will have to be taken into account if we are to succeed in developing our international trade.  I am not denigrating the work that has been done by our ambassadors abroad in terms of international trade.  Our excellent ambassadors work extremely hard. Although there has been criticism in this House, and in the other House, of various members of the diplomatic corps, we should not generalise.  Ambassador McCabe who has been the subject of some criticism, did tremendous work at the time of the Gulf War, not alone in his ambassadorial capacity but in the help he gave to people who were caught up in the Iraq-Kuwait conflict.  He assisted nurses, doctors and engineers from all over Ireland and, indeed, anybody who contacted him; his telephone line was open 24 hours of a day.  That is only one indication of the work that can be done at that level.  It has been brought home to me on many occasions when travelling abroad that the role of the Irish Parliament is important.  At times people feel <Col N="827" /> that the political aspects of international trade are ignored.</P>
    <P>The committee will have to address the role of our foreign representatives and embassies</P>
    <P>At a time when communications have changed so much in terms of faxes, telephone, satellite and air communications, the role of the ambassador as a diplomat has been lessened.  The PR element has grown to such an extent that some of the diplomatic corps abroad are there only to react to situations on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. They tend to socialise among the ambassadorial cliques and to take their political input from the diplomatic corps. Too often they do not know what is going on at street level, but they do know what is going on at diplomatic level.  Diplomatic contact is not political contact and, therefore, is not relevant to some of the areas in which they have been involved.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the imminent political integration of Europe it is important that we should have a strong Foreign Affairs Committee.  The Foreign Affairs Committee should have a major input into the foreign policy of the new integrated Europe.  As a small nation, we will have to use every resource so that our foreign policy is stressed in a political way at European level because our policy can sometimes be subsumed into the foreign policy proposals of other nations.  It will be difficult for us, as a nation, to succeed in having a major input.  I know the Minister is well versed in the need for such a committee.  I have seen the work he has done in attempting to address the human rights violations which have occurred particularly in the Middle East.</P>
    <P>One of the issues dealt with in the motion is the international dimension of the concept of human rights.  President Bush recently said there was a new order in the world and that human rights will have to be taken aboard.  Of course, President Bush and the Americans have not always adhered to the concept of human rights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I join other Members in welcoming the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, to the Seanad. I am particularly pleased to see him here this evening.  He will be one of the outstanding Ministers in this Government and I am confident he will leave his mark and, indeed, serve with distinction. Senator Norris said he will not press the motion to a vote this evening.  I welcome that.  I do not want to speculate why he would do such a thing, but I imagine it coincides with my own view &mdash; that he believes the Minister.  It is a great benefit to the Irish people that somebody of the Minister's calibre and undoubted ability is able to serve this country.  He understands the frustrations of backbenchers, people who have ability and who want to make a contribution but lack the forum in which to do so; he also understands the necessity for this committee and I have no doubt he will ensure that they are given the widest possible terms of reference.</P>
      <P>In common with many other Members, I have been seeking to have this committee established since I came into this House and the sooner that happens the better.  The chairman of the committee will have a great bearing on how the committee will develop in the months and years ahead.  I am just signalling at this stage the important role which the person leading that committee will have to play in ensuring that they get down to the business they should be about.  That will lay the foundation for what I believe will be one of the most important committees ever established, and in time they will go from strength to strength when it comes to being of assistance to the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee should always play a <Col N="829" /> very important part in the debate and political discussion on where this country should be heading in the international arena.  The area of foreign policy is a developing one and it will continue to develop as the world develops.  I have no doubt of the value of such a committee and I believe this Minister will listen carefully to what they have to say.  There may be times when the committee will be able to say things that might be difficult for Ministers to say, and I sincerely hope they will have the courage and confidence to voice their opinions on all issues relating to foreign affairs.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the immediate need for this committee has been referred to by the Minister in the context of the developing Europe.  That is the obvious and most tangible area where this country is and has been directly involved, and, undoubtedly, will be involved to a greater degree in the years ahead.  As more and faster integration occurs the need for further and more detailed discussion on all areas of foreign policy will be greater.  It is regrettable that throughout our membership of the European Community we lacked the opportunity in both Houses to be of assistance and service and to tease out issues.  I do not want to go into a long debate on our problems in relation to Maastricht but it highlights what could have been achieved by a foreign affairs committee.</P>
    <P>There is another wide range of issues which directly affect our involvement in the European Community, many of them, unfortunately, misrepresented or misunderstood, on which a joint committee representing all political parties and independents, could give a very clear signal to the public what is required.  The Irish people, by their nature, are conservative; they do not like change, particularly when the change process is under way and people do not understand what is happening.  Fear becomes the norm and issues which are extraneous to the core value issues become talked about more than the fundamental issues <Col N="830" /> themselves.  I look forward to the establishment of this committee.</P>
    <P>In relation to our involvement in Europe, I see this committee fulfilling a role in respect of our neutrality and common defence policies.  As somebody pointed out recently, if an opinion poll was held and people were asked a simple question about maintaining Ireland's neutrality, 70 per cent would vote yes. However, if the word &ldquo;neutrality&rdquo; was omitted and people were asked if Ireland should be part of a common defence policy, 70 per cent of the people would also agree with that.  Neutrality is not on the agenda for Maastricht and it should not be drawn into the debate on Maastricht. If a foreign affairs committee had been in existence, this issue could have been discussed and we could have looked at precisely what was involved.  In future treaties the questions of a common defence and Ireland's neutrality, and what we mean by it, will be to the front of the debate.  In advance of such a referendum, I look forward to the Committee on Foreign Affairs addressing such matters in a calm and cool manner.</P>
    <P>Ireland's neutrality has a value and should be part of any discussions on defence.  Because one wants to go into that forum for discussion, that does not in any way negate the value of one's neutrality.  As a nation, we have an important contribution to make because of our long history of neutrality.  I want to signal areas where the value of this Foreign Affairs Committee can be of great benefit.  Hopefully this committee will not deal with the philosophical viewpoint and the intangibles, but will give a sense of real value to the ordinary people.</P>
    <P>Other areas causing concern &mdash; more so in other countries &mdash; in the debate on Maastricht are migration, jobs and the movement of people within the European Community.  Here, too, there is a practical role to be played by a Foreign Affairs committee.  They could examine these issues, perhaps not the actual job creation but the movement of people.  In <Col N="831" /> this way, ordinary people, particularly our highly educated young people could have their questions answered before problems develop.  We have some very able MEPs in Europe and it is amazing that we do not have a forum where they can discuss with us their role in Europe. I am not suggesting that they should be Members of this committee, but they should have some direct involvement and bring in their experience, expertise and knowledge of Europe to such a forum when we are dealing specifically with European matters.  We must utilise all the talent available to us.  It strikes me as nonsensical that we do not yet have a forum where our MEPs can discuss with us their role in Europe.</P>
    <P>I hope I will have another opportunity to talk on this matter.  I welcome the establishment of this committee and I have the utmost confidence in the leadership provided by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I have no doubt he will serve this Government with great distinction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister on his first visit to the House as Minister and congratulate him on his promotion to the Cabinet.  I salute his magnificent efforts over the years in the area of foreign affairs while he was a backbencher in the Dáil.  His work in Third World and other areas is well known and he is to be commanded for his magnificent contribution in the area of foreign affairs over the years.  It is encouraging that a man of his calibre is now Minister for Foreign Affairs and I wish him well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to add my voice in support of the establishment of this Committee on Foreign Affairs, a committee that I and many others have advocated for many years.  It is encouraging to get a positive and clear message from the Minister that this committee will be established at an early date.  The committee's terms of reference should be established as a matter of urgency and the committee should be put in place as quickly as possible.  I welcome <Col N="832" /> the fact that this will be a joint committee.  Excellent contributions will be made by members of both Houses to ensure the effective working of this committee.</P>
    <P>The committee will have an important function to perform in the movement of people, referred to by the previous speaker, and in the promotion of trade and acting as an effective ambassador in conjunction with the Minister for Foreign Affairs on behalf of this country.  As already indicated we are unique in that we are the only EC country without a Foreign Affairs Committee.  With an expanding Europe it is vital that we have an effective body to liaise on behalf of Ireland with other countries, in conjunction with the good efforts of our Minister for Foreign Affairs and his Department.  However there is a limit to what any Minister or Department can do. A Foreign Affairs Committee, representative of the two Houses will do great work to further our position in Europe, a Europe that is likely to get larger as the time passes.  I am mindful of the fact that this committee will have functions beyond the European dimension. That is important because of the changes in Eastern Europe.  A Foreign Affairs can do a magnificent job of work ensuring we fit into a proper niche in the context of this development.</P>
    <P>With a population of 3.5 million, we account for approximately 1 per cent of the European Community population of 350 million people.  That 1 per cent, small as it is, has made a very valuable contribution to the development of Europe, and with a greater development of Europe itself, it is going to become a lower percentage.  Nevertheless, I believe we have further very valuable work to do and I am confident we can do it.  I am certain that this new committee, which the Minister has assured us will be put in place at an early date, will contribute very substantially to that progress.</P>
    <P>While Maastricht is not on the agenda for this evening's discussion, I believe it <Col N="833" /> is not out of place to make the point that it is absolutely vital that we have a successful outcome to the 18 June referendum. It is difficult to imagine the difficulties a no vote result would create for this country.  I am saisfied that had we a Foreign Affairs Committee in place many of the problems arising <i>vis-a-vis</i> Maastricht, and indeed other foreign affairs issues too, could have been avoided.  For that reason I believe this Foreign Affairs Committee, properly established, properly managed and with the terms of reference it requires, can do a great job to make certain that mistakes that were made in the past &mdash; and, let us be frank, mistakes have been made in the area of foreign policy and related areas &mdash; will not be repeated.</P>
    <P>We can be very proud of the influence we have had all over the world in various spheres; not in any particular area but right across the spectrum we have made a great impact and it is only appropriate that we should more harness those great resources and make them more effective in the future.</P>
    <P>I warmly welcome the appointment of this Foreign Affairs Committee.  I believe the work of this committee must not be restrained or constrained but must have the terms of reference that will allow them to do the sort of job that needs to be done.  A committee hamstrung with red tape cannot be effective.  I am satisfied, however, that the Minister, with the vision he displayed before he occupied his present position, will ensure that that does not happen and that this committee will have broad terms of reference, but that they will be narrow enough to ensure that it is an effective and meaningful body.  I fully support the establishment of this committee and offer it my full support in the future.</P>

It would be nice to think that Minister Andrews is following in Frank Aiken's footsteps.</P>
      <P>The Government amendment before us is:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann welcomes the Government's support for the establishment of a Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs and urges the early establishment of such a Committee on an agreed basis.</P>
      <P>As a long time Member of this House I have felt that this committee should be in place and I am glad that that is now being done.  It is absolutely necessary.  In his address the Minister told us that the formulation of foreign policy poses a greater challenge today than at any time in the past.  Those were words well spoken, because even though there were tremendous challenges facing this nation, we still have great challenges facing us as legislators.  I see this Foreign Affairs Committee as very important at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="835" /> During the Irish Presidency of the EC I saw a dreadful gap because this House, the Dáil and other elected people were not brought closer to Europe on a regular basis.  I thought that was wrong; I said so at the time and I repeat it here tonight. During the Irish Presidency there should have been much closer liaison between Europe and the elected people at home. We meet the people every day.  They depend on us for advice, never more so than now when we are facing the referendum on 18 June.  It is to us they will turn for guidance on the way they should vote; and if we do not know the European scene, how can we inform them about it?</P>
    <P>I would like also to pay a tribute to the Minister's predecessor in Foreign Affairs Deputy Gerry Collins.  He was an excellent Minister and I know nobody would agree more with that statement than Minister Andrews himself.</P>

      <P>One of my colleagues said that there seems to be a gap between ourselves, the elected people, and the Department of Foreign Affairs.  That perception should not be there.  When I was Cathaoirleach of this House I saw how gracious and helpful were all of the personnel in Foreign Affairs, our ambassadors and the officials in the Department. They were able to give me extraordinary help at that time.  When this committee is set up it will bring the personnel in the Department closer to us, the elected people.  I think it is fitting this evening to pay a tribute to our Irish soldiers serving as peace keepers in other nations.  I try to do this whenever I get the chance, and I know it will be accepted, even though it has nothing to do with the motion before us.  The setting up of this committee was never more opportune.  It should be set up as soon as possible, with terms of reference which would be definite and clear for those who will have the honour to serve on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that during the debate the Minister has been welcomed <i>ad nauseam</i>, and on a personal basis I wish to include myself in that welcome. I have been impressed by the initial impact of the new Minister for Foreign Affairs in the short time he has been in office and I look forward to hearing his views on issues as this Government continue their work.  I would also like to welcome the very positive response he has made to this motion tonight.  It is refreshing to have a Minister listen to the arguments, run with the ball and, more importantly, say on the record things which I heard him say many times before he became Minister.  I think that is the essence of commitment and of knowing where one is going.</P>
      <P>In dealing with the various issues that come up in foreign policy I think it ties in very clearly with the discussion on Maastricht and on neutrality.  I was very pleased tonight that the Minister took the opportunity to mention little known places like East Timor.  Over the last year Senator Norris, Senator Brendan Ryan and I have raised this matter at various places and have been horrified by the reports that have come from that tiny, neglected nation at the far end of the world.  It is refreshing for me to hear that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has taken this issue on board already.  I have seen at first hand the situation in South America and in Central America.  I have been very closely involved in the debate on the Middle Eastern debacle.</P>
      <P>It is important that a Minister for Foreign Affairs should get the support of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  In supporting this motion to set up this committee, I want to say that it should never be in any way obstructionist but should be a resource to a Minister, it should be there in an advisory capacity as putting together the views of different groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of where we are going in our foreign policy, I have listened very carefully to the comments the Minister has made on neutrality and on Maastricht <Col N="837" /> over the last number of weeks, and I concur with much of what he said.  In fact, I think I am probably closer to his point of view than any of the other commentators I have heard so far.  That in a sense puts me in an awkward position, because many of those with whom I have shared views on neutrality and otherwise have I believe, distorted this debate on Maastricht.  I think the people who are going to the extreme parameters of this debate, whether it is those who want us to join NATO or those who are threatening us with conscription, are doing us no favours in terms of where we are going.</P>
    <P>In this century alone our official policy on neutrality had us standing back pure, virginal and uninvolved, while Hitler decided to wipe out a whole nation, while Stalin decided to exterminate 25 million people, while Pol Pot exterminated a nation.  We have claimed neutrality and we are clean, we are unsoiled and unsullied. It is something that we can never explain to our grandchildren; it is something that we can never be proud of. Neither, can we be proud of the fact that the initiator of that policy, the founder of the Minister's party, did not do us any favours by proclaiming neutrality, once he was neutral on the right side, and rushing off to sign the book of condolences on Hitler's death.</P>
    <P>One of the first things I would like to see coming out of a foreign affairs committee is a debate on neutrality. What does it mean?  Those people who use the terms neutrality, sovereignty and pacifism as synonymous with each other, are no help to us either.  There are many people who are not pacifists but who believe in the sovereignty of this nation and who have still not worked out what neutrality is.  The problem is we do not have a model of a neutral nation at the moment.  I have listened to all the arguments. Switzerland is trotted out as a neutral nation, a nation which is prepared to launder the money of every oppressor, dictator, mafiosa or criminal anywhere in <Col N="838" /> the world, to look after their money and give them a clean bill of health.  Sweden is the other neutral country.  I have heard even members of the Government in the last two or three weeks justify neutrality by saying that Switzerland and Sweden are queueing up to join the Common Market.  Sweden is neutral, but how is it neutral?  The Swedes have grown fat on the money made from selling arms to both sides of any war, anywhere, and they have done that for many generations.</P>
    <P>I do not know a model for neutrality and I do not have the answers, but I know it is different to sovereignty, and I know sovereignty is not necessarily inhibited by involving ourselves in other nations.  I know that interdependence is not necessarily a loss of sovereignty.  I know that involvement in a co-operative way is not an infringement of neutrality or sovereignty. I believe that neutrality can never be, has never been, and can never be taken to be a passive state; it is an active state.</P>
    <P>Tonight's <i>Evening Press</i> carries on the strap on the top of the page a reference to the last army officer in Bosnia trying to work on behalf of the UN for peace. To me that is an involvement, that is sovereignty at its strongest, neutrality at its most active.  That is, in the words of many Nobel peace prizewinners, the manifestation of the statement that peace will not come from words alone, that people have to work for it and be prepared to stand up and be counted.</P>
    <P>To me the development of a foreign policy allows us to consider many of the areas of debated foreign policy which will pull people down from their ivory towers, those people who can stay in Ireland, look at the world and offer an easy solution to the Middle East &mdash; we heard them in this Chamber &mdash; or offer an easy solution when dealing with two power blocs, or offer an easy solution to disarmament. Anybody who has tried any of those things knows it is not easy.  I want a forum where I can ask people <Col N="839" /> what they mean by neutrality?  What would they do in a dead end, or worse, scenario?  Let us say that the Lion of the East, China, suddenly decided to follow a policy of expansion and decided to invade Ireland.  What would we expect from the rest of Europe?  That really is the question. What do I say to my friends with whom I would be closely aligned politically who would say that neutrality means keeping away from any involvement in Europe?  I met some of them last weekend.  I was arguing about this debate on neutrality and I found out that they were on their way back from commemorating the involvement of Irish people in the Spanish Civil War.  How do people do this?  How can you, on the one hand, say we will celebrate the 15th International Brigade and, on the other, say our sovereignty and neutrality mean that we do not get involved?</P>
    <P>I am not saying I know the answers.  I do know we need a forum; I know we need a place where we will force people to articulate their points of view, and I know that words become important before deeds and actions.  I believe this is the way forward.  I thank the Minister for his very positive response tonight and I look forward to the working of this committee.  I also welcome his commitment to involving both Houses in a full Oireachtas committee.</P>

    <P>I would like to comment briefly on a few things the Minister said.  First, I would like to say that his openness, frankness and honesty in immediately taking on board the point I raised with regard to East Timor is the kind of thing I would expect from the Foreign Minister, but it <Col N="840" /> is deeply welcomed and appreciated.  I had in the House with me as a guest the chairman of the group in Ireland who are fighting for the rights of people in East Timor and he was particularly gratified with the Minister's response.</P>
    <P>I did not, as the Minister must have recognised, make a very detailed technical submission with regard to all the points of a Foreign Affairs Committee for a number of reasons which clearly the Minister took on board, the principal one being that we have had this debate twice already in the Seanad.  On the last occasion, in 1988, I was the proposer of this motion and I dealt in a comprehensive way with a lot of the technical data.  I am aware that it would be really teaching my grandmother to suck eggs if I attempted to give the Foreign Minister a lecture on these kinds of criteria.  I thought it was redundant; in addition we now have half the time we had due to the Seanad reform.</P>
    <P>I would like to raise one question about subsuming the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities into this new committee.  I say this because this arose in the 1986 debate and was dealt with by the then Senator Mary Robinson, who is now our President.  She indicated the very considerable volume of work done in the statutory role of that committee in monitoring legislation.  I worry a little that perhaps the duties of this aspect of the Foreign Affairs Committee would be so onerous that it would divert attention substantially from other issues of foreign affairs and could not properly be dealt with.  If the Minister is satisfied that this problem can be obviated, then who am I to disagree with him?</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that he gave a clear commitment on Ireland's relationship with the developing countries.  Again, I am not going to rehash arguments I made, and many other people have made, on numerous occasions in this House, but I hope that under this Minister &mdash; and I know it is a question of <Col N="841" /> struggling within the constraints of budgets and so on &mdash; we will start moving towards rather than away from the United Nations' target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for developing countries.  It is very important that we attempt to reach this position.</P>
    <P>In the few minutes remaining to me I would like to raise some other issues and develop a little some of the points I made earlier.  A reference was made to the new world order.  I have to say that when President Bush emitted that phrase I shuddered, because I remember the first time it was used in this century by Adolf Hitler, and the new order envisaged at that stage was one that would be morally and politically repulsive to every person in this House.  I was glad that Senator Lanigan disarmingly, and with great honesty, acknowledged that the foreign policy conduct of the United States of America has not always been a humanitarian one and has not always been a principled one; we can look at Nicaragua, we can look at Kampuchea and at a whole series of countries where they have played the part of an evil empire.  We have to recognise that.</P>
    <P>With regard to our colleagues in Europe &mdash; the Gulf War, for example &mdash; I hope we will bring something new into the European Community when we do develop a coherent European foreign policy.  It would not have given me any pleasure to be morally committed to the kind of behaviour of the individual countries at the time of the Gulf War when, for example, Germany, France and Britain had been previously arming Saddam Hussein with missiles.  Britain built the parts of the super gun and the Germans and the French provided technical assistance in the creation of biological and chemical warfare.  I think that is what happens when you have an unprincipled foreign policy, and I think it is deeply regrettable.</P>
    <P>May I mention also the human rights situation?  Senator Lydon and Senator Lanigan referred to the primacy of <Col N="842" /> human rights considerations.  I did attempt to suggest that guaranteeing the relations between nations is not enough unless you guarantee also human and individual rights, even at a very basic level, of the people inside those countries. May I mention Iran, with whom again we are attempting to develop friendly relations?  That is what diplomacy is about, but if we wish to bring them into the community of civilised nations, we must be aware of reports of groups like Amnesty International, for example, which indicate that serious violations of fundamental human rights are continuing.  Over the last year there have been 750 political executions; they are torturing 70 year old men; there are details of the way they are suspended in contorted positions where they are subjected to sensory deprivation, psychological torture and executed for crimes, such as conversion to Christianity, which in Iran is a crime.  That to my mind is a violation of very basic human freedoms, particularly when one considers that our Constitution lays down that part of the basis of our own view of ourselves is that we are a Christian country and stesses the Christian and democratic nature of the State.  That applies one test by which we must measure our foreign policy.  How is that executed if we do not protest at the execution of the Reverend Hossein Soodman, who converted to Christianity, who was first tortured and then executed within the last couple of years.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to Tibet.  My lead-in was provided once again by Senator Lydon.  I was struck with admiration for the way he reeled off a list of ambassadorial names; he must be hoping to be on the invitation list of every embassy in this country, including a rather curious one &mdash; he referred to Taiwan and the industrial emissary from Taipeh.  I would like to introduce a notion of comparability here because I think it is important that we treat Tibet in a similar way to Taiwan.  The position of the Department of Foreign Affairs has wobbled <Col N="843" /> from time to time with regard to Tibet.  We did, in fact, recognise Tibet internationally.</P>
    <P>We are in a strong moral position with the Chinese because it was we who, in 1979, sponsored the introduction of China to the United Nations.  We maintained that all the territory of China was what was recognised, including Taiwan and Tibet.  Yet we allow an industrial or commercial attaché to set up here and to issue visas and we have a reciprocal arrangement in Taipeh.  Yet we were not able to meet the Dalai Lama officially. Thank God, the President did and that a Minister unofficially met the Dalai Lama. When you have a situation where there are human rights violations with regard to Tibet, where access is forbidden, where people are being killed, where people are being tortured, when the culture of a country is being devastated, surely as a friend of China we have the right to protest?</P>
    <P>Reference was made also to the Maastricht Protocol.  I am not going to be unpleasant.  Almost universal admiration was expressed for Deputy Collins.  Can I however comment on one part of his legacy, that is, Maastricht.  That is a disaster and will haunt Deputy Collins. Deputy Collins' proposal, as Jane Austen might have described it, is a disaster and remains a disaster and is a disaster precisely because nobody was consulted. What kind of idiotic behaviour was it to go off to Maastricht looking for this derogation on the basis that we had to protect the integrity of the Irish Constitution? What about Fianna Fáil's core values?  Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution were compromised first by the Treaty of Rome and are extinguished in international law by the signing of the Maastricht Treaty.  If we are so worried and so delicate about our constitutional provisions, why were the core values of Fianna Fáil abandoned in favour of this quite irrelevant Protocol about abortion <Col N="844" /> which has landed us in so much turmoil and difficulty?</P>
    <P>I think under this Minister, and with the assistance of this Foreign Affairs Committee, which I greatly welcome, we will move more rapidly towards signing the remaining international Protocols and conventions.  I am grateful to the Minister that on Good Friday in St. Patrick's Cathedral at a service organised by the Rescue Trust he gave a commitment to ratify the United Nations Convention on Torture.</P>

      <P>I would like to make two final points.  If we had a Foreign Affairs Committee and respect for international conventions I would possibly not have to take a plane to Strasbourg again in order to try to coerce the Government into the tardy recognition of the judgment in my favour in the European Court of Human Rights.  I am not going to press it because I am possibly more bored than anybody else with this subject.  I welcome what the Minister has said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a civilised, sophisticated political interest in foreign affairs, not just in both Houses of the Oireachtas, but among the Irish public.  I watched as members in the Gallery listened in fascination to what was being said here this evening.  Every time I raise issues such as East Timor, Tibet or Kampuchea, my mail bag is full of letters from private individuals.  I recall one from a sergeant in the Gardaí when I protested about Tibet saying he was delighted that people <Col N="845" /> were actually doing something about Tibet.  The Irish people are interested in foreign affairs.  We are in a unique situation not just because up to now we did not have a Foreign Affairs Committee but because we are the only European country to bear the scars of a colonial history and so can empathise with oppressed people all over the world. Under this Minister we can attain what we always ought to have had but never really had before, a fully principled foreign policy, based on ideals.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and look forward to working with him.  I represent the largest, oldest and most widespread organisation in Irish education and I look forward to being available to him and to being helpful and supportive.  I have no doubt but that he will bring to his Ministry the energy and commitment he brings to everything he does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue I raise tonight is one where I believe the Minister and every Member of the House will acknowledge the unanswerable logic of the points I raise. The background to the issue is an unemployment figure of almost 300,000.  Every survey carried out in Ireland or in Europe has proved that the more qualified a person the more likely they are to gain <Col N="846" /> employment.  Employment depends on qualifications, qualifications depend on education and we have lamented time and again the great resource lost to us in the untapped capacity of unemployed people.  We have encouraged people to be flexible and ready for training and retraining, to further their education.  We have encouraged people to develop their skills and to use their talents to the best advantage of the State.  For that reason the Department of Education recently extended eligibility for higher education grants to mature students.  Any of us who understand the importance of education will welcome that positive progressive move, which may also make some impact on the unemployment total.</P>
    <P>My problem here tonight is that mature students who began courses last year are being excluded from the new higher education grants arrangements coming into effect this year.  Students who took themselves off the unemployed list, worked their way into college, are prepared to work their way through college for whatever number of years required, did so on the understanding that they would be included in new grants provisions.  They now find that that will not be the case. The net effect of all this is that the State is going to lose money.  Those mature students who leave third level will have to go back on the dole and will ultimately cost the State more money than if they were to receive the grants necessary to continue their education.  This does not make any sense.  It is a bureaucratic mess. At a time when the new Taoiseach is talking about initiatives, flexibility, openness and removing the blocks to employment, this surely cannot be sustained.</P>
    <P>We cannot say that we will extend grant eligibility &mdash; I am not talking about more money here but eligibility &mdash; to students at third level but not to students who already have places.  We now effectively say to some students, &ldquo;I am sorry you began your third level course last year.  You came in before the new scheme so you are not eligible to claim or to seek <Col N="847" /> grants this year.&rdquo;  Those students will be obliged to go back on the dole which will cost the State more money than if they paid out grants.  It is ludicrous, ridiculous, and against the spirit of everything this Taoiseach has been saying.</P>
    <P>We need to clear the log jam on this issue.  We are talking about people who expected grants eligibility to apply to them this year and who had got verbal reassurances &mdash; this is all it was, in all fairness &mdash; that grants would be available to them.  They now find this is not the case.  Failure to extend grants eligibility actively discriminates against those students already in college.  First year students, if the restrictions proposed by the Department are carried through, may be forced to leave college because of the cost burden involved.  I have met some students for whom this will be the case.</P>
    <P>By introducing a grant for mature students, the Department recognise mature students' need for financial assistance. The Department's logic implies, however, that it does not recognise any financial need among those already attending university.  These people have pulled themselves up by their bootstraps into university; they are people in whom we can place an investment and who will help this country along.  We are saying to them that because they had the initiative, the push, the drive and the energy to get themselves into college last year, that it's tough luck; there will be no grants for them, they should have sat around for another year drawing the dole.  This does not make any sense and I do not expect the Minister to try to justify it.  I want to hear him say tonight that he is going to resolve this matter.</P>
    <P>I am not gilding the story.  Grants exist for mature students.  There are mature students in the colleges.  The application of this new provision means that people who have fought their way into college, gained acceptance, paid their way expecting to get a grant next year, are not going to get it.  Employment depends on <Col N="848" /> qualification which depends on education. We have people with initiative and drive who are now going to be penalised for not waiting another year.  I do not believe that the Minister wants to do that.  I know his views well enough on employment matters.  He was actively involved in trade union and in other activities.</P>
    <P>None of us can go along with this and I hope the Minister will not disappoint me by trying to justify it.  Whatever is in the script, I want to hear that the Minister will take this matter and try to resolve it whatever its difficulties.</P>
    <P>There is also a human story here. People have raised their expectations, have found dignity and planned a future on the basis of beginning their university courses.  Let us not let them down.  These are the people who hold the future of this country; we need them to create employment. These people have taken themselves off the dole queues.  Let us give them the support they require.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for his earlier kind remarks and for raising this matter because it affords me an opportunity to clarify the position at present in relation to the package of major reforms in the higher education grants and related student support schemes recently approved by the Government.  In particular I want to clarify the situation in relation to mature students and how they will benefit from the improvements in the grants scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should state at the outset in relation to access to third level education for mature students that the broad statement of education policy in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> identified the facilitating of mature students within the education system and upgrading their education or training levels as a key objective.  The commitment to facilitating access to third level education for these students is also emphasised in the introduction to the Green Paper <Col N="849" /> which is of particular interest to the Senator.</P>
    <P>Following on proposals contained in both the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and in the Joint Programme for Government the higher education grants scheme was re-examined in a number of key areas and the Government sanctioned a range of improvements. Those improvements will take effect in the schemes for 1992 and subsequent years.</P>
    <P>The principal improvements are the income eligibility ceiling for families will be increased by £2,000 for each child after the first child attending third level education.  Income eligibility will be assessed on current incomes and income limits in the year of entry into third level rather than as heretofore on the income limits in the year in which the student sat the leaving certificate.  Mature students who secure a place in the third level institution will automatically be considered to meet the academic requirements for the awarding of grants.  Mature students may be assessed on the basis of their own incomes and if married on spouses' incomes, rather than on their parents' income which has been the case up to now.</P>
    <P>Welfare payments under the lone parent's allowance scheme will be excluded from the assessment of income for grant eligibility.  Income limits and maintenance grants will be index linked in 1992.  A working group has been set up in my Department to review the criteria for eligibility for third level student grants with a view to achieving greater equity and transparency.  To give effect to a number of the improvements I have outlined minor legislative amendments required to the Local Authorities Higher Education Grants Acts, 1968 and 1978, and the necessary changes have now been put in train.</P>
    <P>The local authorities are the bodies statutorily entrusted with the administration of the higher education grants scheme.  My Department prepare and <Col N="850" /> issue a specimen scheme each year for the guidance of local authorities.  In effect, each local authority makes a new scheme for each year.  The specimen scheme for 1992 which will include the precise details of the improvements I have outlined is in the course of preparation in my Department at present and will be circulated to the local authorities as soon as possible.  As I have already stated, the recently announced improvements will take effect in the higher education grants scheme for 1992 and subsequent years.  This means that mature students who will be new entrants to third level education in 1992 and subsequent years, subject to the other conditions of the scheme, will be regarded as satisfying the academic requirements for grants and will be assessed on the basis of their own and if married their spouse's incomes.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to mature students already in third level education is that under the existing higher education grants scheme they must satisfy the same eligibility requirements as all other students in relation to residence, attainment in the leaving certificate examination and reckonable income. These include obtaining two grade Cs in higher level papers at the leaving certificate examination and their parents' income coming within the income limits prescribed in the scheme.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the constraints on Exchequer resources, it has only been possible in years when there has been an improvement in the terms of the higher education grants scheme to introduce and fund the improvement with effect from the year in question.  This has always been the position since the scheme was first introduced in 1968.  When it was decided in 1990 to reduce the four Cs in higher level paper requirements to two Cs in higher level papers that improvement applied only in respect of the scheme for 1990 and subsequent years.  If we were now to move away from that well established procedure and extend the <Col N="851" /> improvements in relation to mature students in order to cover mature students already in college, there would be justifiable claims to have the other improvements being introduced in the 1992 scheme extended to cover those other students already in college.  The sad fact is that we simply cannot afford such a move at present.</P>

      <P>It is not excessively colourful use of language to assert that roads in County Cavan are in disastrous condition.  Roads there are not only potholed but cratered and totally broken down, threatening farming, the delivery of social services and particularly the tourist industry and its potential.  Road disrepair has implications for the entire quality of life there.  Cavan people feel ignored, left out and alienated from the centre and are justifiably angry about it. For that reason I welcome the opportunity to bring this to the attention of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been an increase in funding but unfortunately it in no way meets the requirement.  Sixty six per cent of county roads in County Cavan following professional analysis by the executive consulting engineers, etc. are deemed in need of repair.  In the coming year 3 per cent of Cavan's roads &mdash; 60 kilometres &mdash; will be strengthened, less than 5 per cent, that is 90 kilometres, of county roads will be surfaced this year.  The entire length <Col N="852" /> of county roads in Cavan is 1,800 kilometres. Of the 342 kilometres of regional roads less than one-fifth will be surfaced dressed; one seventeenth will be strengthened.  Despite the welcome increase in funding the situation will only be tampered with.  There is a need for a radical injection of funding into County Cavan roads.  It is a chronic situation and has been well documented.</P>

      <P>No reflection on Senator Conroy.  There would be no point in this experiment unless our concerns were conveyed.  My concern is suitably parochial; it is the continuing dispute about free legal aid in Cork which has brought about a crisis in criminal court cases.</P>
      <P>The free legal aid panel has ceased to function since October because of a dispute about solicitors and their fees and arrangements with the Department of Justice.  There have been some attempts to resolve it but they have failed.  Further talks are due but there is no agreement in sight.  The consequences of the dispute are alarming.  It takes a lot to make Cork people apprehensive and nervous, but they are, very much so.  There are hundreds of criminal cases on hold now in Cork.  The courts are impotent.  Defendants walk in one door and when it is obvious that there is no free legal aid available, they walk out the other door.  It is open season for the criminally inclined. This is a crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="853" /> In recent times there has been an increase in crime in Cork but this dispute makes it much worse.  The fundamental duty of Government is to protect the security of the citizen.  Whatever about the obligation to provide jobs, unless citizens feel physically secure, Government are failing in their fundamental task.  This buck stops at the desk of the Minister for Justice.  I do not know what the differences are between the parties involved but it is imperative that the Government take urgent action in this crisis and make fresh and immediate attempts to settle the dispute.</P>

      <P>I want to raise the problem of homelessness, particularly among young people in this country.  I understand that a survey was carried out in January which indicated that 150 young people were homeless during that time. That survey refers only to the areas where facilities exist for homeless children.  In other words, the survey is based on the numbers of people who approach hostels looking for places.  Forty per cent of those who approach the hostels were accommodated in a satisfactory location which means that 60 per cent of those who approached these hostels were accommodated in unsatisfactory places.  It is clear that there is now an inadequate number of places available to deal with the problem of homeless young people.</P>
      <P>It is alarming that of the total 150 people who approached the agencies, 43 per cent were under 16 years of age.  That is a particularly disturbing statistic and it is disturbing also that about 16 per cent of those seeking accommodation had in the past been in residential care.  In other words, this is an ongoing cycle and a recurring problem which has not been satisfactorily resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, of course, the further problem of a great deficiency of data in relation to homeless people in this country, and particularly in relation to the young.  No longitudinal studies have been carried out in relation to this problem <Col N="854" /> and accordingly, we do not know what becomes of homeless people as they become adults.  It is a great pity that an effort is not made to collect that data so that we can carry out the appropriate studies.  I understand that some of these children are being housed in bed and breakfast accommodation which is entirely unsatisfactory.</P>

      <P>I take this opportunity to speaking in support of women's groups throughout the country and the Council for the Status of Women and to call on the Taoiseach to publish immediately the date and wording of the proposed referendum on the right to travel and information, which he says he will have in November.  I do so because Irish women's fears and concerns have not been allayed in the last number of weeks and we have rights through our membership of the EC which we wish to have upheld.</P>
      <P>By and large, the women of Ireland want to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; but they see their rights being eroded.  They see they do not have equal rights to men and we are aware that in the realm of European law we have passed legislation which has been extremely supportive to women in areas of equal pay.  We have been tardy to a degree in Ireland in implementing much of the legislation which would afford us equal rights in economic and social policy areas.</P>
      <P>There is ambiguity and confusion in Irish women's minds and no great hope or security for Irish women that these matters will be addressed in November. They feel that Government can be unstable and they wish to have all-party consensus that this wording will be published. If there is a problem in relation to Fianna Fáil regarding the information aspect, we would be happier if the Taoiseach would say that the area of information is causing hassle.  We know that the travel aspect is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must be positive in our support of women in crisis pregnancies.  If they get non-directive counselling at least they <Col N="855" /> will have an option in a caring community and time to reconsider a decision they now make in another country.  It is imperative that that wording be published immediately to ensure that women <Col N="856" /> will be a decisive factor in a yes vote for Maastricht on 18 June.</P>
