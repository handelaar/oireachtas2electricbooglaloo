      <P>I have notice from Senator Ross that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to delay the commencement of work on the interpretative centre at Luggala, County Wicklow.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to include the roadway at Kilcornan Village, County Limerick, on the N69 between Limerick and Foynes which was omitted in the recent speed limit extensions in County Limerick.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Neville and Ross as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Item No. 2 between 10.30 a.m. and 1 p.m., a sos between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. and Item No. 3 between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. Notwithstanding <Col N="1262" /> anything in Standing Orders the proceedings on the Fourth and Fifth Stages of Item No. 2 and on the Third, Fourth and Fifth Stages of Item No. 3, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 1 p.m. and 5 p.m., respectively, by one question in each case which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only Government amendments and business shall be interrupted from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. as I mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Leader of the House to indicate what legislation it is proposed to bring in between now and the end of the session and if he could put to rest some of the rumours which have been circulating to the effect that it is intended that a number of education Bills which, effectively, destroy the input of councillors and local politicians into the education system are about to be brought in between now and the end of the session? I want to tell him that we would strenuously resist any such attempt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The only way I can interpret the fancy words of the Leader of the House is that he is prepared to guillotine two Bills today.  That would have to be opposed; there is no question about that. These two Bills have been well teased out and this is an inappropriate way to terminate them.  I will not go into a long argument because we have been through this time and again but it is an unacceptable way to do business.</P>
      <P>On the question referred to by Senator Manning, my understanding is that those two progressive pieces of educational legislation, which are giving autonomy to the governing bodies of the third level colleges, are due to be introduced shortly and I would like to hear confirmation of that, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I conclude, it would be appropriate for the House to mark the fact that since we last met there have been three further deaths in the North.  I believe that the House, without going into long winded discussions, should note that fact, that we should show a consolidated front <Col N="1263" /> in support of a peaceful conclusion to the talks on the North and say again how much we abhor the wanton violence which has left three or four more families bereaved in the last 24 hours.  I will be opposing the Order of Business on the basis of the two guillotines, and further guillotines in the next three or four weeks by the sound of things.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say how appalled I am at the terrible murders which have taken place in Northern Ireland; there has been the discovery of a fourth over the last 24 hours.  It is appalling and I sincerely hope that the talks will be successful in the hope that this type of happening might be prevented.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business, the Leader has lost his nerve twice, and seems to have lost the run of himself completely. I hope the disease will not get worse before the end of the term although the prognosis is very disturbing.  A large number of councils are very upset about the Education Bills and among the most upset and disturbed are, I understand, the Fianna Fáil councillors.  I sincerely hope the Brennan and O'Rourke wings of Fianna Fáil do not get into a confrontation about the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with what has been said by Senator O'Toole and Senator Upton about the tragic deaths in the North.  I also oppose most vehemently the guillotining of these two Bills.  We were told categorically on more than one occasion by the Leader that there would not be a guillotine on these Bills and, as Senator O'Toole said, that is all we can understand from the words we heard from the Leader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I again mention a matter I raised with the Leader, he seems terrified to mention the word subsidiarity.  I said yesterday that the Taoiseach has said we must aim for a better understanding and clarification of the subsidiarity rule.  I asked whether there is a better way of doing that than to have it discussed here in this House.  The Leader does not even reply.  I can only assume that he runs <Col N="1264" /> away from this issue as his party have done consistently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to ask the Leader of the House the plans for the introduction of the Dublin Institute of Technology and the Colleges Bills because at this stage what we are really discussing are four Bills, three Ministers and two versions of Minister Brennan's Bill.  I wonder, even if we will be seeing the abolition of the vocational education committees.  I am sorry if this Bill has to be rushed through the Seanad; it will not be rushed by our side of the House.  This is the beginning of the silly season which will mean that effectively the vocational education committees will not know what has happened until they come back in September and then find they are redundant. I feel very strongly about this and I would like to know how much time is to be allocated to what I consider to be extremely comprehensive and important legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The tragic events in Northern Ireland highlight what we were discussing here last night &mdash; the need for dialogue and the importance of getting Strand Two moving towards a peaceful solution.  What the Leader of the House has said about the two Bills before us is disgraceful.  Apparently the season of the guillotine has started, even though we are prepared to work longer hours.  What we have done in relation to the Bill has been very positive and clearly the Minister has taken on board much of what has been said in the Seanad.  It is disgraceful that the Leader should, on the one hand, announce that there will be no guillotine and on the other hand, announce two guillotines on the same day with, no doubt, further guillotines before the silly season is over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Education Bills, we are putting the cart before the horse. There is the suggestion that the Education Bills are to come before us while the Leader has not yet indicated to me, <Col N="1265" /> although I have asked him on two occasions, when we are going to have a debate on the Green Paper.  The Green Paper concerns itself with the colleges and the regional colleges.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Leader to give us an indication when we can have a debate on the Green Paper.  We should have that debate prior to the debate on the colleges Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to be associated with the condemnation of the atrocities in Northern Ireland.  It is disgraceful that the IRA should murder a person in the North and then bury them in Mullaghmore, Sligo, my home area.</P>
      <P>There is something else I think is disgraceful. I hear people criticising the guillotine; an important Bill collapsed yesterday because nobody on the opposite side wanted to speak about it. It is the hypocrisy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, regret that the two Bills before us today are being brought to a very sharp conclusion.  I will not say quick, because both have been debated in the House at length but the application of the guillotine is always to be regretted and I hope we will not see too much of that in the future.</P>
      <P>Every Member abhors the tragedy in Northern Ireland yesterday.  These three murders&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I accept the sentiments expressed by the House Senator McMahon and I know it is a matter of concern to you, but I would prefer shorter contributions on a matter like that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is particularly upsetting to many people when there was hope for a peace initiative in Northern Ireland. These murders brought to an end a long period without a death or a tragedy in the North, at a time when it would appear the political leaders are closer than we have seen for many a day.  I hope every effort will be made on both sides of the Border to bring to justice those who are responsible for these terrible murders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Leader of the House if there has been a change in the way business is run and whether it is now the Opposition's job to keep the Government business going when there are not sufficient Government Senators to speak on their Bills going for the length of time ordained?  Perhaps he could clarify the allegation Senator Farrell has made.  I would be very interested if the Leader could respond specifically to that point.  May I ask him also whether we will have the recently published Family Planning Bill before the recess?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>May I express my abhorrence <Col N="1267" /> of the violence of yesterday and sympathise with the families involved.  I hope, as has been stated on the other side, that the ongoing talks will come to a successful conclusion.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator Manning's question as to what legislation will be dealt with between now and the summer recess, it is intended to deal with the Regional and Technical Colleges Bill, the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill, the Interception of Postal Packages and Telecommunications Bill, the Housing Bill, the ICC Bill, the Family Planning Bill, and the Local Authority (Higher Education Grants) Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to today's Order of Business, <Col N="1268" /> as on Tuesday last the guillotine is only there in case it is needed.  I am sure with the goodwill of the House it will not be needed on either Bill today.</P>
    <P>Question put: &ldquo;That the Order of Business be Items Nos. 2 and 3 and that, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, the proceedings on the Fourth and Fifth Stages of Item 2 and on the Third, Fourth and Fifth Stages of Item 3, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 1 p.m. and 5 p.m., respectively, by one question in each case which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only Government amendments; and that business shall be interrupted from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I would remind the House that Senators may speak only once on Report Stage except for the proposer of an amendment who has the right of reply.  Each amendment must be seconded.  I draw to the attention of the House that there is a misprint in amendment No. 5.  The lines reference in page 19 should read lines 1 to 18.  There should be no asterisk before amendment No. 41 as it is not a Government amendment. Amendments Nos. 4, 7, 14, 18, 19, 22, 23, 25 and 26 are out of order as they have the same effect as amendments rejected in Committee.  Also, amendments Nos. 16, 50 and amendments Nos. 1 to 51 are out of order as they do not arise out of Committee proceedings.</P>

      <P>Section 1 (4) provides for the collective citation and construction of the Referendum Acts.  It is necessary to reword the subsection to take account of the recent enactment of the Referendum (Amendment) Act, 1992 and this amendment provides accordingly.  The present collective citation is Referendum Acts, 1942 to 1992.  The revised subsection (4) will provide that this collective citation will include the sections of this Bill which are relevant to referenda.  The amendment is purely technical.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 15, line 39, after &ldquo;constituency&rdquo; to add &ldquo;or ordinarily resident in that constituency at any time during the preceding five years, but resident outside the State on the qualifying date&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals with the provision <Col N="1270" /> of votes for emigrants and would allow people who were &ldquo;ordinarily resident in that constituency at any time during the preceding five years, but resident outside the State on the qualifying date&rdquo;.  It would be particularly relevant to young emigrants or people who had left this country for a short period of time.  They would be registered and able to cast their vote in a certain set of circumstances if this amendment were allowed.  It would also allay some of the concerns expressed by Senator Murphy during the earlier debate on Committee Stage when he spoke in terms of the possibility of an enormous number of people residing outside the State being entitled to vote.</P>
    <P>The question of emigrant votes is one of great concern to the Labour Party.  It is part of our policy that they be entitled to vote and we had a very strong and positive response from emigrant associations. I hope the Minister will accept this amendment because it is important to make some gesture towards even a small fraction of the people who have left this country and who feel very badly treated.  The State seems to wash its hands of them as soon as they leave.  That is in sharp contrast to what happens in other countries but I do not want to go through the debate we had on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>This amendment defines some of the concerns expressed on Committee Stage. It is a worth-while amendment and I cannot see how it would create difficulties with which this State and the various organisation election processes could not cope.  I sincerely hope the Minister will review the attitude he adopted on Committee Stage and accept this amendment, which is considerably watered down from what we would have felt was desirable. It would be an important step forward in showing some regard and concern for emigrants and it would be a welcome change from the lip service and maudlin sentimentality we go on with in relation to people who leave this country.  When it comes down to brass tacks we have no hesitation in turning our backs, walking away from them and saying as soon as they have left country, they are gone; <Col N="1271" /> goodbye.  We do not want to give them any rights.  That is in sharp contrast to how many other countries treat their emigrants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. I would like to express our deep concern to the Minister that a guillotine has been imposed on Report Stage and that we must complete our business within two hours.  The House divided on the issue. We are satisfied with the number of amendments the Minister has taken on board.  About 20 out of the 26 amendments are matters that were raised here through amendments we proposed and it shows the positive nature of the contributions made on Committee Stage. Our amendments are on issues that are important and substantial and could well benefit from being included in this legislation before it goes to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 3 is in that mould.  It is an important amendment.  We discussed the question of giving voting rights to emigrants on a number of occasions in the Seanad.  We have pointed out that such entitlement is commonplace in other countries where citizens of the country live abroad for whatever reason.  This amendment seeks to tidy up the original proposal so that there is no danger of being swamped by an emigrant vote.  We are restricting the role of the emigrant vote to a maximum period of five years; in other words, the person would have been a recent citizen who would be <i>au fait</i> with the conditions, circumstances and issues that might be important when exercising the franchise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concern was expressed that emigrants might not know the issue.  If it is limited to five years I do not think there is any great danger of that.  It will not be a question of them being out of touch.  If we are talking about up to five years I do not think there is any great danger of that.  It is not a question of being out of date.  We are giving a reasonable set of parameters within which the Minister could take an emigrant vote on board.  I know the Minister indicated earlier that the Government were thinking about <Col N="1272" /> some type of legislative framework.  At a single stroke here we could incorporate this provision which is most reasonable and is the best in the circumstances.</P>

      <P>I am outraged that this Bill has been guillotined, particularly in view of the fact that we were not given prior notice.  We were in fact given to understand by the Leader that the very opposite was the case.  He gave us more than one assurance that it would not be guillotined and it simply means we can no longer believe what the Leader tells us.</P>

      <P>As the Chair said, there is so little time to speak on it that we must get on and address the amendments. We will not have the opportunity to speak on them as we would wish and that is totally unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many amendments have simply been ignored by the Minister, on which we were given to understand we would be given some latitude.  This amendment evoked great heat and feeling on all sides of the House.  I was not in favour of <Col N="1274" /> the original amendment which seemed to allow too much latitude.  It simply spoke of a person who was formerly resident in a constituency but now resident outside the State and I felt there was such a large proportion of our people abroad it could lead to a huge imbalance.  I was not in favour of that amendment but now that the restricting factor has been added in of only allowing people who were resident in the constituency at any time during the preceeding five years, it narrows it down considerably and makes it perfectly acceptable.</P>
    <P>When we were discussing the section very laudable sentiments were expressed by the Minister about how the Government had a committee looking into this question and the Minister gave us to understand it was only a matter of time before we would hear something relevant to the matter of giving emigrants a vote. Now the Minister will not even accept or consider an amendment restricting it to people who were resident at some stage during the previous five years.  I find it very difficult to accept there is any validity or truth in the idea that the Government are giving this matter real, genuine consideration.</P>
    <P>As Senator Costello said, representations were made to all Senators.  I received some but I did not automatically succumb to them or agree with them willy-nilly.  I made my position quite clear when discussing this on Committee Stage and said I had serious reservations about the matter.  Those reservations have now been greatly reduced, if not eliminated, by this amendment.  I hope the Minister will now look at it seriously and bring in something meaningful in the near future.</P>

      <P>While I fully appreciate that the Minister would have difficulty in controlling votes outside the State, I still believe this is a reasonable amendment. When people emigrate they never know how long they will be away.  They should be given an opportunity to take part in our elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was discussed at length in both Houses.  There are many people in the State who cannot cast their vote on polling <Col N="1275" /> day and are annoyed so much attention is given to those who emigrate.  I refer to airline staff, sailors and fishermen. The latter go to sea, at 5 a.m. and do not return until 9 p.m. or 10 p.m.</P>
    <P>A large number of people resident in the State cannot vote.  I refer to the officers appointed by returning officers, presiding officers and polling clerks.</P>

      <P>When we discussed votes for emigrants a fortnight ago I had representations from many people.  In the recent referendum, people were appointed to polling stations almost in the street where they lived and they were refused a vote.  I have letters from two people who were refused a vote because they were outside the constituency. When the ballot paper is the same all over the country, does it matter whether one is appointed to one's home polling station or one in Cork, Galway or Donegal? Many Dublin people were denied the opportunity to vote.  We all know it would not have made any difference to the result of the referendum but people are annoyed when they cannot vote.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;should be made to give emigrants a vote.  The Minister would have difficulty in controlling it for <Col N="1276" /> long-term emigrants but this amendment would give him a breathing space.  Emigrants should not be cut off when they leave our shores.  I have no objection to the five year period.  Many people emigrate from necessity and have every intention of returning if that is possible. Others find the going rough and return home.  It is a great pity to deny them the opportunity to vote for the short period they are out of the country.</P>
      <P>I support the amendment.  I put it to the Minister that there are other groups living in the State and he could without difficulty, do something about them. There is nothing more annoying than to find that one cannot cost one's vote. Every effort should be made to ensure that as many people as possible who are on the register and entitled to vote are given the opportunity to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Existing law on the registration of electors, which is repeated largely unchanged in this Bill, provides that in order to be eligible for registration a person must be ordinarily resident in a Dáil constituency.  The effect on this amendment would be to modify the resident's requirement and enable persons resident outside the country to be registered as electors provided they resided in the constituency concerned at any time during the previous five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle involved here was discussed at substantial length on Committee Stage.  The only difference now is that Senators appear to accept that an open-ended extension of the right to vote to emigrants is not a practical proposition. Oireachtas representation for emigrants raises fundamental questions, including constitutional questions.  In fairness, both the emigrants and the resident population in any arrangement that might be decided on, would have to recognise the difference between those who reside permanently in this country and those who, for whatever reason, live <Col N="1277" /> abroad on a continuing basis.  The difference relates not just to the representation or taxation question but to the emigrant's circumstances, including jobs, wages, housing, health and welfare, the environment, etc.  The Government are giving the fundamental issues involved the careful consideration they demand.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I ask the Seanad to reject this amendment and allow time for the Government to complete their consideration and adopt a position in the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>How long is long enough for the Government to decide?  Will they decide before the end of this Government or will they decide before the crack of doom?  I have difficulty visualising what the problems are that prevent them from reaching a decision on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to what the Minister said about the proposers of this motion having accepted that what was suggested initially was impractical, that is not the case.  We are trying to meet some of the concerns expressed on Committee Stage in relation to difficulties which might arise, but the fundamental question remains. <Col N="1278" /> Many of the good wishes, hopes and announcements made by the people on the other side &mdash; many of them were silent this morning &mdash; and many of the concerns they expressed have been met in this amendment.  They like to make sentimental sounds and give the impression that their heart is in the right place and that, sooner or later, they will get round to doing something; but nothing has happened.  They have their chance now and they are walking away from it.  I wonder what the Progressive Democrat element of this Government will do to ensure that their policy to grant votes to emigrants will be implemented? We know they are a policy driven party because they never stop telling us that. Will they get down to brass tacks when it comes to waling through the lobbies in a few minutes time?  To be fair to them, they did it the last time and it will be interesting to see if they will do it again today.  It will also be interesting to see if they do it in the Dáil when it will really count.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister rejected our amendment.</P>

      <P>Amendments No. 5 and No. 6 are Government amendments. They are related and may be discussed together.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 18, to delete lines 46 to 48 and in page 19, to delete lines 1 to 31 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) Where on the qualifying date, a person is detained in any premises in legal custody, he shall be deemed for the purposes of this section to be ordinarily resident in the place where he would have been residing but for his having been so detained in legal custody.&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 11 (5) and (6) provide for the registration of ordinary hospital patients, mental hospital patients, prisoners and employees resident at a hospital for the purpose of their employment.  The subsections, which propose to repeal the existing law, provide that hospital employees and long stay patients in ordinary hospitals may be registered at the hospital while short stay patients, prisoners and patients in mental hospitals will be registered at their home address.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage different aspects of these provisions were discussed.  In my reply I indicated that I could not accept changes in relation to the registration of prisoners and mental hospital patients but that I would give further consideration to the position in relation to other categories.  Following consideration, I am satisfied that the hospital workers and patients in ordinary hospitals should be registered in accordance with the rules applicable to electors generally and that special registration provisions are not necessary in this case. Under this amendment, therefore, subsection (5) will relate only to prisoners and subsection (6) will relate only to mental hospital patients.  As at present, both categories will continue to be registered at their home address.</P>
      <P>The references to hospital employees and patients in ordinary hospitals will be deleted.  These categories will fall to be dealt with under the ordinary rules and, where appropriate, may exercise a choice under section 11 (1) which relates to the situation where a person may appear to be eligible for registration in respect of more than one address.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Upton says, the changes are an improvement.  They get rid of a lot of circumlocution and tautology.  They also separate the two issues of the hospital patient and the person in legal custody.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 6 is a useful amendment. It tightens up the legislation. However, the salient point we are making in this has not been adverted to in the amendment.  It is that the facility for registering people who are in custody or in institutions should be facilitated.  The right to vote for those who are not in a position to leave an institution should be acknowledged.  This is particularly true in relation to prisoners and people in a hospice or who are not likely to be able to return to their home for the duration of an election, or perhaps for a very long period of time.  This provision effectively debars them from exercising the franchise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They should have that option.  I do not see why polling should not take place, say, in a prison, under the strict monitoring of the prison governor and the <Col N="1281" /> presiding officers.  That should also be possible in an institution such as a hospice.</P>
    <P>The basic principle underlying this legislation is to facilitate the maximum number of people to participate in the democratic electoral process.  While welcoming the tightening up of the section, we do not think the amendment will ensure that what we wanted to see enshrined in this section is inserted.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Government amendment No. 6:</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 8, 9 and 10 seek to improve the efficiency with which the register is compiled.  They seek to prevent situations arising where people find themselves unable to be registered because they have not reached the qualifying age on a qualifying date.  In fact, they may reach the age of 18 subsequent to the qualifying date and before the end of the period of relevance of the register. They are fairly minor technical points which would allow a number of people to get their names on the register more easily.  It is important that the amendments should be accepted and I hope the Minister will give away.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>My apologies, I am formally seconding amendment No. 8.  In support of what Senator Upton had said, what we want to do is to improve the situation in relation to getting young people on the register of electors so that if an election takes place when they reach 18 their entitlement to vote will operate from that point.  At present the qualifying date operates from September which means that a certain period will elapse where people are in limbo.  They are over the age of 18 but they are not entitled to vote.  Under the Constitution, anybody who has reached the age 18 is entitled to vote.  Present regulations prevent this from happening, but our amendments would allow it.</P>
      <P>The Minister should be prepared to accept those points and introduce the necessary changes to ensure that anybody who has reached the age of 18, and can show evidence of that fact at a polling station should be entitled to vote.  It is an important amendment and I am disappointed the Minister has not given more consideration to our suggestions in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, am somewhat disappointed that, not only the present Minister, but previous Ministers have made little effort to ensure that people when they reach 18 years of age have the opportunity of voting.  As was made clear on Second Stage and on Committee Stage, because they cannot register until they are 18, very few people of 18 years have the opportunity to vote.  Usually the year has gone by and they are 19 before they can exercise the franchise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked on Second Stage if consideration could be given to permitting people to go on the register before they are 18 but that it would be an offence for them to cast their vote before they reached 18 years.  Surely it is not an offence to be on a register before the age of 18?  This is done in parts of the country. It may be slightly irregular or even illegal but, at the same time, I would not consider <Col N="1283" /> it an offence for a person to send in an application and for the local authority to accept it so that they could put themselves on the register at 17 or 17½ years of age in anticipation of when an election might take place.  I would like the Minister to give some consideration to these suggestions, to ensure that more of our citizens at 18 years of age have the opportunity of voting and not to restrict them so much as at present.</P>
    <P>I am sure if a survey were carried out we would all be rather shocked to see how few people of 18 years of age have the opportunity to vote.  They are 19 before they do so.  There should be some leeway to permit them to go on the register before they are 18 so that if an election should occur within the next year but after their 18th birthday has passed, they could vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I support strongly the thrust of the argument put forward in support of the amendments.  I find it difficult to understand why a person who has attained the age of 18 years at a point during the year prior to the holding of an election and was of the qualifying age on the date on which the election was held, is denied a vote.  It is wrong.  They should be encouraged to come in to the system. Even if it requires a special section in the register, the opportunity should be provided.  I do not see any valid argument against it.  Younger people are continually taking more responsibilities in various fields and it is only reasonable that the opportunity would be provided for them to vote.</P>
      <P>The compiling of the register in many cases &mdash; particularly in urban areas &mdash; leaves much to be desired and many people who are already 18 on the qualifying date are still not on it.  No barrier should be put in place to prevent a person who has attained the age of 18 prior to the date of election from casting their vote in the election.  I encourage the Minister to think long and hard on this one.</P>

      <P>I strongly support the <Col N="1284" /> three amendments.  In my years, I have known young people who have not had a vote until they were 25 because of the weakness of the regulations on the age factor.  Where a young man or woman has reached the appropriate age after the registration date, the law should allow that person to proceed to the polling station produce a document, a birth certificate, confirming that he or she is of age.  That could be acceptable.  It is something the Minister could look into because I know young people who have become disenchanted having reached the age of 25 and still having no vote.  Perhaps the Minister would have another look at this?</P>

      <P>Under section 15, as drafted, only persons who are entitled to be registered on the qualifying day but who are not so registered are entitled to apply for entry in the supplement to the register.  The section provides a mechanism whereby electors who should have been included in the first place can be added to the register.  The essential consideration is that the persons concerned must have been eligible from day one. Under the section, as drafted, no account may be taken of subsequent events.  For example, the section will not cater for people who change address during the lifetime of the register or people who return home after a period abroad, nor is it intended to cater for people who reach voting age after the coming into force of the register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments would enable a person who reaches 18 years after the coming into force of a register to apply for entry to the supplement on reaching that age.  It would also enable a person who moved house after the qualifying date to apply for entry in the supplement. The provision in section 15 in relation to the supplement is, basically, a safety net to catch those eligible electors who should have been included in the first place.  These amendments, if accepted, would depart from the principle on which the section is based.  The principle is that the applicant for inclusion in this supplement <Col N="1285" /> must have been eligible when the register was being compiled.</P>
    <P>Our electoral arrangements are based on the idea of a final and conclusive register. Section 15 proposes to retain this arrangement subject only to the correction of proven errors.  Acceptance of this amendment would mean a radical departure from this position.  Under existing law, repeated in rule 11 of the Second Schedule, a person who reaches 18 years up to the date of coming into force of the register is eligible for entry in the register.  Under Rule 13 of the Second Schedule, this date will in future be 15 February.</P>

      <P>There is an element of consistency in what the Minister is doing. He seems to be committed to keeping people, such as emigrants who may even leave the country for a short period &mdash; perhaps a month or two &mdash; off the register.</P>
      <P>In relation to the fixed register and the grave levels of concern which have been expressed by the Minister, I wish the practice was in accord with that.  I am sure the Minister knows &mdash; and Senator Howard knows &mdash; that there are many people on registers in places such as County Clare who were a long way from Clare when the register was being compiled. Many of them make their way back on buses funded by political parties, to cast their votes.  The idea that they should be resident at the premises they registered on a qualifying date is out of accord with reality.  Large numbers of people are maintained on registers, for whatever reason &mdash; mainly because it is known which way they will vote &mdash; although they have been living far away from that place. Large numbers arrive from Dublin and Cork to vote in rural Ireland.  I cannot imagine that so many of those people were resident in the west when the register was compiled.  In many ways what we are trying to do is to regularise what is the reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The practice and level of enforcement are in contrast with the lofty position being adopted by the Minister in this matter.  In some constituencies there <Col N="1286" /> would be a few hundred people &mdash; maybe as many as 1,000 &mdash; who would be bussed home to vote on polling day to places where they were not resident when the register was compiled.</P>

      <P>I just wanted to make a point in opposition to what Senator Upton is saying.  Although he comes from a rural background, he must be living in the city too long and his senses have been dulled.  Due to the emigration pattern &mdash; particularly in my own part of the country &mdash; there are people who are legally on the register when the registers are being compiled but who may have moved out of the area and then moved back.  These movements are not permanent and are due to the pattern of migration as well as emigration.  Particularly in recent years, this pattern has been temporary among young people over 18.</P>
      <P>I do not want to address the suggestion the Senator made that people are being bussed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

During Committee Stage debate on amendment No. 30, it was suggested that the inclusion of the words &ldquo;suffered by him&rdquo; in this section is insensitive and may be offensive to people who have a physical illness or disability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had the provision examined and I have concluded that the formula suggested on Committee Stage by Senator Hederman is the most appropriate.  This involves substituting &ldquo;his physical illness <Col N="1288" /> or physical disability&rdquo; for &ldquo;physical illness or physical disability suffered by him.&rdquo;  The amendments provide accordingly.

      <P>In page 23, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>.&mdash;A person who is entitled to be entered on the Special Voters list and was not so entered, may apply to the registration authority for inclusion in a supplement to the list referred to in section 17 (1) and the provisions of section 15 (5) shall apply to any application made under this section.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is self-explanatory.  It is simply a request to ensure that a person who is normally entitled to be entered on the special voters list and who for some reason or other was not included could be entered on the list.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this amendment would be to enable a person who is eligible for entry on the special voters list but who was not so entered to apply for entry in a supplement to the special voters list.  The closing date proposed for applications would be the same as that applying to applications for inclusion in <Col N="1289" /> the supplement to the register under section 15.</P>
      <P>Under section 15 applications for entry in the supplement to the register may be made up to the 12th day before polling date.  This cut-off date would not be suitable in relation to special voters because, depending on the polling day selected, special voting could already be underway on the 12th day.  In this connection section 81 requires ballot papers to be delivered to special voters as soon as practicable after the close of nominations. The procedure for dealing with special voter applications would also render this cut-off date impracticable.  A medical certificate may be necessary and the registration authority may require further information.</P>
      <P>Under Rule 20 of the Second Schedule a minimum of seven days must be allowed for the furnishing of such information. Also, special voting requires detailed forward planning by both the returning officer and the Garda authorities.  Even if it were practicable it would be most undesirable to have special voting applications being made when an election is already underway.  We are dealing here with some of the most vulnerable sections of our community, the disabled, the ill, the old.  They should be allowed make up their own minds in their own time, free from the kinds of pressures that can be generated by the heat of an election.  To have applications up to the date suggested would be neither practical or desirable.  The amendment should not to be accepted.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's reply and the approach to the problem.  I do not believe the Minister, at any point in his reply, doubted or questioned the fact that there can be people who are entitled to be on the register of electors but may not be on it for a number of reasons.  Ordinary justice would require the Minister to outline to <Col N="1290" /> the House ways and means of getting over the disadvantage, so that such people who were entitled to be on the register could be entered on it.</P>
      <P>When an anomaly has been identified by those, for example, on this side of the House and we attempt to highlight the issue for the purpose of resolving it, it is totally frustrating when the reply indicates that the main preoccupation in the preparation of the reply was to find a means of not responding to a genuine point that had been raised.  In view of the fact that the Minister did not reject the point I made which is the core of the problem, that is, that a person who is entitled to be on that list and is not on it for some reason &mdash; which may not be the fault of the person &mdash; there is a greater onus on the Minister and his advisers to find the means of rectifying that wrong, than on me or anybody on this side of the House.  I do not think that issue has been addressed and responded to and, accordingly, I want to express my disappointment.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 15 proposes to extend the period allowed for lodging an appeal against a registered decision from five to 14 days.  They will make specific provision for appeal against the registrar's proposed ruling on any application. The procedure involved is that the registrar will publish his proposed ruling and five days will be allowed for appeal by any person aggrieved.  It should be noted that the right to appeal is not restricted to the party concerned.  Any person aggrieved by the proposed ruling may appeal within five days.</P>
      <P>We have to consider the circumstances in which an application for registration might be made.  It takes time to establish and organise a political party.  It takes time to assemble the evidence likely to be necessary to support the application for registration.  Clearly the party will be anxious to have the application decided as quickly as possible so that they will be able to participate in any forthcoming election, and in our situation an election can occur at any time.</P>
      <P>In this amendment we have accepted that there would be a built in delay of 14 days between the making and the coming into effect of the registrar's ruling.  Thus, we could have the situation where the registrar might rule that the conditions for registration are fulfilled and there is no appeal.  However, the ruling could not come into effect for 14 days and the applicants would not be able to participate as a party in any election arising during this period.  The new party could thus miss out on what might be, for them, a vital election.  I am sure the House will agree that this would be neither fair nor reasonable and I will not, therefore, accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>Under section 30 (6) the approval of the Minister is required for the appointment of a person as deputy returning officer at a Dáil election.  An appointment of a person as deputy returning officer is made in the first instance by the returning officer.  The case was made on Committee State that the appointment of a deputy returning officer should be left completely at the discretion of the returning officer.  I have since considered the position further. Experience has shown that returning officers exercise due care in the selection of persons for appointment as deputy returning officers and that the persons appointed are competent, well qualified and efficient.  On this basis I think the matter can safely be left to the discretion of the returning officers and the amendment will remove the requirement for approval by the Minister.  This is in line with the general approach of the Bill which is to allow the widest possible discretion to the statutory returning officers.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1295" /> In page 37, to delete line 3.</P>
    <P>This amendment seeks to delete the provision that somebody of unsound mind should not be allowed to vote.  The reality and practice is that there is no way to determine whether somebody is of sound mind and for that reason there is little point in having useless items included in Bills.  I understand from what the Minister said on Committee Stage that the ultimate determination of whether somebody would be of unsound mind would be by way of a court case.  I find it very hard to visualise anybody putting themselves through the courts to determine that type of question.  For those practical and realistic reasons, its inclusion in the Bill is pointless.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. While we welcome the fact that the Minister has agreed to delete the reference to &ldquo;imbecile&rdquo; nevertheless, the retention of the words &ldquo;unsound mind&rdquo; is unwelcome. As Senator Upton pointed out it is virtually impossible to determine whether somebody is of unsound mind. I would refer the Minister to section 11 where we discussed somebody being registered in an institution, whether in a mental hospital or penal institution, and that their registration will not be the institution but their normal place of residence prior to going into the institution.  If they are of unsound mind, presumably they are in the institution and therefore, they will not be at home to vote.  The only direction we can have is whether they are already in such an institution.  If so, they will not be at home to vote in the first place.  The simplest thing for the Minister to do would be to delete this entirely and forget about it.</P>

The Minister <Col N="1296" /> has been sensitive to the suggestions and proposals made on the other side of the House in relation to language and terminology referring to people's physical and mental condition in the context of this Bill.  I would only suggest that because another section of the Bill permits an elector to nominate any person who is resident in the constituency so named, a situation could develop where for frivolous or spurious reasons an elector or group of electors could come together and nominate someone in order to disrupt the election or the democratic process for reasons of their own.</P>
      <P>I take the point made by Senator Costello that the person or persons concerned would be in an institution.  If that institution were located in the constituency in which the election was taking place and such an appalling scenario were to develop, it would be an even worse injustice to the person concerned that he or she would be placed in this invidious position of being nominated to take part in an election, considering the state of their mind or their mental state at the time.  Therefore, I would be totally opposed to this amendment on that ground.</P>

Section 41 (a) repeats the existing provision which declares that persons of unsound mind are not eligible for membership of the Oireachtas.  It seems self-evident that a person who, by reason of mental illness or mental deficiency, is not capable of managing his own affairs should not be put in a position of managing the affairs of the nation. The ineligibility would apply to persons suffering from severe mental illness and obviously not to persons who might from time to time suffer from nervous or similar disorders.</P>
      <P>It appears that in most, if not all, member states of the EC severe mental illness disqualifies both for voting and for membership of the national parliament.</P>

      <P>I have no great objection to the general tone of what the Minister says, but in practice this does not add to anything.  I do not think there is any easy way of enforcing it.  When we look back at the history of some of the people who are elected to some institutions, I wonder if it is consistent with having a sound mind when a gentleman who got elected to a local authority as part of the ceremonies which surrounded the election was organised to tear down his own posters in a saloon bar where they had been specially erected as a kind of item of entertainment when he was told that these were the posters belonging to one of his opponents.  He was not even able to read his own name.  The fellow went on to be elected and he served his people in his own way and in a manner which was worthy enough.  I shall refrain from naming him.</P>

      <P>This seeks to increase the duration of a sentence for which it would be possible for somebody to be allowed to cast their vote.  We are talking in terms of increasing it from six months to five years.  We have been through the arguments on Committee Stage and I will not repeat them again at this stage.

      <P>It is a relevant point.  We could have somebody in prison for 12 months who would not be eligible to stand for the Dáil because he had suffered a conviction, although now the law is being changed in relation to it.  This is an example of the ludicrous nature of some of the offences that can result in somebody being disqualified from standing for Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>We should not have a restriction of this nature that is so strong or so demanding. There are many categories where people could go into prison for doing a public duty.  Certain matters could be construed as obstruction or could be construed as a breach of the peace when, in fact, they might well be doing a public duty.  That would result in six months imprisonment but nevertheless they would be disqualified from Dáil Éireann.  Very many of the forebears of the Fianna Fáil Party were elected first to Dáil Éireann in 1919 when, as was said in the Dáil on that occasion, they were faoi ghlas ag Gallaibh.</P>

      <P>I wholeheartedly support this amendment.  It is disappointing the Minister did not apparently take any notice of this amendment.  On Committee Stage very cogent arguments were put forward, some of which have already been mentioned by Senators Upton and Costello.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point is that you could be undergoing a sentence of six months and you could be on your last week of the sentence; you could come out of prison and there could be another four or five years before there might be another election and you would be able to stand again.  It is most unjust and unfair.  The crimes which carry a penalty of six months imprisonment are in many instances not major issues.  People might be defending a civil right by participating in a march or in some sort of obstruction because of a frustration which they experience.  Because we have no local democracy in this country, they cannot do anything about these matters and they are motivated by the highest principles and by the very best motives to take a <Col N="1299" /> stand on a certain issue.  They may find themselves in prison for six months and they may be just about to come out of prison and still the Minister will not allow them to stand for election.</P>
    <P>The purpose of prison sentences is rehabilitation but the Minister is simply saying the idea is a total farce that people could be rehabilitated during their prison term and would be very competent people to be elected to membership of the Dáil.  For a number of reasons I find the Minister's attitude very disturbing and I really wonder what the Minister himself thinks about the matter.  Does he feel annoyed, distressed or ashamed in any way that we have to discuss important issues of this kind?  It may be unlikely but it is also a possibility that this will come about and that somebody will wish to stand for membership of the Dáil.  There is no point in the other side getting up and saying that we want criminals of all kinds to be allowed stand for the Dáil. That is not what we are saying.  The other side of the House likes to misinterpret, misconstrue and put all kinds of flowery connotations on what we have said.  I am not saying, and neither did the two Senators who have spoken, that we want hardened criminals to be allowed stand for the Dáil.  There is no point in Senator Mooney or any other Senator on that side of the House suggesting that.  I can see them wanting to make those ludicrous suggestions they made on Committee Stage.</P>

This Bill, into which the Minister has put so much work, has been debated here with interest and enthusiasm and in a very constructive way.  The Minister has proved that by taking on <Col N="1300" /> board many amendments.  Does he think it right that it should be treated in this light and flippant manner and disposed by 1 p.m.?  Look at the size of the Bill and the number of sections and amendments. This Bill is being rushed through.  Is this because there is an election around the corner?  That is what I want to know.

      <P>I am entitled to respond. The Senator is contradicting herself.  On the one hand she is complimenting us, she is talking about the time we spent on the Bill on Second and Committee Stages.  I am not responsible for ordering the business of the Seanad, but I am satisfied that the views of all Members <Col N="1301" /> are well known and have been incorporated in the Bill by way of the amendments that have been accepted by me.</P>
      <P>Section 41 (j) provides that a person who is undergoing a sentence of imprisonment for any term exceeding six months, whether with or without hard labour or penal servitude for any period, shall not be eligible for election to or membership of the Dáil.  Under the amendment the disqualification would apply only in relation to a person serving a sentence in excess of five years.  The Seanad discussed on Committee Stage at some length the rights and privileges of prisoners in relation to registration, voting and standing for election.  At the end of the day, the House accepted that the disqualification of prisoners for membership of the Dáil should continue in place.</P>
      <P>I would remind the House that there is nothing new in the disqualification.  It has been in place since the foundation of the State.  As I said on Committee Stage, it appears that in virtually all EC member states the law envisages that a citizen may be deprived of the right to vote or stand for election on conviction for a serious offence.  The disqualifying period of imprisonment specified in 1923 was six months.  In relation to Senator Bennett's point, there is no way I will accept that a period of five years should be allowed. That is my position on the matter.</P>

      <P>In page 41, line 2, after &ldquo;known&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(provided that no objection shall be taken pursuant to this paragraph to the use by a candidate of his name as registered in the Register of Births)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>At the risk of paraphrasing Senator Howard, this is the Sonny Scanlon amendment.  For anybody who is not familiar with Councillor Sonny Scanlon, he has been a distinguished member of Clare County Council for a number of years.  He is widely known by the name Sonny Scanlon.  Senator Howard very forcefully made the case on Committee Stage that if Councillor Scanlon saw fit to describe himself by his birth certificate name, which I understand from Senator Howard is Patrick Joseph Scanlon, he should be entitled to do so.  I would be in favour of that option being made available to anybody who wants to use the name on their birth certificate.  If it would damage them politically, then I do not think it should be the function of returning officers to protect them from themselves.</P>
      <P>This seems to be a sensible and realistic amendment, namely, that people should be entitled to use the name on their birth certificate even if that is not the name by which they are commonly known.  In some cases it can be difficult, where people are known by a series of different names, to determine the name by which they are commonly known.  For example, Senator Ó Cuív is widely known in his own constituency and throughout the country as Dev Óg, but he is known in this Chamber as Senator Ó Cuív and I understand that his name goes on the ballot paper as Senator Cuív, without the &ldquo;Ó&rdquo;.  There you have a whole series of difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If people wish to use the name on their birth certificate, it should be their right to do so, even if it will be a political disadvantage to them.  I do not think returning officers should be given discretion <Col N="1303" /> to tell people they cannot use their proper name, the name which is on their passport and the name which will be on all official documents.  It is wrong that they should not be allowed use that name if they wish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. Senator Upton has put the argument very well why we should either delete this section entirely or add the amendment we have here.  Our original proposal was to delete the section but in this amendment we are allowing for both situations to operate.  In other words, a person may use the name by which he or she is commonly known, with the option of using the name that is on the birth certificate. It should be no concern of the returning officer what name they use.  It is a matter for the candidates themselves.  If they want to use the name on their birth certificate and are not commonly known as such, then the likelihood is that they will not benefit from using a name by which they are less well known.  Why should the returning officer have any say in the matter?  People often like to use the Irish form of their name.  They prefer to use the proper form of their name, the name they will use on all official documents and there is no reason they should be prohibited from doing so.  The Minister should take this amendment on board because this type of unnecessary intrusion does not add to the legislation and is just pernickety.  Senator Conroy would say in relation to one or two of the amendments we put forward that we were nit-picking.  This is a nit-picking provision.</P>

      <P>I spoke on this matter on Committee Stage and I gave the example Senator Upton has already used in relation to a member of the Clare County Council, Sonny Scanlon.  That is the name by which he is commonly known. I was not entirely satisfied with the responses I got on Committee Stage as to what discretion the presiding officer would have if Sonny Scanlon decided to use his name, Patrick Joseph, instead <Col N="1304" /> of the name by which he is commonly known.  Other examples have already been quoted in relation to Senator Ó Cuív.</P>
      <P>I have a very distinct recollection of being in Donegal looking for a Patrick Gallagher in the village of Kerrykeel. This was many years ago and it had nothing to do with politics.  The man happened to be a sheep dipping inspector.  I made no progress whatsoever with the address and the name I had.  Even in the local post office there were complications because there were many Paddy Gallaghers in the area.  I mentioned that this man happened to be a sheep dipping inspector and immediately there was no problem.  I was directed to his gate which was about a mile and a half away, but I was told the name by which he was commonly known.  People from the west known very well that there are people called by names which are not their baptismal names or registered names.  There are problems which I raised on Committee Stage.  I am still convinced that this subsection will cause endless problems.</P>
      <P>There is another danger that I raise again because I was not satisfied with the response.  Suppose, for example, a person uses their baptismal name on the ballot paper but it is not the name by which they are commonly known.  Is that election not open to challenge because the name of the candidate appearing is not the name by which the person is commonly known?  The subsection will cause endless hassle and now is the time to look at it.  The matter would be resolved either by accepting the amendment or the simple and clean operation of getting rid of subsection (a) altogether.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The section as drafted requires the returning officer to object to the name of a candidate if it is not the name by which he is commonly known. The amendment proposes that no objection shall be taken to the use by a candidate of his name as registered in the register of births.  As I mentioned on Committee Stage, this provision was inserted by the Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1986, having been drafted <Col N="1305" /> presumably by a Labour Party Attorney General.  The provision was regarded as vital by the Government of the day and it is difficult to see what has caused the change of mind in the meantime.  I do not see anything in the provision that would result in an objection being raised to the use by a candidate of his own name.  I am not aware of any incident where such objection was made and is difficult to see the necessity for the amendment.</P>
      <P>If there is a need for protection in relation to the name as shown on the register of births, should not the name as appearing on the baptismal register also be protected?  After all, most citizens are baptised and it is not unknown for the baptismal name to be different from that on the birth certificate.  I have no doubt about the Senators' sincerity but they are worrying unduly about imaginary difficulties and I suggest that the amendment be withdrawn.</P>

      <P>In relation to this terminology being put together by a Labour Party Attorney General, I want to make two comments. First, even Labour Party Attorneys General are not infallible and matters can be improved as time moves on &mdash; it is six years later.  I doubt that the Labour Party Attorney General spent a long period of time working this out.  I would have thought he would have rather more to do with his time than wondering whether somebody's name should be the name by which they are commonly known or indeed that six years on, lo and behold his life would be fulfilled, it would finish up as part of an Act.  For those reasons, and for the most basic reason I have already indicated, I am sorry the Minister will not accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>Section 102 provides that where a voter inadvertently spoils his ballot paper he may, on returning to the presiding officer, be given another ballot paper.  An amendment to this section on Committee Stage proposed to change the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, thus making it obligatory on the presiding officer to give a replacement ballot paper in all circumstances. As I indicated on Committee Stage, the intention of this section as drafted is that the presiding officer would have some discretion in the matter.  For example, if the presiding officer had any reason to believe that the spoiling was deliberate rather than accidental, he could refuse to give a replacement paper.</P>
      <P>I have considered this section further and the best way to deal with the matter is to provide that the presiding officer shall give a ballot paper to a person who satisfies him that the spoiling of the original paper was inadvertent.  The amendment provides for this and meets both objectives in a reasonable way.  Under it the genuine elector will get a replacement ballot paper, while the presiding officer will have discretion in cases where the request is not a genuine one.</P>

The element of discretion given to the returning officer is desirable, but once the returning officer is satisfied then he should have an absolute obligation to provide the extra paper.

      <P>Subsection 4 (b) states that &ldquo;the Board shall not consider any documents, particulars or other information submitted by an appellant other than the documents, particulars or other information which accompanied the appeal&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a very important amendment because if the Bill is left as it is here it will put the board in a most invidious position; in other words, they will not be allowed to consider documents which may quite properly be sent to them.  On the last occasion we discussed this, the Minister said it would be a question of the board using their common sense.  Some Senators asked what would happen if a document was left out of a letter, if an error was made which the person wanted to correct or some minor matter occurred.  To put the board in the position that they could not consider any documents subsequent to the originals would be most unusual.</P>
      <P>It is quite common, in my experience, for an appellant &mdash; perhaps a developer &mdash; when submitting his side of the case to the board, to give inaccurate information, intentionally or unintentionally. Therefore, it is absolutely vital that a third party &mdash; a prescribed body or whoever is involved in the appeal &mdash; would have the opportunity to counteract or correct errors or misinterpretations.  If subsection (4) (b) is passed unamended they will be unable to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not satisfactory for the Minister to say that common sense will prevail, and in regard to minor matters of course common sense will prevail, and that the <Col N="1309" /> board will be allowed to use their discretion. That leads to complications and misunderstandings.  Would it not be better to make it clear by substituting the words &ldquo;shall not&rdquo; with the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; and then leave it to the board to make the final decision?  If the documents submitted are not appropriate they need not be considered, but the opportunity is there if the board think it is fitting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Hederman's amendment.  It encompasses other matters we have discussed in regard to amendments to section 4 which referred to the limited timescale for lodging the appeal and the submission in relation to all matters relevant to the appeal.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated that common sense will prevail.  However, the law must take account of the provisions in the legislation. This section provides that the board shall not consider any documents, particulars or other information submitted by an appellant other than those which accompany the appeal.  That runs counter to what the Minister said about common sense prevailing because it is a strict and absolute prohibition on the board to consider the slightest bit of information that may be submitted subsequent to the initial appeal.</P>
      <P>We want a timescale put in place but, at the same time, we do not want the balance shifted to such an extent that the appellant will be dealt with unfairly in the process.  It is possible that a need for elaboration may arise at some stage, through information advertently omitted from the original appeal &mdash; considering that everything must be submitted initially there is no second opportunity &mdash; or the possibility that the developer may change a condition for planning permission which may not have been known to the appellant at the time the full submission of the appeal was lodged.</P>
      <P>This provision is so rigidly constructed that it leaves out the possibility of the board considering at their discretion something with good sense or reasonableness. Discretion is not allowed in any circumstances under this provision.</P>

      <P>What surprises me about the contributions of Senators Hederman and Costello again today is that the emphasis continually seems to be on somebody appealing against a development.  I reiterate what I have already said.  I want a balanced situation which takes account of the need for development with so many people unemployed.  It should also take account of the fact that ordinary citizens want to know the decision for or against the proposal, as quickly as possible.  When an application is refused, the developer may decide to invest somewhere else.  Therefore, we need a decision quickly.  If the development is wrong or harmful to the environment, the quicker we make a decision not to allow that development take place the better for everybody.</P>
      <P>Both Senator Hederman and Senator Costello consistently refer to the appellant who, for one reason or another, is against a development.  I would like both Senators to consider, during the course of the afternoon, a broader perspective which takes account of the wider portfolio I have to consider.  The effect of this amendment would be that the board would have to take account of documents, particulars and information submitted by an appellant other than those which accompanied the appeal.  We have tried to streamline this system so that everybody would be obliged to submit not just an appeal but the supporting documents outlining the full grounds for the appeal at the same time.  It is a little unfair to suggest that the appellant where the developer allegedly produces unfair or different documentation which does not present the full picture, is at some disadvantage.  All the documents have to be circulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are the Senators suggesting that every element of an appeal against a development might not be open to question?  The disadvantage, if it exists, operates for everybody.  I will not say where the sins are committed, I will not say they are on one side or the other, generally speaking they are committed across the board.  We are not here to accept an amendment <Col N="1311" /> which cuts across the emphasis of what we want to achieve, which is to streamline the system, to make it more efficient and eliminate the necessity for all the toing and froing of these documents.</P>
    <P>I will deal with the alternative position because I want to be fair to Senators who are doing their best to improve the position.  If we go down the road of accepting those documents, at what stage do we stop?  Will the board be required to accept documents two or three days before they make a decision?  What will happen when the time limit is reached and another document is received?  We should realise that this is about good business, being fair and balanced, and giving everybody an opportunity to have their say.</P>
    <P>People are obliged to put their full case together when submitting an appeal.  We must remember that the application will already have been before the local authority for a minimum of eight, probably ten, weeks.  The opportunity to produce all the necessary documentation at the time of the appeal is a fundamental part of the proposed change to try to restructure and streamline the system in order to get these decisions taken more quickly.</P>
    <P>Finally, because of the consistent pressure and emphasis which seems to be emerging in the context of this debate that in some way the changes we are trying to make will cut across the rights of a person who wants to lodge an appeal against a development, I want to reemphasise that the same rules apply for everyone.  There is no advantage or disadvantage to either side.  The Bill merely requires people to get the business done more speedily and take account of the problems we face at present.</P>
    <P>According to the Culliton report we need balanced development which should be proceeded with as quickly as possible if it is worthwhile and refused if it is not.  Therefore, I appeal to Senators Hederman and Costello to take account of the fact that this House is here to represent not just the appellants, but both sides.  We have a vested interest in the right type of development and in <Col N="1312" /> ensuring that those who want to appeal against improper development are facilitated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to comment on the Minister's constructive contribution. On the last occasion we discussed this Bill I was impressed by the Minister's interest, commitment and grasp of all the issues and I thank him for coming to the House.  However, if the Minister looks at my contributions to this debate, he will realise that I am not just representing appellants.  I made a specific case for a developer having the same timescale in which to submit an appeal as a third party.</P>
      <P>Having read some of the documentation I got from the developer's side, I realised the problem which existed, but apparently the Minister has not considered this because he has agreed to give both parties a month in which to appeal.  That could create a problem for developers because they do not know whether there will be a third party appeal.  They do not know if they might be better off not risking the possibility of an even more unfavourable decision from the Planning Appeal Board, in other words, having more stringent conditions imposed on them.</P>
      <P>The Minister is incorrect when he suggests that we are only representing appellants. I congratulate him on the good case he put forward for developers.  However, I hold a different view.  I hope I am able to look at it from all sides.  It is important to put forward counter-arguments to what the Minister said.  He spoke about a balance, the unemployed and the need to keep investment in the country.  I agree with him but he must realise that it may not be in the interest of the unemployed; it may not result in a balance or attract long term investment if we adopt the measures &mdash; some of them draconian proposed in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that it is depressing for the Minister to have to listen to us as we make our arguments over and over again. However, if the Bill, is drafted in favour of one side, the frustrations of third parties, etc., will be so great that they will <Col N="1313" /> continue with the confrontational and antagonistic attitude I know the Minister does not want, and which I certainly do not want.</P>
    <P>My endeavour here is to put it to him that there may be a different and consensual approach to this problem.  I am concerned about the unemployed, but I am not certain that employment is best served by allowing dirty polluting industries to set up here or by making it easy for developers to get approval for undesirable developments.  That is a simplistic approach and reminds me of the approach taken 20 years ago to proceed with development in order to create employment, and to hell with the amenities, to hell with the Phoenix Park, if you wish to build on it do so.  Those were the sort of naive attitudes we heard 20 years ago.  We have progressed since then, that is no longer the narrow criteria on which we look to the future.  Therefore, I ask the Minister not to repeat those simplistic remarks which I am not prepared to accept.</P>
    <P>Although our time is restricted, I would rather spend my time emphasising those points than on the details of the Bill.  Because there is a guillotine on the Bill all the amendments will not be dealt with.  Since the Bill must pass all Stages this afternoon, what was the point of Senators putting a great deal of effort into analysing this Bill?  What is the point of even trying to get amendments accepted?  The best I can do in the time available is in some small measure to make the Minister realise there is another way.  I am not saying it must be my way. I am simply saying there is another way of dealing with these issues.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of the unfortunate planning issue relating to an afforestation scheme.  I know that was a good scheme. I took the trouble to find out about it because I knew the Minister felt badly about it.  Unfortunately, that scheme went by the board, but that should not influence all our attitudes and thinking. That was an unfortunate incident and it happens on every side.  As the Minister said, there is not just one side to this argument.  There are sins on all sides.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1314" /> I accept that people occasionally submit frivolous, irritating appeals which should be dealt with summarily.  I wish the board dealt with vexatious appeals more often.  I am prepared to look at the facts from a developer's, as well as an appellant's, point of view.  It is my belief that developers in the past have submitted misleading statements.  I accept that third party appellants may also do so, but I want the Minister to accept that developers may want to counteract misinformation submitted by a third party, whether in ignorance or stupidity. I want developers to have that opportunity so that we can deal with the facts when an appeal is made.  That is not an unreasonable request.  I cannot accept that if a balance is reached it will necessarily lead to the smooth passage to which the Minister refers.  If he studies some of the controversial appeals in the past he will realise they need never have taken place if the right procedures and dialogue had taken place beforehand.</P>
    <P>I believe there is a consensus here. We do not have the harsh party political bickering that goes on in the other House and I believe in a consensus approach.</P>

      <P>I will be the soul of brevity. Senator Hederman and I are councillors and both of us get more representations from developers than from appellants in relation to planning permission in the local authority area. I have heard Senator Hederman argue cases in the council following lobbying to us, and I have done likewise.  We are not troublemakers intent on putting forward one side of the case; we are concerned that the right balance is struck.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We welcome this legislation.  We welcome the tightening up of the timescale and there is no attempt in this amendment to alter that timescale.  We simply want to allow for the possibility of additional information being submitted in the time in which the initial submission has been made so that the decision will <Col N="1315" /> still have to be made by the board in the timescale outlined.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will address the point he made the last day that reason would prevail in relation to additional information.  There does not appear to be any scope in the Bill for reason to prevail in the sense that not an iota of additional information will be allowed to have a bearing on a case before the board.  How does the Minister interpret his statement in the context of this provision and does he see fit, having regard to what has been said here, to substitute the words &ldquo;shall not&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in this section?  Will it be left to the discretion of the board and will the timescale remain unaltered?</P>

      <P>I neglected to cover a point made in the first contributions from both Senators in relation to what I said, that common sense will prevail.  First, on the last day we debated this Bill, I was asked what would happen if part of the documentation got lost, etc.  I said that if pages nine and ten were absent, for example, surely common sense would prevail.  Of course, it does not need to have a legislative impact for ordinary people doing their business to be required to meet obligations of that kind.</P>
      <P>I now come to the point where I was accused by Senator Hederman of absolutely representing the developer's case.</P>

      <P>The Senator said I am making a case for the developer and making it very well.  I went to a lot of trouble to explain that whether the development is refused or passed, I have the same interest in getting those decisions taken quickly.  I also said that if it was an improper development, it should not go ahead.  What I am saying is that decisions should be taken as speedily as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Senator Hederman's point about dirty industry, simplistic views and views expressed 20 years ago, we have incorporated into Irish law up to <Col N="1316" /> 80 European Community directives in terms of the environment since that time. We have an Environmental Protection Agency Act and we are in the process of appointing the directors and establishing that agency.  Happily, we have come a long way in terms of how we deal with planning permission applications in 20 years.  I would like this debate to go beyond that, in fairness to all sides.  Those attitudes no longer prevail and a corpus of legislation has been implemented which puts us on a par with some of the most environmentally friendly countries in the world.  Our system is better than any other in Europe.  It is much fairer and better than the UK system.  We should note that and not give the impression that we are inviting dirty industry, even though it provides employment.  That is turning the story around.  Let us deal with the real issues. I will not be abusive to anybody, but I would like to concentrate on the real issues.  All the Senators' fears are covered by section 9 which provides that the board, in the interest of justice, may ask either the appellent or the developer for additional information if they consider it is merited.</P>
    <P>Finally, where a developer or an appellant submits information with their original documentation which could be challenged on the basis of veracity and so on, either party has an opportunity to see those documents.  They must be submitted to them and they have time to respond.  There are safeguards in the Bill which must be maintained.  However, we will not allow people to submit documentation whenever they like, regardless of the consequences on the working of the board.  In addressing it this way, account has been taken of the Senators' fears.  Section 9 provides that in circumstances where the board feel there is some doubt or concern about an issue, in the interest of justice they may ask the appellant to submit additional information. That covers the essential case you are endeavouring to cover here.</P>

      <P>If I make an objection I submit my name and address but the problem is that when An Taisce objects, it is the secretary of An Taisce who submits the objection. However, he is not objecting in his personal capacity but on behalf of a member or members of An Taisce.  When bodies like An Taisce, Bord Fáilte, the Office of Public Works, etc., object they should send in a short briefing of the minutes of the meeting showing who proposed that an objection be lodged and who seconded it, and giving their reasons.  I was wrongly accused of calling An Taisce faceless people.  When I said that I meant that I do not know who had objected because the objection went in under the name of the secretary but the person who raised the objection at their monthly meeting was not mentioned.</P>

      <P>I have a lot of sympathy with and support the sentiments expressed by Senator Fitzgerald.  I am not sure how it could be implemented or put into legislation.  It has been a matter of concern to me for some time that organisations, such as An Taisce, can appeal a decision taken by the local authority having regard to their county development plan, which, in the majority of cases, is supported by all the council members.  The local authority give planning permission for a development and some faceless people put in an objection, perhaps delaying the development.  We had the unprecedented experience in Roscommon at an oral hearing within the last few days of a major tourist linked development, which had the support of every Roscommon County Council member.  Senior personnel in Bord Fáilte had stated in writing that they had no objection to the development.  However, <Col N="1318" /> at the oral hearing, Bord Fáilte objected to the development, despite the fact that on the file senior Bord Fáilte personnel had said they had no objection.  I sympathise with Senator Fitzgerald's sentiments and I believe that if a national body objects, they should state why they are objecting to it and on whose behalf.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 25:</P>
      <P>In page 8, lines 18 to 35, to delete subsections (1) and (2) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  After the commencement of this section, the documents concerned mentioned in section 6 shall be made available for inspection by members of the public, during office hours at the office of the planning authority for a period of five years beginning on the day of the giving of the decision, and members of the public may, on payment of the reasonable cost of copying, obtain a photocopy of all or any of the said documents.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The last part of this amendment which states:</P>
      <P>... Members of the public may, on payment of the reasonable cost of copying, obtain a photocopy of all or any of the said documents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would make life easier for voluntary groups in view of the fact they have to study a great deal of documentation, which is getting more complex all the time, but it is not the part of the amendment I am most interested in.  If it is not possible and if the Minister comes up with valid reasons it cannot be done, it will not dismay me unduly.  However, the first part is important.  As I understand it, under the section as drafted the documentation is only available, when appealed, to the appellant.  Here, the documentation is to be made available <Col N="1319" /> for inspection by members of the public. If that is so, I welcome it.</P>
    <P>What I find difficult to understand &mdash; and perhaps I am not getting the full impact &mdash; is why it should only be for a period of a month beginning on the day of the giving of the decision.  That seems to be a very short period.  One has to look at this in the context of the amount of development which takes place, and which is not carried out in conformity with the plans lodged.  It is very important that the plans should be available so that members of the public, An Taisce, etc., should have the opportunity to see if the development is carried out in conformity with the plans as lodged.</P>
    <P>A survey was carried out by the Environmental Research Unit in February 1990 entitled the &ldquo;Development Control System, 1989&rdquo;, based on a survey of planning applications made in 1986 and developments based on them up to 1989.  This survey found that 44 per cent of permissions commenced were not carried out in conformity with the permission granted.  That is a horrific figure. The general trend was confirmed by a similar survey carried out by An Foras Forbartha; they found a non-conformity rate of 42 per cent.  In 1989 the Environmental Research Unit termed half of such non-conformities as significant and noted that half of effluent disposal non-conformity was significant as well as two-thirds of traffic safety non-conformity. That is something about which we should be extremely worried.  There are appalling implications in those figures about which the Department of the Environment should be doing something.  If I understood these statistics correctly, it is important that the documentation would be available for inspection for a longer period than one month.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I broadly support the amendment.  I am sure the Minister will say there are enormous difficulties in having material available for an extended period; perhaps five years is too long, but one month seems inadequate.  All the development would probably have to <Col N="1320" /> take place after that and some members of the public, having missed the notification of the application in the newspapers, might be interested in seeing what the development would be.  In those circumstances, it is reasonable that information in relation to a planning application should be available for a certain period following it because, of course, the planning development takes place over a period of months and generally years.  Would it not be appropriate that each local authority would have a specific library where planning applications would be lodged and would be available for the general public and for researchers who might wish to look into the past? From that point of view, I wonder what happens to applications that have been made once the decision is taken and once the one month has expired?  Are they shredded?  It says in section 5 (2) that the Minister may prescribe additional requirements in relation to availability but what is the situation to date?  It would seem reasonable that the present specified period be extended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to deal quickly with unauthorised development.  Senator Hederman will know that later on in the Bill we are providing for very substantially increased penalties for any types of unauthorised development which should help considerably.</P>
      <P>With regard to the statistics which show that a considerable number of developments have not conformed absolutely with the planning conditions, my information is that even though I would like to have further time to examine that, we are dealing here with very minor alterations. At the same time, I would like to have a further look at some of those statistics and see where they are leading because it is important that developers conform to the conditions in planning. However, if they are of a minor nature, and I understand they are, they do not significantly change anything but where there is unauthorised development of any significant nature I am increasing the fines very substantially in connection with offences of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1321" /> Amendment No. 25 in the name of Senator Hederman proposes that the documents mentioned in section 6 would be made available for a period of five years after the planning authority gives its decision and that members of the public would be entitled to obtain photocopies of these documents.  The amendment also proposes to delete section 5 (2) of the Bill which empowers the Minister to prescribe additional requirements as to the public availability of documents.</P>
    <P>I am not opposed in principle to the idea of photocopies of documents being made available by planning authorities. However, I am not convinced it would be appropriate to include provisions relating to photocopying facilities in an Act of the Oireachtas, especially at a time when we are attempting to move away from overly detailed regulations and control of local authorities.  The question of making such facilities available is essentially a local matter and would more appropriately be pursued at local level.  On that basis I cannot agree to the amendment.</P>
    <P>Under the existing section 5 (1) relevant documents must be made available for a period of one month from the date of the planning authority's decision.  If an appeal is made to the board this period is then extended until the appeal is determined. My intention is that the requirements as to the further availability of documents relating to applications will be laid down by regulations under section 5 (2).  I believe this is a more appropriate way of dealing with the matter than specifying a fixed period of availability in primary legislation.  I might add also that a five year period suggested in the amendment would not be appropriate in all instances because some planning applications would have a longer life than five years.  For these reasons, I do not consider the Senator's amendment is the correct way of dealing with the availability of documents after the appeals process is concluded.  Accordingly, I ask Senator Hederman to withdraw the amendment.</P>
    <P>The photocopying aspect is something that would be welcomed.  It can very easily be dealt with at local level and is not something that should be catered for <Col N="1322" /> in primary legislation.  Having a definite period as I have explained can, in some circumstances, be not long enough but in the main it can be dealt with in the regulations under section 5 (2) of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said some developments had not conformed completely.  That is not what I am talking about.  The Minister's own Department's Environmental Research Unit, which I quoted already made it clear that 44 per cent of the developments commenced were not carried out fully in conformity with the permission and I went on to say then that in 1989 the ERU termed half of such developments as significant.  I take these figures from the Minister's Department. I have to confess I have not pursued research into the nature of the developments.  I accept what I get from the Department of the Environment and if they tell me the figures are significant and that half of effluent disposal arrangements were not in conformity with the permission and two-thirds of traffic safety arrangements were not in conformity I accept that I must do that because I have no way of hearing any contrary opinion on them.  If that is the case, we are not talking about something minor or trivial. Perhaps the Minister feels that something is minor or trivial which his Department would consider to be significant.  That may be the trend of what is emerging from this debate, that the Minister finds them insignificant and his Department finds them significant.  People do take different attitudes to non-conforming development and that may be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to photocopies, I think I can let that aspect rest because, as I understand it, the Minister is saying in his contribution that there is nothing preventing the local authority from doing that and I accept it.  Other Senators may know the situation with regard to local authorities but I am not aware of it.  On the other aspect, that it is a local matter what decisions are taken with regard to reports, I wanted to confirm that the Minister had in mind that internal reports from local authorities would be available, that relevant documents would include <Col N="1323" /> internal documents.  I will press the amendment and see if the Minister may take it on board.</P>

There is much complicated material which they have to submit to the board under this section, such as planning applications, <Col N="1325" /> drawings, maps, particulars, evidence, environmental impact statement, other written studies, or further information received or obtained by them from the applicant in accordance with regulations under the Acts, a copy of any report prepared by or for the planning authority in relation to the planning application, and a copy of the decision. Those are relatively straightforward. Senators who are members of local authorities should be sure that local authorities will be able to conform with the provisions of this section.  I am all in favour of local authorities being efficient in their operations and I hope they will be able to comply with this section.  If the Minister in his wisdom, and with all the advice available to him, feels that the planning authority can manage this in 14 days I will be happy with that.</P>

      <P>If I thought the local authority in question could not submit documentation within two weeks on an application on which they had decided two weeks earlier, where it was required of the applicant in the first instance to submit an extra set of plans, on which all of the documentation was now on file and where an appeal had been lodged, not only would I not extend it to three weeks but I would abolish the council as well.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 28:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) a copy of any representations or observations made by any third party to the planning authority in relation to the planning application.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks to add section (d) to the documentation to be submitted. We have already a copy of the planning application, a copy of any report prepared by the planning authority in relation to the planning application, a copy of the decisions of the planning <Col N="1326" /> authority in respect of the application. Surely relevant documentation would be a copy of any representation or observation made by any third party to the planning authority in relation to the planning application?  Representations from third parties would be valid and relevant. For example, what about any commissioned by An Bord Pleanála such as an inspector's report?  What about an oral hearing?  This section refers to all documentation that is relevant.  It would seem this is an extra tier of documentation that is required to be submitted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It might help to clarify the inappropriateness of requiring submissions made to a planning authority to be sent to the board to take a couple of examples of the kind of situations that could arise. For example, if a person has written to a planning authority saying he thinks a proposed development should be set back a certain distance from the road or should be subject to an overall height restriction, if the planning authority attaches conditions to the permission dealing with these matters the person's concerns will be met and there is no reason his submission should go to the board if there is an appeal.  On the other hand, a person might be opposed to a proposed development and might make submissions to the planning authority saying why he thinks permission should not be given.  If the planning authority gives permission, that person will want either to appeal to the board or to make submissions to the board.  In that case, his earlier submission to the planning authority will be overtaken by his subsequent correspondence with the board and it is unnecessary for the planning authority to send it to the board.  For the foregoing reasons I believe section 6 should be left as it stands and that we should not provide for the transmission of application level submissions to the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to turn to the point I made earlier to Senator Hederman in relation to the time a local authority has to submit the documents.  We will be sensible about <Col N="1327" /> that.  We require them within a reasonable time to submit all the relevant documents. In the case of the board itself we streamline their system and in the case of the applicant we require them to submit the appeal and all the grounds.  This approach means we will have a sensible, speedy and efficient system.  We are not going to allow for the supplying of unnecessary documents that have become irrelevant.  We concern ourselves with the relevancy, the flexibility and the efficiency and the local authority's ability to provide the documents on which the decision should be based.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>To a certain extent I accept what the Minister says and I accept that this amendment is not an easy or a straightforward one.  There is another side to it.  If somebody wrote in objecting and saying the development should be set back and the local authority put in a condition to that effect, the Minister asked why should that objection or that observation go to the Planning Appeals Board.  I know for certain that many members of the public believe, mistakenly, that when they write to a local planning authority making observations or objections, that observation or objection will accompany that application to its final stages.  They do not always differentiate between the Planning Appeals Board, the planning authority and on.  It is not unusual for an application that gets a condition inserted by the planning authority to go on appeal to the board. When it is appealed the board could remove that condition and they might not be aware that representations were made.  That is the other side of the problem. We do not want to see the board bogged down with unnecessary information, but if members of the public make a representation, it should be brought before whoever is deciding the matter.  The board are entitled to remove the condition which satisfied the objector regarding the setbacks.</P>
      <P>I liked the spirited way the Minister spoke about dismissing the local council.</P>

I did it in the knowledge that local authorities have seen dramatic reductions in staff numbers since they became subject to the public service recruitment restrictions.</P>
      <P>I have constantly said at my own council that we should be more efficient.  I have opposed the imposition of service charges because it is a recipe for inefficiency on the part of the council since the manager can look for more charges. We have been bitterly penalised by the Department for not imposing service charges, but that is another day's work. However, I am not going to discuss that now because it is not relevant to this debate.  What is relevant is the observations made by the public.  I ask the Minister to give a better reason for not passing these observations to the board than that the board would be bogged down with paper work.  I do not think that is a genuine reason.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated earlier that I wanted to achieve the right kind of balance. We must take into account the planning applications that were decided at local authority level which subsequently <Col N="1329" /> become the subject of appeals to An Bord Pleanála and all the documents submitted with them.  I am not interested in foisting all of that paper work on the board when I am asking them to decide appeals within four months.  In order to achieve that I am asking the appellant to give all the grounds for the appeal together; the local authority must submit the documents within two weeks and the board must ultimately take a decision within two months.</P>
      <P>The Senator may not consider it logical to require the board to deal with these matters in that way; she may consider that they should get all these documents whether they are relevant or not.  As I see life in Ireland today, the more relevant everything we do is the better it is for the hopes and aspirations of young people. The more time we waste doing things that are not important, the less time we have to do all the things that are important. What we are doing is concentrating people's time.  I do not want the board to read reams of material which is not relevant. If that proves I am a Minister incapable of doing the job, then someone else will have to take my place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>What it hinges on is what we think is important and what the Minister thinks is important.  I happen to think it is important that if a third party sends in a representation &mdash; I am not talking about a vexatious or frivolous representation but about something important &mdash; it should not be considered irrelevant.  The Minister may not think that is important but I do.</P>
      <P>If the Minister told us he was concerned that the public were of the belief that their representation went with their application and appeal and he intended to take steps to rectify that either through publicising it or asking the local authority to notify the person that their representation will not be forwarded, I respect the Minister's bona fides in the matter but I find his dismissal of the fact that these matters are not important rather distressing to say the least.</P>

      <P>The point has been raised <Col N="1330" /> on a number of occasions that I am dismissing serious matters.  That is far from the truth.  Senator Hederman made the point that people may not be aware, or may be under a misapprehension, that these documents were sent on.  It is not too much to require an interested person or group to follow up their appeal.  The 1983 Act required the appellant to submit the full grounds of appeal.  I am not going to go over the reasons for putting that provision into the Bill but after 23 years experience, we require the appellant, by law, to submit his or her appeal.  I am removing that provision because if anybody is interested in making an appeal they should not be required by law to submit it.  If they believe in it, they will check it out and ensure that their case is made.  This will discourage those who are only interested in putting in an appeal and not following it up.  Senator Hederman can accept that I am not dismissing serious matters.</P>

That happens in many cases because these appeals involve a retention, and it is in the interests of the developer to delay the appeal as long as possible.  If he can delay it for five years court proceedings cannot be taken against him.  Many people did not send in the grounds of their appeals because it suited them to drag out the procedure.

I have been accused of many things in regard to this Bill.  Almost everybody in this House agreed that this system should be streamlined. They agreed it was important for An Bord Pleanála to take their decisions in a much more efficient and businesslike way.  Arising from that, we want to put in place the mechanisms which make that possible but once I sought to put the principle into effect, I was faced with amendment after amendment which cut totally across the principle.  As Minister, I do not have that luxury.  Either I agree with the principle or I do not.  Once I agree with it I will try to put it into effect and that means I have to ask Senators to withdraw the majority of these amendments because in practically all cases they make it impossible for the principle of the four months to be observed.</P>

The fatal flaw in this legislation is the manner in which it is necessary to make a submission and not to be able to elaborate, under any circumstances, on it.  It may result in unfairness if people feel the timescale was too tight, or something occurred in the meantime or was inadvertently omitted and they are not given an opportunity to present any further documentation.

If the appellant has an automatic right to respond to the other party's submission, why should the other parties not have the same right?  We are back into the paperchase again.  I have tried to explain that that was one of the reasons for the long delays in dealing with planning appeals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be preferable for the board, having examined the application, to decide that in the interests of justice the appellant should be required to submit additional information.  If the appellant had the right to circulate a further document, a counter position would be adopted by the applicant, and on goes the <Col N="1336" /> paperchase.  For that reason the more practical and desirable way is to leave section 9 as it is.</P>

We are still working from 1990 figures.  If we had the 1991 report we might discover that the Minister would not need this legislation.  According to the 1990 report, planning appeals on hand for more than six months fell from 16 per cent at the end of 1989 to 11 per cent at the end of 1990.  This provides they must be able to cope with the paperchase problem.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 35:</P>
      <P>In page 11, subsection (1), line 5, after &ldquo;appeal&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;other than an appeal which could materially breach the local authority's development plan zoning&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very often, councils draw up development plans, seek expert advice, and then have their plans approved and agreed.  I know of cases where appeals which do not comply with the county development plan are upheld by An Bord Pleanála. Senator Finneran knows what I am talking about.  We have had at least four cases in County Roscommon &mdash; a small county with a population of 15,000 &mdash; in the last 12 months where An Bord Pleanála refused planning permissions which were in line with the council's development plan.  This is ridiculous and that is why I <Col N="1338" /> ask the Minister to take this amendment on board.  I do not believe we should have oral hearings where there is a proposal that is in contradiction with the county development plan.</P>
    <P>These amendments will strengthen the Bill and through them it will gain the respect of councils and the elected members of councils throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with this amendment.  Where the councillors of a local authority have gone to the trouble of discussing at length a draft development plan, where a development plan is drawn up, voted on and passed and is then the basis on which the local authority operates over a specified period of time, An Bord Pleanála should be obliged to take cognisance of the democratic decision taken by that body.  In that context this amendment is appropriate. We should not allow a material breach of a local authority's development plan in relation to zoning.  The amendment is an exercise in local democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The position here is that we have gone, fairly generally, for as flexible a system as possible.  In the past, in the case of oral hearings, the Minister could decide to have an oral hearing or not.  I am discontinuing that system of involving the Minister in deciding whether there is an oral hearing.</P>
      <P>Senator Naughten made the point that where there is a possibility of breaching or changing the county development plan there should be an obligation to have an oral hearing.  If possible, I want to get away from the position where we set out to define particular cases where the board would be required to have an oral hearing. I have done that consistently throughout the Bill because the more you try to define in law particular categories of cases as being the areas where certain specific action should be taken <i>vis-à-vis</i> an oral hearing the more your realise the problems that poses.  While remaining within a county development plan, a case could involve a serious contravention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Locally elected members can give planning <Col N="1339" /> permission in breach of their development plan, as can An Bord Pleanála. There would be very few cases involved, but the power to do that is covered in the Bill.  I do not want to get into the area in primary legislation.</P>
    <P>I am discontinuing the involvement of the Minister in deciding, in advance, categories where there should be an oral appeal.  Categorising at an early stage, anticipating what is likely or unlikely to be involved, is a dangerous business, in primary legislation.  Times change, attitudes change, different types of planning applications emerge and have to be dealt with in as fair and efficient a way as possible.  I do not want at this stage to be involved in deciding in advance the sort of procedures the board should follow in determining cases like this.  It is an independent statutory board with its own quasi-judicial functions and I want to leave it that independence.  I want to make it more businesslike but I do not want to prescribe in advance constraints or categories of special cases where they are obliged to take certain actions.</P>

      <P>To some extent I can appreciate the concern of Senator Naughten because in his capacity as a local councillor he would have experience of situations which would lead him to put down such an amendment as we have here today.</P>
      <P>The implications of the amendment may prove more serious than resolving the actual problem Senator Naughten, and myself to some extent, have found at local authority level.  The amendment contains implications for our decisions as a council also.  We have the authority and the right to give planning permissions outside our county development plan and to attempt to hamstring An Board Pleanála is not the appropriate way.  I know the intent, but I think the logical conclusions may not be as helpful as Senator Naughten believes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I right in thinking that the difference between amendments Nos. 35 and 36 is that in the first amendment <Col N="1340" /> there would be an obligation on the board to hold an appeal if there was going to be a material breach of the local authorities development plan, while in the same circumstances an oral hearing would be obligatory?  I accept what the Minister says, that local authorities can breach their own development plans, but they have to go through a very rigorous procedure.  They have to get the agreement of the council.  It is not a managerial function, it is a function of the elected members.  They have to put advertisements in the paper alerting the public that they intend to make such an alteration. This is all quite right and proper because those are the procedures we go through when introducing the development plan and if the local authority wants to make a variation to that plan it seems perfectly logical to me that they should have to go through certain procedures of notifying the public.</P>
      <P>Senator Naughten's amendments have a solid base because when the Planning Appeals Board wishes to dismiss the development plan they can do so behind closed doors.  They do not have to alert the public.  They do not have to seek the views even of the elected members who made the development plan in the first place.</P>
      <P>The Minister is itching to get rid of a council but, at the same time, he wants to give them automony.  One of the only autonomous functions the local authority members have is the making of the development plan.  What will happen under this Bill is that the Appeals Board can just ignore the local development plan.  They have to have regard to it, but what does that mean?  It means they can ignore it if they wish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I take it that Senator Naughten is looking for acceptance of one or other of these amendments and not both of them? Amendment No. 36 would keep the Minister happy as well as everybody else. There would be no automatic obligation on the board to have an oral hearing.  It there was going to be a major breach of the local authority plan, it would only be obligatory where they were requested to do so.  That seems to me to be perfectly <Col N="1341" /> reasonable.  There are instances I know of, I could cite a recent example, where the board can decide not to hold an oral hearing.  The difficulty for the board is that until the appeal takes place it is very difficult to know whether a case is going to be complex and convoluted, involving very difficult issues.  The Minister is now insisting that this thing should happen at one time which means the person making an appeal will have to decide, there and then, if he or she wishes to seek an oral hearing.  I know the Minister is doing this in the interests of speeding up the procedures and I am not opposed to that.</P>
    <P>I would like to give the Minister an example of what can happen.  We had a most complex case recently where we sought an oral hearing.  Part of the land which was the subject of the appeal was already sterile due to a previous application for planning permission.  The board appeared to be unaware of this and they rejected the request for an oral hearing.  I am satisfied that if the board had realised the complexities of the case they may have felt that an oral hearing would have been the best way of teasing out the problem; however no such facility will be availabe under this Bill.  The decision on whether to have an oral hearing will have to be taken at the outset.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 36 should be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully to what the Minister said.  I welcome the principle of the Bill.  We all agree with the spirit of shortening the time involved in appeals before An Bord Pleanála.  We have all heard of cases awaiting a decision by An Bord Pleanála for nine or ten months, and I am sure we have lost investment and jobs as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My concern, which Senator Finneran appears to share, is that, after the best technical advice has been obtained and a development plan has been adopted with the unanimous backing of the council, An Bord Pleanála can drive a coach and four through that development plan.  I have seen them do that in County Roscommon on a number of occasions in the last 12 months.  In the last week planning <Col N="1342" /> permission was given for petrol pumps in a small rural village.  It was appealed to An Bord Pleanála and the planning permission which the county council had unanimously agreed to was turned down. The Minister has more confidence in An Bord Pleanála than I have.  That is why I want to insert this safeguard in the Bill. It was one of the reasons I pressed the Minister to accept the principle of an all party Oireachtas committee to which the board would be answerable with regard to policy, not individual decisions.</P>
    <P>This issue has annoyed me, as a public representative.  I come from a county where, in my 18 years on the council, only one section 4 motion was put.  We approached planning matters in the best interests of the county.  In those 18 years I have never seen planning become a political issue.  If an application was received and it was found to be in order, it got the commitment of all the members of the council.</P>
    <P>I will give another example relating to land zoned for housing.  Roscommon County Council gave planning permission for housing, an appeal against that decision was upheld by An Bord Pleanála and the planning permission turned down, despite the fact that the council had zoned this land for housing 14 years ago.  I do not want to stray from the amendment, but I make those points to back up my amendments which would strengthen this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am impressed by the case made by Senator Naughten.  He genuinely believes that what he is proposing is the proper way to go.  Perhaps he would look at it from my point of view for a moment.  We are dealing with requests for an oral hearing and I am being asked to prescribe the categories where there must be an oral hearing.  Let us look at this from a Minister's point of view as distinct from that of a councillor and his adherence to the county development plan.  There may be difficult cases involving a young family, such as unemployment or a tragedy in the family but I cannot prescribe for them here.  I know such cases exist but I cannot legislate for <Col N="1343" /> exceptions.  A breach of a development plan could be desirable because it might meet an oversight on the part of the council. As Minister I would not regard it as an absolute for an exception, not knowing what else may be ahead.  I would rather leave the decision outside the ambit of primary legislation.</P>
      <P>If, in time, I am proved wrong and there is a need for something like this, I give an undertaking that I will look at it again, but only in the context of many other considerations.  I would have to take account of the human, financial and other developments which are the subject of planning and for which we want to get proper balanced and fair decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whenever there is a complex planning problem, there are two sides&mdash;the developer and the appellant, the people who want the oral hearing and those who do not.  Innate in public representatives is the hope that the problem will go away if there is another system of managing it.  Planning is a crunch question.  One person is for a development and another against it.  Inevitably, in a great number <Col N="1344" /> of cases, there is confrontation and somebody somewhere must take a decision. Maybe both sides can be accommodated but more than likely, one side will feel hurt or aggrieved.  That is the planning process; it cannot be changed.</P>
    <P>Taking all that into account, I do not want to be bound by creating exceptions in areas where, in my judgment, they may not compete in the league of demand, areas where a public or a private right could be hurt in ways we cannot foresee which could be greater than the one we are looking at now which is of a general nature.</P>
    <P>Having heard about the planning discipline in County Roscommon, and with my view of Roscommon, I can think of nothing but people who live by the book and could not dream of upsetting a county manager&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 36:</P>
      <P>In page 11, after line 5, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Any appeal which involves or could involve a material breach of the zoning in the local authority's development plan shall, where requested, be the subject of an oral hearing by the Board.&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>In page 11, subsection (2) (b) (ii), line 16, after &ldquo;Board.&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;Such fee shall be returned if an oral hearing is not carried out by the Board.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an eminently reasonable amendment. I could almost say I am sure the Minister will not disagree with it and will accept it.  My amendment seeks to insert the words: &ldquo;Such a fee shall be returned if an oral hearing is not carried out by the Board.&rdquo;.  It is obligatory that a fee accompany the application and if no hearing takes place it means the appellant has not had the opportunity of having the full hearing and the money made available under the law should be returned to the person who transmitted it.  Nobody should be discriminated against by having to contribute and then not be able to get value for money.  At the very least it would seem following whatever paperwork was required that a substantial amount of the fee could be returned.  This is a very reasonable amendment and I ask the Minister to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. I do not want to give the impression that I object to all these fees but I do object to the manner in which they continue to increase at the stroke of the Minister's pen.  There was a huge outcry against these fees when they were <Col N="1346" /> introduced.  We were told they were all very reasonable and so on but now we see the frequency with which they are increased and the fact that it now costs £50 to have an oral hearing and another £50 just to request it.  Which of us would agree with the idea of sending off money for something and if we do not get the goods, they keep the money?  That is what is happening in this case.  I know the Minister will say the board have to do a great deal of work and research when deciding whether to hold the appeal and that the fee is to cover it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we last discussed this matter the Minister gave us an outline of the costs of running the Appeals Board, having oral hearings, etc., and he made the case that this was the cost to taxpayers and he had to have concern for them.  We are all concerned for the taxpayers because we are all taxpayers and we do not want to see costs getting out of control but the Minister never made any reference in his contribution to the benefits accruing to a developer.  Developers do not put in applications to carry out developments unless they are going to increase the value of their property or, more generally, if they stand to make a good profit on it.  I have no objection to that but I object to the Minister's suggestion that instead of the developer paying the major portion of the costs of the Appeals Board procedure, oral hearings and so on the taxpayers are paying.  Why does the Minister not increase the charges to the developers?  Why does the not increase the charges for major commercial developments?  There is a whole range of areas where the charges could be increased if that is what the Minister wants.  I am not advocating that but I was distressed on the last occasion when the Minister put forward this view because it is symptomatic of his whole fundamental thinking.  If a third party, An Taisce, a prescribed body, the Office of Public Works or Bord Fáilte get involved in making an appeal against some hideous permission which has been given as a result of a section 4 motion by some very irresponsible local authority they will not make any financial gain as a result.  They <Col N="1347" /> are there purely to protect the <i>status quo,</i> and to assist the Minister and the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>I quoted from a booklet last week which stated that it is our obligation and duty to have a concern and care for the environment.  These people are not going to make any money out of it and yet when they ask for an oral hearing they do not get it and the board keeps their money. It is a bit Irish to say the least of it.  The Minister should have a look at the other charges.  With regard to this one, he should see that the money is returned if the request is not fulfilled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We have covered a wide area again considering that the debate so far has not related to the precise amendment.</P>
      <P>Planning fees have been increased substantially over recent years.  We now have the building regulations and, depending on the type of development, a fire certificate, is required; the costs are in the region of £1.75 a square metre.  Overall, the level of fees for planning applications, and subsequently for planning appeals, are reasonable.</P>
      <P>About 20 per cent of the total cost of running An Bord Pleanála is provided for in the fees.  There is no getting away from the fact that taxpayers pay 80 per cent of the cost of the provision of this system.  The Senator is asking me, in a situation where the people who are directly involved contribute about 20 per cent of the overall cost, to reduce that amount and to increase the amount contributed by taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to refund of the fee paid by a party to an appeal who seeks an oral hearing, one would have to assume there were very solid reasons for requesting such hearing.  The board would take into account all of the circumstances and decide whether an oral hearing was required and on foot of that decision it would be appropriate to write to the applicant in a case where an oral hearing was not allowed.  All considerations to determine whether one should have the oral hearing would have been gone <Col N="1348" /> through at that stage.  If you require the board, in primary legislation, to refund the £50 which was submitted on foot of the request for an oral hearing, somebody else must pay and I would like to be told who is that other person.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The request for an oral hearing is made in good faith.  A fee is required for that request.  If the fee is not paid that request is not considered.  An appeal without the fee invalidates the appeal but if the appeal is refused the money is retained.  We are splitting hairs here when the Minister says that the person who makes the request should not get their money or part of it back and brings it into the context of the taxpayer having to pay for it.  We are concerned with the increase in the amount of money required in recent years for appeals. There is a need to ensure fairness in the system.  The argument is that unless the request for the appeal is accompanied by the fee then it is not permitted under any circumstance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather an unusual case.  The Minister seems to be making the point that it is desperately difficult for the board to decide, not just on the appeal, but on the simple fact of whether they will hold an oral hearing.  Because the issue is so complicated for them it takes time for the board to go through the papers and so on.  The Minister is making a very good case perhaps for going back to having an automatic oral hearing if such is requested.  I do not know if that is the case the Minister meant to make and I suspect it is not but the Minister does not realise the extent to which he gives away his fundamental approach to this whole matter.  The Minister's Department &mdash; and I can only assume the Minister supports them &mdash;<Col N="1349" /> brings out these excellent briefing sheets by ENFO which is an offshoot of the Department of the Environment.  These briefing sheets tell us to promote care for the environment and the most recent one is called <i>Planning Anew</i>.  It makes it quite clear: remember you are supposed to get involved, it is your right and responsibility, do not be afraid to go it alone, you can play a part in creating a better environment, planning is everybody's business, it should be seen as a duty as well as a right, an opportunity to help create a better environment.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the Minister wants to put this cripping burden on a person who decides to take the suggestion here of going it alone.  It is £50 to ask for an oral hearing which is a lot of money.  The Minister wants people to be involved, to have the courage of their convictions, and the guts if necessary, to ask for an oral hearing and go it alone as suggested in this leaflet but now he is putting forward the argument that they should sustain the costs.  The Minister does not seem to realise that a good environment is a financial benefit to the whole community and that the whole community is prepared to pay for having a good environment.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his Government make us pay for all sorts of things we do not want.  Most people want a good environment and are prepared to pay for it.  The Minister is trying to drag it down to the lowest level; in other words, every time a person wants to have an oral hearing they should be thinking of the costs involved and the fact that only 20 per cent are covered by the fees and 80 per cent is borne by the unfortunate taxpayer. If the money was spent as well in other areas as it is in this area, the country would be a better place.</P>

      <P>What I am saying happens <Col N="1350" /> to be the truth.  For too long and too often contributions from Senator Hederman and others tended to suggest that the Government ask us to pay for many things we do not want.  Can the Senator tell me what she does not want in the Department of Education, the Department of Health and the Department of Social Welfare because it is very easy to talk in hypothetical terms?  I would be waiting a long time in this House before Senator Hederman would say abolish this service or abolish this demand.  I have to be fair to everybody.  I am trying to provide for a system where a person is not obliged to look for an oral hearing but when they do, they are obliged to submit part of the cost.  It would frighten Senators if the appellants had to pay the true costs.  I am not prepared to do that. I will not ask people who request an oral hearing to pay the full costs; I am not asking them to pay half the cost.  I am asking them to make a contribution towards the overall cost.  I am not going to deceive this House by telling Senators this money can be found somewhere else</P>
      <P>In the best, independent planning system which will allow for a good, sensible, planned, balanced development, and provide for the rights of individuals to object, there is public participation, public contribution and it is supported willingly by the taxpayer.

      <P>We are asking that regard should be had to the provisions of the development plan, the provisions of a special amenity area order and any tree preservation order.  As I understand it, tree preservation orders are not included in the original legislation.  Since there are not many such orders, as the Minister is aware, it is reasonable that consideration should be given to this point.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 40 would <Col N="1352" /> require An Bord Pleanála when exercising their power under section 15 of the Bill to have regard to the development plan of the planning authority concerned and to any special amenity area order or tree preservation order relating to the area in question.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 41 differs in that it specifies special amenity area orders and tree preservation orders as the matters to which the board would have to have regard.  Section 15 (2) as it stands requires the board to deal with cases under that section by reference to the considerations they would take into account in dealing with an appeal <i>de novo</i>.  These considerations are the proper planning and development of the area concerned having regard to the provisions of the development plan and any special amenity area order relating to the area.  To that extent, therefore, I consider that these amendments are unnecessary.</P>
      <P>Planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála would clearly have regard to the provisions of a tree preservation order when considering a planning application or appeal, although the planning Acts do not expressly require them to do so.  I do not believe that this proposal would establish a formal requirement for the board to have regard to tree preservation orders only when exercising their power under section 15.  It is an appropriate approach to what is a general question concerning the standing of such orders. We would be happy to consider this matter in a future general review of planning law, but I do not think it would be appropriate to accept the amendment at this time.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister confirming that they must have regard to the development plan and the amenity area order but not to the tree preservation order?  I cannot understand why the Minister would suggest that.  He then went on, rather helpfully, to say he might introduce such a provision in future legislation. <Col N="1353" /> Why wait for future legislation? Is this not the right time?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 15 deals with a small number of appeals.  The consideration the Senator is suggesting is something to be considered in a broader context.  I will give it consideration in the context of a future planning Bill.  The Senator returned to a question we dealt with earlier, that is, putting into primary legislation a requirement covering proper planning considerations.  The Senator is giving priority to a particular consideration. That should be done in a broader context because it means ultimately that you are giving priority to one type of development and not specifying others.  In planning terms there is a whole range of planning considerations that are important in the determination of appeals.  Singling out a particular area which is already covered and leaving out hundreds of other considerations at the same time is not the way to approach it.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(1)  (a) Section 31 (1) of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the addition of the following paragraph after paragraph (b):</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(c)  A notice referred to in paragraph (b) of this subsection shall not be served after&mdash;</P>

      <P>(ii)  if the permission to which the condition is attached is a permission for the retention on land of any structure, the expiration of a period of five years beginning on the day of the grant of the permission.&rsquo;.</P>

    <P>(b) This subsection shall have effect as respects development referred to in the subsection inserted in section 35 of the Principal Act by paragraph (a) which is carried out before or after the commencement of this subsection.&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments are concerned in the main with time limits for taking enforcement action under the Planning Acts.  Certain powers that planning authorities can use against unauthorised development or development which does not conform to the terms of the relevant planning permission are subject to a five-year limit.  For example, an enforcement notice under section 31 of the 1963 Planning Act can be served in respect of an unauthorised development only within five years of the carrying out of development.  However, other enforcement powers such as the warning notice under section 26 of the <Col N="1356" /> 1976 Act are not subject to any time limitations.  The open-ended nature of some of the enforcement powers gives rise to serious practical difficulties, particularly in the area of property transactions.</P>
      <P>Effectively the existence of these open-ended powers means that the planning history of any property has to be checked right back to 1 October 1964, the date on which the 1963 Planning Act came into operation.  This is very often difficult, time consuming and expensive and is likely to be even more so as 1964 recedes further into the past.  I am proposing, therefore, that we should bring about greater clarity and consistency in relation to enforcement powers by putting a five-year time limit on the use of these that are currently open-ended.  I am satisfied this will not adversely affect the ability of planning authorities to police the proper planning and development of their areas because any unauthorised or non-conforming development or use that has not come to attention or been the subject of enforcement action within five years is most unlikely to be problematical from the point of view of the proper planning and development of the location concerned.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 43 will put a five-year limitation on the time within which a notice under section 35 of the 1963 Act can be served where development has not been carried out in conformity with the planning permission grant.  That amendment also proposes related changes to the existing time limits under sections 31 and 32 of the 1963 Planning Act for taking action against development which does not comply with the conditions attached to a planning permission.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 47 proposes to serve a warning notice under section 26 of the 1976 Planning Act in relation to unauthorised use of land only within five years of when the unauthorised use first commenced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 48 would place a time <Col N="1357" /> limit of five years from the date of the relevant contraventions on applications to the courts for an order under section 27 of the 1976 Act.  Amendment No. 46 is a minor consequential drafting change arising from these amendments.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that these new time limits generally will not come into operation until the start of 1994 so that planning authorities could take action in the intervening period in relation to any longstanding planning infringements of which they are aware.</P>
    <P>I would like to explain also that these proposed time limits on planning enforcement will not affect local authority enforcement powers under other legislation.  For example, a fire authority's power under section 23 of the Fire Services Act, 1981 to seek a High Court order restricting or prohibiting the use of land or a building where it considers there is a serious fire risk posing danger to people will be unaffected.  These amendments meet the concern underlying amendment No. 50 from Senator Costello and others.  It should not be possible to challenge the validity of a development after an unduly long period and I ask the Senator to consider withdrawing the amendment.</P>
    <P>Finally, amendment No. 47 also contains another amendment of section 26 of the 1976 Planning Act.  As that section stands at present a warning notice in relation to unauthorised use of land can be served only when the unauthorised use is taking place.  The amendment will allow a notice to be served also when a planning authority considers that an unauthorised use is likely to be made of the land and will make it an offence knowingly to assist or permit the commencement of unauthorised use in contravention of the warning notice.  I believe these changes will bring about a significant improvement in the warning notice procedure as it relates to unauthorised uses by allowing planning authorities to take pre-emptive action in <Col N="1358" /> the same way as they can in relation to anticipated unauthorised development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has used arguments which made this seem very reasonable and straightforward, but many of us have an intimate knowledge of the enforcement problems for local authorities.  I gave earlier the very high figures for unauthorised developments or developments seriously in breach of the planning permission given either on appeal or by the local authority.  We know we have a fairly serious situation on our hands.  We also know as members of local authorities the very grave problem of understaffing in local authorities. Legal departments are always understaffed.</P>
      <P>There are also very serious practical difficulties in the courts.  It takes a long time to get cases into court and there is an unsympathetic attitude on the part of some district justices or High Court judges in appreciating the pressure on local authorities because of these time constraints.  If an unauthorised development has been in existence for five years, that precludes the court from taking action.  In some instances it is not actually laid down but the courts seem to have decided that after five years have elapsed they should not prosecute or find somebody guilty of the offence.  The Minister made the point that if authorised developments do not come to the notice of the local authority for five years they cannot be very serious.  I accept that, if it is a major development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is in favour of the living city and all the very laudable sentiments which are expressed from time to time by members of his Government. Very often a difficulty is that a developer in a sneaky way can expand an unauthorised development.  I heard of a case only yesterday involving two houses in Wellington Road.  There was authorised office use in one &mdash; it was pre-1964 and the house adjacent to it had been a family residence.  The owner of the <Col N="1359" /> authorised office in the first house acquired the adjacent house on the same terrace.  The local residents' association were unaware of any unauthorised activity in the adjoining house.  They watched it very carefully.  However, on one occasion a member of the residents' association went in to speak to some workman who was in the second house and discovered a wall had been broken through betwen the basement of the office house and the basement of the family house.  They brought this to the attention of the local authority because we do not want another house used for offices.  We are trying to keep the area as part of the living city.  The local authority sent out their planning inspector but the owner maintained that the work had taken place a considerable time previously and that he had been using this other house for his offices.</P>
    <P>You may say that if the local residents are interested and concerned they could give evidence.  How can they give evidence as to exactly when this took place? Let us say that the developer brought the house a year and a half ago and carried out the unauthorised development.  It then comes to the notice of the local authority but they are very reluctant to take action because they do not know if the residents will stand up in court and give the necessary information, but they finally decide they will take action.  They probably get affadavits from the previous owner of the house.  The local authority will have to send these documents to their legal department for examination and the local residents will have to be able to countermand them when the case goes to court.  All this takes time.</P>
    <P>Eventually the local authority decide to prosecute and as soon as the owner of the illegal development knows what is happening, he makes a planning application to stall the whole process so that the planning authority will not go ahead with the court action.  If they try to go ahead with the prosecution, the courts <Col N="1360" /> will say they are unreasonable because the man has submitted a planning application to which the local authority or the Planning Appeals Board may agree.  The courts will not give a decision on this case and will adjourn it.  The matter has to go through the application and appeals procedures.  This developer may be one of those people the Minister finds so irritating because they will not provide all the back-up information for their appeals.  They want their case to drag on. The local authority refuse it, the Planning Appeals Board refuse it, the local authority go back to court and our friend, the developer, makes another application. This time he is only asking for two floors in offices instead of the three floors he asked for the first time, and so it goes on, sometimes for five years.</P>
    <P>If it is the Minister's intention, which I am sure it is not, to facilitate these unauthorised developments and developers by bringing in the five year cut-off point and to make life easier for them, I would be very sad.  I am certain that what he has in mind is to make the whole process more efficient.  I suggest with the greatest humility, that of all the amendments, the Minister should not to go through with this one.  I would be prepared not to speak on any other amendment if he were prepared to withdraw this one.</P>
    <P>Why did he bring it in at this late stage? Who made representations about it? Why was it not in the Bill when it went through the Dáil?  Would he not consider that the advantages gained by making life easier for the solicitors, because they will not have to go back to October 1964, are greatly outweighed by the disadvantage he is imposing on people who are endeavouring to assist the local authority to prevent illegal developments taking place?  I would urge the Minister to drop this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>During the debate in the Dáil I indicated that I was trying to find a suitable amendment to cater for the <Col N="1361" /> kind of situations I have outlined.  Deputy Howlin put down an amendment in the Dáil containing the same type of aspirations. We are trying to meet a certain type of problem.</P>
      <P>It is an outrageous perversion of everything I have said to suggest that this amendment is introduced to facilitate people who want to pursue a course of unauthorised development.  Not only am I making it more difficult to do that, but I am imposing a new regime in that fines for offences in this area are astronomically different than anything ever provided in planning law.  Let us get rid of the notion that we want to facilitate unauthorised development.</P>
      <P>The enforcement procedures only have to be initiated within the five years. Whatever takes place after that can go on as long as necessary, whether there are court developments or otherwise.  This amendment is in response to representations and is designed to achieve our own objective.  In some cases it was necessary to go back to 1964, and that took a considerable time.  We need to regularise this.  In no way does this amendment facilitate unauthorised development.  In fact, if you combine all the features of this Bill, you will find that unauthorised development is being outlawed in a more significant and substantial way than ever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the most serious change in the Bill.  I can only repeat my plea to the Minister to drop it. The Minister claims that it is a perversion of his views to assert that he wishes to facilitate unauthorised developers.  I am certain that it is not his intention, but the unwitting outcome may be that that is precisely what will happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1362" /> The Minister makes the very good point that only the initial stages will have to be taken.  To what initial stages is he referring?  I do not know exactly how far it will have to go.  As soon as a planning application is submitted, that puts a stay on the local authorities.  If a planning application has been made, you will not be able to persuade the legal department to take legal proceedings because they know what will happen.  Could the Minister explain what he means by &ldquo;initial proceedings&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>I take the point about the astronomical new fines but may I point out that astronomical fines are not worth anything unless the cases can be prosecuted in court?  By introducing this five year bar, the Minister is making it far more difficult even to get them fined sixpence.  That is the reality.  Having astronomical fines will be of no value if they are not prosecuted and we cannot get the judges to impose these fines.  If five years is to be the cut-off period, we may never reach that position.</P>
    <P>What is the great and deep concern for legal persons having to go back to 1964? Is that not what a lawyer is for?  If you employ a solicitor to buy your house, do you not expect him not only to go back to October 1964 but to the date the house was built?  My house was built in 1834 and my solicitor went back to 1834 to check it out.  Senator Norris's house was probably built in the 18th century and he expects his lawyers to go back and check from the first legal document which was drawn up.  That is what solicitors are for. I do not understand the grave concern and trauma about solicitors having to go back to October 1964.  That is not a terrible burden on anybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask him to consider some of my points and answer them specifically. I raise this matter because it is extremely urgent and relevant and because things are now happening at Luggala very quickly.  I have reports today that there is at least one bulldozer with a crane on the site of the proposed interpretative centre.  Perhaps it is testing for water at this stage or is starting the excavations but it is on the site.  Maybe the Minister could let me know what it is doing there.</P>
      <P>I raise this matter in the context of a statement issued by the Minister and the Office of Public Works on 24 June and the reply which was issued by Professor Phillips on 26 June.  It is important to read into the record the Minister's statement and Professor Phillips's reply.</P>
      <P>The Minister, when commenting on the announcement by the Office of Public Works that works were to start and that a contract had been issued, said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for a National Park in Wicklow has long been recognised and the need for a proper Visitor Centre is also accepted.  The debate about Wicklow has revolved around the choice of site.  It has generated much heat and emotion, it has brought to the fore some ill-conceived reactions based on misconceptions about man's role and influence on the landscape.  No credible arguments have been advanced nor has any scientific evidence been adduced to show that this site should be passed over and the Planning Authority agrees that this is the case.  I understand that a recent report by <Col N="1365" /> TCD on interpretation in the Wicklow Mountains accepts the need for a centre in the Luggala area and saw merit in the site proposed by the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>I would now call on all who care for, and value the Wicklow uplands to use this Centre to proclaim the message of conservation, particularly to the younger generations of Irish and European citizens who will come to visit the Wicklow Mountains National Park.</P>
    <P>That statement by the Minister prompted what appears to be an extraordinary reply from Professor Adrian Phillips, the Director of Natural Resources Development Centre, University College, Dublin.  It is extraordinary because Professor Phillips felt obliged to issue a statement before the publication of his report because of the action of the Minister and the Office of Public Works.  If one reads between the lines it is a coded reply which is saying that the Professor is acutely embarrassed by the action of the Minister. It states:</P>
    <P>In a press release dated 24 June 1992, the Office of Public Works announced that a contract has been placed for the new Wicklow Mountains National Park Visitor Centre near Luggala. The Minister was also quoted as saying &ldquo;I understand that a recent report by TCD on interpretation in the Wicklow Mountains accepts the need for a centre in the Luggala area and saw merit in the site proposed by the Office of Public Works&rdquo;.  We were astonished that such a gross misinterpretation of our report should have been conveyed to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Those are very strong words.  It continues:</P>
    <P>The report, which is an interpretative plan for the whole County, was commissioned by the Wicklow County Councillors, who have yet to be given the opportunity of reading.  It would be as inappropriate for us as it is for the Office of Public Works to comment <Col N="1366" /> on its contents until the Councillors have read it and then considered it at their forthcoming meeting on 13 July. In the meantime, misuse of our report does nothing to justify the Office of Public Works's decision to go ahead with the Visitor Centre near Luggala.</P>
    <P>It is signed by Adrian Phillips and Gillian Binks.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious there is an extraordinary process and sequence of events going on which are rushing the interpretactive centre at Luggala.  A report is due for the councillors of Wicklow County Council on 13 July, nearly two weeks away.  Apparently the Office of Public Works, as far as one can interpret the Minister's statement, have already seen this report.  How can we make objective decisions on environmental matters of such enormous importance when Wicklow County Council, which commissioned this report, has been bypassed?  Have the Office of Public Works got a copy of this report and have they communicated the contents and interpreted this report to anybody in advance of those who commissioned this report because the timing of this announcement is insulting to those who commissioned the report.  This announcement and the comment on the report is issued before those of us who are Wicklow county councillors have even been allowed to have a look at it.  It seems to me that on a matter as important as this we are rushing the process in order to try to stifle the opposition.  It is being presented by the Department and by the Minister as a <i>fait accompli</i> so that the opposition will be stifled.</P>
    <P>The opposition to Luggala will not be stifled.  Challenges will be made to this decision at every level and by every means, including legal means if necessary. What is the point of getting experts like Professor Phillips and others to issue reports when apparently the Office of Public Works, that undemocratic monster, over-rule the democratic wishes of <Col N="1367" /> the people of Roundwood, the environmental experts and other bodies and the wishes of the democratically elected county councillors?  How can this body take a decision like this into their own hands?  What is the hurry?  Why can the Minister not wait two more weeks?  Why can the Office of Public Works not wait two more weeks?  It appears from what the Minister and the Office of Public Works say that they are making an interpretation of the Phillips report which is in direct contradiction of Professor Phillips' interpretation.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the report accepts the need for a centre in the Luggala area and saw merit in it.  I am sure there is merit in it but how much?  Surely there is greater merit in putting it in at a different location.  I guess &mdash; and it is not an inspired guess &mdash; that the report finds that a different location would be better than Luggala.  What has happened is that we have been treated to selective leaks from the Department and the Office of Public Works and I am asking that we wait until the county councillors who commissioned this report have seen and debated it and a decision can then be made by the democratically elected representatives.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed visitor centre in Ballinastoe townland, near Luggala, is part of a broader conservation project concerning the Wicklow Mountain National Park.  The Government's decision to establish Ireland's fourth national park in Wicklow was announced on 3 April 1990.  At the launch a commitment was given to a park which could eventually cover 33,000 hectares of mountain land, resources permitting, and subject to the <Col N="1368" /> voluntary agreement of landowners to sell land, or enter into management agreements with the Office of Public Works.  At the launch in April 1990, it was also announced that the Government had approved the construction of a visitor centre at the periphery of the target area which would be open to the public in 1993.</P>
    <P>A lot of progress has been made on the park since the initial announcement in 1990.  Eight staff have been employed, £150,000 was invested in an information office at Glendalough and thousands of school children have availed of the nature walks provided by the park rangers.  The amount of land acquired for the park has been expanded and this year a further 1,214 hectares was added to the park.  In addition, a number of proposals for large scale commercial afforestation in the heart of the mountains have been resisted to date.</P>
    <P>All these initiatives have virtually gone unnoticed in the controversy over the plans to build the visitor centre which was, as I said, announced in 1990.  That centre is being placed at the edge of the target area for the park in a commercial conifer plantation.  Before the Office of Public Works acquired the site they approached the planning authority outlining the various site options they had considered in the county.  The planning authority indicated that the site was acceptable in principle and so it was purchased by the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>As soon as the Office of Public Works became aware that there were public misgivings at the location we commissioned an independent environmental impact statement which, contrary to some public statements by various critics, went into considerable detail on the effects of the proposed development, including a detailed assessment of traffic.  The environmental impact statement was prepared by Brady Shipman Martin, reputable consultants with a recognised expertise and track record both at home and abroad.  Their study concluded that <Col N="1369" /> the project would not have a significant impact on the environment.  The public were then given an opportunity to comment on the statement.  Not only was this direct public participation made available, but the Office of Public Works also accepted every invitation to meet opponents to the project and to attend public meetings.  As late as Easter Monday last I spent four and a half hours dealing with protestors against this and other centres.</P>
    <P>Sixteen submissions were received. Although the Office of Public Works were only obliged by law to have regard to these submissions, we went further and sent them to the planning authority together with a detailed assessment of the environmental impact study and public response.  The planning authority subsequently confirmed their acceptance of the project.  Following the planning authority's acceptance of the plans their elected representatives on the casting vote of the chairman asked on 20 January 1992 that the project be deferred pending yet a further study, this time an interpretation generally of County Wicklow. TCD were commissioned to prepare this study which was, I understand, to be completed by April 1992.</P>
    <P>My predecessor in office, Deputy O'Donoghue, responded to the councillors' request and said that the project could not be deferred any longer given that three different competent bodies &mdash; including the officials of Wicklow County Council &mdash; had examined the plans, that considerable investment had already been made in the project and the fact that EC funding was conditional on the project being completed by 1993.  No response was received from the council and I reaffirmed the position in March 1992.  Subsequently, the EC Commission accepted our proposals last month.</P>
    <P>I then authorised the placing of the contract with Ascon last week.  I was fully aware of a <i>Sunday Press</i> report that TCD in their study had backed the visitor centre site.  TCD, in fact, presented a <Col N="1370" /> completed version of their report to the Office of Public Works on 5 June 1992 and when I announced that the centre would be going ahead, I did say I understood that the TCD report accepts the need for a centre in the Luggala area and sees merit in the site proposed by the Office of Public Works.  This resulted in a press release from Professor Phillips of TCD who said that the report had been misrepresented and stating that it would be confidential until discussed by Wicklow County Council.</P>
    <P>I must reiterate that nothing I have stated is contradicted in the report and I was commenting in the light of previous public interest as shown in the <i>Sunday Press</i> article and the fact that the Office of Public Works had been given a copy of the final report.  The Office of Public Works could comment in greater detail on the report but have and will refrain from doing so in deference to Professor Phillips' request until the members of Wicklow County Council discuss it.</P>
    <P>An irrevocable contract has now been placed for the visitor centre and work has commenced on site which has been handed over to the contractors by the Office of Public Works.  I look forward to seeing the centre open to the public next year.  I hope that any divisions arising from the saga will be overcome when the centre is seen to be operating smoothly.</P>
    <P>It is very important that the Office of Public Works continue dialogue with local community groups and landowners on the broader issues affecting the national park and in this respect I look forward to a further report from TCD on the management of the uplands.  The report is nearing completion and is part funded by the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>I hope this puts the matter in context, puts the facts on the record of this House and allays any fear the people of Wicklow have so that the great beauty and heritage of Wicklow can be interpreted for the people of Wicklow, for the people of greater Dublin who use it constantly, for <Col N="1371" /> the people of Ireland and for our European partners and the world at large.</P>

      <P>I would like the Minister to answer a question.  Why not wait and hold fire until everybody has had time to consider the Phillips report, particularly the county councillors because some people have been able to interpret it and county councillors and the democratically elected representatives have not been able to interpret it.</P>

      <P>I am privileged to know yourself, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, for many years.  I worked in public commercial life prior to coming into public life ten years ago and I pride myself in all my public utterances in giving the facts of every matter as I know them to be true and accurate.  I categorically state once again that the Office of Public Works received this report not alone from TCD but it was presented personally to us by Professor Phillips.  I further state that based on the decision of Wicklow County Council, on the decision of the European Commission and on the consultant's advice as interpreted by us, we have decided to proceed given the fact that three studies have already taken place and a fourth study is at present about to be considered by Wicklow County Council.  I believe we have taken the right decision.  The site has now been handed over to the contractor, the contract is irrevocable, it is proceeding, and as far as I am concerned the centre will be opened next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Wallace, to the House and wish Cork well on Sunday. I hope they play well and I know that Limerick will win.</P>
      <P>The issue I raise is the failure of the Minister for the Environment to sanction the introduction of a speed limit of 40 miles per hour at Kilcornan in County Limerick.  There is extreme concern, disappointment and indeed anger in the parish of Kilcornan resulting from this decision.  It must be reviewed immediately and a speed limit of 40 miles per hour or less introduced at Kilcornan.</P>
      <P>For many years the people of Kilcornan have being pressing for the introduction of a speed limit.  There is extreme concern with the risk of serious accidents in this village.  This is especially the case at the national school, where speeding traffic is endangering the lives of the children. The school is situated at a series of bends on the road.  The parents' committee and the school management for several years have requested that a warning light or pedestrian crossing light be placed at the entrance to the school.  We are informed that this cannot be done because the road is a national secondary route and there is no 40 mph or less speed limit operating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The community is extremely concerned that the Department of the Environment have ignored the concern for the safety of the children.  We do not want to wait for a fatality to occur for action to be taken in this case.  All local representatives in the area are concerned that this be rectified.  It is more than five years since county councillors in the Rathkeale area proposed to Limerick County Council that a speed limit of 40 mph be introduced.  The Garda Síochána were consulted and were very supportive of the proposal and the formal consent of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána was received.  Limerick <Col N="1373" /> County Council gave unanimous approval to the proposal and it was forwarded by Limerick County Council to the Department of the Environment together with a comprehensive list of proposals for the introduction of speed limits in other areas of County Limerick.</P>
    <P>It was a surprise and a disappointment that when the Minister on 7 May 1992 considered the list and signed the Road Traffic (Speed Limits) County Borough of Limerick and County Limerick Regulations, 1992 the proposal to include Kilcornan was omitted.  This was one of the more important on the list because of the speed of the traffic, the condition of the road and the level of local traffic including the school, shops, church, a lounge bar, a caravan site, a pitch and putt course as well as a substantial number of private dwellings.</P>
    <P>If local government and local people have any semblance of autonomy, surely the strongly held views of the people and their public representatives should not be ignored?  What is the point in requesting local involvement by the county council if the strongly held views of the council in a matter of local concern such as speed limits is to be disregarded by the Minister? The proposal for a speed limit was done in the interest of safety, especially the safety of the children in the area and to ignore it is anti-democratic.  I respectfully ask the Minister for State to reconsider the matter.  The views I have expressed are not just being held by me but by all the people of this great parish in County Limerick and their public representatives on all sides.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank Senator Neville for the good wishes to Cork next Sunday.  As we have already agreed, we will meet after the match and I will commiserate with him and he will celebrate with me when Cork wins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am grateful to be provided with this opportunity to explain to Senators my <Col N="1374" /> Department's policy with regard to national roads.  Senators will be aware that there is a major development programme under way to bring our national roads system into line with other Community countries and substantial capital funds sought from the Exchequer and the European Community Structural Funds are being expended for this purpose.  The whole <i>raison d'être</i> of this programme is to put in place a high quality network of national roads to facilitate a fast and efficient transport system which is essential to our economic growth.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to instruct Senators on the importance of the national transport system for this country.  Probably to a greater extent than any other country in the European Community we depend on transport for the health of our economic life and the road network is a key element in this system.  Therefore, its development and maintenance are of the highest national importance.  It is my Department's policy, to protect national roads against unwarranted developments of any kind which would tend to reduce their traffic-carrying capacity or their effectiveness as national routes.  Any unnecessary reduction in the speed limits below the national limit which is currently 55 miles per hour would reduce a national roads effectiveness.</P>
    <P>On the stretch of road in question at Kilcornan, along the N69 between Limerick and Foynes it was proposed by Limerick County Council that a 40 miles per hour limit would apply.  While it is the practice to accept proposals for speed limits by local authorities in relation to non-national roads, proposals affecting national roads are examined carefully. For this reason the location was examined by the roads inspector from my Department and I was satisfied, following consideration of this report, that the lower speed limit proposed for this stretch of road was not essential for the purposes of road safety.  Low speed limits on stretches of national roads can lead <Col N="1375" /> to pressure for development along these stretches, further reducing their traffic-carrying capacity and effectiveness.  It was for these reasons, therefore, that I decided not to approve the county council's <Col N="1376" /> proposal to apply a 40 mile per hour limit on the national road N69 at Kilcornan.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 3 July 1992.</P>
