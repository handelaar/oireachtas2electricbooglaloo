      <P>I have to inform the House that letters dated 10 and 11 February 1992 have been received from the Secretary, Department of the Taoiseach, regarding: (1) the resignation of the Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey; (2) the appointment of Albert Reynolds as Taoiseach; (3) the appointment of members of the Government; (4) the nomination of John P. Wilson as Tánaiste; and (5) the allocation of Government Departments.  The letters will be set out in the usual manner in the Journal of the House, and consequent on this announcement they will also be printed in the Official Report of the Debates.</P>

      <P>I have notice from Senator McGowan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to examine the present overcrowding in prisons, which is exacerbated by the number of persons imprisoned for minor motoring offences.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Norris of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to accede to the expressed wishes of Seanad Éireann and Dublin Corporation by making a substantial cash grant from lottery funding for the rebuilding of the Hirschfeld Centre in Dublin.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to make extra funding available through the Eastern Health Board for Wicklow community services.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Jackman of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to abandon his plans to apply means testing to the ESF maintenance grants.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Costello of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to rescind the decision to meanstest ESF grants for students enrolling in the regional technical colleges and Dublin Institute of Technology colleges.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators McGowan, Norris, Ross, Jackman and Costello as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator McGowan's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Norris, Ross, Jackman and Costello may give notice another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>As you indicated at the start of business, a Chathaoirligh, very momentous changes have taken place since the House last met.  One Taoiseach has gone and a new Taoiseach and Government have taken office.  Although the Order of Business is not the appropriate time to discuss these matters, it would be appropriate that at the earliest possible opportunity &mdash; I hope it will be during this week &mdash; Members be given a chance to say farewell to the former Taoiseach and discuss the appointment of a new Taoiseach and Government and matters arising from that.  I suggest to the Leader of the House that, as this is the second House of the Oireachtas, he consider inviting the Taoiseach to come to this House to outline his views on the state of the nation and to hear the views of this House.  I ask him to do that at the earliest possible date so that Members can make their contribution to the current debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been mention in the past few days of the possibility of a new forum to discuss Northern Ireland.  While that may be a good idea, I must point out that we have such a forum, this House.  I ask the <Col N="427" /> Acting Leader of the House to accede to requests that the House have a full debate, with contributions from all sides, on Northern Ireland in as constructive a way as possible and as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would very much welcome an opportunity to debate the resignation of Deputy Haughey as Taoiseach.  Gan dabht ar domhan ní bheidh a leithéid ann arís.</P>
      <P>I would also welcome an opportunity for a full debate on the Government and on the importance of implementing policies, particularly those aimed at addressing the problem of unemployment.</P>
      <P>I welcome the initiatives taken in relation to Northern Ireland and I hope the Acting Leader of the House will accede to our request for a debate on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's call for a debate on Northern Ireland.  I have made a similar call so many times that it would be redundant for me to add further to it.</P>
      <P>I also feel that it would be appropriate for the House to have an opportunity not to rehash the past but to extend our good wishes to the new Taoiseach and his Cabinet. I am sure everyone hopes they will succeed.</P>
      <P>I realise that new Ministers have taken charge of portfolios and it would be unrealistic for us to demand immediate answers, but I remind the Acting Leader of the House that item No. 40 which deals with the consequences of the European Court judgment on the matter of homosexuality, is still a matter of considerable concern to me.  It is perhaps of a little more concern to me as a result of yesterday's appointments, but one never knows, people do change and seek to impress with new-found virtues.  Deputy Burke certainly showed himself to be a progressive Minister in some regards and I hope Deputy Flynn will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Acting Leader of the House if the Government have taken note of the consequences of the referendum on <Col N="428" /> abortion, as reported in today's Irish Times.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not appropriate to the Order of Business, as the Senator will understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>May I then put the issue on the record in a slightly different way?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator wants to ask the Acting Leader an appropriate question on the Order of Business, he may do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case, I would ask the Acting Leader to convey to the Minister for Justice the concern felt by people that according to the newspapers, a 14-year old victim of rape is currently, or is about to become the subject of an injunction in the matter of abortion, and ask if he or that party feel satisfied this is a humane method of proceeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Since we last met there have been enormous changes and I ask the Acting Leader of the House if he would give us an opportunity to discuss the changes that have taken place and, indeed, the programme that might be envisaged by the new Administration. We have a new Taoiseach, a new Cabinet and as the new Taoiseach mentioned, a new dream ticket to get Ireland going again.  It would be most appropriate if we could have a debate in the Seanad on the state of the nation and invite the Taoiseach to contribute.  Perhaps we could take Motion No. 9, which the Acting Leader put down, as part and parcel of that, because it deals with industrial policy.</P>
      <P>On the proposal by the Labour Party Leader, Deputy Spring, to have an all-party forum on Northern Ireland, it is most appropriate that we should establish one.  Indeed, there have been encouraging signs from Northern Ireland leaders that they are going to meet on a regular basis.  That does not inhibit a long overdue discussion on Northern Ireland in this House.  Will the Leader give time for such a debate in the very near future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="429" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's imaginative proposal that the new Taoiseach be asked to address the House.  Obviously, while we cannot discuss the changes in Government, those changes modify our concerns on a wide range of issues, because of the fresh personnel and the fresh sense of commitment of the Government.  Will the Acting Leader consider the following points and perhaps put them to the Government?  Under this new regime, I hope the Government take Seanad Éireann seriously: I hope the new Ministers will do us the courtesy of coming in here and taking their appropriate briefs, isntead of assigning them, quite frequently &mdash; I mean no offence &mdash; to Ministers of State who are totally unconnected with the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Senator to put his question to the Acting Leader rather than make a speech on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I never make speeches on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Secondly, would the Acting Leader again convey to the Government the urgency of dealing with the subjects raised in Items Nos. 22 and 25 on the Supplementary Order Paper, which in brief ask that justice be done and amends be made to Mr. Nicky Kelly? This is particularly appropriate now, because tomorow a British House of Commons group is being formed to consider this matter.  As I said before, we will be shamed into it.  Also, we have a new Minister for Foreign Affairs whose sense of commitment in redressing injustices is very well known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I support the call that has been made again and again for a debate on Northern Ireland.  Here again we have the sense of a new start &mdash; the British Prime Minister's initiative yesterday, and the new Taoiseach's commitment to going to any limits to promote a settlement in Northern Ireland.  Last week, a number of us said we doubted whether a <Col N="430" /> debate in Seanad Éireann could really make any contribution.  I have changed my mind on that.  When we talk about Northern Ireland we should, individually and collectively, not just make ritual condemnations but examine how far our attitudes are contributing to the problem in Northern Ireland and how far we can change them to help towards a proper solution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join in the requests for a discussion on the new Government.  Very dramatic events took place in the past week and it would be appropriate for this House to discuss them and the future direction of the Government.</P>
      <P>I would also ask the Acting Leader to bring forward the debate on Northern Ireland.  Last week we had condemnation of the slaughter in the province.  It was appropriate to condemn the appalling incidents that took place, but there are some signs for hope following the mass meeting in Belfast, the visit of our President to that city and developments yesterday. They demand a political response and it is now time for politicians to take centre stage and put their views.  We can do a useful days work in this House by doing so.</P>
      <P>Finally, will the Acting Leader indicate when it is intended to take item No. 9, the report of the Industrial Policy Review Group?  Given the unacceptably high level of unemployment, it would be appropriate to discuss that document because it charts at least one path forward in how to deal with some of those appalling problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I too would welcome a visit by the Taoiseach to the House to discuss procedures and the role the Seanad could play.  I have no doubt the Taoiseach would welcome the opportunity to speak to the House.  I strongly support the Members who asked for a debate on the problems in Northern Ireland.  We have requested such a debate for a long time.  I call on the Acting Leader of the House to approach the new Minister for Foreign Affairs to <Col N="431" /> ask him to visit the Seanad to hear our strong views.  I have a contribution to make to such a debate.  The population in the North of Ireland are under great pressure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have noted the Senator's request but I would prefer if he did not make a speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Chair's guidance and I will tailor my contribution accordingly.  For the ordinary law abiding citizens in the North of Ireland security is not the answer.  They are under pressure and the circumstances under which they are living do not have an equivalent in Europe.  Regardless of whether other fora are set up, this House should&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is a long tradition of long speeches on the Order of Business. The issue raised by Senator Manning, the request to the new Taoiseach to come here and outline the programme of action and his views and philosophy, is an excellent one and should be addressed. Speaker after speaker has asked for a debate on Northern Ireland.  I am the only person in this House with an office in Belfast and I have been there for three days of the past week.  I was at the demonstration last week in Belfast.  I was in west Belfast last week when the Sinn Féin office was blown up.  My members taught the young child who was killed in the bookie's office.  The President of my union was in a school in Armagh yesterday which had been blown up before Christmas and has just reopened.  I am making the point that it hits every aspect of our lives.</P>
      <P>Words are important.  They are almost more important than action because the actions of everybody are suspect &mdash; what side are you on?  What is the hidden agenda?  Where are you going?  People are looking for leadership from politicians and we need at least to say where we are going and what we are going to do.  Our actions and commitments are led by our words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greatest issue in Ireland today, whether we are looking at the past or to the future is still whether there will be peace.  We have to look at that.  I recognise, a Chathaoirligh, that you feel I am <Col N="434" /> going on a bit and I will conclude at that. I believe above all else that we have to look at that problem.  I have a responsibility to those people whom I represent in the North, both in the trade union sense and politically, and also to children and pupils.  We all have different responsibilities in different ways.</P>
    <P>I came back from Belfast late last night.  We blame the security forces.  I went through five security checks between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m.  They are doing what they can do.  An attitude change is necessary and we have to address it.</P>

      <P>Senators Manning, Upton, Norris and Dardis raised the issue of an invitation to the new Taoiseach to the House.  That invitation was issued this morning and I hope the Taoiseach will come to the House next week to address us.</P>
      <P>Senator Murphy hoped the new Government and Taoiseach would take note of this House.  The Taoiseach's record as Minister stands.  I remember he was in the House to introduce Bills and always paid this House that courtesy.  I hope, subject to further discussion with the Whips, that we would have an hour next week to discuss the issues as outlined.</P>
      <P>On the Northern Ireland debate, I made contact with the new Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews.  He obviously has just arrived at his new post but would be conscious of the fact that this issue has been raised here every week.  I made the views of the House know to him.  He would like to have some time over the weekend and come back to us on it.  He indicated he would look forward to coming to this House on occasions.  I hope to have some definite information on that soon.</P>
      <P>Motion 40 was raised by Senator Norris.  I ask the Senator to await the White Paper which I hope will be forthcoming quite soon.  Item No. 9 was raised by Senator Costello and Senator Dardis. I hope that over the coming weeks, subject to agreement between the Whips, we will have a debate on industrial policy.</P>

      <P>I want to express my appreciation to Senators for their co-operation in passing this legislation.  I will be reporting back to the Dáil on some of the amendments which were put forward here.  This is a very important Bill.  It will provide a very efficient system of examination of patent applications and will enable Ireland to ratify two important conventions, the European Patent Convention and the Patent Co-operation Treaty.  It will enhance the reputation of Ireland internationally. It will provide a special low cost system of protection for small inventors, i.e. the short term patents.  I am heartened by the welcome shown to the Bill in this House and the debate which took place.  This Bill will now pass into law as soon as possible and we will do our utmost to reduce the patent backlog after the Bill is in operation.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the co-operation of Senators and the contributions they make to legislation.  I have always done my utmost to ensure that legislation comes before this House in the first instance because of the very detailed knowledge available here and the assistance given by all in this House.</P>

I also recognise that part of the reason the Bill was brought forward was to take account of certain EC directives.  I was not present, for certain reasons, during the earlier debate on this Bill but I understand that it has been very thoroughly debated.  I <Col N="436" /> know my party would prefer to have certain strengthening additions or provisions to the Bill which they felt were lacking. Nonetheless the Bill will be an improvement on existing legislation.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister on behalf of my party for the co-operative manner in which he has dealt with his brief and the various exchanges of views thereon. While we would have preferred the provisions of the Bill to have included other matters, nonetheless it does constitute an improvement on the legislation as it stands.</P>

      <P>I should like to express my gratitude to the Minister of State present, Deputy Leyden, and his senior Minister, the Minister for Industry and Commerce who I know have put an enormous amount of work into this Bill.  It would be remiss of me not to compliment Mr. Seán Fitzpatrick, the Controller of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks, on the tremendous work he has undertaken with regard to patents over the years in extremely difficult circumstances, occasioned particularly by the lack of facilities.  It would be my hope that the Minister and his Minister of State would bear in mind one point I raised specifically, which was that, of all Government agencies this is one of the few that makes a profit despite its lack of facilities.  I appeal to the Minister to increase the facilities available to the Patents Office for their benefit and that of the country generally.</P>

    <Title>Role of Seanad Éireann: Statements (Resumed).</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the then Leader of the House was elevated to the position of Cathaoirleach many tributes have been paid to him, particularly in regard to the emphasis he has always placed on his commitment to Seanad reform and his <Col N="437" /> open attitude to the distinctive, separate nature of this House from that of the other House.  For example, in his opening remarks to this House as Cathaoirleach, he said this House was not a carbon copy of the other House but rather &ldquo;should carve out for itself an individual, definite and distinctive role&rdquo;.  We look forward to his continued championing of reform of this House.</P>
      <P>We were glad to note that certain basic reforms were agreed unanimously by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. Nonetheless, since becoming a Member of this House in 1989, I remain disappointed that universities, regional technical colleges and other third level institutions have been discriminated against, being excluded from having Seanad voting rights.  I contend that two and a half years is a long time to wait for the elimination of such discrimination. Graduates of the University of Limerick are becoming extremely anxious about this discrimination.  I predict it will not be long before there will be a lobbying force since the numbers of graduates increase annually particularly since the incorporation of the Thomond College of Education and the Mary Immaculate Teacher Training College into the University of Limerick.  This means there will be a strong lobby of graduates in the humanities occasioned by the integrative process of the Mary Immaculate Teacher Training College and the Thomond College of Education, affording the humanities a strong niche in the University of Limerick.</P>
      <P>I appear to be repeating myself <i>ad nauseam</i> seeking what I regard as a very basic reform.  I appeal again that the universities I have mentioned the University of Limerick, Dublin City University and the other third level institutions, particularly the regional technical colleges, be included for Seanad voting purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will be debating the two colleges Bill.  With the enhanced status of the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology the time is ripe for them to be allocated that status. For example, the Culliton report, which <Col N="438" /> I hope will be debated shortly in this House, places enormous emphasis on the excellence in our vocational education sector.  It obtains already within the academic sphere but, we do not appear to respond as readily as we might to its importance within the vocational sphere. In not extending Seanad voting rights to the regional technical colleges I wonder whether we are not rendering ourselves even more elitist.  Surely we Members of this House must realise that the only way forward for the country is by representation in both Houses of all sectors of our community, the academic as well as the vocational sector.</P>
    <P>I appeal earnestly to the Cathaoirleach to put an end to this discrimination during his term of office because it is esential that it be abolished.  I predict mine will not be a lone voice in the future since the many graduates are becoming most uneasy about this matter, having allotted a certain time within which this matter was to be pursued.  While there may not be huge numbers of them, they feel victimised and excluded.</P>
    <P>Because we do not have an education Act there is little scope for debating the subject in this House.  After all, it should be remembered that education impinges on all our lives.  Indeed, looking at Members of this House it will quickly be realised that there are representatives of first, second and third levels in education, with a dispersal of university professors. Another Member is the general secretary of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, a past president of the Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland. While some may have given up teaching to concentrate wholly on politics, others may be continuing part-time teaching.  It is a shame their expertise is lost through the lack of an education Act.</P>
    <P>One might well ask why this is relevant to reform of the Seanad.  I contend that, if and when the Green Paper, White Paper and, ultimately, the education Bill come on stream it would be appropriate that it be this House which would initiate this legislation since we have the time, expertise and broad cadre of Members capable <Col N="439" /> of debating its provisions fully.  Education should not be the prerogative of educators solely.  Everybody has a vested interest in ensuring the best possible education for themselves and their children.</P>
    <P>A day, if not an hour, is now a long time in politics, in that there have been two major changes on the Irish political scene <i>vis-a-vis</i> Ministers for Education since I last commented on this matter.  It is my hope that the new Minister for Education, Deputy Brennan, will immediately get to work and introduce this long awaited education Bill.</P>
    <P>From time to time we have debated major reports in this House, a feature of our role I welcome.  For example, one such report thoroughly debated was that of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities, which committee has the statutory mandate of vetting EC Directives, particularly since we are now in 1992.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the chairpersons or directors of agencies like NESC, the ESRI and others &mdash; whose reports map a course for us through the nineties and well into the next century &mdash; to present their reports to this House.  We have had plenty of representations made to us, by mail, from the Conference of Major Religious Superiors, the Combat Poverty Agency and others: daily we receive such representations.  I would focus attention on the major agencies which have had a major impact on budgetary provisions, that have consistently raised the matter of poverty in recent years.  I should like to see them present their pre-budget proposals to us, indeed even perhaps their post-budget comments when poverty and other issues tend to be forgotten.  I would recommend that they return to this House to review budgetary provisions, there by concentrating all our minds on waht should have been apropriate budgetary provisions in this area.</P>
    <P>One might well argue that that is not the business of this House.  I contend it is because, though separate, there is that interlink between this and the other House.  It is my hope that when we have <Col N="440" /> an opportunity to debate the Culliton report that their chairman, Mr. Jim Culliton, would come before us and present the report.  It appears to be extremely simple and easy to digest but between the lines it is radical and controversial report. To encapsulate all the submissions by the various bodies that reported to that group, the report itself is not sufficient.  I would like to see Mr. Cullition come before us.  After all, the report was commissioned by the Government and it is mapping the change industrially, educationally through tourism, transport and so on.  Chapter after chapter, it maps out where we should be going.</P>
    <P>In relation to the structure of the Seanad, I join with many Senators in expressing the need for debating two matters on the Adjournment: I am not sure whether we need the full 20 minutes. The issues are very important to the Senators who raise them.  Sometimes the issues may be regional, provincial or even local but it is the only opportunity Senators have of responding to people who see them as real politicians.  There is always this feeling that the real politicians are in the other House.  Local councillors are politicians, we are politicans, and we get the same representation as Dáil representatives. We do not have the opportunity to go back to the electorate and inform them on issues that need immediate action.  That request does not appear to be too radical and I think all Senators are happy that we should have two matters on the Adjournment each day to accommodate four Senators.  That would be most welcome.</P>
    <P>I was a teacher in the post-primary sector and I feel when I go through the Tá and Níl lobbies when voting that I am back in the classroom.  I find the system extremely cumbersome and outdated.  At this stage with modern technology, computers, electronic devices and so on, there should be an easier way to record our assent or dissent.  Surely, we could have a device that would record automatically or perhaps we could have an electronic device in our offices with an override facility to ensure it could not be tampered with where we could record <Col N="441" /> our assent or dissent.  There were some days here when we had to rush across Kildare Street to vote on important amendments.  We are in the last decade of the 20th century and that is not too extraordinary a request and it would allow us to spend more time on the debates.  Let us get rid of the antiquated Tá agus Níl voting system and use the modern systems of voting used in other Parliaments where they can do their business very rapidly.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question and answer session, the Cathaoirleach mentioned in his presentation that it would be very similar to the system which operates in the Dáil.  In fairness to the Cathaoirleach, he has tightened considerably the Order of Business and I say this as somebody who may not always use it in the proper way.  It is frustrating that we cannot raise something that is urgent and important to us.  I see no reason we cannot congratulate Ministers from the other House on their appointments.  It is extraordinary that that is ruled out of order on the Order of Business particularly when Senators from the opposite side wish to extend congratulations to new Ministers, or to the Taoiseach.  Indeed we have had many changes recently and I think it is common civility and courtesy to congratulate the people involved.</P>
    <P>The position of Leader of the House is a very important and prestigious one.  It is time to give the Leader of the House financial recognition now that county council chairpersons throughout the country receive a token recognition. They are happy with that and realise it lends status to the position.</P>
    <P>As we move towards European integration I join with other Senators who would welcome MEPs to this House. They will not be a threat to us as some people think because they are so busy with their business in Europe they will not be here every second week dominating the proceedings in this House.  I hope we will have an opportunity in the House to hear our Members of the European Parliament explain, analyse, discuss and debate with us the importance of the forthcoming referendum which will be <Col N="442" /> held in early summer and that will have an opportunity to respond to that debate so that the people can understand the complex issue.</P>
    <P>When Europe appears on the agenda sometimes people yawn and do not appreciate the importance and influence it will have on our lives.  Europe is important not just for Structural Funds but for the whole concept of unification.  It would be a welcome move if the MEPs would come before the House and give us the benefit of their knowledge in preparation for what I consider to be an extremely important referendum.</P>
    <P>I am glad I have had the opportunity of contributing to the statements on the role of the Seanad which began last November. An indication of the importance of reform can be seen from the list of Senators who have contributed, and the many others who are still waiting to contribute. It shows we respect this House, that we wish it to continue but that we would like it to operate more speedily.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to begin by echoing the sentiments expressed in Senator Jackman's closing remarks.  We would all like to see this House improve, change its image and deal more positively with legislation and with various reports. Contributing at the end of a debate has its disadvantages because all the good points have been made.  I have listened to the debate and read some of the reports and some very positive suggestions have been made over the past few weeks, and I agree with many of them. We can all play a part in trying to change this House, to make it more amenable and to make it fulfil its role as the Upper House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that this House is not a carbon copy of the other House and this has been stated by you, a Chathaoirleach, and others.  As one who has served in both Houses I agree with that statement.  This House has its own job to do.  It is doing a good job and Members should strive to make it better.  Very often people outside the House get a wrong impression.  We are seen as not doing as effective a job as we might.  That is wrong because <Col N="443" /> during the past few years in particular, we have been sitting longer hours, we have paid more attention to legislation, to reports, etc. than had been the case heretofore.  I can remember a time when the Seanad sat only occasionally, but those days are gone and we now sit two days a week and sometimes more.  I would like to see this trend continue.  By making a few changes we should be able to improve the working of this Seanad.</P>
    <P>The Order of Business has been mentioned by many speakers.  Time and again it has dragged on for an hour to an hour and a half.  With the agreement of all the parties in the House, we should be able to improve this procedure because many of the items raised are not relevant.  It is a pity that so much time is wasted when we could be debating legislation and other matters of importance.</P>
    <P>The Acting Leader was asked today if there was any possibility of the Taoiseach addressing the House to give us some idea of how his Government intend to face up to the problems affecting the nation.  I am glad he responded favourably and that there is a great possibility the Taoiseach will address the House next week to outline his views and indicate what he proposes to do during the next couple of years &mdash; during the lifetime of this Government &mdash; to tackle the serious social and economic problems facing the Government.  It is great that the Taoiseach has recognised this House. I would like to see this trend continue with the Taoiseach coming into the House occasionally to give us the benefit of his experience and to outline what he proposes to do to tackle various problems. I can see no reason this should not happen from time to time.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned time and again that our MEPs seem to be cut off from this Parliament.  Apart from those who have a dual mandate &mdash; there are only one or two &mdash; there is no forum to help them keep in contact with our Parliament and legislation.  That is a pity.  They should be invited to address this House occasionally to give us the benefit of their knowledge of the European scene, to inform us of <Col N="444" /> what legislation is before the European Parliament and how it might affect us. The only forum available to them is the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities to which they are invited occasionally.  I think they should be allowed to address the Seanad.  I am not sure, however, if they would be allowed to do so under the Constitution but I am sure changes could be made to allow them to do so.</P>
    <P>I would like to see Question Time, introduced in the Seanad.  Many Senators are actively involved in politics in their own constituencies and from time to time there will be a number of issues of great importance to them that they would like to raise in the Seanad.  I would like to see them being given the opportunity to do so.  An hour could be set aside, perhaps once a week, for Question Time when a Minister would be questioned on matters affecting his Department.  That would be good for all of us and allow those Senators who are active in their own areas to raise issues of great importance to them.</P>
    <P>The system of election has also been mentioned.  Those of us who have taken part in Seanad elections know how difficult and cumbersome the system is. Despite what Senator Norris and others may have to say, I still believe it is very democratic.  Indeed there could be no more democratic system because those Senators who have to travel around the country to seek the votes of county councillors and Deputies are seeking the votes of those who have been elected by the grassroots and who are actively involved in politics.  I think it is a very democratic system and cannot see any changes being made.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has the right to appoint 11 Senators; I think this is a very good idea because it gives the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;an overall majority in the Seanad and the opportunity to <Col N="445" /> appoint those who have made a contribution at local or national level.  People who are very prominent in the arts and other areas have been appointed to the House and we have benefited from their presence.  A number of very important people from Northern Ireland have also been Members of this House and it was a pleasure to serve with them.  They include John Robb, Séamus Mallon and Bríd Rogers.  It is very important that the northern part of our country should be represented here.  I hope some day we will again have representatives from Northern Ireland in the Seanad because the three people I have mentioned made a terrific contribution to this House.  As I said, it was a pleasure to serve with them and they were always constructive. They came from different sides of the political divide but this did not stop them from expressing a view here.  We all benefited from their presence.</P>
      <P>There are six University Senators.  Like many other speakers, I would like to see the graduates of other universities being given a vote.  This will probably happen in the very near future.</P>
      <P>There are many issues we could debate here from time to time.  Indeed, some excellent reports have been prepared but they are gathering dust in the corridors of power.  It is a pity we cannot spend more time debating them.  Given that some major reports have been prepared I hope more time of the Seanad will be used to debate them.  We could all benefit because a lot of hard work was put into the preparation of those reports and it is a pity they are gathering dust on the shelves in Leinster House and not being debated.</P>
      <P>It has been mentioned that we should allow two items to be raised on the Adjournment.  Again, I agree with that suggestion, and perhaps when changes are being made agreement could be reached on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Seanad will be used far more and that more legislation will be initiated here.  That is what we should be looking for.  As we are aware, there is a backlog of legislation waiting to be introduced in the other House.  I see no reason some <Col N="446" /> of that legislation could not be sent to the Seanad because in my experience legislation has been debated far more effectively in this House than in the other House and that we have spent far more time on it.  We have the necessary expertise and Senators are knowledgeable about various matters.  Any legislation initiated in this House was debated very well and our amendments were accepted by the Dáil.  I would like to see a greater flow of legislation initiatied in this House under the present Government and we will be pressing for this at every available opportunity.  All that I can say is I hope the House will be busy this term and that we will all have to work harder to earn our money.</P>

      <P>I find myself in the very difficult position of agreeing with a great deal of what Senator Hussey said.  Why are we debating this subject today?  Why are we once again indulging in this extraordinary piece of navel gazing and this self-indulgent self examination as politicians? This is the third debate of this sort which I remember in recent times in Seanad Éireann.  Although it has been debated three times there has been very little action as a result.  The reason we are debating this is that the Seanad, as it has been run in the past few years, is in danger of becoming redundant.  We are debating this subject not because we are particularly interested in it but because we do not have legislation to discuss.  The Seanad, since 1989, has been a toothless body and has given rise to a great deal of dissatisfaction among the public and the parties in it.  This debate today is symbolic of that because it is a filler, it is on the Order Paper because we do not have anything else to talk about.  Let us be honest about it; that is why we are discussing it today, that is why it has been retained on the Order Paper for so long.</P>

      <P>We were waiting for Senator Ross's majestic contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>We always had this motion to fall back on and the reason is that the Seanad is now completely dependent on <Col N="447" /> the other House for its workings, procedures and debates.  We are in danger of becoming redundant if we accept that dependence.  Certainly, for the past two and a half years, the Government have not only accepted that dependence but, under the former Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, they encouraged it.  We were taking our orders and our agenda from the Dáil; we took our legislation when it suited the Dáil and debated it when it suited the Dáil.  As a result we have achieved virtually nothing in the past two and a half years; in fact I put it to Members that the Seanad is fast going backwards, not only in the eyes of the public but in the eyes of the politicians.</P>
      <P>We have a chance to remedy the matter now and to do something about it if we respond to this debate and to other suggestions which have been made about the gross inadequacies in this House and the deteriorating situation.  I may be wrong &mdash; I am open to correction from the Government side &mdash; but it is my belief that between July and December this House passed only two Bills, a small Bill from the Department of Justice and the Sea Pollution Bill.  The rest of the time was taken up in debating internal Government problems, motions which meant nothing, or simply not sitting.  The House is really in danger of becoming a laughing stock which simply rubber-stamps the business of the Dáil, which does not sit for a reason of its own and which does not have a mind of its own. Now that we have, in effect, a new Government I hope that fresh life will be injected into the House because, if not, we will go downhill fast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not subscribe, and I do not think I ever would subscribe to the views of the Progressive Democrats &mdash; in so far as we know their views as they are difficult to ascertain &mdash; that this House should be abolished.  I cannot repeat often enough the total hypocrisy of that party in sending three very able and surprisingly committed Members to this House who have made good, valuable contributions, when they believe the House is of no value. Despite all their purity and supposed <Col N="448" /> integrity, they have decided to play the system and to put three Members in this House who want to get into the Dáil while still believing that this House should be abolished.  It is not a principled situation, it is one which politicians can understand but they should make up their minds whether they really believe this House should be abolished or whether they are simply playing to the populist gallery. They have taken three seats because it is convenient for them to do so.  That slogan, which they adopted in Opposition, was a gimmick, a cheap shot which encouraged public ignorance of this House instead of educating them about what was going on in it.  Indeed, when they took up that position the Seanad was working far better than it is working now.  It was doing valuable work in all sorts of areas on which I will elaborate in a few minutes.</P>
    <P>This House produced magnificent legislators and parliamentarians such as Alexis FitzGerald, Yeats, Noel Browne, Skeffington, Gemma Hussey and Jim Dooge who all achieved a great deal in this House.  To say the Seanad should be abolished is short-sighted and cheap and shows no knowledge of the great work which has been done in this House in the past and the way it has led public opinion on issues where politicians in the other House feared to tread.  That has been one of the great roles of this House in the past but it is a role which is in danger of being stifled by the Government because their attitude is that this House should shut up and pass legislation as quickly as possible on the instructions of the Leader of the other House.  This is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey's comments are sensible considering the way he was elected. However, the concept of the Seanad as a democratically elected House is completely wrong.  The first thing we must accept is that the Seanad is not elected by the people and that it was never meant to be elected by the people in a popular vote in the way Members are elected to the Dáil.  There was no pretence &mdash; or indeed intention &mdash; that the Seanad should be democratically elected by the people.  It was certainly the intention that <Col N="449" /> most Members of this House should be elected but not in a popular vote because, if they were to be elected in a popular vote, it would be what it is in danger of turning into anyway, a mere mirror image of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The first principle which I understand was established about the election of Members of this House was that they were not to be elected on a constituency basis which was purely geographical because, if that was the case, they would simply reflect the numbers, views and origins of Members of the Dáil.  It was not meant to be like that.  What I think was, quite rightly, in the mind of Eamon de Valera when he set up this House was that it should have a completely different role, examine legislation from a different angle and that there should be &mdash; as there is superficially in the House &mdash; a large vocational input and that the primary loyalty of the Members concerned should be to that vocational input rather than to political parties.  Unfortunately, if that was his intention he made an enormous mess of it by then deciding that the nominating bodies could nominate people to this House and that they would then be elected by politicians.  The result is that it is virtually impossible, except for the university seats, for people who do not have political affiliations to be elected to this House.</P>
    <P>The proportions elected in this House are roughly the same as the Dáil.  As a result, the outlook, majority, workings and political divisions in this House also reflect the numbers in the Dáil.  As a result the Seanad, to a large extent, reflects opinion, numbers and procedures in the Dáil.  This is unfortunate as I believe the Seanad can play a real role in the running of the country if it approaches legislation, public opinion and many other issues from a different angle.  Obviously members of political parties could not be denied access to this House.  We could have a bicameral system without such strong party loyalties but the people who come to this House would have primary, or at least equal, loyalty to something else.  Their expertise is so evident in certain fields that they <Col N="450" /> make a contribution which is valuable in itself and is not diluted by loyalty to a political party.  This is a very important point.  Such a system would change overnight the approach and value of this House and the respect in which this House is held.  We have to get away from the idea that it should be a purely democratically elected body.</P>
    <P>Of course the Dáil must have the greater and ultimate power because it is popularly elected, but this could be the House with the moral influence, the experts, the people who offer impartial advice gained through experience of life rather than politics, for which they would be respected and listened to.  We do not have to have the power to defeat legislation, but we must have the moral power to have an input into legislation.  This is important.</P>
    <P>This House was set up in 1937 under the Constitution and has remained unchanged.  There was a constitutional amendment in 1979 but since the legislation was never followed through the composition and method of election remain the same.  The Seanad is outdated in its procedures and outlook.  It has served its purpose well but it now needs drastic reform.  The procedures, composition and structure of 1937 no longer apply in 1992.  A great deal has been said about the procedures of the House but I will come back to this point later.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a subject on which Senator Hussey touched, that is, the Taoiseach's 11 nominees.  I do not have a principled objection to people being appointed to this House, I do not see any problem with that, but I see a problem if people are appointed to this House simply and solely to give the Government a majority.  If they are nominated to this House so that they can lobby for the Government, as were the last 11 nominees appointed by the former Taoiseach, then they should not be appointed at all.  If the Taoiseach's 11 nominees are appointed because they have an important contribution to make to legislation then, of course, they should be appointed.</P>
    <P>It was unfortunate that the former <Col N="451" /> Taoiseach's 11 nominees, all good people who have a lot to contribute to Ireland &mdash; it is symbolic that this happened in the case of the former Taoiseach &mdash; had exclusive loyalty to one political party and that is why they were here.  The 11 nominees appointed by the Taoiseach in 1989 were very unfortunate because they exclusively belonged to a political party, were here to give a majority to that political party and were appointed because the Taoiseach of the day was vulnerable and could not afford to appoint non-party people in political terms.  This is not a party political point and it should not be taken as such because the same would happen if Fine Gael were in a similar position.  Leaving it in the hands of the Taoiseach of the day to nominate 11 appointees means that in certain, if not all, political circumstances political pressure will be on him to appoint political people whose loyalty is to a party and who will gain seats in the other House. These people were appointed to the exclusion of those who could play a strong important role in this House.</P>
    <P>In 1987 the Taoiseach of the day, Deputy Haughey, made some very enlightened appointments to this House. I am referring in particular to the appointment of the former Senator de Buitléar who was a Member of this House from 1987 to 1989; unfortunately, he had to be sacrificed by Deputy Haughey for political reasons in 1989.  Mr. de Buitléar was an ideal example of the type of Senator about whom I am speaking.  He was appointed by Deputy Haughey because he was an expert on Irish wildlife, nature, etc.  He was non-partisan, he played a vital role on legislation in this area and had a moral and actual authority in that area which none of us had.  At a time when the environment was, and remains, such an important all-consuming public issue, it was wonderful that the primary commitment of a Member of this House was not to the Taoiseach of the day but to the environment.  That is the type of Senator we should be looking for who should be appointed by the Taoiseach. Unfortunately this is not the case <Col N="452" /> at present due to political pressures and this will remain the case as long as the structure of the House remains unchanged and as long as this House is dependent on the Dáil and the Taoiseach of the day.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Hussey &mdash; he did not regret the lack of them this time round &mdash; the greatest, most constructive, interesting and innovative contributions I have heard during my ten years as a Member of this House were made by the people from Northern Ireland who were appointed by the Taoiseach.  They were not, as Senator Hussey said, from both sides of the political divide.  He got that wrong; they were from one side of the political divide.  However, that does not really matter.  I am talking about Séamus Mallon, Bríd Rogers and John Robb. Their contributions to this House were unique and vitally important.</P>
    <P>Although we were on different sides, I can remember Séamus Mallon's emotional and deeply felt speech on extradition when he conveyed in almost unprecedented terms the real deep feelings of the Nationalist people of Northern Ireland about extradition and matters of that kind.  He conveyed their feelings in a way which could not have been done by anybody in this House, regardless of their political hue.  He told us from the heart what the Nationalist people of Northern Ireland felt about extradition and matters of that sort.  I have to say quite honestly that this contribution was an eye opener for me.  As I said, I was on the other side &mdash; it will not surprise Members of the House to hear that I was not convinced by his argument &mdash; but I understood the depth of his emotion and realised the value of such a contribution. We should remember that the former Senator Mallon was a democratically elected Member of the House of Commons and a very significant political figure in Northern Ireland before and after that time.  We were very privileged to avail of his contribution in this House.</P>
    <P>Similarly, for a short time Bríd Rogers from Northern Ireland was a Member of this House, as was John Robb whose departure from the House we all <Col N="453" /> mourn.  Mr. Robb contributed not only on Northern Ireland but also on other matters and his points of view were refreshing and authoritative.  Maybe they did not carry quite the same authority as did those of Senator Mallon because John Robb was not an elected representative in Northern Ireland, and I think he never has been so.  These people had authority, provided information and brought a message from Northern Ireland to the Republic and from here to Northern Ireland.  Their contributions were invaluable. Those three figures, the former Senators Robb, Mallon and Eamon de Buitléir, were indicative of the role which Seanad Éireann could play in this State, a role which is not played at present.</P>
    <P>The absence of these people makes this House a poorer place.  I do not wish to make that statement as a party political point.  I am sure a similar situation could easily arise if a Taoiseach was elected from Fine Gael and a coalition was formed in circumstances similar to those at present.  In that case a Fine Gael Taoiseach might be forced to make appointments for political reasons, and that would be understandable.  When considering reform of this House we should take the prerogative to make such opportunities out of the hands of the Taoiseach of the day so that he would not yield to such temptation.  This House is worse off as a result of the absence of the individuals I mentioned and as a result of the fact that no Taoiseach has been capable or reappointing people in that way.</P>
    <P>We can go even further back and mention former Senators such as Ken Whitaker who was reappointed by Jack Lynch and by Deputy Garret FitzGerlad. Dr. Whitaker made expert contributions to this House which were respected on all sides of the political divide and which carried moral weight similar to that carried by the other people to whom I have referred.  There is a role for people such as Dr. Whitaker, Eamon de Buitléar, Mr. Mallon and Mr. Robb, and that is a matter we must seriously consider in reforming this House.  Those people brought credit to the House in a non-partisan and moral way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="454" /> I would now like to refer to the procedures in this House.  I hope this debate will not result in a report from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges which suggests tinkering with the system as it works in the Seanad.  That would not be enough.  It would be much too cosy and would improve only in a peripheral way the workings of a House which needs radical surgery.  There is something fundamentally wrong with the workings of this House and that has been most apparent in the past two and a half years.</P>
    <P>Several suggestions have been put forward as to the improvements that could be made to the House, but they are inadequate, ill thought out, short term and basically a little silly.  The suggestion is constantly put forward in this House that Members of the European Parliament should address the House on matters of interest.  I do not think I have ever heard anything less radical or less interesting. If I want to know the views of Members of the European Parliament I can read about them or I can hear them in many forums, but I do not have to listen to them here.  To suggest that by inviting Members of the European Parliament to address this House would make a radical change in the workings of the House is absurd.  These people would come in, make a speech and go away again, and we would congratulate ourselves on reforming the Seanad.  Interesting as it might be to hear them, such a suggestion is ill thought out and would do nothing to improve the workings of the House.</P>
    <P>There is a tremendously good case for initiating a great deal of legislation in this House.  It does not matter what the powers of the House are once legislation is initiated here, as was done so successfully between 1983 and 1987 and to a lesser extent between 1987 and 1989. Ministers should take on board amendments from all sides of this House before bringing the Bill to the Dáil.  In that way we would not have to go through the absurd nonsense that we go through week after week whereby Ministers who bring legislation from the Dáil refuse to accept amendments in this House, whatever their merit, because they do not want <Col N="455" /> to take the Bill back to the Dáil.  That practice is unacceptable.  If Bills were initiated in this House, non-contentious Bills in party political terms, and amendments put forward for consideration by objective Ministers, the Bills would not have to come back to the House again. The improved Bills would go to the Dáil and there would be no delay in legislation. In practical terms that is by far the most sensible way to proceed.</P>
    <P>The Companies Bill, the Clinical Trials Bill and other such Bills were initiated in this House.  The Companies Bill was published by a Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government in 1987 and was introduced by a Fianna Fáil Government.  It was initiated in this House by the present Taoiseach and his Minister of State at the time, Deputy Seamus Brennan who is now in the Cabinet.  That legislation was a role model for procedure in this House. With over 150 sections, it was very long and very difficult but very good legislation. That Bill went through a careful, well-examined analytical Second Stage debate by many Members on all sides of this House.  It then went through Committee Stage where the Minister, to his great credit &mdash; I think it was Deputy Brennan who dealt with it on most occasions here &mdash; considered the amendments put down and accepted many of them.  The legislation was changed quite dramatically as a result of amendments put down in this House.  The Minister listened to the debate on the amendments, assured the House he would consider them and came back on Report Stage with fundamental changes on insider dealing and other matters.</P>
    <P>The debate in this House on the Companies Bill was one of the finest we have had.  It was conducted in a civilised, non-adversarial way, with everybody intent on improving it before it left this House. It is legislation of which this House can be proud.  Had it been introduced in the Dáil, it would have been the old story; having taken so long to get through the Dáil the Minister's riding instructions quite simply would be to get it through <Col N="456" /> the Seanad as quickly as possible and on to the Statute Book.  That is what happens so often to legislation in this House.  It is regrettable but that is the system and that is why fundamental surgery is necessary in order that this House can do justice to the legislation.</P>
    <P>The problems of this House are apparent to the public and certainly much more so to those who are here.  I have no solution to this.  I regret that this House appears continuously to be getting its marching orders from the Taoiseach of the day; the legislation we consider, the business we order, and the controversial matters that are taken come not from ourselves but from the Government, the Cabinet, the Taoiseach.  As a result it appears that the Seanad does not organise its own affairs.  There is a sort of facade that we are an independent House.  I was told, as everybody else is told when he or she comes in here first, that the Seanad and only the Seanad makes its own rules.  That is true in theory but it makes its own rules, unfortunately, on the instructions of the Government and the Taoiseach of the day.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely essential that a way of separating the Leader of this House from the Government Chief Whip is found if this House is to have some sort of life of its own because there appears to have been, and Members on all sides of this House have been aware of it, a wish on the part of the previous Government that this House would keep its head down and not be noticed, that it was there to a large extent to rubber stamp what was happening in the Dáil and that anything original or different was an obstruction to Government business and was a nuisance.</P>
    <P>That was noticeable in the way the House was continuously treated with contempt by the Government in the last session.  I am sick and tired of hearing and seeing the wrong Minister come into this House.  I welcome the fact that Ministers come into this House; some take it seriously, some take Committee Stage seriously, but time and again during the past four years we have seen junior Ministers from the wrong Department come <Col N="457" /> in to talk on legislation about which they know absolutely nothing.  That is not acceptable.  It simply shows the Government cannot be bothered or that the appropriate Government Ministers are too busy to deal with legislation in the Seanad.  I do not believe it would be tolerated in the other House.  Any old Minister will do in the Seanad &mdash; you can rent a Minister, send him in, especially on Second Stage debates.  If he is able, he will be able to bluff his way through Committee Stage no matter what legislation we are debating.  That is not good enough.  It makes for bad legislation and it shows contempt for the Seanad.</P>
    <P>We will have to order our business better so that we do not have these absurd guillotine motions at the end of every session.  We had a farcical situation coming up to Christmas &mdash; we always have a farcical situation coming up to Christmas &mdash; where two Bills were discussed between July and December 1991 and God knows how many were rushed through between the beginning of December and the Christmas recess.  The same happens in the summer.  We are so dependent on the business coming from the Dáil that when it has finished with it, we then take it on board and finish it as quickly as possible without proper examination because we will not be allowed to amend it anyway.</P>
    <P>That system has to be changed.  If it means that all legislation should be initiated here, so be it.  I believe there is a very good case, if we are to have a Seanad at all, that every piece of legislation should come first before this House if we are to keep the same laws and constitutional arrangements.  We could amend it in this House before it is sent to the Dáil and it would not have to come back here.  At present if it is amended in this House it goes back to the Dáil as it rightly should do.  We should be able to improve the Bill in a non-contentious political manner.  I would like to see less Government contempt for the operation of this House.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested many many times by Members of both Houses that we should introduce Question Time.  I am <Col N="458" /> not sure that the Adjournment matter procedure does not work rather better and it could certainly be improved.  Normally five or six specific matters are tabled for the Adjournment and we have a very comprehensive discussion on the subject chosen.  I must say that I have been treated very fairly on the Adjournment recently and there is no undue delay in raising a matter.  The Member is able to state a position on a particular issue and the Minister replies in detail on the Government's position.  This is possibly more informative and better than a question and answer session in very limited time where one basically does not get satisfactory answers at all.  One will not get a satisfactory answer if the Minister does not want to give it.  There probably is a case for the suggestion already before us that we have the opportunity to raise more matters on the Adjournment.  The House would seem more relevant if we could raise matters of immediate public interest.  Whether that is done by way of the Adjournment, under Standing Order 29, or on the Order of Business does not matter very much but it is a procedural improvement which is important and which should be initiated.</P>
    <P>I would like to address briefly a few remarks to the Progressive Democrats who have been so loud in their criticisms of the activities of this House.  The role this House has played in the past ten to 12 years has not been redundant or useless, although I think it is deteriorating now.  The Seanad has played a very proud role in these ten or 12 years in influencing matters which are significant in Irish life.  On the whole it has been a progressive body and a focus for change.  With the exception of the past two years the democratic element of the House has influenced Irish life disproportionately. It should be said that certain subjects which were taboo were initiated in this House and started the public debate and, as a result, legislation was introduced and changes in the law were made.  I want to state quite categorically the particular issues involved. They remain controversial but they were brought on to the agenda by Members of <Col N="459" /> this House.  I shall first take the issue of Northern Ireland and then the question of extradition in particular.  All of the major legislative initiatives on Northern Ireland that I can remember were first taken in this House.  For example, in 1982 I proposed a motion in the House, which was seconded by Professor Murphy and signed, to his great credit and on his first day in the House, by former Senator John Robb, calling for the extradition of so-called political offenders &mdash; terrorists &mdash; to Northern Ireland.  That motion provided the first opportunity for Members of either House to debate that issue.  The debate attracted a great deal of coverage and interest because at the time the subject was thought to be taboo, which it was.  The motion calling for extradition was defeated by 48 votes to five, and even those five Members voted for us for technical reasons only.</P>
    <P>The debate on that motion prompted a national debate on extradition.  It provoked a great deal of thought on the issue because at the time members of the IRA and the UVF were able to plead in Irish courts that terrorist offences were political offences and as a result judges allowed them walk free.  At that time there was no extradition for such offences.  Although there would have been an extradition warrant issued for those offenders.</P>
    <P>Despite there being a very hostile reception to that debate, the Supreme Court changed its mind on the issue two years later and started the extradition process after the Dominic McGlinchey case.  Three years after that public opinion had moved so far that at last Ireland ratified the European Convention on Terrorism and legislation on extradition was passed through the Dáil and the Seanad.  Such a move would have been unthinkable five years previously. The Bill on extradition was opposed by the Fianna Fáil Opposition of the time for reasons that were historic and understandable but, I think, wrong.  Fianna Fáil later, with mixed feelings but with a certain amount of determination, <Col N="460" /> implemented extradition out of this part of Ireland to the other part of Ireland.</P>
    <P>That process started in this House, when the Dáil would not touch the issue. It does not really matter about the merits of the case, what matters is that a subject of that kind was first raised in this House, it was brought into the public arena here and it then was put on the Statute Book; it was accepted.  That process is valuable in itself.</P>
    <P>The question of family planning is also relevant.  It was former Senator Mary Robinson who in 1973 or 1974, as an Independent Senator then and a Labour Party Senator later, introduced the first family plannning Bill in the Seanad, thus starting a controversy which is still bubbling in the public arena and for which we are now looking for a solution.  That subject, for which Mrs. Robinson clearly got the cold shoulder treatment, was not raised in the Dáil but in this House.  There is a great tradition that the pluralist issues are raised and have been raised in the Seanad rather than in the Dáil.  Again, the merits of the case are not so important as the fact that those issues have been raised and debated in this House. Members of this House have forced Members of the Dáil and the public to take positions on those issues.  The great merit of being able to produce a motion on pluralist issues is that it forces political parties to take a stand on such issues when they are not willing to do so in other forums.  That is the merit of this House and that sphere should be extended.  Rather than being allowed to recede, it should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>I also think of the debates on Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  There is now consensus amongst at least four of the five major political parties in the Dáil that Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution should be at least amended and taken out of their present form.  There is now consensus that those Articles are outdated, that they reflect the attitudes of 1937 but not the attitudes of 1992.  The Fianna Fáil Party dissent from that view. The debates on Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution were initiated here, not in the Dáil.  Many people will not thank <Col N="461" /> Senators for starting that debate because it attacks what many regard as Irish traditional core values, but if we are anything we must be a questioning House; we must be a House that questions traditional values again and again.  That is a role that this House has played in the past and one that we will continue to play if we are allowed to do so.</P>
    <P>We are lucky that the issue of homosexual law reform has come before this House as a major issue; that a thorny, taboo issue of that kind has been championed in this House and that it was in this House that the Minister chose to announce that he would respond to the European Court of Human Rights.  In a tacit way, that is acknowledging that we are the House that has played a most prominent role in pluralistic, liberal issues.</P>
    <P>I should like to make one or two points about the University seats, a subject that has been debated for a long time.  I was elected by university graduates &mdash; I do not know if I shall ever again be so elected &mdash; and I have experience of the University seats system that may be of some value to the House.  The accusation that they are in some way rotten boroughs or not representative of the people is unfair, principally because the Seanad is not meant to be a purely democratically elected body, an area on which the debate has already touched.  However, the House is meant, in its concept at least, to produce people from all kinds of diverse angles who will approach legislation, motions and issues from different directions than would those who are purely directly elected.</P>
    <P>There is perhaps one compelling reason for the retention of the University seats.  They number a small but significant number of people who live in Northern Ireland.  I was conscious, as were my colleagues and as are my colleagues from the National University of Ireland, of that section of the electorate, whether they be Nationalist or Unionist, it does not matter.  We have to be conscious of that sector of the electorate not because they have votes but because, like every other constituent, they write to us and <Col N="462" /> invite us to speak at meetings and, I suggest, we go to Northern Ireland many more times than other Members of this House.</P>
    <P>For that reason among others, the University Senators are sensitive to the realities in Northern Ireland as they change from day to day.  They cannot afford to adopt the traditional Irish Nationalist position from the safety of the Republic of Ireland, because they have constituents in Northern Ireland who are moving all the time, and who do not take that traditional Nationalist position.  For that reason the University Senators have to listen to the opinions of those who live in Northern Ireland and they probably articulate those opinions.  Other Senators are not subject to that sort of pressure and are not in touch on such a day-to-day basis with so many people.  For that reason, if only for that reason, it is valuable to have University Senators.</P>
    <P>It is vital that this House continue to have a significant number of Independents because the opinions of Independents contain a different value from those of Members of political parties.  We must encourage Independents, even if on some occasions we are a little irritated by what they have to say, by their opinions and by the mileage they get from them.</P>
    <P>There are some serious gaps in the composition of this House.  If we are to look at a true vocational role for this House and not just a party political role, we should widen the franchise.  I am thinking particularly of the unemployed. It is anomalous that in this House we have panels named after various vocational interests which do not include, possibly the greatest vested interest in this country, the unemployed.  As we head for a 300,000 unemployment figure, this House has representatives of teachers, farmers, trade unionists, the CII and many other bodies and yet the great mass of unemployed people have no representation in this House.  This would be worth considering because the unemployment problem, despite what many politicians say, will not go away in the foreseeable future.  It is imperative, if we are to be representative of groups, <Col N="463" /> that we hear the voice of the unemployed, their suggestions and their complaints. They do not have a realistic voice anywhere else.  It would be absurd to suggest that representatives of trades unions in this House represent the unemployed. They represent the employed, those who have vested interests in staying employed.  There are many other areas of vocational interest which are left out but if we are going to insist on radical reform of this House we must look for those vocational interests to be included in this House.</P>
    <P>At the moment we are in danger of becoming irrelevant.  We are in danger of reflecting merely the numbers and the points of view in the other House.  We are in danger of simply accepting legislation which is handed down to us and not being allowed to find a life of our own.  That scenario is reasonably simple to amend. We need constitutional changes, but there is to be a constitutional referendum shortly.  I hope this debate will not just be the filler it is.  It is filling gaps because we do not have enough legislation.  I hope this debate will be the forerunner of constitutional changes this summer which will see this House being reformed and made more relevant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>Is deacair teacht i ndiaidh cainteoir chomh breá leis an Seanadóir Ross ach tá roinnt pointe ba mhaith liom a dhéanamh agus tá cuid acu ag teacht leis na pointi atá déanta ag an Seanadóir a chuaigh romham.</P>
      <P>As far as I am concerned the primary role of any House of Parliament is its legislative role and I will address my attention to that role of the Seanad. When we talk about legislation coming to this House we have to first decide which type should be initiated here and which type should come here through the Dáil.  I support what Senator Ross and many others said, that a large part of our problems with regard to legislation derives from the fact that it all seems to come in a rush at the end of term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea of a second House is to ensure that there is a time for reflection, for <Col N="464" /> amending, for second thoughts.  We have seen time and again the problems that arise from rushed legislation, from legislation which is put through because it is expedient to do so.  The danger of rushing legislation through in the last two or three days before Christmas, for instance, was brought home to us in the famous rod licence legislation.  A lot of disharmony, disunity and argument arose over a matter of minor importance.  If that legislation had come to the Seanad in good time and it had been debated more thoroughly, the massive opposition that was subsequently shown would have manifested itself at that time and we would not have had the rod licence dispute nor would we have had to introduce amending legislation subsequently.  That is not to indict one Government, that is something which has been happening under numerous Governments and is something which Senators on all sides should resist.</P>
    <P>It is important that this House should be a House of review.  There are people who are always calling for the speeding up of the passage of legislation.  There is an old saying &mdash; marry in haste and repent at leisure.  We could amend it as follows &mdash; pass legislation in haste and regret it at leisure.  The Seanad is a very fitting place for the initiation of Bills which, by common consent, are needed but which require a large amount of detailed work. I refer to Bills such as the Companies Bill and the Bill setting up the Environmental Protection Agency, which is now going through the other House.</P>
    <P>There are two other major roles for the Seanad.  Thagair an Seanadóir Ross do thábhacht an tSeanaid maidir le díospóireacht a thosnú faoi ghnóthaí a bhaineann le maitheas an phobail i gcoitinne. Luaigh sé cuid de na díospóireachtaí a bhí ar bun sa Teach seo, ábhair a tháinig faoi bhráid an phobail agus ar tháinig athrú mór ar intinn an phobail fúthu thar tréimhse ama.</P>
    <P>Ba cheart dúinn tuilleadh díospóireachtaí mar sin a chur ar bun.  Tá gá, mar shampla, go mbeadh díospóireacht phoiblí ar chúrsaí tionsclaíochta, ar fhadhbanna an iarthair agus, ar ndóigh, <Col N="465" /> bhí díospóireacht an-tábhachtach againn ar chúrsaí árachais.  Bíonn díospóireacht againn ó am go chéile faoi ghnóthaí na hEorpa.  Is maith an scéal é sin ach creidim go minic go mbíonn na díospóireachtaí sin ró-theoranta agus ró-ghinearálta. Is ainneoin go bhfuil comhchoiste sa Teach seo a bhíonn ag plé le gnóthaí na hEorpa nach bhfeictear ó thaobh an phobail de go ndéanann Tithe an Oireachtais trí chéile dóthain plé faoi na ngnóthaí sin agus go mór mhór faoin i liomad rialacha atá ag teacht chugainn ón Eoraip an t-am ar fad.</P>
    <P>We must accept, some of us more reluctantly than others, that day by day regulations are being passed in Europe, drawn up by people who have no experience of our lifestyle or of our country. These are having a profound effect.  No longer is this Parliament sovereign in the sense of being the only law-making authority of this country.  I am concerned that a vast volume of legislation and regulation is being passed which, under constitutional amendments, is becoming part of our law and there is very little public debate about it.  At times it strikes me as odd that this legislation is taken so calmly.  If similar legislation were to be introduced in either of the Houses of the Oireachtas it would be subject to major national debate.  I accept that there is a committee within these Houses dealing with secondary legislation, but that committee has not the same impact that debate on such legislation would have in a House of the Oireachtas.  Perhaps we should consider setting aside a certain amount of time to debate EC legislation or regulation.  We could heighten the awareness of people about how this legislation is affecting the lives of ordinary people.  A valid point was made lately that it is very easy for Europe to introduce legislation which has cost implications in our public service and that there is no debate about it.  It just slips in, the cost is borne and no more is said about it.</P>
    <P>This leads me to the whole role of a Senator.  Senators have traditionally been considered as part-time legislators.  I have <Col N="466" /> no doubt that in the simpler administrative world of the thirties that was a valid opinion, but we must recognise the reality of the very complex world in which we live.  It is not a question of the Seanad being a luxury.  If public representatives are to fulfil their role thoroughly and properly, it is a full-time job.  Although I am a full-time Senator and work very long hours, I cannot give the time and the detailed effort I should like to my senatorial role.  The remuneration of Senators is such that very few would or could be happy without some other form of employment.  This is a pity.  We must stop accepting the Seanad and seanatorship as some second class citizenship within the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We must define a clearly separate role for Senators as distinct from that of Dáil Deputies.  It should be no less a role because it is different.</P>
    <P>I was appalled on my election to this House to find that the conditions under which legislators in the national parliament operated were so antediluvian and so inferior to those which I had been used to as manager of a small co-operative in a very small rural community in the west.  There is a total waste of time due to the fact that even the most mundane tasks have to be performed by myself, due to lack of secretarial assistance. There is a total lack of any research assistance.  I could not even be provided with a secretary who could do my work in the first official language, which is the common spoken language of a large part of the area in which I live.  These things appal me as a Senator.  It shows either that we are too shy to state our requirements or that we do not have due respect for this House.  A junior executive in any of the State services, public bodies, semi-State companies or county councils would be provided with better facilities in terms of equipment and staff than we who believe we are legislators.</P>
    <P>People say that the public would not countenance better facilities for us and greater expenditure on equipment.  I do not believe this.  If it is true it is because we have not explained to the public what our role is and what we are doing.  As <Col N="467" /> legislators we are probably too apologetic about our role.  If we take the full gamut of activities in which any public representative has to be involved, it is quite obvious that we would need top class facilities to perform our role properly. To legislate one has to be informed.  This means that, in addition to time spent in this Chamber or around this House, one needs to move throughout the country, reading reports and reviews, meeting individuals and groups, while carrying out the normal duties of any public representative wishing to fulfil his or her role properly.  However there is no recognition of Members time, effort or facilities needed to properly undertake their task. If nothing else emerged from this debate than an analysis of what we should be doing, or how we can do it most effectively, then it will have been worth while.</P>
    <P>There were references in the course of this debate to different Senators, some who had come from the Lower Chamber to the Upper Chamber, reference even to those in his Chamber who might well have aspirations to become Members of the other House.  Such debate is totally sterile, without meaning, and I hope will not be repeated.</P>
    <P>I would say to those Senators who tend to criticise Deputies who lose their seats and become Senators, or Senators with aspirations to become Dáil Deputies, it would seem totally illogical to advance such criticisms on the basis that, if one held a job outside this Chamber while aspiring to become a Senator, that would not mean that, for as long as one remained in that outside employment, one did not fulfil one's functions properly. Similarly, as long as Senators perform effectively while Members of this House, I cannot see what relevance any ambitions they may hold for their future careers have to their present membership. It must be remembered that many people in various employments or professions change their type of employment or career at various times throughout their lives.  Yet nobody questions their right to move from one to the other <Col N="468" /> as long as they undertake their tasks effectively in whatever sphere.</P>
    <P>The whole method of election to and make-up of this House has been the subject of much debate.  As was proven in the early thirties, if this House were not to become somewhat obstructive, rendering the activities of Government and the passage of legislation virtually impossible, then it is necessary that its make-up be intrinsic so that, in the normal course of events, legislation passes smoothly through this House.  Any other aspiration might be idealistic but, in the imperfect world in which we live, would be totally impractical and, at the end of the day, lead only to the demise of this House.  Nonetheless it is important that the membership of this House be comprised of representatives of diverse backgrounds, holding many different views.  It is important that its membership be comprised also of some Members who might not necessarily have any allegiance to any political party so that, flawed and all as it might be, its structure would have merit.  It is important that the Seanad, in the main, be representative of the main political parties and have an intrinsic mechanism to ensure the smooth passage of legislation.</P>
    <P>I contend that the University seats in this House have added a certain colour and experience without which the House would be all the poorer.  After all, this House is not meant to be similar to the other House, that is a direct representation of the ordinary citizen on one to one basis.  Rather its membership is meant to be comprised of people of diverse views.  Therefore, to abolish those University seats would take from its intrinsic character.  However, it is a matter of urgency that that franchise be extended to all graduates, particularly those of the new universities that have sprung up in recent years, something I understand needs to be given legislative effect only.  It is a pity that that has not come about.  It would be my hope that such would be in place for the next Seanad elections.</P>
    <P>If we, as University Senators, are seen to represent perhaps the esoteric or finer <Col N="469" /> points of life, then it is important that the Seanad be very conscious that the concerns of the majority of our people are very much about the mundane, that the public at large would not have much time for us were we all to talk continuously and solely about abstruse points with regard to social legislation without ever coming down to earth to discuss matters affecting people on a daily basis, such as social welfare, taxes, jobs, farming and so on.  The fact that many Senators, in the main, represent that strand of politics, does not in any way detract from the real purpose of the Seanad but rather creates a much needed balance in this Chamber.</P>
    <P>Reading through much of this debate I was surprised that, in all the discussion regarding the various electoral panels and their membership, nobody alluded to the right of the various nominating bodies to nominate candidates they regard as fit to represent their interests. As Members will be aware, there are seats reserved on each electoral panel for nominees of the various nominating bodies.  Therefore, it cannot happen that candidates nominated solely by the Oireachtas become Members of Seanad Éireann.  To make this Chamber work as a vocational body a huge onus is placed on the nominating bodies to ensure the people they nominate broadly represent their interests.</P>
    <P>Bheadh súil agamsa, nuair a toghadh do Sheanad Éireann mé, agus ó shin, go bhfuil an dream a thug ainmniúchán dom don Teach seo, is é sin muintir na Gaeltachta, sásta gur sheas mise do na rudaí a sheasann siadsan dóibh, agus go gceapann siad go bhfuil mé tar éis ionadaíocht mhaith a dhéanamh ar na rudaí a bheadh gar don chroí acusan.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an Seanadóir Ross nach raibh aon ionadaíocht ag an dream dífhostaithe ar na painéil a cheapann daoine do Sheanad Éireann.  Is fíor dó, ach sílim gurb í an fhadhb atá ansin ná, go dtí le gairid, nach raibh aon eagraíocht ann féin a bhíionadaíoch do dhaoine dífhostaithe. Tá a fhios agam gur féidir nach bhfuil eolas ag an bpobal i gcoitinne go ndéantar athbhreithniú tar éis chuile thoghchán <Col N="470" /> Seanaid ar na heagraíochtaí a bhfuil cead acu daoine a ainmniú le seasamh do thoghchán an tSeanaid.  Mar shampla, de réir mar a thuigim ón toghchán deiridh don Seanad, tá ainmniúchán faighte ag Údarás na Gaeltachta le duine a ainmniú le seasamh ar an bpainéal Cultúrtha agus Oideachais.  Cheapfainn, dá mbeadh eagraíocht na ndaoine dífhostaithe le cur isteach ar ainmniúchán, mar shampla, don Phainéal Saothair, go mbreathnófaí go báúil ar sin, agus bheadh súil agam go nglacfaí leo don phaineál áirithe sin.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris in his contribution on this subject referred to the fact that we may get only 64 or 65 votes to be elected to the Seanad and that the 1,000 is added on, not to give an air or respectability, but for pure mathematical convenience. However, if one followed that through to its logical conclusion the President of the United States of America who is not elected by direct franchise but by an electoral college at the end of the day, would not represent the people of the United States and would only be elected by a few hundred people.  It is a two tier system. Technically, a President of America can be elected without a popular mandate once he secures enough votes in the electoral college.  It is akin to the way we are elected on the panel system to Seanad Éireann because the people who elect us in turn are elected by the people.  They represent a good many of the concerns of the people.  Most Members are elected on party tickets because that is the way most people here choose to elect their public representatives.  Because of the increased number of small parties and independents amongst our electorate, they will have a much greater say in Seanad elections.  They may still be party people but the determining factor between various candidates could lie with the uncommitted independent vote which we will have to deal with in the next election.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words about the Taoiseach's nominees.  It is a pity that in this Seanad, for reasons that were very good at the time due to the form of Government we have, that there were no nominees such as Éamon de Buitléar, <Col N="471" /> Séamus Mallon, John Robb and so on. Like the Independent Senators they would add colour to the Seanad. However, political exigencies determined what the position would be.  To take away the nominations of the Taoiseach would not address that.  The type of situation we had in 1989 will arise from time to time.  However, it is likely that in a future Seanad one, two or three people of that calibre will be nominated.  It would be foolish because of particular circumstances, no matter how the rules are applied, to make a fundamental change and take away those nominations. It is important, no matter what Government are in power that they have intrinsically the power to pass legislation.</P>
    <P>In relation to representation in the Seanad one matter ought to be looked at for the future: there should be some established method of ensuring representation from the North in Seanad Éireann.  Certainly it would add reality to any debates we may have on that subject. It would add a breadth to the Seanad that, unfortunately, at this time cannot be added to the Dáil.  I would like to see some method of permanent representation from the North in Seanad Éireann so that we would have a northern view of events.</P>
    <P>I see another role as fitting for the Seanad.  I have been concerned for a long time about the relationship of semi-State agencies and bodies to the Irish Parliament I remember the difficulty I had in raising the question of charging by Telecom Éireann in the Seanad.  When I tried to raise it I was told that since charging was purely a matter for Telecom Éireann I could not ask the Minister responsible a question regarding it.  I did manage to get around the problem by asking the Minister for Industry and Commerce to ask the Fair Trade Commission to investigate the matter.  I do not think I should have to twist backwards to raise questions regarding fundamental State services.  I accept we have a Committee of Public Accounts and a Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies but they address their <Col N="472" /> accounts and their spending of money rather that their role as agents of public policy.</P>
    <P>There should be a mechanism whereby we could debate the general thrust of the operation of semi-State bodies.  They play a huge and increasing role in our lives.  More and more facets of Government are delegated to Stage agencies. Once we do that and once the legislation is put in place those agencies can act without any reference to us.  I accept they are responsible to the Minister, but there is no way we can have a debate about their policy and direction.  That is a great pity.  We have seen time and again how fundamental policy changes in An Post, Telecom Éireann and Teagasc can be affected by the semi-State bodies and politicians are left carrying the can for their actions.  The public think public representatives have a say in how those bodies act.  They think we can make our views known, in an official way through the Houses of the Oireachtas, to those bodies.  In my experience that is not so. We are left to make individual representations or get on radio or television programmes and into the local papers to highlight something of major public importance.</P>
    <P>Ar deireadh ar fad, is dóigh liomsa go mba cheart dom mar Sheanadóir ar thaobh an Rialtais focal a rá maidir le ról Sheanadóirí Rialtais agus an bealach chun oibre atá acu le hais Seanadóirí atá sa Fhreasúra.  Sílim féin go bhfuil an tuairim curtha thart go mbímid i gcónaí ag aontú le gach rud atá molta dúinn ag an Rialtas, ag an Státseirbhís.  Ach ní thuigtear i gcoitinne, maidir le ceardchumainn agus dreamanna eile, go n-éiríonn linne go leor den bhrú agus den athrú a chur i gcrích taobh istigh de choistí, agus bíonn teagmháil eadrainn taobh istigh dá bpáirtithe féin.  Mar go ndéantar scaití é taobh istigh de dhoirse dúnta, ní hionann sin agus a rá nach bhfuil an díospóireacht chomh beo agus chomh bríomhar agus a bheadh sé dá mbeadh sé ar urlár an Tí.  Creidim féin chomh maith, dá léifí oráidí atá tugtha ag Seanadóirí Rialtais ar gach aon taobh don <Col N="473" /> Teach ag amanna difriúla, is é sin, nuair a bhíonn an Freasúra atá ann anois ina Rialtas agus <i>vice versa.</i>  go bhfeicfí go mbíonn deis ag Seanadóirí atá ar thaobh an Rialtais go leor tuairimí a nochtadh agus nach gcuirtear ina gcoinne ag a bpáirtithe féin.  Dáiríre, ag deireadh an lae, is é an t-aon laincis atá orainn ná go bhfuiltear ag súil, tar éis na díospóireachta ar fad, go vótálfaimid leis an Rialtas. Is rud nádúrtha agus ciallmhar é sin, mar, mar a dúirt mé, mura mbeadh sé sin ann is beag dlí a rithfí i dTithe an Oireachtais.</P>
    <P>Ní amháin sin, ach níl aon amhras orm ach go dtiocfaimid faoi bhrú dhamánta ó bhrúghrúpaí a bheadh ag iarraidh iallach aonaránach a chur orainn le seasamh áirithe a ghlacadh nó seasamh amach ar cheisteanna áirithe.  I ndeireadh báire, is é an toradh a bheadh air seo ná briseadh síos chóras na bpáirtithe agus in ionad dreama mar atá againn a thiocfadh, eatarthu féin, ar chomhthuairim faoi chúrsaí éagsúla, bheadh an tír á rialú ag brúghrúpaí a bheadh ag cur a dtuairimí pearsanta ar aghaidh agus ag iarraidh pionós a ghearradh mura n-aontófaí leo.  Ní Rialtas maith a bheadh ina leithéid de chóras.</P>
    <P>Mar sin, dhéanfainn cosaint ar an gcóras páirtithe atá againn mar chóras a dhéanfadh cinnte gurbh fhéidir linn teacht ar thuairim gan an iomarca tionchair a bheith ag brúghrúpaí beaga ar na cinnte a dhéanfaimis agus a thabharfadh cosaint dúinn on a leithéid sin de bhagairt. Tá siad ann a déarfadh go mbeidh go leor cainte déanta ar an ábhar seo ar fad faoin Seanad, agus ról an tSeanaid, agus nach dtarlóidh aon ghníomh, ach is dóigh liomsa gur éirigh leis an Seanadóir Ross a chruthú, an áit a dtosaítear díospoireacht, cuma cé chomh lag agus chomh beag a bhíonn sé, agus go gcuirtear tuairimí ar aghaidh &mdash; agus, go minic, b'fhéidir, bliain nó dhó ina dhiaidh sin &mdash; bíonn toradh ar na tuairimí sin.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam go mbeidh sé mar thoradh ar an díospóireacht áirithe seo go dtabharfar aitheantas breise do ról agus do sheasamh an tSeanadóra, agus go gcuidfear na h-aiseanna is gá chuige ar fáil dúinn chun go ndéanfaimid an jab atá <Col N="474" /> le déanamh againn níos fearr agus níos foirfe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me at the outset acknowledge the thoughtful nature of the last contribution.  I will allude to some of the suggestions made later.  In particular, we should consider taking on board the suggestion that there be a permanent input from Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The power of this House is obviously being curtailed at present by the social partners and by the process taking place outside the House in relation to pay bargaining. It is also being curtailed by the role being played by the European Parliament which has an input in our legislative process and our economic policies. I suspect, however, that it is being curtailed most &mdash; and perhaps this marks a change of direction on our part &mdash; by our willingness to take on board suggested reforms.  We should with confidence take account of our role, the importance of what we do and give it serious consideration.</P>
      <P>The first thing we need to do before reforms will have any meaning is to commit ourselves to extending the number of sitting days.  It is absurd that this House sits on so few occasions.  For a start we should not sit just two days a week.  If we are to put all the other reforms into place we must start at the beginning and extend the number of sitting days.  That is a necessary reform.  We should have a three day week and curtail our holidays so that we have a more standard-type holiday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept this might infringe on the liberty of people who have to earn a living outside of Seanad Éireann.  No one would question that this is necessary given the level of pay.  It will, therefore, be necessary to introduce reforms in the area of salary.  These would be accepted by the public if they resulted in a greater output. It is my conviction, however, that we must extend the number of sitting days. It is nonsense to suggest that legislation might not be ready on a given day; there are enough important issues to be discussed. We have been elected to the Seanad and it is our responsibility to do <Col N="475" /> so.  As such we should accept the notion that we should extend the number of sitting days.  I commend the suggestion to the House and I would be delighted if it were to gain all-party acceptance and were to be put forward to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges as a recommended reform.</P>
    <P>Secondly, we need to respond urgently, quickly and more comprehensively to issues of the day.  We should have had thorough debates in recent months and weeks on Northern Ireland and on unemployment.  As someone who comes from a rural area &mdash; I will refer to this in the debate on the Appropriation Bill; it is not relevant to go into this matter in depth now &mdash; it will be necessary to have an urgent debate shortly on the depopulation of rural areas and on what is happening there with particular reference to the up-to-date census figures.  That matter needs to be examined urgently.</P>
    <P>The next thing we need to do &mdash; and this has been trotted out here so often that we should do something about it &mdash; is initiate more legislation in the Seanad. There is nothing wrong with this if one accepts the principle that this House acts, to borrow a phrase, as a distillery, a strainer or filter in relation to legislation and has a less sharp political edge to it.  Since that is generally accepted to be the case, clearly it would be worthwhile to initiate legislation here.  This should be done more often.  Given that we are not able to give effect to this change from within, obviously we will have to put the required pressure on at political level and maintain it to have more legislation initiated here.</P>
    <P>Because legislation is not initiated in the Seanad there is a lack of willingness to accept amendments here.  I was delighted, however, that a couple of amendments I had tabled to the Child Care Bill were accepted.  That Bill was debated in a constructive fashion but it is very noticeable that generally amendments are not accepted.  If amendments are not going to be accepted it is nonsense to suggest that we are serious about the Seanad or that it has a serious role to <Col N="476" /> play.  What I am saying, therefore, at this stage is that we will have to extend the number of sitting days, expand the range of issues to be debated and respond urgently.  We must show our willingness to initiate legislation here more often and there will have to be Government acceptance of amendments in this House; otherwise it is a farce.</P>
    <P>I know plans are being mooted by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges at present to increase the number of Adjournment matters which may be raised in the House.  I welcome that.  It is timely and necessary and it should help the House to respond more comprehensively, fully and immediately to issues of the day.  I strongly believe that we should introduce questions for written answer to this House.  I accept that there may be a logistical problem in regard to Ministers answering questions in the House on a regular basis &mdash; although there would be merit in doing so occasionally &mdash; but I see no reason for the facility to ask written questions not being extended to Members of this House.  It must be done and it might even have a desirable effect on the Order of Business because when an issue of importance to a Member's constituency arises, which is also relevant to his or her nominating body or to the electorate, Members are forced to abuse the Order of Business or Standing Orders to refer to the issue.  A system of written answers would partly rectify the problem and increased Adjournment debates will also help, although they will not be adequate.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross gave an excellent discourse on the role of the Seanad, based on years of experience.  However, I disagree with his view that it would not be fruitful to have MEPs addressing this House.  It would be fruitful if, occasionally, MEPs addressed this House; we should constantly review what is happening in Europe and there should be a constant link with them.  I know there is an Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities but, progressively, Europe has a much greater input to the day-to-day lives of people here.  Senator Raftery, <Col N="477" /> as a former Member of the European Parliament, may elaborate on this.  We should constantly monitor the European scene, have interaction with our MEPs and ongoing discussions on European affairs, which would be a worthwhile exercise.</P>
    <P>This House should provide an obvious vehicle for dealing with the situation in Northern Ireland.  It should provide an obvious forum for bridge building between North and South and should be a focus for reconciliation.  That can be achieved by accepting the principle, however we implement it, in our proposed reform of the Seanad.  There is no point in having a debate if we do not act on it.  I made a number of recommendations &mdash; and recommendations have been made by other speakers &mdash; and they will all have to be distilled and analysed and a programme of action initiated.</P>
    <P>We should accept that Members of this Assembly from Northern Ireland should be accepted as a permanent feature.  We should have membership here of progressive opinion within Ireland and as wide a spread of opinion as possible.  If we are to give right of audience to and consult Members of the European Parliament &mdash; which I previously suggested &mdash; I see no reason for this House not having regular consultation with elected representatives with leaders of Northern Ireland opinion.  It is critically important, at a time when events in Northern Ireland are of such gravity to see what extent this House could be used as a vehicle for reform or reconciliation.  I would accept the principle of Northern Ireland representatives being here, it is a shame that in the Taoiseach's 11 nominees we do not have a number of people from Northern Ireland.  I hope that in future this anomaly will be corrected.  Of the 11 nominees there should be at least four people reflecting a spread of opinion in Northern Ireland and reflecting the potential for greater understanding.</P>
    <P>I am heartened to hear that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges are considering extending Private Members' Time each week.  I welcome it as a new <Col N="478" /> initiative which can lead to more fulfilment in the House and a better reaction to events of the day.  That is why I argued at the beginning that we will have to increase the number of sitting days in this House.  It is an absurdity that the House sits on so few occasions and it cannot continue if we are to be taken seriously in our efforts to reform the House.  I support increasing Private Members' Time, that it is used much more often and that it involves all the parties putting forward their motions in sequence.  It is crazy to have so little input at that level at present.</P>
    <P>We have not attempted to implement a proper committee system in this House. I know we are frustrated by the fact that amendments are seldom accepted in the House and that legislation is, too often, initiated in the Dáil.  However, a committee system will have to be introduced which will examine a range of issues which are relevant to society and which arise in current legislation.  There is no reason for not having a committee, specific to this House, examining European legislation, our input to Europe, what is happening in Europe relevant to this country and how we could link with Europe in certain matters.  There is no reason for a working committee of this House not functioning on the Northern Ireland crisis on an ongoing basis.  The committee could be a focus for special trips to Northern Ireland and for special inter-parliamentary delegations between the two parts of the island.</P>
    <P>It is absurd that there is not a proper committee system specific to this House and initiated by it.  The committee would not necessarily conflict with the Oireachtas Joint Committees of the two Houses because our committee would seek to make our work here more effective, our reaction to events more thorough and would result in an in-depth study of issues.  For example, the Culliton report has presented us with a very challenging situation.  It challenged the <i>status quo</i> on education, investment strategy and industrial organisation.</P>
    <P>Why not set up a specialist committee, an all party committee of this House, <Col N="479" /> who would do nothing for the next six weeks except to analyse the Culliton report?  The report could be brought back to this House in plenary session. There is no reason for that not to happen. It is the kind of thing we are supposed to be doing and because we have failed in that regard there is cynicism about politics and politicians.  I commend this very strongly to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges because I do not want this debate to be just a nebulous set of abstractions and good wishes, we should make specific proposals.  One of the specific proposals I am putting forward is that we implement such a committee system as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>With great respect to all our colleagues &mdash; I am not referring specifically to any individual &mdash; we will have to look at the qualification system for panels.  One of the objectives of this House is to ensure that we have expertise in a range of professional areas.  I suggest that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges reexamine the qualification system for panels so as to ensure that there is a clear delineation between panels.  Some of my colleagues have said that they would qualify for all panels at the one time. That should not be the case.  Irrespective of the brilliance and comprehensive experience of individuals it is a bit much to think that they can automatically qualify for every panel.  For this reason the qualification system needs to be examined thoroughly.  This might prove an uncomfortable experience for all Members of the House but if it does so be it; the system needs to be tightened up.</P>
    <P>It was said to me that a person who makes even one speech could qualify for the Cultural and Educational panel.  If that is one of the criteria for qualification to that panel it is absurd.  I am not for one moment suggesting that Members who were elected on that panel are not suitably qualified &mdash; I am not in a position to comment on that one way or the other &mdash; but this kind of loose system of qualification has to be done away with if we are serious about reform.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="480" /> If, as I have suggested, we are to extend the number of sitting days of the House, to perpetually demand the initiation of more legislation here, to ensure that our amendments are accepted and are to be fully committed to what we are supposed to be doing we should not be embarrassed to point out that the Leas-Chathaoirleach is the only office holder who does not have the facilities normally given to office holders of the Oireachtas.  I would argue that it is wrong and unacceptable that the duly elected Leas-Chathaoirleach of this House is not given facilities commensurate with that office.  The other Oireachtas office holders have access to a car and other facilities.  I should like these facilities to be extended to the LeasChataoirleach of the Seanad.  If we are to be confident about our duties and role we should demand that these facilities be extended to him.  Why should we accept any secondary treatment of this House or its office holders?</P>
    <P>Due to recent events &mdash; it would be totally wrong to go over these issues which have been adequately thrashed out over the past six months &mdash; and the frustration felt by people who are unemployed and so on the level of cynicism among people, particularly young people, towards politics is at an all time high.  There is no question about this.  All independent market research carried out by agencies who have the proper scientific qualifications and back up have found that there is an enormous level of cynicism among people towards politics. If we do not endeavour to eliminate that cynicism and reduce our level of unemployment a very real threat will be posed to our democratic process.  I contend that we have a duty to do this as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>However, before we can do this we must first reform the Seanad.  I have put forward a number of suggestions in this respect.  Doubtless other suggestions will be put forward during the course of this debate.  One of my greatest fears is that this debate will make its way to the archives to be considered by post graduate students of sociology and politics in <Col N="481" /> ten years time.  If this happens we will have nobody to blame but ourselves.  We have the capacity to reform the House if we come to a consensus that this should be done.  Nobody can stop us doing this as this is a sovereign House of Parliament; it cannot be prevented or thwarted from introducing reforms should it so wish.</P>
    <P>We should ensure that the procedures of the House are reformed as a matter of urgency and that a set of reforms, which will remain under review, are put forward within a number of weeks.  Otherwise we will be giving people who propose that the Seanad should be abolished legitimate reasons why this should be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussing the role of the Seanad, we need to be conscious that reform of the Dáil and Seanad is part of the Government's programme.  For that reason I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  It is very easy to say what the role of the Seanad should be but it is very difficult to define this role.  Many speakers have said that the Seanad should be apolitical.  I welcome this opportunity to decry that illusion. The best way to do this is to refer to <i>The Pickwick Papers</i> when the mottled faced gentleman addressed Sam Weller and said, &ldquo;I object to the introduction of politics&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Some people believe the Seanad should be above politics, that it should be composed of eminent ladies and gentlemen of great distinction from various walks of life and that they should be politically neutured.  They believe that those eminent people should discuss political questions from time to time but that they should do so from an independent and detached point of view and, above all else, be unmoved by party politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A case can rightly be made for ensuring that the Members of the Upper House be less dependent on party considerations than the Members of the Lower House. I welcome the fact that there are a large number of Independent Senators.  I should like to pay tribute to them for the contributions they make on Bills and other matters.  If the Seanad is to be anything more than a debating society or <Col N="482" /> a discussion circle, whether or not we like it the word &ldquo;party&rdquo; is likely to arise.  If the Seanad has the power to discuss and vote on Bills, even if Members are limited to suggesting amendments or delaying the passage of a Bill, surely it will become obvious whether there is a majority of Members for or against the Government. One would think that after 12 months the politically neutered eminent ladies and gentlemen in this House would have to play a political role in that they would have to come down on one side or the other.  The case would then be made that the Government side had or had not a majority.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the Seanad, why it was set up and what its functions are.  The Seanad is expected to give opinions on measures which are promoted by Government.  I would ask how can the Seanad avoid party politics or, indeed, why should it?  A second House is part of a political system and its business is politics.  While I agree that this House need not be as partisan as the Lower House it would be completely powerless to express views or take decisions without being political.  A number of speakers mentioned vocational representation.  If we go down the road suggested it is inevitable because of the way the Seanad is structured, that instead of having more politically neutral vocational representation there would be much more political interference in the vocational presentation sector.  I have had the experience of being a Member of the Dáil and I am now very proud to be a Member of Seanad Éireann.  I listen with great attention to those who say there is something wrong with having a political agenda.  For example, people say it is wrong for Members of this House to hope to progress to the Dáil or indeed to the European Parliament, but I see nothing wrong with that.  It is an important aspiration. It is vocational in itself and is part of the make-up of each individual.</P>
    <P>Independent Members, in particular, give the impression from time to time that everything they say is more important than the contributions of the political parties.  In all political parties <Col N="483" /> in this House there are people who are totally dedicated to the positions they hold in the Seanad and they work actively to ensure that it runs properly, efficiently and effectively.  The reason there is so much interest in the debate on the role of the Seanad is that Members are committed to it.  By being politically ambitious it does not take one iota from the commitment of individual Senators to the House.</P>
    <P>As regards the operation of the House, it is fair to say that all of us, including those on the Government side, from time to time feel that insufficient time is given to discussion of various bills.  Perhaps Ministers from time to time do not treat this House with the respect that is its due. I would ask the members of the new Government to have regard to the Seanad and to the important role it plays in the legislative system.  Calls have been made for the setting up of committees of the Seanad, but what is needed is the initiation of a greater number of Bills in this House.  It is time wasting to introduce in Dáil Éireann Bills which could be effectively debated and amended in this House.  The recent example was the Environmental Protection Agency Bill. As can be seen from the debates on that Bill, the standard of debate was extremely high and valuable points were made.  However, by the time that Bill came to the Upper House the time spent debating it was cut by a number of hours.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Reilly suggested the setting up of a committee system in this House, but we want to avoid duplication.  A number of committees have been set up already.  These committees should not be solely Dáil committees but rather joint committees of the Oireachtas.  There is scope for the setting up of such committees and in future all committees should include Seanad representation.  I would urge the new Taoiseach, in view of the importance of foreign affairs to this country, to set up a foreign affairs committee and to ensure that there is Seanad representation on that committee. I regret that there is no Seanad representation on the Committee of <Col N="484" /> Public Accounts.  I see no reason why that is so because Seanad representatives would have a major role to play on such a committee.</P>
    <P>I am bemused by the fact that Senators request the proper ordering of business because the Order of Business each day reminds me of champagne corks popping, with people hopping up, patting each other on the back and congratulating each other for raising certain matters.  Very often it is the people in favour of reform who are responsible for lengthening discussion on the Order of Business.  Some of these people see the Order of Business as an opportunity to grab a headline, and I can well understand that because we are all political minded and none of us backs away from such an opportunity.</P>
    <P>In the Seanad there are various groupings &mdash; the Government side and the Progressive Democrats, Fine Gael, Labour and the Independents.  Surely it would be possible in the ordering of business to make arrangements with regard to the questions that might arise on the Order of Business.  This calls for a discipline within each group so that the time for dealing with the Order of Business can be reduced and this House is seen to act in a proper manner.  I say that genuinely because this side of the House &mdash; certainly since I became a Member&mdash; likes to raise matters on the Order of Business, as do Independent Members who frequently use the opportunity of doing so.  It is unacceptable that four or five Independent Members should raise matters on the Order of Business on any one day.  Unfortunately, this side of the House has taken the view that if Independent Members may raise as many matters as they wish on the Order of Business why can we not do the same?  It is a question of putting our heads together to agree on a procedure to restore normality to the Order of Business.</P>
    <P>Somebody spoke about the voting procedures. Funnily enough, I like the archaic way we vote as it gives Senators the opportunity to come together and mingle.  It is good that all Members are <Col N="485" /> in the House at the one time.  However, it should be an order of the House that Senators be seated in their place after voting rather than standing around and talking to each other.  That would be in keeping with the dignity of the House.</P>
    <P>With the advent of televising the Seanad, the proceedings of this House are being viewed in the public arena.  I agree with all the Members who said that the Seanad should be made more meaningful.  We are all aware of the restrictions on having topical matters of national importance debated.  Indeed, over the past 12 months I have being trying to initiate a debate on the banking system.  When I gave notice that I wished to raise this matter on the Adjournment I was told that no Minister had a function in the matter.  Therefore, it appears to me that the time has come to give Members the opportunity to make statements without a Minister being present. In making that suggestion I am conscious that there is not much point in a Member making a statement if somebody is not taking note of what has been said.  Some Members have suggested that we should be allowed to put down questions but as this is a costly and difficult procedure I cannot see that suggestion being taken on board.  However, I suggest that the relevant Minister could respond to the Member's statement the following week, outlining the Government's view on the topic.  That would be meaningful and at the same time we would be eliciting a response from the Minister, which is exactly what we want to achieve.</P>
    <P>There are a great many topical issues that are relevant to this House.  Is it not strange that with so many unemployed we have not had a debate on job creation?  I would advocate any forum&mdash; even an all-party group that could come up with good ideas for the creation of jobs, indeed, everybody would.</P>
    <P>Members would like to have the opportunity to raise matters of local importance but there is no scope at present for doing that.  I agree that there should be grievance time and that we should be allowed to raise at least four topics on the Adjournment each week.  Some <Col N="486" /> Members suggest that the sitting time should be extended by another day.  I am not sure if that is a good idea, one has to be practical.  A Senator is paid in the region of £14,000 per annum and many Senators would find it very difficult to provide for their family and exist on that. However, I suggest there is scope for extending the sitting time in the two-day period.  Is there any reason why we should not start at 12 noon and continue until 10 p.m. on Wednesday night?  I know we have done that in certain instances but perhaps we could structure the sitting time in that way.  This would give us time to raise topical matters of local and national interest.</P>
    <P>A number of Members suggested that we could arrange for dignitaries to visit this House.  I agree with that.  For instance, we could invite the Commissioners of the European Communities to address this House.  Senator O'Reilly suggested that we invite members of the European Parliament but I am wary of inviting parliamentarians because of the political nature of the EC Parliament. The EC is important to Ireland and will become increasingly so and it is important that Senators be aware of the various EC programmes from which Ireland can benefit.  Therefore it would be a good idea to issue an invitation to the EC Commissioners to address this House on various issues.  I believe that the regions should have direct access to European funding and we could initiate the process here.  I support the idea of extending an invitation to the Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment on a remark made by Senator Ross.  He said that in the period from July to December 1991 only two Bills were passed by this House. That is very unfair to this House.  Let me put on record what exactly transpired in this House from January to December 1991: 34 Bills were passed by this House &mdash; a far cry from the number mentioned by Senator Ross; 13 non-Government motions and 12 Government motions were accommodated; statements were made on nine occasions on issues such as the Gulf War, the EC, the Kurds, etc. Finally, in case the message goes out that <Col N="487" /> the Seanad is not functioning well, let me commend the Cathaoirleach and the Leas-Chathaoirleach, the Leader of the House and the party leaders for the excellent way, by and large, that business is now ordered.  We have had far less acrimony in recent times than we had in the past.  We are all learning.  There is an across-the-board commitment to a more effective and efficient system in Seanad Éireann.  For that reason I am delighted that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges propose to adopt a number of procedures that will enhance the reputation of Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>This is my third time discussing the role of the Seanad in the last two years.  It is clear from the debate so far that there is a will and a need to reform and change the role of the Seanad.  We need to look at ourselves and at the way in which we must see this House.</P>
      <P>This House is an undemocratic Chamber. It is a Chamber which, in many instances, is unrepresentative.  It is very often irrelevant and as a debating Chamber it is emaciated in that it has lost its power in many ways.  That is not to say that it does not have extraordinary potential nor is it to say that it does not have a critically important role within the structure of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>In regard to legislation, the role of the Seanad consists of reviewing legislation that is already on the Statute Book and revising legislation initiated in the other House.  More importantly than any of those is its role in initiating legislation. Those are the three legislative functions of this House.  We fall down on all three. We are at our best in the area of initiating legislation and do that better than it is done in the Dáil for the simple reason that a Bill gets far more detailed consideration and attention during the course of its passage through this Chamber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedure in the Dáil &mdash; the only reason I refer to this is just simply to show the comparison, not to say one is better than the other in that sense &mdash; is <Col N="488" /> that there is a set period of time in which to deal with legislation.  Very often, particularly on Committee and Report Stages of a Bill, all the amendments are not debated in the Dáil.  This House has a different approach.  We insist on addressing and dealing with every amendment.  Consequently, a Bill which has passed through the process of initiation in this House is likely to have far fewer defects in it than a Bill which was initiated in the Dáil.  That is a fact that is not widely known and one that we do not sell ourselves.  It is our strongest point and our greatest contribution.</P>
    <P>Three major Bills, the Companies Bill, which now is an Act, the Insurance Bill and the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, were initiated in this House and were changed beyond recognition between the time they were initiated and the time they were passed by this House. That is the reality.  The changes were for the better.</P>
    <P>Changes in this House can be made in a non-confrontational way because it is not seem as a party against party type Chamber.  In this House the groups address legislation and put forward proposals which are far more likely to be accepted by the Minister of the day. Unfortunately the problem with Bills which have been initiated in the Dáil and which come here, is that Ministers very often set their faces against accepting changes because that would mean bringing the legislation back to the other House.  That is unfortunate.  It results in weak legislation.  As regards the initiation of legislation there should be a balance between this House and the Dáil.</P>
    <P>On the question of the review of legislation, that process does not take place at all.  There are areas where, as part of the process of legislating, we should address older legislation, run the rule over them to see if they are still relevant and reflect the views, attitudes and philosophies of the country at this stage.  We do not do that.  Some form of that process is done regularly by the Law Reform Commission.  Unfortunately the reports of the Law Reform Commission are far too rarely debated.  I accept the point <Col N="489" /> that it might be better to have the Law Reform Commission doing the professional work of lawyers in addressing legislation and giving their reports to us but, at the end of the day, it would be a mistake to think that lawyers are the best people to review legislation.  They are not.  Lawyers are the best people to examine legislation.  They are the best people to make comments on its worth, safety and effectiveness but not to make the political judgment as to what is necessary, correct or right.  That is our function and it is an area where we are losing out.</P>
    <P>This is an undemocratic Chamber and however much that puts our backs up, or however much people react against it, that is the reality.  We cannot sustain the method of election to this Chamber much longer.  I think I am the only person on the Independent benches who has never criticised the role of members of local authorities, county councils, corporations, etc., despite the fact that during the course of this debate Senator Finneran made strong comments about my views on this.  I put it on record that I have never offered a view in public. My view is that I see a role for county councillors and city councillors in the election to this Chamber.  I am the only one on the Independent benches who has taken that view consistently.  I would never underestimate the important role and function of county councillors and I would not deprive them of their input into the election of this Chamber, but I would restrict it.</P>
    <P>I spend my life working in the area of education and trade unionism.  There is a Labour Panel and an Education Panel but I would not have the remotest possibility of being elected on either panel despite the fact that I am at the most senior level in trade unionism and in education. There is something wrong with that system.  It seems extraordinary that the only way I could be elected was on the most exclusive &mdash; in terms of social position &mdash; the University franchise.  In general terms, one-tenth of this House, six members out of 60, are elected through the University vote.  In terms of the population at large, approximately <Col N="490" /> one person in ten receives third level education.  It represents one cadre of people within the community and it sticks in my throat to find it is the only one on which I could become elected.</P>
    <P>As far as the University panel is concerned &mdash; and I have been saying this since 1981 despite the fact that some people think it is a new issue &mdash; every graduate of every third level institution, RTCs, colleges of education, the new universities, should have a vote on the panel that elects me.  I will develop that point.</P>

      <P>Coming from Westport in west Mayo, I have been involved with tourist issues since I was a child.  I have seen the immense benefit the development of the tourist industry has been to west Mayo.  If one takes a broad look at the west in terms of its strengths and weaknesses, there are enormous weaknesses in terms of its remoteness, the length of time it takes to get goods to markets and the high cost of freight charges.  It is not a logical place in which to base most heavy industries.  There are problems in tackling intensive agriculture. On the other side of the coin there are certain strengths, such as the fishing industry and the potential for tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="492" /> The more I travel, the more I appreciate where I come from and the values and strengths we have with magnificent unpolluted beaches in a polluted world. County Mayo has about a quarter of the Blue Ribbon beaches in Ireland.  We do not have major urban conurbations.  We do not have urban pollution.  We do not have industrial or marine pollution.  We have an environment that is unique in the world today and we must take all possible care to nurture it.</P>
    <P>I applaud the development of Knock Airport.  When it was less popular many years ago, I was a great fan of that development and of Monsignor Horan. There were many people who were critical of the cost of that airport but when one looks back now, a strip was constructed which can take in jumbo jets, at a total cost of about £11 or £12 million. In contrast to that, the recent building of a single runway at Dublin Airport had a budget of about £40 million.  To put it into context, Knock Airport was a magnificent development in which the State got huge benefits in terms of its capital investment.  It is a landmark to the man who created it and I am delighted to see it there.  The airport is a huge bonus to Bord Fáilte and to the State and many visitors fly in directly from London.  It is an admirable development but there are problems there which we must meet.</P>
    <P>There is a great dissatisfaction in Mayo at present about air fares into Knock airport.  Ryanair in the past provided a reasonable service.  Perhaps it is the existence of a monopoly which gives them the idea that they can charge more than they should.  The charges are unacceptable. Around Christmas time, someone in my family was coming from London and wanted to fly to Knock.  The cheapest possible return air fare was about £205. I asked if that person were flying from London to Dublin what the fare would be and was told it would be about £100 return.  The return fare from London to Knock was £205 while the return fare from London to Dublin was £100.  A person with limited income could fly into Dublin, buy a return train ticket from Heuston Station to Westport for about <Col N="493" /> £18 or £20 and save about £80 in the process; I know of many people in the west who do this because of the difference in air fares.  I ask the Minister to investigate this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister might also look at the lack of reciprocation between Aer Lingus and Ryanair because most major airlines reciprocate where ticketing arrangements are concerned.  When British Airways were flying into Dublin, if you flew out on an Aer Lingus flight and had a conventional type ticket, you were not obliged to come back on an Aer Lingus flight.  There was reciprocation between the two airlines which was a valuable asset.  If one flies from Dublin to Heathrow on an Aer Lingus flight and wishes to fly back to Knock, one must travel with Ryanair.  Due to lack of reciprocation, the only way one can do so is to buy a single Aer Lingus ticket from Dublin to one of the two London Airports they fly into and buy a single Ryanair ticket back to Knock.  That is madness because one pays double or treble the air fare.</P>
    <P>I had the experience in Manchester Airport one morning of having an Aer Lingus return ticket to Dublin where my car was parked.  The plane, which was coming from Zurich, was held up due to engine trouble.  Three or four hours passed at which point a Ryanair plane was going to Knock airport which is close to where I live.  I asked for reciprocation and even though Aer Lingus were at fault because their plane was three or four hours late, there was no reciprocation and I had to buy a ticket there and then for the privilege of getting on the Ryanair flight to Knock Airport.  That is quite unacceptable.  British Midland sought reciprocation with Aer Lingus and were refused and the case was to go to the European Court of Justice.  There is reciprocation between the Netherlands and Britain and with KLM and Aer Lingus and it would be only sensible for people in the west to have the benefit of reciprocation.  The national airline is accountable to the Minister.  Ryanair are not entirely independent because, through the munificence of the Minister, <Col N="494" /> they have special concessions into Stansted. I would like the Minister to look into that whole area.</P>
    <P>We are thrilled with the developments over the last two decades in the Mayo/Galway region.  Westport is the second largest centre in the region after Galway-Salthill.  Last year, it was staggering to see the numbers of foreign visitors. I mentioned last week the number of Italian visitors.  The preliminary tourist numbers published for 1991 by Bord Fáilte showed a 33 per cent increase, about three times greater than the increase from any other country.  We need to develop that area.  There is still scope for major tourist investment and the Government can use European Community Structural Funds to fund needy developments in growth centres.</P>
    <P>Westport needs a first class conference centre.  If the town had such a facility it could attract visitors off-season.  It is a venue which has many other advantages: It has excellent hotels, marvellous guest-house accommodation, good eating houses, a first-class golf course, a bay, beautiful scenery and the people have been educated to deal with tourists.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan made a very unusual statement last week when he said we would be much better off developing fishing in the west rather than tourism. That was an extraordinary statement.  I am all for developing fishing but it is compatible with the development of tourism.</P>
    <P>I wanted to mention mining and how at Croagh Patrick, Doo Lough and Delphi vigilant local committees are protecting the environment, but that is for another day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Honan in congratulating the Minister and welcoming her to the Seanad.  The people in the west and particularly in my county, rejoice in her appointment.  I attended the bishops conference in Sligo and listened intently to the ground that was covered by those who honestly expressed their concern.  The Government have made an important response by appointing the Minister who has wide experience <Col N="495" /> of the difficulties in the west.  I and others enthusiastically look forward to her contributions.</P>
      <P>Donegal is a county with vast potential for tourism, an industry which has the capacity to provide jobs.  This has been recognised by the vocational committee and has resulted in the establishment of a hotel training college in Killybegs.  Some 500 students from all over the country attend there.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to look at the case which has been made for the provision of an airport or an air-strip at Letterkenny. The Cabinet may say there is an airport at Eglinton, County Derry and another in North Donegal and that we do not need a third airport in that region.  I would remind the Minister that my county does not benefit from the £120 million that is pumped into Irish Rail because we have no railhead; Irish Shipping accumulated losses of £40 million and natural gas has been developed.</P>
      <P>I am highlighting areas of high expenditure which have not benefited the people in the west or in Donegal and that must be recognised when an application for funding in rural areas is made.  A case will be made to the Minister to consider the location of an airstrip at Letterkenny. At present, 32 private coach operators transport people from Dublin to Donegal.</P>
      <P>In Donegal we have areas of major importance, such as Portnoo and Portsalon. If these two areas were developed many jobs would be created in the tourist industry.  In Donegal we are giving attention to development of the tourist industry. We are involved in hotel training and catering.  There is vast potential for development and we are confident that with the Minister's understanding of the value of tourism, her attitude towards people and projects and her easy style and approach, we will go forward.  The appointment of the new Government and of the Minister has been a good day for the west.  I wish the Minister good luck in her task.</P>

      <P>I wish to join with other Senators in welcoming the Minister and say how delighted I am that not only is there at least one woman in this Cabinet but we have a woman of outstanding ability.  She will bring the talent and ability she has shown in her previous appointments to this exciting Department she has now taken over.</P>
      <P>In 1987 the Government set a target for doubling tourism potential between the years 1988 and 1993 and they set the objective of getting £500 million in additional revenue and an extra 25,000 new jobs.  These were ambitious targets but they were realisable.  The Government are correct in pinning much of their hopes for job creation on the tourist industry.  I know that between the period 1987 and 1991 tourism claims to have created 17,500 new jobs, which is 37 per cent of the new jobs created in that period.</P>
      <P>Tourism is a service industry.  If is very much a labour intensive industry and for that reason it can, if properly handled, if the commitment is maintained by the Government and, above all, if the resources are put into it, make an important contribution to the economy.  It is fair to say that when capital is scarce, which it always will be and certainly is at the moment, it is important that we use our capital resources in areas where the yield can be of greatest benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The year just passed has undoubtedly been a difficult one for tourism all over the world, and Ireland is no exception. International tourism was down and there are a number of factors for this, the most obvious ones being the Gulf War and the recession, particularly in Great Britain and the United States.  In spite of that, the figures Bord Fáilte will publish for last year will show that total overseas visitor numbers were still within about 2 per cent of the 1990 record, which was 3.1 million, the highest figure ever.  It is interesting to look at those figures and see that while tourism from Great Britain was down by 1.9 per cent, from mainland <Col N="497" /> Europe the figure was up by a very encouraging 13 per cent.  This to a large extent is where our future lies.  The majority of tourists who come here from Europe are discerning, sophisticated tourists for whom Ireland has a great appeal.</P>
    <P>The tourism figures for North America were particularly disappointing, down by 21 per cent.  As I said, the Americans are always uneasy about travel when there is war on anywhere in the world.  In spite of this, Bord Fáilte have, I understand, ambitious targets for 1992. They hope to increase the numbers from Britain by 7.4 per cent, from mainland Europe by 19 per cent, from North America by 15 per cent and from the rest of the world by 12 per cent.  These are ambitious targets, an 11.6 per cent increase overall.  They can achieve this but the budget allocation made to them this year has been disappointingly low.  In 1990 their budget allocation was £20.513 million.  In 1991 it went up to £21.892 million but in 1992 that figure was down to £21.5 million.  When one takes inflation into account this figure in real terms is considerably down.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte have to contend with fierce competition from other parts of the world.  There is no point in imagining that because we have what we consider to be an attractive product, an unpolluted country, though I am not quite so sure that image is still as real as it used to be, Bord Fáilte do not need to open up new markets or extend markets.  I am sorry to see that their allocation is down as this will mean a tighter rein on their advertising and promotional campaigns.  I do not believe that in view of this decrease in their allocation they will be able to fully exploit the market potential, especially in the more productive markets.  They need to attack news segments and new markets.</P>
    <P>The Japanese market has fantastic potential.  Only 10,000 people from Japan came to Ireland in 1991.  This is a tiny fraction of the Japanese who come to Europe.  I do not know what the figure is but one only has to travel in any part of Europe, particularly in England, to see <Col N="498" /> them swarming around everywhere.  I just hope we can attract more of them to this country.  I understand that Japanese generally like to stay in Japanese-owned hotels so we may need to encourage the Japanese to invest in hotels here.</P>
    <P>I was recently in Malaysia and there is huge potential there.  I realised during my visit that Malaysians were extremely interested in Ireland but it was virtually impossible for us to get literature to give to people.  Bord Fáilte have no profile in that part of the world.  This is something which should be looked at although they say they do not have the resources to tap this market.  That is unfortunate.</P>
    <P>Foreign exchange earnings are also, I understand, expected to rise following the CSO report for the period from January to June.  They say that earnings in that period increased by 8 per cent.  This shows that the objective of attracting higher spending tourists to this country is being met and that is the right road for us to go along.  I do not believe that Ireland can compete with places like Malaga or the south of Spain or other places which attract huge numbers of tourists who spend very little.  That is not the way we should develop our tourist business.</P>
    <P>We have a quality product and that is what we need to concentrate on.  We need to improve our standards so that we can offer the very highest standards to visitors. It is encouraging to see that in areas like hygiene and service standards have improved but they still have quite a considerable way to go.  What is not so evident and what we need to concentrate on is preserving the character and the special quality of our towns and villages so that they do not become characterless mid-atlantic type places where visitors find nothing to interest them.  We had a noteworthy indigenous architecture but in many instances it has given way to ribbon housing development on the outskirts of villages, a bungalow blitz and other unattractive developments.  I ask the Minister not to ballyrag the local authorities but to encourage them; they have been ballyragged too long by central Government. I suggest she encourage them to <Col N="499" /> promote the best types of development and the highest possible standards of design.</P>
    <P>I fear that the Government believe we must have development and building at any cost, cranes in the sky; I do not think that is the way forward for us.  We need to concentrate on traditional design formations on a suitable scale for the countryside and villages of Ireland.  We can have new developments which are modern in the very best sense of the word but not banal.  There are many places where this has been achieved.  I was in Clonakilty recently and one can only be overjoyed to see how the kind of modern development there has been beautifully integrated into the town.  Trinity College Dublin, which is celebrating 400 years, will make an enormous contribution to tourism in 1992, bringing in tens of thousands of new visitors.  One has only to walk down the road from here to Trinity College to see the wonderful modern buildings which have in no way detracted from the elegant 18th century atmosphere of the university; they have added to and enhanced it.</P>
    <P>We need to remember that people coming here from abroad want different and distinctive cultural experiences.  Our remoteness is not necessarily a disadvantage; on the contrary we could use it to great advantage.  We will soon be the only island in Europe on the west coast, which is something we could exploit.  I am concerned, however, that the substantial European regional development moneys now coming in and the anxiety to get a much as possible from Europe may result in thoughtless building developments.  I am thinking particularly of interpretive centres on which there is so much division.  The letters columns of the daily papers reveal the extent of local resistance to many of these centres.</P>
    <P>We must not spoil the quality of what we have to offer.  We should concentrate on cultural and heritage tourism and in this regard it is sad to see the loss of so much fine Irish architecture.  The great Irish houses are a case in point and the <Col N="500" /> papers referred again yesterday to the tragedy of Drogheda grammar school. We have lost so much already and I beg the Minister to intercede and plead with her colleague, the new Minister for the Environment, to introduce the necessary legislation to avert further losses.  I am not asking for more funding but for legislation which would allow local authorities to hold on to the best of our architectural heritage.  At the moment this area is sadly neglected and needs immediate attention if we are not to lose more of our great heritage.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on her appointment and wish her well in her tenure of office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the new Minister, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, on her much deserved appointment and wish her every success in a very important economic portfolio.</P>
      <P>This is a very opportune time for a discussion on tourism.  The Government's new policies to support the industry paid rich dividends in 1988, 1989 and 1990.  While we acknowledge the destructive impact of the Gulf War in 1991, tourism outcome for the year has been satisfactory considering the difficulties. Since 1988 investment in new projects and infrastructure for tourism have reached record levels so, as we enter 1992, we are in excellent shape to take advantage of further growth.  For too long tourism has suffered as a poor relation in our portfolio of economic options.  The excellent progress made in such a short period should encourage not only optimism but confidence in what the industry can deliver.  Statistics show that since 1987 tourism has contributed 40 per cent of all new jobs created in this country; this amounts to just under 20,000 jobs. When we consider that employment is the main item on the new Government's agenda, I hope that the Minister will use all her efforts to ensure that the tourism success of the last few years will continue with increased investment in tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Foreign revenue from tourism has increased by £400 million in three years <Col N="501" /> and now stands at £1,200 million.  We should continue to invest substantially in tourism to create jobs and to attract foreign revenue, but there is also another reason.  Tourism contributes close on £600 million to Government revenue through taxation and this level of contribution is vital to maintain essential services and to create further opportunities.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to Bord Fáilte for the excellent work they have done and for the potential they have demonstrated. It is not all plain sailing.  The death and carnage inflicted in Northern Ireland and the activities of terrorists in Britain do a great deal to tarnish the image of Ireland and to create fear among prospective visitors.  Senators on all sides of the House have deplored these activities many times for the human suffering and misery they cause, but their indirect economic impact serves to destroy economic opportunities.  In my own constituency in north County Dublin I am aware of the opportunities which tourism has brought through new hotels, extensions to existing hotels and the provision of leisure and cultural activities and facilites. We are not yet a rival to Killarney but we have come a long way.</P>
    <P>Malahide and Skerries are two of Ireland's tidiest towns and the area can boast some of the best heritage projects in the country and an unequalled potential for golf and leisure.  We are now building on these assets and I want to acknowledge the positive role played by Bord Fáilte in the use of EC Structural Funds.  Before the end of this month I hope to ses the first sod turned on the new £15 million investment by Mark McCormack in an international golf and leisure project which will be a major boost not just for Portmarnock and Malahide but for the whole country.</P>
    <P>As one who has been involved in tidy towns for the last ten years, and Senator Hederman would concur, I am sure that for very little money this competition has contributed significantly to the improvement of our environment.  If my recollection is correct, I do not believe Galway has yet achieved the number one spot in that competition, but I am sure <Col N="502" /> that under the Minister's direction, influence and commitment towns in Galway will begin to feature.</P>
    <P>Approximately 20,000 people are involved on a voluntary basis in the Tidy Towns Competition with limited Government investment and I urge the Minister to look at that competition and to offer some recognition to those involved.  Bord Fáilte struggled to find sponsors for the competition over the last years and have been lucky to find a financial institution to invest.  Fewer than 100 towns were involved in the first Tidy Towns Competition whereas now over 600 communities are involved on a voluntary basis.  I hope when the Minister has an opportunity to read her brief she will give serious consideration to improving and promoting this competition further.  It is extraordinary how, when holidaying in Ireland, people seek out the towns that do well in the competition, that have made an effort.  I have no doubt about the investment consequences for those towns &mdash; I know what it has meant to everybody involved in commercial and residential investment in Malahide and we are extremely proud of our success.</P>
    <P>In three years we have seen great improvement; our eyes have been opened to tourist potential.  It is right for this House to earnestly encourage the Government to give tourism a higher priority, to raise its status as an economic activity.  The Taoiseach has already put jobs firmly on top of the Government agenda and tourism is one of the fastest and most effective ways of getting these jobs.  I hope tourism will come to be recognised as the best, or one of the best, strategic options open to us.  I have every confidence that this Minister will convince those who decide where money should be spent to increase investment in tourism.  The record in job creation speaks for itself.  Other investments deserve encouragement but tourism affects everyone; it is the life-blood of many towns and cities.  I hope the new Administration will give all those connected with the promotion of tourism every support possible and I wish the <Col N="503" /> Minister good luck in her new portfolio.</P>

      <P>I propose to allocate some of my time to Senator McMahon. I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate her on her appointment; I wish her every success in the various matters which comprise her portfolio. Without wishing to minimise some of those matters, I hope that the development of tourism and its knock-on effects in relation to job creation and putting Ireland on the world tourism map will be one of her priorities.</P>
      <P>We are all concerned that more tourists should visit this country and we need to focus on a strategy to promote tourism. We all congratulate and commend Bord Fáilte for their efforts and in the light of difficulties not of their own making.</P>
      <P>In relation to the reduced budget over the last number of years, I hope this Minister will be able to fight for a greater share for tourism and an enlarged grant to Bord Fáilte.  We need commitment and a long term strategy.  Bord Fáilte have drawn attention to certain matters, such as, product strategy, competitiveness, promotion, distribution, all of which must be examined.  In some areas we need to change old ways and in other areas the requirement is to develop and plan ahead.  It is disappointing that the tourism grant over the last number of years has been reduced from what it was in the late eighties, but I hope the Minister will give a commitment tonight to reverse this trend.  It would be a good start to her tenure to acquire more money for her Department, which could then be allocated to the development of national tourism.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the Cabinet table at a future stage will the question of Dún <Col N="504" /> Laoghaire Harbour which for many tourists is the first sight of Ireland.  Another recently appointed colleague who will be fighting this cause very hard is the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy David Andrews.  I hope this Minister will acknowledge the need to develop those harbour facilities and to retain the ferry at Dún Laoghaire, in order that people may start their holiday not only in Shannon or Dublin but also at Dún Laoghaire. I am sure Senator Honan will not take exception to anything I have said.</P>
      <P>We need to look at various aspects of the tourism industry.  Sometimes little things give this country a bad name.  One aspect which should be scrutinised is the question of taxi fares.  A proportion of people are ripped off from time to time, particularly from Dublin Airport and other arrival and departure points.  When visiting other countries we all express surprise at the low cost of taxis but here the bill seems to mount up quickly, leaving one with a sense of being ripped off. The Minister should also examine a warning system in relation to attacks on tourists. We had a tragic incident in the Phoenix Park last year, and other less serious incidents which would not enhance a tourist's memory of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Many things need to be looked at.  I commend the proposer of and speakers to this motion.  It is a motion which we in general terms support even if we are putting down certain riders in relation to money being provided and certain strategies worked out.  I hope the Minister will meet people in Bord Fáilte to ensure that Ireland is developed as an all-year around destination, with a variety of holiday opportunities.  We are not the Costa del Sol and we must remember that and examine other aspects of our holiday market which could be developed.  I support the motion and I hope the Minister will be able to reply.</P>

      <P>I congratulated the Minister last night, and may I wish her well in her new position?  I would like to say publicly that I am delighted she has been appointed to this position although I am somewhat disappointed that she has <Col N="505" /> been given three portfolios.  I would prefer to see her pay all her attention to the tourism industry.  I am sure another area of her portfolio will command attention over the next few weeks given the situation in communications.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister will be a strong voice for tourism at the Cabinet table, casting no reflection on previous Ministers. Tourism needs a strong voice because the Government contribution to tourism is dwindling.  I am therefore amazed at the motion that has come forward from the Fianna Fáil group, signed by each of them, asking us to note the Government's contribution as outlined in the recent budget initiatives.  This is a carefully worded motion; it does not congratulate the Government but notes their continued interest in tourism.  I would like to see greater interest in tourism and more money being allocated to Bord Fáilte.  I congratulate them on the job they have been doing down the years under extreme difficulty, fighting for money and against odds which I am not going to go into here.  I am going to deal with other Departments, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, in the few minutes remaining to me although I would like half an hour or more to make a contribution on tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to note that other Departments give insufficient attention to tourism potential when carrying out certain projects or developments; each year controversial developments are insisted upon by the Office of Public Works; and the latest one by the Department of the Marine.  I refer to the seemingly great rush of the Office of Public Works to erect interpretative centres at various locations, the latest in County Wicklow.  There seems to be an enormous hurry to erect this interpretative centre at a cost of £3 million.  It is subject to a grant from Europe and if not built by a certain date that money may not be available to Wicklow, but residents, including public representatives and those from the Minister's party, feel that it has been rushed, that it has been sited in the wrong place and that a delay <Col N="506" /> of two or three months to have the situation examined by Trinity College would be worth much to the people of Wicklow and to those who will visit this county, from here and abroad.</P>
    <P>I am particularly fond of County Wicklow and I am delighted that a large stretch of the mountain area recently purchased by the previous Government will be turned into a public park.  I am delighted to see an interpretative centre coming to that area but I believe it is wrongly sited and I hope there will be a rethink on it. The previous Minister gave the green light to it in the dying days of the last Government and I hope that this Minister will look into this and consider siting it at Roundwood.  There are dozen other more suitable sites.  However, I leave it to the experts examining the situation at the moment.</P>
    <P>The Dingle marina is another contentious subject.  It baffles me that, in a democracy where so many people opposed the siting of the second Dingle marina, those who opposed it felt they had been conned because of the 22 objectors offering evidence only two were accepted by the inquiry, while on the other side, those who favoured the marine &mdash; 22 or 23 people &mdash; were allowed to give evidence.  It would be worth the Minister's while to pay a brief visit to Dingle.  No doubt she has been there before and is familiar with the area but this 25 acres of foreshore being proposed for the development of 40 houses, and other facilities will block the view of the harbour.  I feel for the people of Dingle and for all of those who will visit Dingle in the future, I am frequent visitor there myself.  The first sight you get of Dingle is when you turn a corner and descend a hill and it is proposed to put a marina there.  This marina is not needed because one is already being constructed. Because of these 40 two-storey houses the approaching visitor will no longer see that beautiful view of Dingle Harbour.  I ask the Minister to take a serious look at this.  It is not too late because while the Department of the Marine have given licence, planning permission is still required.  If that development goes ahead <Col N="507" /> our democracy is not worth anything because it will have been put there for reasons and purposes other than the requirements of the people of Dingle.</P>

      <P>Senator Mooney spelt out in some detail here last week the contribution which tourism now makes to the wealth of this country and all available statistics support this.  A recent independent study commissioned by the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation shows that Irish tourism grew twice as fast as the national economy from 1985 to 1990, contributing almost three-quarters of a percentage point each year to the national growth rate and increasing its share of GNP to almost 7 per cent.  The study confirms tourism as Ireland's principal internationally traded service accounting for 60 per cent of total exports of services and contributing more than £400 million, or about half the surplus on the overall balance of payments last year.</P>
      <P>Tourism was responsible for one in every three jobs created in the economy between 1985 and 1990 and now supports one in every eight jobs in the service sector.</P>

    <P>The transformation in the Irish tourism industry did not happen by chance.  This spectacular achievement is due to this Government's commitment to the sector <Col N="508" /> and to the magnificent efforts of all involved in the industry.  It justifies in full the Government's confidence in the sector's potential for growth and economic development.</P>
    <P>It is now just five years since Fianna Fáil published their ideas for putting growth back into tourism.  In that document we committed ourselves to revitalising tourism as a top national priority and this we have done.  Since then annual tourism numbers have gone up 66 per cent from 1.8 million to an estimated 3 million and foreign revenue from £650 million to £1.2 billion last year.  Over that period there have been considerable improvements in our product range and greater co-ordination in our marketing efforts which have been central to this achievement.</P>
    <P>Talking about marketing, may I refer briefly to one of the hot potatoes on my plate in the new Department, referred to by Senator Hourigan last week, and one of the issues on which I was buttonholed by Senator Honan and Deputies de Valera and Daly yesterday immediately following my appointment.  I refer to the Shannon stop over.</P>
    <P>First, let me reiterate that I and the Government are fully committed to the growth of Shannon and its airport.  Over the last 12 months or so my predecessor had discussions with most major US airlines about the possibility of further additional air services to Ireland.  He also received proposals from Aer Lingus for expanded services on the North Atlantic route.  On Monday next I will be sitting down with representatives from Shannon, from the status committee, from SIGNAL representing the workers, with Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta and SFADCo, to discuss the entire situation, including how best Ireland can win extra business before presenting my proposals to the Government.</P>
    <P>The vast improvement in our tourism product range is largely attributable to the implementation of the EC operational programme for tourism for 1989-1993. This programme involves contributions of over £118 million from the European Regional Development Fund <Col N="509" /> and over £28 million from the Social Fund.  It is concerned with the development and marketing of tourist amenities in Ireland to meet demand from identified segments of the international tourist market, thereby enabling achievement of five year sectoral targets for job creation and foreign revenue.</P>
    <P>Total investment, from national and EC sources, under the programme, will exceed £300 million by the end of 1993. So far, over 300 projects have been approved for assistance, involving more than £270 million, of which £85 million is being provided by the EC.  The administering agencies, SFADCo and Bord Fáilte, are still assessing and evaluating applications and I hope to be making further announcements regarding approved projects in the near future.</P>
    <P>Tourists are already enjoying the benefits of this programme with a vast array of new tourism projects now up and running throughout the country.  These vary from equestrian centres to golf resorts, from heritage centres to interpretive centres, from water based activities to all-weather activities.  In addition to enhancing Ireland's appeal in overseas markets, these facilities, of course, are also providing an added boost to a thriving home holiday market which is now worth about £360 million annually to the economy. This investment by the industry in a wide range of tourism products is helping to boost our off-season business and to ease the problems created by seasonality&mdash; an issue referred to by a number of speakers in this debate.</P>
    <P>The unique quality of our natural environment is one of our major tourism strengths and remains one of our strongest selling points in our overseas marketing drive.  During this debate great emphasis has been placed on the need to protect and conserve our environment. Developments being assisted under the operational programme for tourism must be environmentally sensitive and enhancing. The provisions of the EC environmental impact assessment directive will be applied to specific projects which come within its ambit.  We must constantly strive to preserve and enhance our <Col N="510" /> environment, not alone as an essential contribution towards tourism and other industries but as a key element in our everyday quality of life.</P>
    <P>I know a number of Senators have raised specific points.  I appreciate Senator Cosgrave and others mentioning the fact that I would need time to read into the brief I have been given.  I refer to issues, such as the development of Dún Laoghaire, the interpretive centres and their sensitive development, the air fares problems, which was raised by Senator Staunton, the Dingle marina and other points raised by Senators.  I will undertake to look at each of the issues raised last week and this week in this debate and, hopefully, I will be able at least, to further the points made by each speaker.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer specifically to a point made by Senator Hederman and Senator Cosgrave in relation to the Bord Fáilte allocation.  I would like to remind the House that grant-in-aid to Bord Fáilte Éireann has been held at £21.5 million in cash terms since 1989.  Considering the need for significant cutbacks in other areas of public expenditure this, in itself, was an achievement, but, in addition to the grant-in-aid, a further £10 million of Regional Development Fund money is available in the five year period up to the end of 1993 for co-operative marketing.</P>
    <P>Overall 1991 proved to be a difficult one for the Irish tourism industry, brought about, as has been referred to by many Senators, by economic recession in some of our main markets and, in particular, by the Gulf crisis.  To counteract these problems the Government introduced a number of measures including the allocation of an additional £1 million in the 1991 budget to Bord Fáilte for promotion and marketing in the UK and continental Europe.  An additional £1.25 million was also made available from the European Regional Development Fund at a special 75 per cent intervention rate for marketing compaigns in the US and mainland Europe.  These measures, together with Bord Fáilte's decision to step up marketing in continental Europe, ensured that the downturn forecast at the <Col N="511" /> beginning of the year was more or less avoided.</P>
    <P>Overseas tourist numbers for the full year were within some 2 per cent of 1990s all-time record performance and, in fact, revenue for the first nine months was up by almost 7 per cent on the corresponding period in 1990.</P>
    <P>We aim to get back to double digit growth again this year and all efforts are being concentrated to this end.  The recent budget will facilitate this effort.  I know that the decision to avoid VAT increases on tourism related expenditure on hotel accommodation, meals and car hire was particularly welcomed by the industry and should help this year's performance.</P>
    <P>The problems being experienced by the car hire industry and the repercussions for the tourism industry have also been acknowledged in the budget with the allocation of an additional £1 million to assist this strategically important sector.  Other measures, such as the reduction in excise duty on new cars and petrol, will also provide real assistance to the sector.  It is hoped that these measures will stimulate an increase in the supply of self-drive cars for hire during the peak season this year, thereby ensuring that valuable revenue is not lost to the industry generally.</P>
    <P>Since 1987 we have become somewhat used to seeing tourism records broken on a regular basis.  However, we cannot afford to become complacent.  Competition is growing keener and new destinations, such as Eastern Europe, are opening up all the time.  If we are to continue to grow we need to plan, to invest, to market and to work towards clear and broadly accepted objectives and strategies for the tourism sector.</P>
    <P>The recent initiative of my predecessor in establishing a new tourism task force, as suggested by the social partners, is timely.  It is appropriate that we should, at this stage in the development of the sector, stop, reflect on our achievements and look at where we go from here.  The task force have, therefore, been set an important and challenging task.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="512" /> The task force, which will report quickly will first, review, in the light of international commercial and marketing practice and organisation, the recent performance of and the future prospects for the Irish tourism industry with particular emphasis on the creation of additional new employment; second, determine the commercial and marketing opportunities available to the industry in order to capture a greater share of the international tourist market; third, propose creative and innovative approaches to develop the tourist market with a greater role for the commercial sector, and to assist the initiative of local communities in designing commercial packages to develop and market the tourist accommodation and facilities of their areas; and finally, make such other proposals as is thought necessary for the future commercial development of the industry.</P>
    <P>The tourism sector has proven its economic worth over the past five years in no uncertain terms and shown quite clearly how it can contribute to wealth and job creation.  With that in mind the task force are being asked to plot a strategy which builds on that achievement maintaining vibrancy and growth into the 21st century. The membership of the task force represents a broad spectrum, including product, marketing and commercial interests, most notably the commercial banks.  In fact, the banks have already agreed with the social partners to provide £15 million for preferential rate loans to small and medium sized business with employment potential and are prepared to consider other commercially based proposals which can contribute to economic growth and expansion.  I look forward to receiving the report of the task force in due course.</P>
    <P>Tourism is the principal reason for our participation in the international exhibition in Seville, Spain, this year for which the Government have committed £3.5 million of national lottery funds. That was my responsibility, incidentally, in my former portfolio and has now, through strange chance, reverted back to me.  Our main objective in going to Seville is to continue to raise Ireland's <Col N="513" /> profile on the world map as a tourism destination and as an ideal location for industry with the focus on our young, well educated population.</P>
    <P>The exhibition which runs from April to October this year has been billed as one of the most important events before we enter the new millennium.  It will not merely be a trade fair but a major cultural event which will provide a showcase for the best of Irish products, talent and culture. The cultural events of the programme will reflect the uniqueness, variety and creative quality of Irish talent and will include performances from Siamsa Tíre, the Gate Theatre, Dé Danann and the Chieftains, to name a few.</P>
    <P>All in all, 1992 should be an exciting year for our tourism industry.  Already preliminary indications suggest that we can expect significant recovery this year and a return to double digit growth is very much a realistic goal.  All the achievements to date have been brought about by the co-ordinated activities and efforts of all sectors and players in our tourism industry, big and small, and they are all being asked to row in behind the national effort again this year to enable us get back on target.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to express my thanks to the Seanad and, in particular, to Senator Mooney for affording me my first opportunity since my appointment as Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications to speak to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  As I have said, I am delighted that opportunity presented itself in Seanad Éireann.</P>

      <P>I am thankful to whoever has given me the precious time. In <i>The Irish Times</i> last Saturday there was an interesting article, in the context of our debate this evening, in which a report was carried of a conference in San Francisco where various members of the Irish tourist trade and US tour operators got together and assessed the prospects for the forthcoming season.  The bottom line was a guarded optimism.  One of the problems worrying the people in the trade is direct access and the fact that, for example, in 1990 the number of visitors who travelled directly from the United States to Ireland was 215,000, while the number who came via Britain was 219,000.  In other words, more tourists came via Britain.  Those who come via Britain stay only a relatively short period compared to those who come direct.  This raises the problem of direct access and indicates beyond doubt that Shannon is a nettle which has to be grasped.  I was interested that the Minister, very diplomatically, dodged grasping the nettle &mdash; just for the moment&mdash; when she said that the matter would be discussed and there would be consultations. However she stopped short of saying that the indirect flight in its present form will be retained.  What I am suggesting is that there surely must be a compromise which could safeguard the interests of Shannon and the mid-west and at the same time accommodate these very pressing problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not have time to put forward my own views except to mention my own pet promotion.  This is really for Bord Fáilte rather than for the Minister to take on board.  It is the relatively undeveloped state of walking holidays in Ireland.  We have a splendid network of roads; we have relatively unimpeded country areas, <Col N="515" /> unfortunately because of emigration but we should make the best we can of this. We really have not got around to attracting the continental tourists who, above all, would be interested in the prospect of walking holidays, which are independent, for the most part, of seasonal change.  In fact, over this fine winter it was almost possible to walk four days out of five.  This is something which would appeal to those who are of a certain vintage and who are no longer able to race up the hills.</P>
    <P>Last week, Senator Ryan philosophically discoursed on tourism and suggested that he was not too happy about it.  I understand in a way the dangers of tourism to the morale and dignity of the people.  He also mentioned the situation in parts of Africa and Asia where the local people are made to prostitute their dignity in order to entertain the tourists. It has been said, &ldquo;tourism corrupts, absolute tourism corrupts absolutely&rdquo;.  I do not entirely agree with the full principle there because if you take it that far you would discourage people from going anywhere.  I am not saying that Senator Ryan is guilty of this but there is a kind of person in Ireland who wants to preserve Gaeltacht areas for themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">

      <P>No, no.  I have always been a tourism man.  I am not clear from the Minister's speech that steps are being taken to do this, but I would like to see the fruits of tourism go to those who supply the muscles, nerves and sinews of the tourism industry.  I am not happy that that is so.  I suspect that the people who do well out of tourism are those who own the resources of restaurants and hotels and public houses, not those who work in them.  I am worried about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sa deireadh thiar thall, a Chathaoirligh, ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil anáthas orm go bhfuil an post nua faighte ag an Aire.  Tréaslaím a gradam nua léi, <Col N="516" /> agus tá súil agam go mbeidh gach rath uirthi sna blianta atá le teacht.</P>

      <P>I was trying to search for words, to laud the newly appointed Minister and to rise above mere mediocrity, having listened to my colleagues here.  I was thinking of singing &ldquo;Lovely Leitrim&rdquo; followed by a bar of &ldquo;Galway Bay&rdquo;, in which I am sure my colleague, Senator Murphy, would, not only have joined in, but would have led the assembled chorus in his own inimitable fashion.  However, all I can think of is that the Taoiseach has been imaginative in his appointment of someone who is both dynamic and innovative. I could think of many other plaudits but I think I will leave it at.  I am sure the Minister will get the drift of what I am saying.  I think it is an imaginative and significant appointment for someone&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Do you mean to tell me that you are interrupting me in full flow when I am praising my Minister?  I am deeply disappointed.  I want to pay tribute to the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Séamus Brennan, who also brought his own inimitable style to this very important portfolio and who was always readily available to come to this House and expound and explain Government policy in the area of tourism.  I have no doubt from listening to the Minister's speech that many of the intiatives taken by Minister Brennan will be carried on by her and given her inimitable stamp as well, particularly in the area of dispute that has arisen over Shannon.  I am particularly pleased the Minister has taken an early initiative on this matter which has obviously cause great concern to the people of the mid-west region.</P>
      <P>I presume Shannon is on the agenda because of the competition in the battle of the airways.  As someone who comes from County Leitrim and who has found that the Shannon dispute has not impacted to the same extent in my part of the country I hope the Minister will also consider the cases of Cork and Knock airports in the context of any changes or any proposals that will be made that might impact on Shannon's current status.</P>
      <P>I have been watching this dispute with growing concern in regard to both sides of the argument and I stay neutral on it, although coming as I do from the west I would have a preference for the <i>status quo.</i> I look forward to the Minister's progress in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the future well-being of the tourism industry in this country will rely, certainly in the short and medium term, to a great extent, on how well we are able to sell our case with our European partners.  I would like to add my voice to that.  The impact of structural funding on the Irish tourism market cannot be under-estimated and all sides of the House have acknowledged this in one way or another.  The Minister has highlighted the matter.  If one is to believe the current speculation in relation to the possible increase in Structural Funds as <Col N="518" /> a result of Maastricht, I could not think of a better Minister, with her vast experience of European affairs, to fight the case in the debate in this area over the next 12 months for an increase in Structural Funds as it affects her portfolio.</P>
    <P>While referring to structural funding, I would like to acknowledge and welcome the recent decision of the Government to agree finally to the reopening of the Lough Allen Canal.  In tandem with the magnificent work on the Ballinamore/Ballyconnell canal, by the mid-nineties, this will result in one of the most impressive waterways not only in these islands but throughout Europe. Ballinamore/Ballyconnell will link the Erne waterway with the Shannon.  The reopening of the remainder of the Lough Allen Canal will open up for the first time in almost 60 years the entire Shannon waterway literally from the Shannon source in the Cuilcagh Mountains down to Lough Allen and all the way to the Shannon Estuary.  The impact economically and socially this will have on my part of the country cannot be over estimated and I must publicly pay tribute to all those both at national political level and local community level who have been lobbying so strongly for this project to be completed.</P>
    <P>This was a dream, an aspiration, some 30 odd years ago and I cannot allow the occasion to pass without mentioning the initiatives taken by my late father, the former Senator Mooney, in this regard. I am particularly pleased Minister Geoghegan-Quinn, coming as she does from the west of Ireland, and with great awareness and consciousness of the real needs of the region, is in office at a time when this project is coming on stream and I hope that when the reopening takes place in the next 18 months to two years, she will be to the fore, perhaps in the leading boat down Lough Allen towards the Shannon.</P>
    <P>Staying with the theme of Europe and Structural Funds, I emphasise to the Minister the importance of progress towards tax harmonisation.  In the context of tourism and of attracting substantial tourist numbers to this country, <Col N="519" /> particularly from continental Europe, we need to get our act together.  Notwithstanding the economic difficulties we face, as the Minister pointed out in her speech, it is vital that we move as rapidly as economic conditions allow, towards tax harmonisation.  Those of us who saw photographs in the newspapers this morning of the amount of duty-free liquor and cigarettes one can now take into this country under recent European legislation, cannot help but be concerned that unless we harmonise in that area our whole economy my find itself in greater difficulties.  It seems to me it is integration by stealth.  There are areas in European cohesion and integration where, unless we have a vigilant Government, some of the measures being suggested at European level may not always be in our best interests.  We would need to be, and I have no doubt will be, vigilant, specifically as regards liquor.  The exicse duty on wine for example is substantially higher than that of our European partners.</P>
    <P>As the Minister coincidentally holds not only the brief for tourism but also for communications, I would like to suggest the possibility of investigating whether it would be viable to establish a shortwave radio service to highlight, promote and market and image of Ireland.  My understanding from discussions, informally, with colleagues in RTE is that, technically, this is possible and would not be very difficult to set up.  What I have in mind is that the programmes which would go out on this network would promote Ireland, the image of Ireland, the culture of Ireland.  Senator Hederman tonight, and other speakers last week, spoke of the various parts of the world where Ireland has no profile at all.  I am only throwing it in as a matter for debate but it might be worth pursuing and perhaps the Minister would request one of her experts in the Department to tease out the possibility of setting up such a shortwave service in conjunction with RTE.  It would have many benefits, not just in the tourism area.</P>
    <P>In the context of an increase in structural funding, I would welcome an <Col N="520" /> increase in European Regional Development Fund funding.  Senator McGowan earlier referred to areas in Donegal and he is the only colleague of mine here this evening who comes from a Border county.  He will testify to the tremendous impact that European Regional Development Fund funding has had on tourism in the Border counties over recent years. Without European Regional Development Fund funding it would not have been possible to have achieved many of the things we have done.  The bandwagon is now rolling in that area and I hope the Minister, being from the west and being so intimately aware of the disadvantages at infrastructural level that we have there, will press as hard as she can for continuing an increase in European Regional Development Fund funding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to welcome this very talented Minister.  I know she will do an excellent job.</P>
      <P>May I be parochial?  For the first time last year the Cork-Swansea ferry came into a profit situation.  We have a cash flow problem in terms of the operation of that service.  It brought in 135,000 persons last year and in excess of 30,000 cars. It is extremely important to the Cork-Kerry area and we would like the Minister to continue to renew the £500,000 loan to that service.  It is a lifeline to us in terms of tourism.</P>

Tá a fhios agam go dtuigeann bean as an taobh sin tíre na fadhbanna agus na buntáistí a bhaineann le cúrsaí turasóireachta, san iarthar go mórmhór, agus tá a fhios agam go n-éireoidh léi an jab a dhéanamh thar cionn.  Tá an t-uafás a ba mhaith liom a rá, ach níl an t-am agam chuige.  Ach díreach mar cheannlínte, sílim féin go gcaithfimid béim faoi leith a chur ar an turasóireacht chultúrtha; tá na deiseanna ansin ach níl an ghné sin forbartha chomh maith agus go bhféadfadh sé a bheith.

Mar cheann de na fadhbanna atá in áiteanna, go mórmhór snaháiteanna is faide amach - níl sé chomh dona sna bailte móra &mdash; go bhfuil séasúr an-ghearr turasóireachta ann faoi láthair. Rud eile go gcreidim go mba cheart díriú air ná na bealaí go bhféadfadh an earnáil phríobháideach agus an Stát a dhul i gcomhpháirtíocht maidir le forbairt a bhaineann le háiseanna seandálaíochta, seanachaisleáin agus mar sin de.

Caithfimid breathnú ar an gcomhshaol go ginearálta i gcomhthéacs na turasóireachta agus, b'fhéidir, beagainín níos mó airgid a chaitheamh air sin <Col N="522" /> le féachaint chuige go bhfuil an tír ag breathnú go maith do na turasóirí nuair a thagann siad anseo.</P>
    <P>Ar deireadh, arís déanaim comhghairdeas leis an Aire agus guím go n-éireoidh go maith léi sa jab sna blianta atá ag teacht.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him on his new appointment and wish him well.  We are delighted his first active duty is here with us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to join in congratulating the Minister on this very important portfolio and wish him a very successful term in office.  I join with the Cathaoirleach in welcoming him to the Seanad on his first official duty.  I am very glad that the Minister found time to come in and listen to my problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In County Donegal and in all Border counties a person is about a hundred times more likely to be stopped for a motoring offence than in any other part of the country.  For security reasons there are check points and that is acceptable and understandable.  I totally support the maintenance of check points.  They should continue.  However, my concern is that the motoring public in Border areas have had to live with them for over 20 years.  They have resulted in minor motoring offences coming to the surface daily, for example, in the area of tax, insurance, etc. I have kept some newspaper cuttings going back to 1984.  In general the penalty for these offences depends on the justice, the court, the number of hearings and the degree of the offence.  I am reluctant to imply that <Col N="523" /> judges do not always give fair play.  In one case a motorist was fined £25 for having no tax and broken number plates and in another the Probation Act was applied.  That was where the person had no insurance, had broken number plates back and front and the car had not been taxed for four years.  In another case a man was fined £150 for not having his car taxed.</P>
    <P>It has reached a stage where in my county, and I am sure in other Border counties, the gardaí phone each station to see if there are people to be brought to Mountjoy.  A van or minibus is organised to call at the station to collect those who are not in a position to pay fines of, say, £150 and they elect to serve five days in Mountjoy.  Recently, a family man was not in a position to pay a fine of £150.  He elected to go to Mountjoy and he was taken there in a station wagon with a large number of people.  I spoke to him on his return and he said it was awful. People were eating bags of crisps and chips and sleeping on the floor.  I estimated that the expense involved to the State in bringing people from Donegal to Mountjoy is about £1,000 per person taking into account security expenses, their stay in Mountjoy and their return to Donegal.  Yet, the amount of the fine involved is £150.</P>
    <P>The chance of being detected for a crime of this kind is a hundred times greater in Border counties than in the rest of Ireland.  It poses a serious problem and one that the Minister and his Department must look at as a matter of urgency. One can buy a secondhand motor car for about £500.  Car tax costs £250 and if one is a first time driver, insurance can cost anything up to £1,800.  The temptation for a motorist to buy an old banger and get on the road for £500 with no insurance or tax is very great.  The authorities must deal with this effectively.  There is a problem here and I ask the Minister to examine the possibility of dealing with it by way of on-the-spot fines or some other method.  I leave it to the good sense of the Minister and his Department to find a solution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="524" /> The law should be fairly administered. It may sound drastic but I would rather see the vehicle being confiscated and taken from the person.  The vehicle could be given back when the fine was paid. That would eliminate the problem of over-crowding in our prisons.  That may sound drastic but it is still better than the present system which is unworkable.  At present, people have to stand in queues outside the court.  I am sure that district justices would welcome any improvement in the system and I ask the Minister to look at this problem.</P>
    <P>The second part of the problem is that the courts are filled with this kind of offender.  Different justices deal with the offences in different ways.  I thank the Minister for coming to the House.  I know he is energetic and that he will tackle this problem.  I wish him good luck for the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to convey to the Cathaoirleach my congratulations on his appointment as Cathaoirleach of the Seanad.  It is a great honour.  He brings great skills and a great reputation to the office and I know he will bring honour to the office.  I would also like to express my thanks to Senator McGowan for the very kind words he and the Cathaoirleach expressed on my appointment as Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that it should be in this House that I make my first contribution in this, very important portfolio.  The opportunity to contribute to the deliberations of Seanad Éireann is always important and, as I said, it is interesting that it should be here that I make my first contribution as Aire Dlí agus Cirt.  I hope I will get many other opportunities to appear in this House.  I have always been very impressed by the consistently high standard of debate in the Upper House. As I start my tenure as Minister for Justice, I assure the Cathaoirleach of my support and my goodwill at all times for the very important work undertaken by all Members of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McGowan suggested that there is a problem with overcrowding in <Col N="525" /> our prisons and that that is being exacerbated by the number of persons serving custodial sentences in respect of what might be termed minor breaches of the Road Traffic Act.  It is very rare for a person to be sentenced to imprisonment for a minor traffic offence.  What happens on occasion is that persons found guilty of offences, which are in themselves relatively minor, have a fine imposed on them by the court.  If they do not pay the fine, they can end up serving a short term in prison in default of the payment.  The extent to which this happens is often overstated.</P>
    <P>On any given day there are approximately 2,200 persons in custody in the institutions operated by my Department. The institutions I refer to include prisons and places of detention, such as Wheatfield and the open centre at Loughan House, Shelton Abbey and Shangannagh. Within this daily population figure of about 2,200 no more than 40 persons, about 2 per cent of the total, would be in custody on any given day as a result of defaulting on the payment of fines imposed by the courts for traffic offences.  I am sure the House would agree that puts the issue in perspective.</P>
    <P>A further point that needs to be made is that in all cases the sentence is always a very short one &mdash; usually one, two or a few days.  Clearly offenders in this category are not a significant feature in the overall custodial accommodation equation. It could well be argued, however, that there are nevertheless 40 persons too many in the jails and that the spaces occupied by them would be far better utilised by other persons who have committed much more serious offences. Appealing as that argument might seem at face value, it is nonetheless flawed.  It should be borne in mind that custodial sentences are generally applied only as a last resort, after all other possible options, such as community based sanctions to which I will refer later, have been tried without success.  The courts take into account as far as possible the person's means when fixing the fine.  In many cases such persons are only sent to prison in the face of a refusal to pay a fine in <Col N="526" /> circumstances where the offender clearly has the means to pay.</P>
    <P>I referred to community based sanctions. Senator McGowan referred to them also and asked that they be considered more favourably in dealing with these kinds of cases.  It is important in the context of Senator McGowan's comments to look at them in a little more detail.  As I indicated at the outset, approximately 2,200 persons are in custody on any one day of the week; allied to this there are a further 3,200 persons on alternatives to custody.  These alternative sanctions include community service orders, probation, deferment of sentence and fines.  Non-custodial sanctions of this nature are an increasingly significant feature of the criminal justice system.  I will illustrate that point for Senator McGowan: the number of community service orders made by the courts increased from 698 in 1985 when the scheme started, to 1,349 in the first nine months of last year.</P>
    <P>I welcome that trend and I am very pleased that Senator McGowan referred to it in a supportive way also.  I am committed to ensuring it will continue on these lines during my tenure as Minister for Justice.  My Department are alive to the possibility of extending the scope of the community service order &mdash; I take it that is the thrust of Senator McGowan's proposal this evening.</P>
    <P>We are considering introducing a system of attachment of earnings to secure payment of fines.  Senator McGowan referred to this in a slightly different way &mdash; he mentioned the confiscation of vehicles but it really comes to the same thing.  However, we will actively consider that issue.  Any proposals which may emerge in that regard will be announced in the usual way and I hope to do something about it because 40 people are taking up spaces that could be utilised for more serious offenders, and that possibility should be minimised as much as possible.</P>
    <P>For the sake of completeness, it is fair that I should place on the record the principal developments which have taken place, and which are about to take place, <Col N="527" /> in relation to prison accommodation in general.  This will be of interest to Senators and to the House.  In this regard, the most recent addition to the capacity of the prison system was the opening of a place of detention at Wheatfield in June 1989.  Wheatfield has accommodation for 150 offenders.  Other projects in the pipeline include the provision of a new unit at Mount joy and the refurbishment of St. Patrick's Institution for young offenders which, when completed, will provide accommodation for an extra 400 offenders.  In fact, the total expenditure on the prison building programme since 1987 now amounts to about £31 million. It is not an insignificant sum when one takes into account the many other demands on the Exchequer since that time.</P>
    <P>No Minister for Justice has ever denied that there are accommodation problems in Irish prisons, and I do not deny it either.  The problems are there.  Money has been committed from scarce resources to try to deal with it but more <Col N="528" /> has to be done.  Some of the alternatives to custodial sentences that the Senator referred to will have to be pursued.  The House may be assured that there are no circumstances in which pressure of accommodation will be allowed to affect the ability of the prisons to retain in custody persons convicted of serious offences and who, if released, would be a danger to the community.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the Government are committed to providing sufficient accommodation for those given custodial sentences by the courts.  I intend to continue this policy and support the use, as the Senator recommended, of non-custodial sanctions such as I have outlined in appropriate cases.  I hope to be able to return to that matter in a more positive way in the not too distant future.</P>
