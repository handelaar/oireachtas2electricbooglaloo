      <P>I have notice from Senator Brendan Ryan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The attempt by the Minister for Energy to end the practice whereby ESB customers can pay for appliances through their ESB bills.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Norris of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to accede to the expressed wishes of Seanad Éireann and Dublin Corporation by making a substantial cash grant from lottery funding for the rebuilding of the Hirschfeld Centre in Dublin.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to make extra funding available through the Eastern Health Board for Wicklow community services.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Dardis of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to make provision for a <Col N="238" /> northern access road from the new motorway by-pass to the town of Kilcullen, County Kildare.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Ryan, Norris, Ross and Dardis as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected Senator Ryan's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Norris, Ross and Dardis may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business for today is item No. 1, the Patents Bill, 1991, Committee Stage, and whatever other Stages may be taken, depending on progress, but certainly Committee Stage for this afternoon until 6 p.m. and then Private Members' Motion 46 from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I would like to make a point about the current strike in RTE.  I do not think it would be helpful if the House went into a detailed discussion of the rights and wrongs of that strike but I think it is important that we place on record the strong sense of public anger and outrage that this strike should continue for so long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out that we had an Adjournment debate on that matter last week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, indeed.  I listened to it but I will not comment on the debate itself.  I think &mdash; and perhaps my colleagues behind might agree &mdash; that there are two sides to the story and we heard one put very well last week.  That is not the point.  After this strike has been settled &mdash; and hopefully it will be very soon &mdash; will the Acting Leader of the House make time available for a full discussion on the future of public service broadcasting? It is an issue which we should discuss in a calm way once this episode is over.</P>

      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos, ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Seanadóir nua do na binsí seo.  I would like to compliment the staff of the House on having so quickly put back the sixth chair, which we lost recently.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed.  I assure you that I will be much more careful in my next comments.  Will we need extra chairs or will we need a new location when the Government announce that the Shannon stopover will be abolished?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That has nothing to do with the Order of Business.  Has the Senator a query or question, please?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>You got votes on the west coast as well.  Do not forget that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I put that question to the Acting Leader of the House.  He could well lose some people.  It is important for us to note that the debate on Seanad reform continues today.  We should bring it to a conclusion very quickly in order that the recommendations are brought back into the House and that we see some change taking place along the lines that is indicated through consensus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not ordered today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I express my dismay at the events which took place in Belfast yesterday?  It was absolutely tragic and I hope nothing will be done by anybody now which would make things worse.  On that point, may I ask the Acting Leader what is the situation in relation to a debate being held in this House on Northern Ireland.  Secondly, is it possible to have a debate on industrial policy.  I am simply supporting the calls that come from a number of other Senators in this matter.  Finally, I would like to ask the Acting Leader of the House what the present situation is in relation to the <Col N="240" /> Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices (Amendment) Bill.  I raise this matter because I have had representations about it from a Member of the other House who is very anxious to know the present position of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis an Seanadóir Pól Ó Foighil faoi bheith in a bhall den ghrúpa Neamhspleách.</P>
      <P>I would like to congratulate Senator O Foighil.  It is particularly appropriate that he should so have swelled the percentage of Irish speakers to the extent in fact that the Independent group are now by far the most proficient group of Irish speakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>It has nothing to do with the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out also that in the exchange with Senator Ross we undoubtedly increased the level of English speaking in Fine Gael, so there is a kind of equivalence.</P>
      <P>With reference to the debate on the role of the Seanad, I support my colleague, Senator O'Toole.  We have had this debate for a very long time.  May I ask that the Acting Leader of the House will consider some response to the extremely inaccurate and damaging comments of Deputy Mitchell at the weekend, that no amendment of any significance has been inserted in recent years in Dáil legislation as a result of an initiative from the Seanad.  This, as the Cathaoirleach will know, is incorrect.  He said the Seanad is now as politicised as the Dáil and, therefore, useless.  Could the Leader of the Opposition perhaps indicate whether he thinks it honourable for Fine Gael to receive remuneration for doing nothing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to remind the Senator that it has nothing to do with the Order of Business.  It is not appropriate on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case I will turn to an issue that is appropriate and ask the <Col N="241" /> Acting Leader of the House if he has had time to ascertain the Government's response to the question of the Government's approach to the decision in the European Court case.  I have this morning received information from a Member of the Dáil containing a response to a question there.  I hope the Minister will be able to deal with that.  I am not going to put the matter to a vote at the moment as I think the Acting Leader is entitled to time on this.</P>
      <P>May I join with Senator Upton in his absolute condemnation of the appalling events in Belfast?  It is important that we condemn each outrage from whatever source it emanates.  This was a particularly tragic one.  May I ask that we take a debate on the North?  The Acting Leader will realise there are motions down on this subject, including one that has been put down by a number of the Independents, taking note with concern of the independent inquiry into the killing of Fergal Carraher?</P>

      <P>We do not want a speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just like to ask a question of the Acting Leader, through you, Sir, and if he cannot answer the question perhaps he might ascertain the situation for us.  What has become of the repeated assurances we got from the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications and also from the Government <i>vis-á-vis</i> Shannon Airport? Is there a change in the Government's position with regard to the status of Shannon Airport?  We have been assured repeatedly that there would be no change.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom freisin comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis an Seanadoír Pól Ó Foighil.  Ta an-áthas orm é a bheith linne.  Ní féidír leis bheith anseo inniu mar tá fliú air.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this is the start of a substantial move in this House towards the Independent benches.  The <i>raison d'être</i> of this Chamber is that there should be genuine <Col N="242" /> independent thinking without people having to kowtow to a party Whip.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>It has nothing to do with the Order of Business.  We are not allowing speeches on matters like that.  It is not appropriate to the Order of Business and I have so ruled on two occasions in the past ten minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>You are not allowing any comments about the change on the part of Senator Pól Ó Foighil to these benches?  I think that is most inappropriate, but I will bow to your ruling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I said. It is inappropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Níl le rá agamsa ach go bhfuil mé ar chomhaigne le mo chomhbaill sa ghrúpa Neamhspleách faoin gceist sin.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask you, Sir, to pursue through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges the remarks of a Member of the other House about this House. They were a complete breach of the conventions that exist.  I suppose it would not be inappropriate for me to point out that the only member of the Fine Gael Party who was actually congratulated by Young Fine Gael was a Member of this House, Senator Neville, on his action with regard to legislation on suicide.  Perhaps the Member in question would be advised to reflect on the activity of his colleagues in this House <i>vis-á-vis</i> the other House if he has anything to say.</P>
      <P>May I ask the Acting Leader, as I asked you, Sir, in a previous incarnation on many occasions if we can have a debate on the single biggest social problem this country has, which is not divorce or anything else, but which is unemployment and which gets lost in the welter of the liberal agenda and gets buried for months on end.  I would like us to have a long, open-ended, continuing debate on the issue of unemployment.  It is well beyond being an issue of ideology or indeed of party politics.  It is the biggest social problem in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="243" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Senator ask his question and leave it at that?  I am sure the Acting Leader will reply to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure he will.  May I simply ask him if we can have a debate on unemployment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House two questions.  First, will he ask the Minister for Justice to introduce the Criminal Evidence Bill, recently published, into this House?  It is a most appropriate Bill for this House and would be well teased out here.  It is a very important Bill.  I have called over a period of two years for the necessary changes in the law.</P>
      <P>My second question is to request the Acting Leader to ask the Minister for Justice when he hopes to introduce the Bill to decriminalise suicide and attempted suicide.  The Minister promised on 27 November that he would introduce such a Bill before Christmas.  We are now six weeks on from that date and we have no sign of a Bill to deal with the matter.  It is unfair to make such a promise.  I believed at the time the Minister was sincere in making that promise. I would like to get an indication from the Minister before he leaves his position, as to when he intends to introduce the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask if we have a Leader of the House or have we still an Acting Leader?</P>
      <P>In relation to Senator Ó Foighil&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we leave Senator Ó Foighil his independence?  It has nothing to do with the Order of Business. I have ruled on that three times already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>A misconception has arisen and I wanted to correct that misconception. There seemed to be a presumption that Senator Ó Foighil had not only left one party but that he was joining a grouping.  All the Senator has said&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Where he sits in the House is absolutely a matter for himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="244" />
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely wanted to correct the impression that was given from the backbenches here.</P>
      <P>In view of the terrible atrocity in Belfast yesterday, and indeed following on the other atrocity two weeks ago in Tyrone, we cannot really allow the situation to continue in this House without having an opportunity of putting on the record our view in relation to what is happening in Northern Ireland.  We have not had the opportunity to have a full debate on this issue and it is most appropriate that we should at this stage.  I ask the Acting Leader of the House if he would consider having such a debate at an early date.</P>
      <P>Finally, I think the remarks made by a Member of the other House were quite inappropriate.  It was certainly downgrading this House.  I would like that brought to the attention of the Member in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Senator to leave it at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to raise two issues with the Acting Leader of the House.  First, I would ask him to take very seriously the proposition by Senator Ryan &mdash; one which I raised myself previously some weeks ago when the present Cathaoirleach was Leader of the House &mdash; that there be a debate on unemployment. I will not elaborate on that. We all know the gravity of the issue.  I appeal to the Acting Leader of the House in that context to ask the Government to give more thought to taking on board the proposition by our party leader.  Deputy John Bruton, that a national jobs forum be put in place.  I appeal to the Acting Leader of the House to do that as a constructive positive step in relation to jobs.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I appeal to the Acting Leader to convey to the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications and the Minister for Labour the anxiety of my group in relation to the RTE strike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, Senator, it <Col N="245" /> is not appropriate to the Order of Business for today.  I indicated that previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>We are just requesting the Acting Leader of the House to convey to the Ministers that it is ironic that people in the communications business cannot sit down and solve their dispute. We are concerned about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the multiple tragedies yesterday in the North, we would like to join with those Senators who have called again today for an urgent debate on the North of Ireland.  I urge the Acting Leader to find time on our agenda as soon as possible to allow all sides of the House to have a well considered and balanced debate on the ongoing tragedy there.  I would also like us as a House to congratulate our President, Mary Robinson, on her visit to the North yesterday.</P>
      <P>I would like to support the remarks made by Senators Norris and Ryan in relation to a Member of the Lower House on his views on the Seanad given at the weekend and to say that this group does not support him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to be consistent and also say to you that it is not appropriate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but I think it is very important since this House was being badly reflected upon in the remarks.  He did not offer the views of Fine Gael.  The remarks were ill informed and unwarranted and we have asked our party leader to respond to the Fine Gael group on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House if it is Government policy to take decisions before the findings of a task force set up specifically to investigate an issue are made known.  I refer to the overflying of Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have to remind the Senator that it is not appropriate to the Order of Business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking a question about Government policy: if a task force is set up, do the Government respond before its findings are make known?  The other question is: now that we have a Cabinet in waiting, who has the collective responsibility regarding that decision when we are in this sort of limbo between a Cabinet and a Cabinet to be formed? On a positive note, I would like to congratulate the Minister for Defence for making an effort to remove a barrier for women in relation to access for women&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a spokesperson on women's affairs and there was never legislation on this matter in this House to which I could respond.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is extraordinary in relation to the fact that somebody has done something constructive.  It <Col N="247" /> shows the commitment of this House to women and women's affairs.  I am delighted with the action of the Minister and I hope other Ministers will work to remove any barriers that prevent women getting to the top of the Civil Service, particularly to the rank of Secretary.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Acting Leader to consider allowing a debate in relation to regional policy in the context of the west of Ireland.  In recent months the bishops have got together and have drawn a huge response to public opinion by massively attended meetings throughout the province of Connacht.  In a most apolitical sense there is alarm at what is happening in the west &mdash; depopulation, unemployment and all that goes with it &mdash; and dissatisfaction at the lack of a fundamental regional policy for the west in the context of our membership of the European Community. The Seanad could respond to public opinion in the west by agreeing to have a debate on that issue.</P>

      <P>I totally support Senator Staunton in that request.  I also lend my weight totally to a full discussion on public service broadcasting.  In fact, a <Col N="248" /> discussion on all broadcasting is necessary as a review of the legislation which came in 18 months ago.</P>

      <P>May I reply to Senator Manning first and say, yes, we would have no problem agreeing a time for a debate on public service broadcasting. Senators O'Toole and Norris mentioned Seanad reform.  It may well be, subject to the Whips, that we have had enough discussion on that issue.  As Senator O'Toole is aware, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges have made quite good progress and, hopefully, we can come back to the Seanad quite soon.</P>
      <P>In regard to Northern Ireland, I mentioned last week in reply that it would be my view that no issue should be outside debate in this House.  The former Leader, now Cathaoirleach, had made progress on that issue and I hope in the coming weeks we will be in a position to come forward with a more definite decision.</P>
      <P>In regard to a debate on industrial policy, it is Item No. 7 on the Order Paper.  I would link that with the views of several other Senators on unemployment. Perhaps we could deal with the more positive role of employment and perhaps the debate on industrial policy would be the way forward on that. Anybody outside seeking to create jobs would welcome a positive debate in this House on that issue.</P>
      <P>Most of the matters mentioned by Senators today are outside the ambit of the Order of Business.  Senator Neville mentioned a couple of Bills.  I will try to ascertain the position regarding the possibility of the Criminal Evidence Bill coming to the Seanad and I will also find out about the Suicide Bill.</P>
      <P>Senator Doyle mentioned President Robinson's visit to Belfast yesterday.  I would certainly like to be associated with her remarks regarding the success of that visit.  I hope it will lead to more positive thinking on all sides.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 are consequential on amendment No. 1 and all may be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection (1), lines 9 and 10, to delete the definition of &ldquo;the Court&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;the Court&rsquo; means the High Court or the Patents Circuit Court&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments provide for an amended definition of &ldquo;court&rdquo; in section 2, the definition section of the Bill, and for the establishment or setting up of a new Patents Circuit Court.  These amendments provide for the insertion of six new sections.  The new section 97 provides:</P>
      <P>(1) There shall be constituted a Patents Circuit Court.</P>
      <P>(2) The Patents Circuit Court shall have jurisdiction (its &lsquo;special jurisdiction&rsquo;) to hear and determine such description of proceedings&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) relating to patents, designs, or trademarks; or</P>
      <P>(b) ancillary to, or arising out of the same subject matter as, proceedings relating to patents, designs, or trademarks as may be specified in rules of court.</P>
      <P>(3) The Patents Circuit Court may entertain proceedings within its special jurisdiction notwithstanding that no pecuniary remedy is sought.</P>
      <P>(4) Nothing in this section shall be construed as affecting the ordinary jurisdiction of the Circuit Court.</P>
      <P>The new section 98 provides:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="250" /> (1) The Rules of the Circuit Court may provide for limits of amount or value in relation to any description of proceedings within the special jurisdiction of the Patents Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>(2) If a limit is imposed on the amount of a claim of any description and the plaintiff has a cause of action for more than that amount, he may abandon the excess; in which case the Patents Circuit Court shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine the action but the plaintiff may not recover more than that amount.</P>
    <P>(3) Where the court has jurisdiction to hear and determine an action by virtue of subsection (2), the judgment of the court in the action in full discharge of all demands in respect of the cause of action, and entry of the judgment shall be made accordingly.</P>
    <P>(4) If the parties agree, by a memorandum signed by them or by their respective solicitors or other agents, that the Patents Circuit Court shall have jurisdiction in any proceedings, that court shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine the proceedings notwithstanding any limit imposed under this section.</P>
    <P>The new section 99 provides that:</P>
    <P>In considering in relation to proceedings within the special jurisdiction of the Patents Circuit Court whether an order should be made transferring proceedings from or to the High Court, the court shall have regard to the financial position of the parties and may order the transfer of the proceedings to the Patents Circuit Court or, as the case may be, refrain from ordering their transfer to the High Court notwithstanding that the proceedings are likely to raise an important question of fact or law.</P>
    <P>The new section 100 provides:</P>
    <P>(1) Where an action is commenced in the High Court which could have been commenced in the Patents Circuit Court and in which a claim for a <Col N="251" /> pecuniary remedy is made, then, subject to the provisions of this section, if the plaintiff recovers less than the prescribed amount, he is not entitled to recover any more costs than those to which he would have been entitled if the action had been brought in the Patents Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>(2) For this purpose a plaintiff shall be treated as recovering the full amount recoverable in respect of his claim without regard to any deduction made in respect of matters not falling to be taken into account in determining whether the action could have been commenced in the Patents Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>(3) This section does not affect any question as to cost if it appears to the High Court that there was reasonable ground for supposing the amount recoverable in respect of the plaintiff's claim to be in excess of the prescribed amount.</P>
    <P>(4) The High Court, if satisfied that there was sufficient reason for bringing the action in the High Court, may make an order allowing the costs or any part of the costs on the High Court scale or on such one of the Patents Circuit Court scales as it may direct.</P>
    <P>The new section 101 provides:</P>
    <P>(1) The President of the Circuit Court shall nominate a person entitled to sit as a judge of the Circuit Court as the patents judge.</P>
    <P>(2) The Rules of the Circuit Court shall make provision for securing that, so far as is practicable and appropriate, proceedings within the special jurisdiction of the Patents Circuit Court are dealt with by the patents judge, and</P>
    <P>(3) The Rules of the Circuit Court shall make provision empowering a Patents Circuit Court in proceedings within its special jurisdiction, on or without the application of any party&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) to appoint scientific advisers or assessors to assist the court, or</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="252" /> (b) to order the Controller to inquire into and report on any question of fact or opinion.</P>
    <P>(4) Where the court exercises either of those powers on the application of a party, the remuneration or fees payable to the Controller shall be at such rate as may be determined in accordance with the rules of the Circuit Court and shall be costs of the proceedings unless otherwise ordered by the judge.</P>
    <P>Section 102 provides:</P>
    <P>(1) a registered patent agent may do, in or in connection with proceedings in the Patents Circuit Court which are within the special jurisdiction of that court, anything which a solicitor might do.</P>
    <P>(2) The President of the Circuit Court may by regulations provide that the right conferred by subsection (1) shall be subject to such conditions and restriction as appear to the President of the Circuit Court to be necessary or expedient; and different provision may be made for different descriptions of proceedings.</P>
    <P>These provisions are modelled on section 287 and 292 of the United Kingdom Copyright Designs and Patents Act, 1988, which set up the Patents County Court in that country.  The argument put forward on the last occasion by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, when he introduced the Bill on Second Stage that there were not sufficient patent actions to justify such a special court is not valid.  The reason there are very few patent actions at the moment is because most small and medium-sized firms find the costs and delays which are inherent in High Court proceedings prohibitive.  If, as is proposed in these amendments, the court has jurisdiction to hear trademark matters as well as patent matters, then there would be a considerable workload.</P>
    <P>It has long been recognised and was emphasised in the United Kingdom White Paper on Intellectual Property and Innovation which was published in 1986 <Col N="253" /> that the benefits of an inellectual property system are seriously undermined if the associated legal machinery is too slow, too complicated and too expensive for many of the rights granted under the patents system to be enforced.  In the United Kingdom a committee was set up under the chairmanship of Sir Derek Outlon, Q.C. then Permanent Secretary to the Lord Chancellor, to consider proposals for the reform of the entire patent litigation aspect.  They recommended that patents jurisdiction be conferred on one or more of the county courts in parallel to the existing jurisdiction of the Patents Court which is part of the Chancery Division of the High Court in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the Oulton Committee were implemented in the Copyright Designs and Patents Act, 1988, and the first Patents County Court was set up at Wood Green Court complex in north London with a jurisdiction over patent and design matters for England and Wales.  That is the type of model I would like the Minister to consider.</P>
    <P>The new courts procedure is specially adapted for patent and design cases but it remains much simpler than High Court procedure.  The parties are required to exchange written statements of the case setting out fully the facts, matters and arguments relied upon.  The papers in the case including the parties' request for directions concerning the further progress of the action are considered by the judge and they are discussed by him with the parties representatives relatively informally and in private.  Preparations for trial, which may include the obtaining of technical reports from the United Kingdom Patents Office are then made under the control of the court, the object being to see that justice is done to the cases of both parties with the minimum expenditure of time and money.</P>
    <P>In many cases, the informed preliminary consideration by the judge may be expected to help the parties to settle their disputes without the matter proceeding in any great detail if possible.  If the case goes later to trial, the thorough but cost-effective preparation should <Col N="254" /> enable the hearing of witnesses and arguments to be concentrated in a shorter period and with the participation of fewer professional representatives and legal advisers, etc.  than normally are required in High Court actions.  I am making a case against the over-involvement of solicitors and barristers in these cases and for cutting down on remuneration that many barristers would like to get.</P>
    <P>Registered patent agents normally have a right of audience before the new Patents Circuit Court and they can speak before the court on complex and technical matters.  That is a real benefit.  The benefits and success of the new Patents County Court &mdash; it is a single court &mdash; have been well pinpointed in a recent article entitled <i>The British Patents County Court</i> which was published in the newsletter of the European Practitioners in Industrial Property.  That article makes the following salient points as far as I am concerned in regard to the whole question of delay and costs.  First, while there has been very little criticism on the quality of the judgments provided by the High Court, nevertheless there has been unease at the time and money involved in litigation and at the fact that many small and medium-sized enterprises are very reluctant to even contemplate patent litigation.</P>
    <P>Most of the Senators who spoke here on the last occasion when this matter was discussed, and in particular Senator McCarthy when he spoke last week, made a very strong case for the small and medium-sized enterprise.  I support that. That is one of the reasons I suggest the establishment of a court which would ease the technicalities and so on associated with litigation.</P>
    <P>Secondly, in September 1990 &mdash; we are talking in relatively new terms as far as the UK is concerned &mdash; a new court opened in north London called the Patents County Court &mdash; our equivalent would be the Circuit Court &mdash; which has been able to hear cases dealing with patents and/or designs.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, it has jurisdiction extending over the whole of England and Wales and is able to provide all of the orders <Col N="255" /> and injunctions that are available in the High Court.  I suggest again that there should be no trouble at all, as far as I can see, in conjunction with the president of the appropriate courts, in setting up such courts fairly quickly.  It should be feasible and possible to do so.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, the Patents County Court has a specialist patents judge.  This is one of the great benefits of this court.  The first such judge was His Honour Judge Peter Ford who started his professional life as a barrister at the Patent Bar in the United Kingdom dealing with many of the intellectual property cases and was subsequently Chairman of the Legal Board of Appeal at the European Patent Office in Munich.</P>
    <P>Fifthly, the new court operates under rules which are closely based on the ordinary county court rules, these rules establishing a procedure which has been found in practice to be swifter, more flexible and less formal than the High Court procedure and which has also been found &mdash; and this is most important &mdash; to lead to considerable cost saving.</P>
    <P>I have spoken at length on this because I am dealing with six amendments.  I am aware that these amendments were tabled yesterday but I have been working on the matter since last week and I appreciate that the Minister may want to look further at the matter.  I urge him to accept these amendments.  As far as we are concerned, we would like to see the best legislation we can possibly achieve leave the House.  There are no partisan or political points to be made here today. I assure the Minister of our full co-operation in ensuring that this Bill is the best possible measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Leyden) Terry Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Cathaoirleach on his appointment and wish him good luck.  I wish to place on record my appreciation to his predecessor, Senator Doherty, my constituency colleague, for his work.  I know the Cathaoirleach will share with me regret at his departure at this stage and at the circumstances which led to <Col N="256" /> that.  I wish the Chair long life and best wishes in his important role as Cathaoirleach of this very important House.</P>
      <P>I refer to the amendments put down by Senator Kennedy and restate the views put forward by my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, with which I fully concur.  During the debate last week the Minister said he rejected the proposal. He pointed out that the Bill as it stands provides certain jurisdiction for the Circuit Court in regard to infringement proceedings involving short term patents.  He went on to say that this should help to reduce the cost of litigation in those cases as he assumes the cost to small inventors holding short term patents would be less than if litigation were before the High Court.  He also pointed out that, in practice, certain judges for the most part hear certain types of cases, including patent cases.  He concluded by saying that there was not in any event in this country at the moment a sufficient burden of litigation to warrant any separate court being specially created to handle it.  I do not think it would be our responsibility as such to set up such a court.  That would be a matter for the Minister for Justice. It would require a considerable amount of discussion with the Attorney General and the Department of Justice before such a court, if it were agreed, could be established as proposed by Senator Kennedy.</P>
      <P>About 1.5 per cent of all the patents granted are granted to Irish inventors and firms.  To say that we would facilitate Irish inventors would not be accurate because only 1.5 per cent of them would apply. Therefore, it would be foreign patent holders who would have a greater interest in defending the patents before a court. In any event the volume of litigation is negligible so it would not be practical at this stage to set up such a court.  We are giving jurisdiction to the Circuit Court in short term patent litigation.  This will have a favourable effect on costs for small patent holders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Senator Kennedy for putting forward this concept.  It may arise in the <Col N="257" /> future but it depends on the demand in relation to patents.  It is our intention to set up a separate patents office because there are considerable delays at the moment, through no fault of the staff who are doing tremendous work.  The volume of work has increased considerably over the years.  There is tremendous demand for the establishment of a separate office.  From a financial point of view, it would be quite justified to set up a separate company to organise the patents area.  It may be that in the future there will be need for a separate patents court but at this stage we are quite clear about our position.</P>
    <P>We are not refusing the amendment for the sake of refusing.  Senator Kennedy put forward a well argued case in relation to this but my arguments are stronger as only 1.5 per cent of all the patents issued are issued to Irish inventors.  That would not justify the cost involved in setting up such a court system.  Senator Kennedy would agree that by bringing the Circuit Court into this area we have reduced the cost for Irish inventors and other inventors.  I regret I must reject the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the views expressed by the Minister that within the complexities of this Bill at this point everything is being done to accommodate small inventors who apply for patents. As I said on Second Stage, this is very important because many people were prohibited from applying in the past because they did not have a surplus of money.  They are now being accommodated within this structure.  As the Minister has very appropriately pointed out, only 1.5 per cent of applicants for patents are Irish.  I am sure it would be costly to provide a special patents court at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his response but I am disappointed he did not advert to many of the points I made. Basically, what I have advocated is the setting up of a low cost litigation court. That would have many benefits for the small and medium-sized enterprises <Col N="258" /> Senator McCarthy talked about.  It is also important that we encourage innovation and inventiveness among our community. The Minister said there is only a tiny percentage of Irish applicants and so on.  It has been adverted to by various industrialists in recent times, especially by Mr. T.P. Hardiman, that there is a low level of inventiveness in this country and in regard to applications for patents and so on.  I hope that in the future, with our highly educated younger generation, that will change.</P>
      <P>We need at least one judge in the country who knows and specialises in that area.  I must press my amendment.  The Minister said that the time may arise in the future when he may be able to consider this proposal in more detail but because of the response and lack of analysis of what I put forward I will press the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the points put forward, but most of them will be allowed for in the courts because there will be certain specialisation in the courts. The president would allocate a particular judge to an area like this, and that would be taken into account.  Some time ago we advocated the setting up of a small claims court.  That is coming into being now. I will not pre-judge the future in this regard.</P>
      <P>The points raised by Senator Kennedy will be taken on board by me and my Department for future reference but at this stage we could not justify it.  There has been an increase in the number of enterprising young people putting forward applications for inventions.  We encourage them.  We do not have a background of putting forward inventions. Since I took over responsibility for trade and marketing, I have seen some interesting proposals but the people felt their ideas were not good enough to look for a patent.  I advocate that anyone who has an idea should apply for a patent and we are making the task much easier in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is important legislation which will assist young patent holders.  It will assist patent applicants to have their patents <Col N="259" /> accepted in a simpler and quicker way then was the case in the past.  We have many people of talent but, unfortunately, we have an inferiority complex as far as the quality of some of our ideas is concerned.  Inventions should be patented to give protection to those who go to the trouble of working on original ideas.  I regret I am not in a position to accept the amendment.  It is unnecessary and it would not be cost effective to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Without being directly concerned with Senator Kennedy's amendment which is probably not necessary for the reasons I stated, no court can be set up without incurring costs.  The Patents Office is one of the few State offices which makes a profit and has done so in spite of the difficulties it encountered. We must give the credit for that to the Controller of Patents, Mr. Fitzpatrick, whose performance has been outstanding.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister might bear in mind that the improvement of computerisation in the Patents Office is important and that improvement of the library facilities is absolutely vital.  It is crazy that small inventors must fly to London at enormous cost and use the library facilities there simply because they are not available here.  This office makes money.  I suggest that the Minister might bear three things in mind: improve computerisation of the Patents Office; improve the library facilities and improve the staffing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with Senator McCarthy in relation to his appreciation of Mr. Fitzpatrick and his work as the Controller and Patent Officer.  The points the Senator made are extremely good.  In most cases the information is available. There may be cases where more technical information is required but the advent of computerisation and the development of the Patents Office should make this more readily available.  This Bill will be the basis for the development of a highly efficient Patents Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="260" /> The points made by the Senator are taken.  Unfortunately there is a major backlog of patents at the moment which will not be cleared unless the office is freed from direct departmental responsibility. It is paying its way but it could be more profitable if it were a separate office.  The Senator's knowledge of the subject as a former Minister in the area of science and technology is quite evident from the views expressed here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The horse has bolted, in a sense, but I would like to express my regret that we did not do enough to have the European Patent Office located in Dublin.  It would have made so much money for Ireland.  It would have been of enormous benefit.  We would have had applicants for patents from all over the world coming to Dublin.  I do not believe we did enough and, as much as anyone else, I was derelict in my duties in that regard.  The European Patent Office is now based in Munich.  I have nothing against Germany but they have done extremely well out of the European Community. I suggest to the Minister that we might try strongly to have the Trademark Office located here.</P>

      <P>I cannot let the occasion pass without agreeing with my colleague Senator McCarthy.  I agree that big changes will have to be made in the Patents Office in regard to library and computer services and to the question of staffing.</P>
      <P>The Minister made an interesting point.  A very tiny percentage of the applicants are Irish.  I hope that for the future that there will be a great sense of inventivness among our young people. Computers are part of the daily life of young people in school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="261" /> Senator McCarthy is totally unrealistic when he suggested there was any chance of the European Patent Office coming to Dublin.  We deal with some 4,500 applications in this country every year.  The London Patent Office deals with 30,000 applications every year.  If it had not gone to Munich it would probably have gone to London or some other place.  It is completely parochial to imagine that the European Commission and the Community would say the Patents Office should come to Dublin because it would create jobs.  We all know it will create spin-off services, extra jobs and investment and so on.  Perhaps the Senator thinks there is a case to be made in regard to the Trademark Office, but I do not think that is realistic either.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Minister to accept a fairly low cost-effective measure here in regard to litigation.  He is not in a position to accept it on this occasion but I think there may be another occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to what Senator Kennedy said apropos the European Patent Office, at a Ministerial Council meeting when we were debating the matter, and which I attended as Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce, there was almost a consensus around the table that the English language was the industrial language of the world.  Even our colleagues from the then Federal Republic of Germany appeared to accept it as did our Greek and Spanish friends.  The then Secretary for Industry, Raphael Clarke, suggested that in view of this fact the only and proper place for the Office should be London.  I pointed out that we had not got any of these great spoils from Europe and that if we were making an issue of the English language being the industrial language of the world, the best English in the world was spoken in Ireland and Dublin was the appropriate place for the office to be located.  I felt I had the support of some of our friends at that time but obviously the Germans hijacked it in due course.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in his reply to Senator Kennedy, said patent numbers in future would be greater in Ireland.  You have to be very near to the subject of this Bill to know what it is about.  I ask the Minister, in the interests of the young people about whom he is concerned, who will use this legislation in the years ahead, to ensure the Department publicise it adequately.</P>

      <P>With regard to the points raised by Senator McCarthy in relation to the Community Trademark Office, I am aware that Senator McCarthy, as Minister for Science and Technology, very much supported the establishment of such an office in Ireland and fought a very strong case.  He cannot take any blame for the location of the European Patent Office, which was actually established in 1976, in Munich.  The Senator has been unfair on himself because I know he put a very strong case at the Council meeting.  It is a difficult task &mdash; as Senator Kennedy rightly said &mdash; to try to locate an office here but Senator McCarthy put forward a very strong case for the establishment of the office in Ireland.  We are continuing and will continue that representation in the European Council of Ministers.</P>
      <P>I want to express my appreciation to Senator Honan for her contribution to the debate.  She is quite correct on the question of making the Patents Office more accessible to young people and particularly to the regional colleges.  I will certainly bear in mind the necessity of making it more open and meaningful and of making information on how to go about getting patents available to those offices and colleges and to young people who would be interested in that matter.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 12, subsection (1), line 20, to delete &ldquo;susceptible&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;capable&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>While I do not wish to engage in a lengthy exercise in etymology, and while I agree fully that in formulating a new code we should follow as closely as possible the system set out in the European Patent Convention, it seems to me that the phrase &ldquo;capable of&rdquo; is more used in our laws and is more readily understood by the public than is the phrase &ldquo;susceptible of&rdquo;.  However, I must emphasise that the word &ldquo;capable&rdquo; is a synonym for the word &ldquo;susceptible&rdquo;.  Either would satisfy the requirements of the European Patent Convention.  I have a preference for the word &ldquo;capable&rdquo; and I, therefore, propose this amendment.  I would also like to add that &ldquo;capable&rdquo; is the word that has been enacted in British legislation.  They obviously decided not to opt for the word &ldquo;susceptible&rdquo; as contained in the European Patent Convention but to go for what is more generally acceptable in legal terms and as far as the public will be concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>We find no major difference between &ldquo;capable&rdquo; and &ldquo;susceptible&rdquo;. However section 9 (1), in its <Col N="265" /> entirety mirrors the corresponding provision of the Europen Patent Convention and is now almost universally regarded as the acceptable definition of a patentable invention.  We should stick, therefore, with a wording which is pretty well universally accepted.  The amendment is, therefore, not acceptable to me.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to put the matter to a vote, but the wording is not in fact universally accepted; it is not accepted by the British legislation.  This matter was debated at great length in the House of Lords where there are very accomplished and eminent patent barristers and judges, such as Lord Lloyd and so on, who are well known international experts in their field.  They opted for the word &ldquo;capable&rdquo;.  However, I will not press the amendment as I think there are more important amendments we can look at.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 15, lines 22 to 24, to delete subsection (3).</P>
      <P>Section 18 (3) provides that &ldquo;Every application shall be accompanied by the prescribed filing fee unless the Minister prescribes a later date by which such fee may be paid&rdquo;.  I believe that this subsection should be deleted because it runs counter to the practice throughout the world of not demanding fees upfront when an application is made for patent.</P>
      <P>The World Intellectual Property Organisation, WIPO, have published an applicant's guide to the Patent Convention Treaty, the PCT, in which they state that &ldquo;all fees can be paid within one month from the date of receipt of the international application by the receiving Office&rdquo;.  This means, in effect, that people who apply for a patent outside Ireland or to an international agency will not have to pay a fee until one month after the receipt of the application, whereas, in Ireland, the Government will now require applicants to accompany their applications with filing fees upfront. This requirement will hurt, in particular, the small person and the small enterprise whom we want to be innovative and inventive, and to register new patents, new inventions, etc.  I know the Minister will say there is a let-out in this subsection which adds &ldquo;unless the Minister prescribes a later date by which such fee may be paid&rdquo;.  However, the subsection is totally unnecessary and we should confirm with the guidelines that have been drawn up and endorsed by the World Intellectual Property Organisation.  In this matter I believe we are out of step with virtually all of Europe in demanding these moneys upfront.  I would, therefore, ask the Minister to consider this matter as a sign of his response to the very reasonable, commonsense amendments we have tabled here today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Under no circumstances would I accept this amendment.  We want to make this office self-sufficient and self-financing. With 4,500 applications per <Col N="267" /> annum, at £80 per application, about £360,000 revenue per year is involved.  I could not possibly go along with Senator Kennedy in this regard and accept an amendment which would deprive the new office, when it is re-established, of the possibility of being self-financing, leaving it in a position where it would run at a loss and become a net drain on the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>The fee required on application is also an indication of the seriousness of an application.  This is a very serious business and the fee is a simple requirement. The Senator's amendment would abolish the requirements to pay a fee upon filing application.  The filing fee is required to cover part of the cost of processing a patent application and we cannot forego it.  This amendment is therefore not acceptable.</P>
      <P>The whole idea is that a patents office must charge fees to cover the cost of the services it provides.  The two amendments proposed to section 23, like the amendment proposed to section 18, are again concerned with the suspension of the payment of a filing fee.  The proposed amendment are unacceptable since we cannot dispense with the requirement of charging a fee upon filing application.  We must live in the real world.  It is lovely to be able to put down an amendment which would relieve the applicants of the obligation to pay a fee of £80 and deprive the Exchequer of £360,000 but in my view this would result in the Patents Office being flooded with applications which would have no real likelihood of ever being suitable to be patented.  In the circumstances I have absolutely no wish to accept such an amendment and I could not do so.  This section gives the Minister powers in this regard and it is appropriate that this Minister and future Ministers should have power to change the cost of the fee at any time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is imperative that every State office, if possible, should to a degree be self-financing; I believe that to be the purpose of this filing fee.  The <Col N="268" /> other important and cogent point is that a filing fee will discourage frivolous applications. People could have a crazy project in mind and instead of just putting it into the waste paper basket they file an application for a patent to the Patents Office at no cost to themselves where in fact they should be certified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I am living in the real world.  To suggest that people who specialise in these areas and who make applications at European and international level are not living in the real world is unrealistic.  I would like to agree with the Minister and with Senator McCarthy that our own Patents Office should be self-financing as it is; over the years the Patents Office has not been a drain on public funds I must suggest to the Minister &mdash; this is the case Deputy O'Malley made on Second Stage here &mdash; that we endeavour to conform with international and European practice in these matters.  This provision is out of step with the guidelines issued by WIPO. I will quote briefly from where it asks: &ldquo;When are the fees due?&rdquo;.  We are talking about international applications under the Patent Co-operation Treaty. Very briefly, &ldquo;all fees can be paid within one month from the date of receipt of the international application by the receiving Office&rdquo;.  That is the only concession I require.  It states:</P>
      <P>In certain cases the designation fee part of the international fee can be paid after the expiration of that month.  The dates on which payments are deemed to have been received are determined by the receiving Office.  The latter applies the same rules as are applied in the case of payments for national applications.</P>
      <P>In rule 142 of the same guidelines it is stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the due date of the designation fee a distinction has to be made <Col N="269" /> between two cases: (i) where the international application does not contain a priority claim, the designation fee must be paid within one year from the date of receipt of the international application.</P>
    <P>Various concessions are available from leading international organisations dealing with patent applications.  The guidelines continue:</P>
    <P>(ii) Where the international application contains a priority claim the designation fee must be paid within one year from the priority date or within one month from the date of receipt of the international application if that month expires after the expiration of one year from the priority date.</P>
    <P>What I am suggesting here, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, is that by adopting this <Col N="270" /> provision we are placing ourselves out of touch with international and European practice.  By adopting this attitude the Minister and Government ensure that we remain out of touch with reality.  We are not putting forward the best ideas in the interest of patent applications as far as this country is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to restate my position.  In this situation our Exchequer requires the funding from the start.  I do not believe that the fee at present in operation would deter any applicant putting forward their case for a patent.  If a person felt strongly about their invention, this fee would not deter them.  To cut down on paperwork we believe this is proper procedure and I do not want to add to what I have stated already.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The general concept of a priority right in relation to an application is quite simple.  If, for instance, a British investor makes an application in Britain for a patent, he can make an application <Col N="272" /> in Ireland or in any other country which is a member of the Paris Convention at any time within 12 months of his British filing date and claim the priority of the British filing date in respect of his Irish application.  This means in effect that should more than one applicant apply to the Irish office for a patent for the same invention the applicant who can claim the earliest priority date is the one who will have the right to a patent for the invention. Subsection (1) makes provision to this effect.  It also provides that a claim to priority can exist in respect of a previously filed application in the Irish office.  This can be very useful where, for instance, an applicant might for some reason wish to abandon his earlier application and proceed within 12 months with a new one.  The right of priority will apply in respect of a prescribed period.  It is intended that this shall be 12 months for the previous filing and that conditions including payment of a fee can also be prescribed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (1) requires an applicant to make a declaration as to the earlier application whose priority he is claiming and to submit a copy of the previous application with translation of that application if it is in a foreign language. Under subsection (2) the priority of more than one previous application can be claimed even if the filings were in two different countries.  Any time limit for claiming priority will run from the earliest previously filed application.  The effect of subsections (3) and (4) is to establish that priority date of a prior application can only be relied upon to the extent that the subject matter of the Irish application is <Col N="273" /> of the same scope as the application whose priority is claimed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Under subsection (4) the Controller will request the applicant when sending him the copy of the search report to submit any amendment to the specification of the patent application which is called for in the light of the search report.  Amendments must be submitted within a prescribed period.  We added a Dáil amendment in that regard. The subsection as it appears in the Dáil Bill imposes the penalty of withdrawal of an application where the applicant did not respond to the Controller's invitation to carry out any necessary amendments in the light of the search report; thus the application would go dead.</P>
      <P>After publication of the Bill representations were made that this would be an unwarranted penalty to impose in the case where the applicant's failure to act was due to circumstances outside his control, like a postal strike, for instance. It has been decided, therefore, to substitute the penalty of withdrawal for a provision where the Controller may refuse application where the applicant failed to act.  This will keep the application alive because an applicant is entitled to request a hearing when the Controller proposes to refuse so that he has the opportunity to argue his case before the Controller.  This is the effect of the amendment we put forward in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <Col N="274" /> Section 30 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 20, before section 31, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;31.&mdash;Where an applicant makes the request provided for in section 29 (1), or submits as evidence under section 30 (1) (a) the results of a prescribed search, the Controller shall cause the patent application to be subjected to such examination as is necessary to determine whether the patent application complies with the requirements of the Act in the light of the search report, or the results of the search, as the case may be.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This reasonable amendment provides for a substantive examination where there is no corresponding European or British patent.  This is an important common sense amendment and should be accepted by the Minister.  What we are seeking is that in cases where the Irish patent specifications do not conform with the European or United Kingdom patent specifications a substantive technical examination should occur in the public interest.  There is a suggestion in this Bill which was confirmed here by Deputy O'Malley, Minister for Industry and Commerce, that a number of patents should be nodded through without examination by the professional examiners simply on the word of the Patent Controller. This may be satisfactory in many cases; however, there are cases of a technical nature where there should be a substantive examination by the professional examiners and where more than the Controller himself should be satisfied that the patent should go through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister no doubt will point to the large backlog of arrears in the Patents Office.  This seems to be the continuing scenario here &mdash; the backlog of arrears and so on.  Who was responsible for the backlog?  Who was responsible for the <Col N="275" /> curtailment of staff and so on?  There must be a better way of getting rid of this backlog.  It is not right for the Minister to throw the baby out with the bath water.  It is not right in endeavouring to get a quick resolution of an arrears problem and to remove the stockpile that has built up, that the Minister is unnecessarily lowering standards to be applied to future patents.</P>
    <P>Dealing with this important subject I adverted to similar legislation in the United Kingdom because I think it is appropriate that we should look at it. Unlike Senator McCarthy, I often draw inspiration from their legislation and I would hope that legislators throughout the world would draw inspiration from one another.  In dealing with that legislation in the United Kingdom the Lord Chancellor &mdash; I will quote two or three paragraphs from what he said regarding this important matter of the strength and validity of patents &mdash; stated during Committee Stage of their legislation on 24 January 1971:</P>
    <P>A major criticism of the present system is that the patents when granted do not carry a sufficiently high presumption of validity.  Patents of doubtful validity can often be recognised as of little value, but their existence causes uncertainty and can act as a deterrent to a manufacturer competing in the same field of technology who may not want to run the risk of being involved in expensive litigation.  This can bear hard on the small firm which, for reasons of expense, is less likely than the large firm to be in a position to evaluate the likelihood of its own patents or those of others being upheld, if challenged.</P>
    <P>The Lord Chancellor went on to say:</P>
    <P>This situation cannot be allowed to continue into the future when strong European and Community patents will be effective here.</P>
    <P>I would like to suggest to the Minister of State that the same situation prevails here, only it is far more serious, because <Col N="276" /> there is now substantive and technical examination carried out under the British legislation.  The Minister is suggesting the opposite here.  The Lord Chancellor continued:</P>
    <P>The answer to this problem is to strengthen the search and examination carried out by the Patent Office.</P>
    <P>The Minister is doing quite the opposite to the existing legislation.  He refers to sections 14 and 15 of that legislation. Under section 14 of their legislation the search is not limited, as was the case, to discovering documents which would destroy novelty.  It is extended to the discovery of documents which are of relevance in assessing inventive step.  We are adopting the European Patents Convention. We are talking about matters like industrial application, inventive step, novelty and so on, and we are, according to this legislation giving this over to the controller.  The Lord Chancellor concludes that their legislation represents a genuine, technical advance.  Under section 15, the subventive examination is extended to exclude the consideration of inventive steps.  He says:</P>
    <P>We believe that these two clauses should enhance the value of our patent system.  They are also backed up by other provisions; in particular the present limitations on the area of search are broadened.</P>
    <P>In the light of what is being said in these few paragraphs I would like to put it to the Minister that the same critical situation arises under this proposed legislation. A major criticism of the system which is being introduced in this Bill is that the patents when granted will not carry a sufficiently high presumption of validity and that the answer must be to strengthen search and examination carried out by the Patents Office in so far as difficult technical applications are concerned. It is a bad principle &mdash; and I share the views of my colleague in the Dáil, Deputy Barry &mdash; to write into legislation a flawed section which could well undermine the whole system on the basis, as <Col N="277" /> the Minister has repeatedly said, that an accumulated backlog needs to be cleared. The Controller of Patents, Trademarks and Designs has repeated over the years that this question of the backlog needed to be addressed.  The first solution he put forward was that staff needed to be augmented, that the resources needed to be improved rather than a curtailment. Of course, the opposite happened.  There is a real danger that patents will be passed by the Controller on a blanket basis without giving the minority of cases, technical cases, sufficient attention.  I urge the Minister, in the interests of having good legislation, to look at this matter.  I will be pressing this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is not acceptable.  An identical amendment was tabled on&mdash;Committee Stage in the Dáil. It would conflict with section 31 (1).  The proposed amendment seeks to impose examination duties on the Controller.  All that is required is that the applicant, in consultation with his patent agent, should put forward any amendments which may be required in the light of the search report established under section 29 (1) or the evidence submitted under section 31. In the circumstances it would be unnecessary and would be unhelpful to have an amendment as put forward by Senator Kennedy.</P>
      <P>We have given very careful consideration to the amendment.  It has given us an opportunity, having debated it in the Dáil, of having a detailed examination in the Seanad.  It gives us an opportunity to review our position.  I cannot accept the amendment.  When the applicant employs somebody who is technically qualified to evaluate and make any necessary amendments to the application, that is the proper procedure.  The amendment would be unhelpul to the smooth working of this legislation and, in the circumstances, I must reject it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">

      <P>During Second Stage I referred to the case of The State (Jacob Rajan and Others) <i>v.</i> the Minister for <Col N="278" /> Industry and Commerce and the Controller of Patents, Designs and Trademarks. That was an important case not alone from the point of view of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Controller of Patents, Designs and Trademarks but for that group of professional examiners who do such an excellent job in carrying out an examination of patent applications.  During the course of his judgment in that case Justice Barron referred to the fact that:</P>
      <P>Each member of the technical staff is recruited to the position of Examiner and each is academically highly qualified. They are university graduates either with postgraduate qualifications or research or industrial experience or both.</P>
      <P>It is most important that these professional examiners be given the widest scope to perform their undoubted obligations in the best traditions of their profession. They asked a question of the Controller and it is reported in the judgment of Justice Barron.  The examiners replied to the memorandum by a memorandum of their own, dated 17 January 1985.  This involved detailed comments on the Controller's memorandum and so on.  Two important questions were asked by the examiners.  They asked if the Controller &mdash; and I am asking the Minister &mdash; would indicate what changes in the examination practice that has hitherto pertained in regard to these matters will occur as a result of this legislation; and, secondly, if the Minister would indicate the nature of the duties of the professional examiners.</P>
      <P>This case raises important implications for us.  In that judgment Justice Barron referred to the fact that:</P>
      <P>The Controller is undoubtedly in charge, but this should not be confused with a right to direct officers to refrain from carrying out statutory functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that in the future there is a better relationship between the Controller and the professional and technical staff.  That <Col N="279" /> relationship between the professional staff and the Controller was indicated by Kingsmill Moore, J. in McLoughlin <i>v.</i> the Minister for Social Welfare, 1958 Irish Law Reports, where he says:</P>
    <P>It is common knowledge that professional men &mdash; architects, doctors, engineers &mdash; are employed in considerable numbers in Government Departments.  They are none the less civil servants, subject to civil service discipline and tradition.  They preserve also the traditions of their own profession.</P>
    <P>It is important for us to acknowledge that the corps of professional examiners have indeed adhered to a very fine tradition and I hope this legislation will not undermine the very fine work that is being carried out by the professional examiners. I would hate to see a situation, as is suggested here and as the High Court judge indicates, where if the directives and memoranda that were issued by the Controller in regard to most of these examiners were not challenged in the courts, then many of those examiners would have been made redundant &mdash; the word &ldquo;redundant&rdquo; is used by the judge &mdash; thereby, leaving the examiners with nothing to do.</P>
    <P>This amendment is important.  The Minister, Deputy O'Malley, indicated here previously that this was the purpose of the amendment.  I welcome the assurance given by the Minister here this morning that it is the purpose of the Government and the Department to set up the Patents Office as an independent, autonomous organisation and I look forward to that.  As far as I am concerned, the role of the professional examiners seems to be in a state of limbo and has not been clarified so far in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with Senator Kennedy in this case.  My ambition, and <Col N="280" /> indeed the ambition of my colleague, Minister O'Malley, is to make the Patents Office a very efficient organisation.  In regard to the case the Senator is referring to, it was rather unusual that a case of that nature was taken at that stage.  I am pleased to be in a position, with the support of the Seanad, to rectify the position that has resulted in a backlog of 20,000 applications at the moment.  The present powers of patent examiners will be changed in this legislation.  That is our ambition.  That is the decision of Minister O'Malley and myself.  We are very pleased to be in a position to put a Bill of this nature through the House in order to speed up the workings of the Patents Office.  It will allow the Controller to get on with his job without in any way being hindered by the situation that exists at the moment.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, all the applicants normally engage patent agents who are technically qualified to evaluate and make any necessary amendments to an application. Therefore, I do not think it is necessary for the patent examiners to carry this responsibility.  In these circumstances I am quite clear, as is my colleague, on the rationale behind this section and in no circumstances will I accept the amendment put forward by Senator Kennedy.  I will go further and say that I would not accept his arguments in this regard, because the situation is such at the moment that there are enormous delays and a backlog of work in that office.  I believe that this new legislation, and the proposals which my Department and the Government are considering for the setting up of a separate agency, will allow the Patents Office to improve their services to the public.  They will also be in a position of having very strong legislation to make the office more effective.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances I have to reject this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 35, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) In settling the terms of any licence referred to in subsection (2) the Controller&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) shall endeavour to secure the widest possible user of the invention in the State consistent with the proprietor deriving a reasonable advantage from his patent rights,</P>
      <P>(b) shall endeavour to secure to the proprietor the maximum advantage consistent with the invention being worked by the licensee at a reasonable profit in the State,</P>
      <P>(c) shall endeavour to secure equality of advantage among the several licensees, and for this purpose may, on due cause being shown, reduce the royalties or other payments accruing to the proprietor under any licence previously granted,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(d) may so frame the terms as to preclude the licensee from importing into the State any goods the importation of which, if made by persons other than the proprietor or those claiming under him, would be an <Col N="283" /> infringement of the patent, and in case such terms are so framed the proprietor and all licensees under the patent shall be deemed to have mutually covenanted against such importation.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is quite clear.  It reintroduces the desirable provisions in section 37 (3) of the existing patents legislation &mdash; the Patents Act, 1964.  I propose that these provisions be retained in the Bill because I do not believe it is desirable to have the matter of setting of fees and the terms of a licence, etc., decided by the Controller without general statutory guidelines and directions.  Statutory guidelines should be set down by the Houses of the Oireachtas and we should not allow the Controller to invent or make up those guidelines, however admirable and competent the Controller may be, as he goes along. These guidelines have been in operation for the past 27 years and the Controller issued licences always subject to them. The Minister will say, as he said in the Dáil, that this provision was rarely if ever used but that does not mean they are unnecessary because the Controller always took, and indeed was under statutory obligation to do so, cognisance of them before he issued a licence.</P>
    <P>This amendment is necessary to ensure that there is consistency in this matter over a long period.  It may be that one Controller will take a particular view over a period of years and another Controller may take a different view.</P>
    <P>It is for the Houses of the Oireachtas to set the guidelines.  These guidelines have operated over the past 27 years.  It is impossible to say they were rarely used because the Controller used them and he was under a statutory obligation to do so. I, therefore, urge the Minister to accept this amendment or to bring in his own amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is not acceptable.  An identical amendment tabled for Committee Stage in the Dáil <Col N="284" /> was rejected as it would conflict with section 21 (1).  The proposed amendment purports to impose examination duties on the Controller when all that it required is that the applicant, in consultation with his patent agent, should put forward any amendments which may be required.</P>
      <P>A very important point was put forward by Senator Kennedy.  Before adverting to the amendment, it is necessary to look at section 68.  The objective of this section is to enable a patent holder to in effect advertise the fact that he is willing to give a licence as of right under his patent and he can request the Controller to make an entry to that effect in the Patents Register.  When this is done, any third party is entitled as a right to a licence under the patent and only in default of agreement between the patentee and the third party may the terms of a licence be settled by the Controller. The situation is, therefore, very much one in which one might expect licence terms to be mutually agreed between the patent owner and a licensee.  If licences were not to be agreed, in most cases there would be no point in the patent owner asking for endorsement of the patent licences of right in the register in the first place.</P>
      <P>My difficulty with the new subsection which the amendment proposes to insert is that it is purports to lay down directions to be followed by the Controller in settling the terms of a licence which it seems to me the patent owner will find totally off-putting and, therefore, a disincentive to use this section at all.  The fact that some of the provisions are included in the present law does not change my mind.  The fact is that similar licences of right provisions exist in the present law and they are simply never utilised.  In my view, there is no point in having provisions of this sort unless they serve as a stimulus to industrial and commercial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking at elements of the amendment, I consider the directions proposed to be given to the Controller in settling the terms of licences to be extremely cumbersome.  The Controller is, for instance, required to secure the widest <Col N="285" /> possible user of the invention in the State in settling the terms of a licence but there is no guidance a to how the Controller is to do this.  Next, the Controller is obliged to secure the maximum advantage to the proprietor of the patent consistent with the licences working the invention at a reasonable profit.  How is one to reconcile these objectives without going into interminable detail and place such burdens on the Controller as are totally incompatible with the scarce resources available to him to perform his chief task, namely, the grant of patents, as effectively and efficiently as possible?  Next, the Controller is obliged to secure quality of advantage among the several licensees.  The Controller, for instance, is to engage consultants to determine how this objective is to be met.</P>
    <P>Another element of the amendment would authorise the Controller to frame <Col N="286" /> the terms of a licence and preclude a licensee from importing goods covered by the patent.  I do not think this criteria would stand up to scrutiny under the Treaty of Rome.  All in all, therefore, the matter should be left to the judgment of the Controller in each case as happens with other matters which he has to decide under the Bill.  Moreover, under section 70, which deals with the grant of compulsory licence by the Controller, no directions of the type proposed in the amendment are included in that section and it would be totally unbalanced to do so in section 68.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I can not possible accept the amendment for the very good reasons I have outlined in detail.  The amendment should be rejected by the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I do not have much detail on this area for Senator Kennedy.  Under subsection (1): a Minister may accept on behalf of the State an assignment of the whole of or share in any invention. Where he does so the Minister may do all or any of the matters specified in paragraphs (a) to (e) of subsection (1).  That gives the Minister considerable powers but it is also very useful on behalf of the State that the Minister would be in a position to have these powers in the Bill. It may raise in relation to an application for a patent or indeed in the development of a patent that the State, or the IDA on behalf of the State, may have an involvement in that regard.  It is a provision that may be required in the future.  In a sense we are endeavouring as far as possible to ensure that this Bill is very broad and will allow for situations that may arise in the future.  In the circumstances the Minister should be in a position to accept on behalf of the State an assignment of the whole of or a share in an invention.  For instance, an invention could be left to the State by an inventor and we would have to be in a position to accept it.  That is the main reasoning behind it.  The cost of developing a particular invention could be so costly that it would require State involvement.  If one thinks of State companies &mdash; the ESB, Telecom Éireann or Bord na Móna &mdash; there may be instances where they have to accept such an assignment. Generally speaking, the provision is useful and I am satisfied with it; I think Senator Kennedy is also satisfied that it should be there.</P>

      <P>I did not put down an amendment on this section but I might do so on Report Stage.  I raised the question with the Minister for Industry and Commerce on Second Stage regarding the rights of employee inventors.  The Minister indicated that no representations were made to his Department in this regard.  That may very well be true but surely employee inventors are entitled to some recognition and legal protection.  I suggest that the common law approach to employees who make useful inventions for which the employer may derive vast and substantial profits in our existing legislation is not fair or just to employee inventors.  We must be careful to strike a balance but it seems to me that in many cases the employer is in a very strong bargaining position while some employees may be in a very weak bargaining position.  I am surprised that Senators who are members of the Labour Party and those who might be regarded as having a social streak or be supporters of the broad left, did not table such an amendment in spite of the fact that I raised this matter on Committee Stage.  I am not a socialist or anything like it. It may be that these young, intelligent employees whose inventions subsequently are very beneficial to employers are not in a position to take up this matter with employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the legislation passed through the Houses of Parliament in the United Kingdom there was general welcome across the board for it.  The Conservative and Labour Members in the House of Lords welcomed it.  It seems strange that in a small country like ours we would not have some type of protection.  The common law is not sufficient, the way the common law is incorporated into the Patents Act, 1964, is not fair to employee inventors.  I am surprised that some Labour Party Senators who might be regarded as being on the left did not <Col N="289" /> advert to this.  Perhaps the Minister might say something on it now.</P>

      <P>The section confirms the legal status of a patent application and a patent.  There is a class of property referred to in the law of choses in action as opposed to physical property.  Applications for patents are nevertheless rights which can be assigned like property and on the basis of which the owner of the rights may sue for infringement.

      <P>&ldquo;(3) Provided that if in any circumstances he thinks it right so to do the Minister may authorise any person whom he considers suitable to act as a patent agent in a particular case or at a particular time.&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed amendment is identical to the one tabled in the Dáil on which there was a detailed <Col N="290" /> debate.  The amendment is not acceptable. The purpose of section 106 (3) is to enable the Minister to authorise from time to time suitably qualified persons, other than registered patent agents, to act on behalf of inventors in the filing of patent applications.  The person concerned would have to apply to the Minister and demonstrate his qualifications to undertake such work.  The amendment proposed by the Senator is misconceived in that, as drafted, it only allows the Minister to authorise people who are patent agents to act on behalf of others and thus the element of competition in this area of activity which is implicit in section 106 (3) would be removed.  This provision is one that should be very welcome to the general public.  It allows a person putting forward patent to engage a person who is suitably qualified.  That person will apply to the Minister and the Minister may or may not approve their application.  Basically, it ensures that the patent agents will not have a monopoly in this area.  I feel this is a welcome development.</P>
      <P>We also have to ensure that inventors only engage suitably qualified persons to put forward their applications for patents. In the circumstances it is not unreasonable that the Minister would have some say in this area.  Generally, all applications come through patent agents. This may be the case in the future also, because patent agents provide an excellent service for an inventor.  They take the burden of responsibility from the inventor who is not an expert in the area of obtaining a patent.  I would generally recommend that an inventor would go to a patent agent to ensure that the invention is patented as quickly as possible. The patent agent would also have qualifications and knowledge in relation to European and international patents.  In the circumstances I think it would be the desirable course.  It is the one I recommend to inventors to avoid the large volume of documentation and detailed work that goes into lodging an application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, in the case where a person is working in conjunction with <Col N="291" /> somebody else or is aware of a person who is suitably qualified to submit an application on their behalf, then under this provision the Minister may accept the application.  The Minister is in a position to accept the person's qualifications. For instance, if the invention is a drug, to my mind a suitably qualified chemist would be an appropriate, person to file an application.  There is no point in an inventor in that area getting a person who is not suitably qualified to submit their application.</P>
    <P>This type of provision is there to assist inventors.  Quite frankly, I do not think many situations will arise where there will be any conflict or difficulty.  I also feel that when a person is once accepted as being suitable, it would make their future applications quite unnecessary.  In the circumstances, for very solid and sound reasons I could not accept the amendment put forward by Senator Kennedy.</P>
    <P>I reiterate again that patent agents who are at present working in this country are very well qualified and provide an excellent service but we are not in favour, generally speaking, of monopolies and they have, basically, a monopoly at the moment.  This removes that monopoly and allows the Minister an opportunity <Col N="292" /> to approve an application from an agent or other person who puts it forward.  In the circumstances I feel this amendment would not be acceptable to myself or my colleague, Minister O'Malley.</P>

      <P>It is.  The Minister has indicated a number of criteria by which this legislation should be judged.  I agree basically with what he has just said.  It seems to me, however, that the amendment I am proposing would meet those criteria better than what the Minister has indiciated.  There is no question of a monopoly for the patent agents.  I would, however, like to pay tribute to the patent agents in this country for the excellence of their professional work in helping inventors, especially small inventors with their applications.  This is a very specialised and complicated area and the patent agents are doing an excellent job.  The Minister indicated this would only arise on very rare occasions.  My amendment would, in fact, meet that requirement. It would be in the public interest and, therefore, I am pressing the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann notes the increase in tourist revenue during 1991 and welcomes the Government's continuing commitment to the Irish tourist industry, as outlined in the recent budget initiatives.</P>
      <P>The importance of tourism to the Irish economy is well illustrated in the report recently commissioned by the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation which shows that over the past number of years tourism grew twice as fast as the national economy and that its share of GNP increased to almost 7 per cent.  Tourism revenues topped £1.5 billion in 1990 of which £1.1 billion was foreign exchange earnings.  In 1990 the Government raised over £400 million in tax revenue from tourism and the total number of full-time jobs supported by tourism was in excess of 80,000 for that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tourism now accounts for one in 14 of all jobs.  This sector is one of the few that offers clear opportunities for significant employment expansion in the future, mainly as a result of the Government's and especially the Minister's continuing commitment.  I wish to welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications who is with us for the debate this evening.  We are always pleased Deputy Lyons comes into the House for motions on tourism as he is now one of the most experienced <Col N="296" /> Ministers in this area.  I await his contribution to the debate with great interest as I am sure do all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the most recent statistics available, the three year period from 1988 to the end of 1990 &mdash; the period we are debating this evening &mdash; showed a spectacular and unprecedented growth in Irish tourism.  Again, I must pay tribute to the commitment of the Government from 1987 onwards which at last identified the tourist industry as absolutely vital to the future well being of the Irish economy.  For many years various lobby groups and tourism interests had stated that the Government of the day needed to quantify their commitment to tourism by bringing in all the various aspects of the industry under one umbrella.  Following the 1987 general election, the Government for the first time recognised the importance of tourism as an industry by appointing a Minister with a specific brief in that area.  It is now accepted that a Minister with responsibility for Tourism is a vital and important part of Government.</P>
    <P>Such is the general and widespread acceptance now of this status that one sometimes wonders why it was not initiated before now.  It was obvious the concentration of energies within one Department under a political head was going to benefit the tourism industry and the period under review has shown growth well in line with the target set by the Government.  For example, foreign tourist numbers grew by an average of 15 per cent per annum, more than twice the world average, while foreign revenue increased to over £1.1 billion.  It is also estimated that tourism has contributed an average of 5,000 new jobs every year since 1988, a tremendous achievement at a time of global recession and despite the Gulf War 12 months ago.  Last week the airline industry IATA stated that 1991 has been the worst year on record for the aviation industry.  They pointed directly to the global recession and to the aftermath of the Gulf War following which people were less inclined to travel abroad.</P>
    <P>Despite this glowing mid-term report <Col N="297" /> on the Irish tourism industry &mdash; the operational programme for tourism goes right through to 1993 &mdash; there is never room for complacency.  Last year serious problems were presented to the tourist industry not only in Ireland but internationally. Nevertheless, despite the prophets of doom and despite those who in late spring, in debating tourism in this House on the basis of the indicators of that time, said that Irish tourism was in for a bumpy ride at best and for a severe downturn at worst, I am pleased to say that the tourism industry responded magnificently to those challenges.</P>
    <P>Ireland performed better than originally anticipated.  For example, overseas tourist numbers were within 2.6 per cent of the 1990 record figures which was an achievement in itself.  Although there was no palpable increase in tourist numbers, there was a significant increase in tourist revenue, mainly as a result of the excellent marketing strategies carried out by Bord Fáilte.  They directed their considerable energies away from the United States &mdash; which by mid-spring last year was already showing signs of severe recession coupled with the natural reluctance of Americans to travel abroad in times of uncertainty generated by the Gulf War and its aftermath &mdash; and concentrated on mainland Europe to great effect.  That market continues to show strong growth.</P>
    <P>While overall British tourist numbers are down, there is evidence of a significant increase in pure holiday traffic from that market as distinct from the traditional ethnic market, the emigrant market.  The emigrant market has been of tremendous value to this country for decades.  It is not stated often enough in this House or outside how valuable a contribution our emigrants have made acting as unofficial ambassadors for Ireland, especially in Britain where Irish people have been under constant attack arising from the continuing appalling problems of violence affecting part of this island.</P>
    <P>As a former emigrant I was fortuante to spend most of my time in England prior to the current troubles in Northern <Col N="298" /> Ireland so I did not experience at first hand the level of prejudice and downright racism many of my Irish compatriots have experienced since the mid-seventies as a result of the IRA campaign.</P>
    <P>It is to their eternal credit that Irish people abroad, and particularly in England, have never lost their sense of identiy, their pride in being Irish, and have been able to convey this pride in themselves and their native country to such an extraordinary degree that British tourists with no Irish connections whatsoever come to this country on the basis of their personal relationships with Irish people in Britain.</P>
    <P>At the risk of sounding trivial, I want to emphasise the important role of a number of our leading entertainers, particularly in the United Kingdom, who have presented such a positive image of this island, not only in the material they record but in their manner on radio, televison and in concerts.  I am thinking particularly of Daniel O'Donnell, Foster and Allen and of the Furey Brothers and Davey Arthur, to name three from a particular sector of the music industry.  I also think of the tremendous contribution U2 have made and the Saw Doctors are now making.  These comments may be regarded by some as trivial in the context of a debate on tourism but that is a problem for those critics.  Those of us who operate between Britain and Ireland and who are strongly associated with emigrant groups in Britain can testify to the important work they are doing.  I note the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, Deputy Brennan, in launching a tourism task force yesterday in Dublin has included among it membership Mr. Chris de Burgh, the entertainer and Mr. Oliver Barry, the well known promotor and former head of Century Radio.  The Minister has obviously acknowledged the contribution the entertainment industry is making to promoting tourism in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Last year the home holiday market which is often overlooked also performed well.  Here, again, it is an expression of practical partriotism by Irish people to choose to spend their holdiays in Ireland. <Col N="299" /> I know the sand and sun of the Costa de Sol can appear very attractive to people in the depths of a grey Irish winter when they are planning their holidays, but it is to their credit that Irish people consciously take the decision to spend their holiday time and their money in Ireland and so make a contribution to the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>This expression of practical patriotism by the Irish people should evoke a more positive response from those invovled in the tourism market here.  One has only to look at the letters pages of the various national newspapers, particularly at this time when people are planning holdays, to read what others think of us.  Recently a German tourist spoke about his disappointment at part of County Kerry and made a very valid point among other points that I thought not so valid.  He referred to the amount of litter in a particular part of the south-west and could not understand why so many Irish supermarkets and retail outlets supplied bags free to shoppers which were then dumped in the nearest outlet rather than taken home.  He paralled that with the position in Germany where one has to pay for shopping bags.  He felt that if the Irish had to pay for their shopping bags they would not be so keen on throwing them around the countryside.  This is a small point but as those of you involved in the Tidy Towns Competition for many years will testify, adjudicators in all annual reports on various towns and villages say that the starting point for improving and enhancing a rural or urban environment must be the elimination of litter.  It is a valid point.</P>
    <P>Recent CSO statistics show that foreign tourism revenue for the first nine months of 1991 was up by almost 7 per cent on the corresponding period in 1990. That is the result of tremendous work carried out by Bord Fáilte and those in the tourist industry.  The facts speak for themselves and it really is a jumping off point, a platform for even greater achievement as the operational programme for tourism continues through to 1993.  It is this revenue that creates much <Col N="300" /> needed jobs in our economy and I hope this trend will at least be maintained when figures for the full year become available.  This performance provides evidence, if such were needed, that the Government's tourism policy in recent years was correct and the industry is better prepared to face external challenges than ever before.  This year will bring its own challenges and Bord Fáilte and the industry will be doing their utmost to get tourism back on target with a return to double digit growth for 1992.</P>
    <P>The budget will facilitate this effort. It is designed to stimulate employment generally and contains a number of measures to achieve this.  The significant easing of personal taxation in general impacts on costs which are particularly important in the labour-intensive tourism market.  Furthermore the decision by the Minister for Finance, despite the present economic difficulties, to avoid VAT increases on tourism related expenditure on hotel accommodation, meals and car hire and additional excise duties on alcohol should also pay dividends and has been welcomed by the industry.</P>
    <P>Specific problems were feared in the car hire sector this year.  All of us here will be familiar with stories in the media over the past few weeks about a potential crisis in the car hire industry here during the months of July and August, the fear being that there would not be sufficient numbers of cars available for hire at that peak time.  To counteract this fear the budget allocated £1 million to assist this strategically important sector.</P>
    <P>The reduction in excise duties in new cars and on petrol will also help.  It is sometimes forgotten that one of the main lobbying points being made by those in the tourism industry over the last number of years has been the relatively high cost of petrol <i>vis-a-vis</i> our European neighbours. One of the requests some years ago was that Ireland should introduce some form of coupons for tourists such was the high cost of petrol per gallon&mdash; being good Europeans we should refer to it in litres &mdash; in comparison with our European neighbours.  The Government <Col N="301" /> acted not only fairly but wisely in reducing the burden of excise duty on petrol. Some economists are suggesting that with the current global glut in the petrol market coupled with these imaginative initiatives in the recent budget the resulting decrease in the cost of petrol per gallon could be as much as 12p to 15p.</P>
    <P>These budget measures provide real assistance to meet the demand by tourists for hired cars this season and ensure that valuable revenue is not lost to the industry generally.  I do not think the House needs reminding of the sad development in Senator McKenna's county recently when one of the major players in the car hire market went into liquidation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Matters such as these have created fear in the marketplace that there will not be sufficient cars available.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to keep the House any longer but it is important that this motion be taken at this time, the beginning of yet another tourist year and in the aftermath of budget initiatives taken to protect the tourism industry.  Initiatives have been announced by the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications &mdash; and I presume the Minister of State, Deputy Lyons, will be devoting some time to the composition and terms of reference of the Tourism Task Force in his contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to those who are contemplating taking holidays this year, and one must always sadly remember that for some people in our society a holiday is an aspiration rather than an economic reality to consider spending some of their time in Ireland.  The growth in the number of leisure centres and in the holiday opportunities for families now available in this country makes us comparable with the best.  I appeal also to the emigrant population or to those who have friends and relatives abroad notwithstanding the reality of so many unemployed people in our midst. Although many emigrants had to leave <Col N="302" /> involuntarily they remain a vital part of our economy.</P>
    <P>When I was growing up &mdash; as many people in this House and the Leas-Chathaoirleach will testify, coming from a rural area &mdash; emigrants' remittances kept body and soul together for many families.  I have no doubt that the dollars, sterling and deutsche marks are still coming in to Irish homes but one hopes they will also be accompanied by the people who have had to leave; that those who have married abroad will bring their families back and make a real economic contribution to this country.  I know that begs the question: what are we doing for them?  I could not help but think of the much quoted phrase of the late President Kennedy when he talked of asking not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country.  That form of practical patriotism should be still alive and would help those of us attempting to make life better for Irish people now.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Government on the initiatives taken; I commend the Minister, the Minister of State and the Department for their continuing commitment to tourism and especially Bord Fáilte who have experienced trying times in recent years attempting to attract people to this offshore island which is still one of the most beautiful parts of the world.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  I concur with Senator Mooney when he compliments the Government, Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications and the Minister of State on the magnificent performance of the tourism industry over the past 12 months.  At the beginning of last year when the Gulf War started had we been asked what effect that unfortunate episode was to have on the Irish tourism industry we would have had to say it was going to be horrific, that the fall-off in tourism, particularly from the American market, would be enormous and that no Government or tourist <Col N="303" /> organisation could make up the lost revenue that would accrue from that unfortunate episode.  It is, therefore, amazing that we are now reflecting on an increase in tourism revenue during the past 12 months.  By any standards, that is a magnificent performance.</P>
      <P>It is acknowledged and recognised that tourism is a growth industry.  We have not fully recognised the potential for the development of our tourism.  For many years we were sitting on a sleeping giant and did not appreciate its development potential.  It is now recognised as the largest industrial growth area.</P>
      <P>We are beginning to realise what resources we possess.  For too many years the emphasis was on the sun holiday and it was difficult to compete with other countries in terms of sunshine.  We did not realise for years that tourism potential existed in a range of other areas. We cannot offer the lazy type of holiday where one lies on a beach for a fortnight or so to get a tan which will to prove one has been away for a gorgeous 14 or 21 days of sun.  Many people who participated in those holidays suffered extremes of all sorts &mdash; initially people would spend four or five days getting acclimatised.</P>
      <P>With the current emphasis on healthy living we are beginning to realise how enviable Ireland's position might be, worldwide.  We have a temperate climate and it is amazing to think that winter has passed and people who had the good fortune to take holidays in Ireland have had a most enjoyable holiday because we had such good weather.  The time when we could concentrate all of our energies on a three or four months holiday season has passed because we have the potential to extend our annual tourist season to 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people in the tourism industry recognise that fact and are setting about providing facilities to encourage people to look to Ireland as a holiday destination. In that connection we must acknowledge the response of the tourism industry to the Government's prompting and leadership and to the proposed five <Col N="304" /> year plan in relation to the development of tourism.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney, in a different context, mentioned the county of Tipperary, but I do not think I could let the occasion pass without referring to the River Shannon and the potential in that area. The Shannon is recognised as one of the finest rivers in Europe.  It has three fantastic lakes and there is the development of the Ballyconnell Canal linking with Northern Ireland.  The potential there for tourism development, from the North of Ireland down to the south, is enormous. I acknowledge the efforts being made by all the responsible agencies connected with the Shannon &mdash; Bord Fáilte, Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited, the Office of Public Works and all the other Government agencies that are playing a vital role developing the Shannon and bringing home to all and sundry the potential there.</P>
    <P>There are quite a number of people involved in promoting the tourism industry, including the local authorities, and ensuring that all the facilities required are being provided.  There is no agency involved in this sector that is found wanting at the moment.  We can look forward with great confidence to the enormous development and spin-off effects.  All we have to do is recognise all the new initiatives that are coming from the Government &mdash; even in the agricultural area there is the new Leader programme promoting agri-tourism ideas &mdash; the potential is right across the spectrum of Irish life.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that at the end of this five year plan we will see the fruit of the labours of the Government, the tourism industry and all the agencies that are so actively involved.  I again congratulate Senator Mooney and others for putting down this motion.  I want also to congratulate the Government, the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications and the Minister of State on the magnificent job that is being done under extremely difficult circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the progress that has been made in the tourism industry in recent years, this is to be lauded, and the effort of everybody who contributed is to be recognised in a positive way.</P>
      <P>Tourism is so important that there is justification for a full time senior Minister. This is one of the areas we can look to in the future as a means of solving many of our economic ills.  I make that point to highlight the importance of the tourism business because, as I perceive it &mdash; and I am sure others would have to agree &mdash; its potential has not been exploited to the full.</P>
      <P>We have three areas from which we can derive income: we have agriculture, which has major constraints put on it with the Common Agricultural Policy, GATT and associated matters; we have industrial developments, some of them under severe pressure with major competition and we have tourism, an area that can be developed a great deal further.  I believe that as a generator of finance it requires a far greater commitment than it got in years gone by.  Successive Governments have not tapped tourism to the extent they should have.  While I do not want to be derogatory about the contribution of the present Government towards tourism, I believe the fact that Bord Fáilte have been getting a reducing figure since 1988 when they got £28.4 million to 1991, when they got £21.9 million, and £21.5 million in 1992, shows this Government are not committed to the concept of the development of tourism.  This is an extremely important area.  While the reductions in the amounts paid to Bord Fáilte may not be major, they indicate a certain trend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's feeble attempts in the recent budget in providing £1 million for the tourism industry, coupled with the modest decrease in petrol prices, I would regard as only a pittance in relation to the sort of business we are talking about.  It was mentioned earlier that the value of tourism to the economy was £1.5 billion.  When we talk about that kind of figure on one side and an injection of <Col N="306" /> about £1 million on the other, we see there is no balance there.</P>
    <P>It behoves not just the Government but everybody in the area of tourism to put their shoulder to the wheel and support the Government in any way possible to exploit this very worthwhile and meaningful area of development.  It is an area that can do wonders to remedy the many ills in our economy at present.  We must, of course, have this overall plan to which I referred.  If not, we will have nothing.  It is essential that no stone is left unturned, that the Government, other agencies and people in every walk of life who are remotely connected with tourism, are involved in this scheme and that we develop the tourism potential.</P>
    <P>Seasonality has been referred to.  This is very important.  Up to a few years ago we had some very bad summers and the pattern was that the tourist season lasted four or five months depending on the weather.  However, in recent years, fortunately, our weather improved.  The seasonality aspect can only be developed side by side with the development of indoor hobbies and indoor leisure pursuits which people can engage in when the weather is inclement.  Reference was made here that today, 5 February, is an exceptionally mild day; but I do not think we could take that as typical of the weather at this time of year.  We need to develop leisure pursuits that can be enjoyed in adverse and poor weather conditions.  There are many possibilities for that.</P>
    <P>There is one matter that is disturbing: I refer to the announcement today by the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications about the stop-over at Shannon.  We have been repeatedly assured by the Minister and the Government that there would be no change in the status of Shannon.  I believe it would be a very retrograde step to have any change in that position and I call strongly on the Government to stay with their stated policy in that regard.  In the context of tourism alone, forgetting other lines of business, I am quite satisfied that many tourists come to Shannon Airport, they explore the regions not too far away from <Col N="307" /> there, such as Connemara, Kerry, Cork, Tipperary, the midlands and so on and they do not, in many cases, get involved in the capital city of our country.</P>
    <P>I believe the tourism aspect is one of the strong reasons the stated and restated position of Government with regard to the Shannon Airport situation should be maintained.  It is extremely serious to read of a report now going to Cabinet which will in effect change the whole status of Shannon Airport.  As a person living in the mid-western region, and as a person who worked with other colleagues from all parties for the future of Shannon Airport, it is a very disturbing matter to learn at this stage that there is a change envisaged.  I appeal to the Minister at this stage to stay with the stated policy.  We look forward to a continued successful, vibrant Shannon Airport and its hinterland in the context not alone of tourism but of industry as well.</P>
    <P>Let us call a spade a spade.  It is a long distance for people coming from various parts to Dublin to go to Connemara and Kerry whereas many of those people &mdash; and figures will substantiate this &mdash; would go directly to places like Kerry, Connemara, Cork and other parts of the north-western region and would not have occasion to come to Dublin.  There are other arguments <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Dublin situation from the business point of view but, frankly, from a tourism point of view I submit it would be detrimental to go down that road.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to agri-tourism because agri-tourism, in my view, is an absolutely essential ingredient in the future to help alleviate the declining incomes on Irish farms.  It has done much already and it can do a great deal more.  I believe we must work in that direction.  Our main markets are Britain, Europe and North America.  Bord Fáilte have been doing a good job but I believe the functions of Bord Fáilte should be extended.  As I said earlier, there should be somebody appointed specifically and exclusively in charge of that matter at ministerial level, at senior level in the Cabinet, and finance should be made available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="308" /> I want now to deal with the matter of accommodation.  In this country we have had a tendency to build many very upmarket hotels, particularly in the Dublin area, and in other parts too &mdash; hotels like the Hilton, the Berkeley Court, the Westbury and so on.  I have nothing against hotels of that standard but when people come to this country they seem to be directed towards those hotels and they pay fairly handsomely for their accommodation, food and so on.  In many cases they do not return.  That is bad business where we lose customers on a permanent basis.</P>
    <P>Equally, in the area of accommodation, I believe we should look at the practice in Europe and other parts of the world.  For a husband and wife sharing a room in an Irish hotel the price is very often double the single price, or near enough to it, whereas in many of the continental countries and America the second person is charged only a nominal rate.  This would help enormously. Remember &mdash; and we tend to forget this &mdash; these people coming to Ireland do not have unlimited resources.  They must work within a certain budget.  If we put them off once then they are people who are lost to us as future visitors.  I welcome the task force which has been referred to earlier and I look forward with interest to seeing its precise function and work.  I wish it well in its area of activities.</P>
    <P>If the Government are serious about the development of tourism they should not limit Bord Fáilte, our tourist body, to such a small figure.  They should not also in a national budget allocate what I would regard as a paltry sum of money, £1 million, for the development of tourism. Before I finish I want to say again, at the risk of being repetitive, that is a very retrograde step if what we read in the papers today <i>vis-a-vis</i> Shannon Airport is true.  We have a vast area with magnificent tourist attractions in the midwest, the south and the north-west.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to welcome the Minister to the House and I look forward with interest to his comments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with <Col N="309" /> my colleague, Senator Hugh Byrne.  I second the motion.  It is very appropriate that we have the Minister, Deputy Lyons, here tonight.  He has played a major part in promoting tourism since he came to office and I wish to avail of this opportunity to congratulate him.  I can assure him that within the industry and especially in Kerry his personal involvement is very much appreciated.  Over the past number of years he has been a frequent visitor at various tourist-related functions and also on holidays with his wife.</P>
      <P>While tourism is a tremendous success, we must still move forward as the potential for growth in this sector is tremendous. In this step forward we must include the regional organisations.  I include SFADCo also because we in north Kerry are part of that region.  While one must welcome the new approach of Bord Fáilte to regional tourism organisations, if there is to be a genuine willingness to devote increased responsibilities to the RTOs in developing and marketing there must be an equal readiness to hand over funds to implement this new policy.  Over the past five years regions have experienced a sharp reduction in Bord Fáilte's allocation of funds in all areas, thus eroding the credibility and effectiveness of the regions.  At the same time, in the past three years the regions have increased income from commercial activities by 140 per cent.  Therefore, asking the regions to demonstrate their success in achieving worth-while growth in tourism revenue and, at the same time, denying them the right to direct marketing and promotional campaigns in the market areas is a base contradiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years Bord Fáilte has failed to achieve any increased participation by the private sector in expanding the tourism industry.  Having reduced the role of the RTOs in most areas of marketing, this has created a difficulty in stimulating the private sector to any level of success. Because of budget restraints, in particular Bord Fáilte's attitude towards the regions' role in marketing, it was inevitable that local interests, such as local <Col N="310" /> tourism groups, local authorities and all other organisations went about doing their own thing and ignored the RTOs. This is not in the best interests of the industry.  At this time co-ordination is essential.</P>
    <P>As regards overlapping by state agencies, this was also inevitable and became increasingly obvious with Bord Fáilte staff in particular when engaged in responsibilities with the regions.  Therefore, the present perception of the overall effectiveness of the regions appear good to Bord Fáilte but poor to the public.  The reduction of funds by Bord Fáilte to the regions is the greatest militating fact in this regard.</P>
    <P>One has to look at the success of tourism in general in 1991, but I would like to make special mention to the success of the Cork-Swansea ferry which carried approximately 135,000 visitors and in excess of 30,000 cars during the 1991 season.  One has to contrast this with the situation of some five years ago when the Minister of the day decided to bring in consultants to do a feasibility study to see if it would be a viable proposition to adopt this route.  These consultants reported back to the Minister and made it very clear to him that it was not a viable proposition to adopt this route. Thankfully, the Minister ignored this report and he allowed the local authorities to become involved.</P>
    <P>The local authorities of Cork and Kerry decided to set up a board and made the necessary funding available with the co-operation of the Government.  In particular, Minister Lyons, who comes from Cork, played a major part in the formation of this company because three years ago he was instrumental in getting a grant of £500,000 plus a loan of £500,000 which helped this company to get off the ground.  The first year showed a loss of almost £1 million, the second year &mdash; with the aid of a grant of £500,000 and a loan of £500,000 from the Government &mdash; showed a loss of almost £500,000. However, 1991 was the crunch year and figures will be released shortly which will show a massive turnabout and that there will be profits for the season in excess of <Col N="311" /> £800,000.  This to me is a tremendous achievement.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that we can be proud of the success of tourism.  I want to compliment my colleague, Senator Mooney on the points he made, which were very important.  The recent report commissioned by the Tourism Industry Confederation highlighted many important aspects of the progress and the success of tourism.  It pointed out that between 1985 and 1990 tourism grew twice as fast as the national economy and its share of gross national product increased by almost 7 per cent.  Tourism now contributes more than £400 million to the overall balance of payment surplus even when allowance is made for foreign holidays by Irish residents.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the success of tourism where Kerry is concerned.  We are certainly very proud of our success in tourism in Kerry which is the leading tourist/holiday county in Ireland.  Tourism is now the county's most important industry and the estimated income from tourism in 1991 for the county is £145 million.  At this stage it is in excess of the income from agriculture, the county's main income source heretofore.  Employment in the tourism sector in Kerry is estimated at 7,500, some 17.5 per cent of the labour force.  This signifies the importance of tourism to the economy of the county.  Kerry on its own has more rented accommodation and derives more revenue from tourism than many of the existing regions, let alone counties.</P>
    <P>We have a major expansion of Kerry Airport at Farranfore costing approximately £12.5 million &mdash; again thanks to the Government.  The extended airport will enable jet aircraft to fly direct from continental Europe.  Short stay tourist traffic is seen as a major element of the increased airport activity.  The consultants to the airport have estimated that 200,000 passengers would use the extended airport on an annual basis by the year 2000 and that ten years later this number would have increased to approximately 371,000 passengers per year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Lyons, to the House this evening and, like my colleague, Senator Foley, I would like to thank the Minister for this genuine interest in tourism.  He came to Wexford on several occasions.  I wish him continued success in his portfolio.</P>
      <P>I am sure Members will forgive me if I mention the sunny south-east, which is where I am from, and to say that Wexford has the most sunshine and the least rainfall in the country, which must, of itself be a major attraction.  These facts can be proved by studying the statistics available.</P>
      <P>There are many things I could say about Wexford which Senators may not be aware of, because we are in our infancy as regards tourism.  About one and a half million people come through Rosslare port each year and it is now firmly established as one of the leading ports in Europe.  It is the intention of the Wexford people to encourage those people on their way to Kerry and other places and on the way back to visit our area.  It is estimated that each of the tourists coming into the country brings in about £600 on average.  That shows the amount of money that is spent.  I agree wholeheartedly with my colleague, Senator Foley, when he says that the potential in tourism is not tapped.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, we have too little time here to discuss the matter in full this evening.  The point I make to add to that already made in relation to Wexford is that heretofore we depended on agriculture for employment.  Basically employment was mainly on the farm and in the agricultural services industry.  Since the early eighties when agriculture started to decline &mdash; in fact, I would have to say the services industry completely collapsed &mdash; we have had to find jobs for those people who had been displaced. We intend in a major way to tap the tourism market but I have to say there are not sufficient bed spaces.  We must provide amenities.  Kerry is in the fortunate position of having natural amenities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Heritage Park in Wexford attracts about 120,000 people per <Col N="313" /> year.  It is a fantastic heritage park and is well worth a visit by Senators and others who have not been to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that a personal invitation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  I would be only too delighted to give the Senator a tour of the park any time.  Another project in Wexford is the coastal park for south Wexford.  That project is running into some difficulty because the proposers forgot there were people already living in the area.  While I respect environmentalists and those who promote the green image, we must never forget that people living in the area must come first. I ask the Minister to tell the people of Wexford that no coastal park will be imposed on them.  We want a debate on this matter.  We want what is best for both sides but we do not want anything imposed on us that will damage employment in the area.</P>
      <P>People in County Wexford are worried about coastal erosion as, I am sure, are people living in all coastal counties.  The experts predict that with global warming, the tide will rise by several feet within the next ten years and that will exacerbate the problem.  I wonder if the Department are monitoring the situation.  Have we control over this?  Are we making provision for it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse everything that was said by other speakers.  I am heavily involved in the tourism industry which, as Senator Mooney said, provides 80,000 full time jobs.  One in every 14 workers is employed in tourism.  Between 1988 and 1992 there was a 15 per cent increase in the the number of foreign tourists coming to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Mooney mentioned the emigrant market and I could not agree with his comments more.  Entertainers are great ambassadors.  I want to pay tribute to our soccer team.  They too were great ambassadors and did us all proud.  I look forward to our athletes taking part in the Olympic Games this year because when <Col N="314" /> the Irish go abroad they are our ambassadors. I realise that anyone from the State of Maryland who comes here as a tourist can be made an honorary ambassador and is given literature etc., to promote this country when they return home.  The Department, the Minister and Bord Fáilte are to be congratulated.  The write and invite campaign was a novel idea and an enormous success.</P>
    <P>Ireland is predominantly an all weather sport country.  There has been a massive growth in such sports as golf and fishing. These attractions have enormous potential, unlike Canada and other countries where there is snow for four or five months of the year.  Ireland is well placed geographically and has its place in Europe.  The wealth of our culture, the warmth of our people and their hospitality will not be found in many other countries.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers pointed out that many tourists stay in certain chain hotels. That does not happen by accident.  It is the result of careful marketing by these groups in America, Australia, Canada and Europe.  They organise tourists to come here.  They got experience in other countries and then came here and built massive hotels with every modern facility.  I pay tribute to the late P.V. Doyle who saw what was happening around the world and then provided the necessary facilities here.</P>
    <P>We should investigate the possibility of eliminating VAT on admission charges to places of historical, cultural or educational importance, for example, museums and novel attractions such as circuses.  These are all-weather tourist attractions and, as such, are important.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have mixed views about tourism.  I see the good it can do for those of us who are in a position to travel and for those who can sometimes gain work but I am profoundly sceptical about its capacity to generate jobs which give people income, security and dignity.  I am also profoundly sceptical about the impact of large scale tourism on our environment which, in many ways, is self-defeating. By its nature it will destroy <Col N="315" /> much of the appeal which creates a worth-while tourist industry.  These are issues that need to be addressed in the apparent rush to spend large amounts of money on interpretative centres and such like.  They are issues that are rarely addressed because we are supposed to be pro-job creation.</P>
      <P>My view is that the west would be far better served by a dynamic fishing industry based on a natural resource which we should own but which we gave away, which would produce perhaps seven onshore jobs for every job at sea and which would produce well paid, secure work and the dignity that goes with it instead of the pretend jobs that are generated during the tourist season. They may well put a few bob in the pockets of individual families who provide bed and breakfast accommodation or run some small enterprise that lasts for a couple of months, but will not ensure a livelihood for somebody who has no other source of income.</P>
      <P>I am sceptical about the jobs that are created in many of the tourist resorts. The one I know best is Corca Dhuibhne and I am sceptical about the number of full-time as distinct from seasonal jobs. The extra revenue is more than welcome to people who are desperately short of money but it is no solution for real work. It does not guarantee a future for many of the young people in those areas.</P>
      <P>I am also worried about how we sell ourselves.  If we are uncertain about who we are it is extremely difficult to sell ourselves as unique and different.  There was a survey published in the last number of years which suggested that many potential tourists from the Continent saw Ireland as a particularly bland country without much to distinguish it.  That is not true but many of those who form our opinions have lost contact with what is unique about this country as have many who are involved in the tourist industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last time I travelled to the United States with Aer Lingus the offering of what masqueraded as Irish music was an offence.  I have no objection to the kind of music that was played.  People are <Col N="316" /> entitled to their choice but to pretend to tourists that what they were offered was representative of real Irish music was a distortion beyond belief and a reflection on those who put it together.  If we do not understand what is good about ourselves, we will not be able to persuade tourists to come here.</P>
    <P>What bothers me is that instead of appreciating our unique qualities and attracting tourists who have a sense of discrimination, we are aping the mass tourism of other regions.  In the process, for the sake of a short term killing if we are lucky with the weather and the economic situation in other countries, we will turn ourselves into a developed wasteland of over-developed tourism which will gradually frighten away any future discriminating tourists.  We will end up in the worst of both worlds and many of our resources will have been destroyed.</P>
    <P>A classic example which will do precisely that is the proposed second marina in Dingle.  It was an issue which could not generate in a public inquiry the support of more than two citizens of the town.  So many people from the town wanted to object to it that the chairman of the inquiry asked that they should not all insist on giving evidence because it would be very time consuming and would cost too much.  Those decent people, in an effort to be helpful, decided not to participate in the inquiry.  They are not indiscriminately hostils to tourism as is evidenced by their support, for instance, for the Fundúireacht na mBlascaodaí project in Corca Dhuibhne where the local people can clearly see the difference between worth-while and worthless development.</P>
    <P>In contrast, the local community are overwhelmingly hostile to a proposal which will hand over 22 acres of what should be public property in Dingle Harbour to a developer and allow him to build a private marina with 30 or 40 accommodation units with space for 60 sailing boats, and another marina is being provided by the State.  If we do this most of the discriminating tourists who come to the area because of its uniqueness <Col N="317" /> will say, to hell with it; this area is like everywhere on the west coast of Europe; we will find somewhere different which has something unique to offer.  If that is the way extra money is expended, it is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>The decision in Dingle is an affront to the people there who know their area better than any inspector from Dublin. It is an affront to good tourism, good planning and the unique beauty of that area.  The way the decision was reached has and continues to have the stench of political influence about it.  I resent it as one who has a long attachment to that area.</P>
    <P>I do not own a yacht so this marina will not affect me one way or the other.  I do not have any desire to own a yacht and I have no objections to those who do, but I object to one of the most beautiful places in the world being handed over to a private developer for reasons that do not stand up to objective assessment. Apparently the Minister for the Marine thinks it is in the public interest to do this, even though it is manifestly against the wishes of the people who have to live with it.  That is not the way to develop the tourist industry or that area.  We should have a belief in ourselves, a willingness to keep ourselves as we want and we should not make ourselves into anything other than what we want to be.</P>
    <P>There is a list of minor grievances I articulate year after year when we discuss tourism &mdash; for example, the apparent unwillingness of many who run small enterprises to appreciate that perhaps tourists come here to find something different and would appreciate something better than the music offered in virtually every coffee shop and pub on the west coast which consists of turning on 2FM and leaving it on for the day. Perhaps people would like to hear music that will make them aware that they are in a different country, understanding different people with different feelings, speaking a different language &mdash; another unique characteristic.  Perhaps Killarney should avoid such offensive sounding names as the Nashville guesthouse when it is supposed to be the symbol of all that <Col N="318" /> is uniquely and beautifully Irish.  Not just the State but those who want to invest in tourism should realise that there are good commercial reasons for developing a sense of ourselves and a sense of our own uniqueness.  We must not forget that in the rush to increase tourist numbers. What we want are people who have a clear idea of why they come here and who appreciate what is unique about this country.</P>
    <P>There are many sad stories about other countries, for example the tribesmen of some rural areas of Kenya, some of the most dignified people, who are reduced to standing at the side of the road in full regalia to be photographed by tourists and the kind and gentle people of many of the more remote countries of Asia who have been swept into the most appalling forms of mass tourism.</P>
    <P>Like all forms of development, the unqualified rush to develop tourism by building based on the assessments of the Office of Public Works who do not have to through the normal planning process unless they so choose, based on decisions often taken by people far removed from where these developments take place, amounts to potential disaster which will frighten off many of those we want to attract.  It may create a short term boom but in the end it will leave us with masses of concrete in many of our most beautiful areas with no tourists, no industry and ultimately no people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister and the Minister of State for their interest in tourism and for the work they have done. I do not agree with everything Senator Ryan said about more accommodation ruining the countryside.  With proper planning, that is, providing green areas, etc., our scenery will not be raped.  In the present climate, the only avenue for real growth and job creation is in the tourist business and special emphasis should be placed on tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1991 we had the Gulf War but the number of tourists visiting our country held and the figures are there to prove what they meant to the Exchequer.  In Kerry we failed to attract the industry <Col N="319" /> needed to provide employment and the only avenue open to us is tourism.  The business expansion scheme introduced in the budget two years ago was exploited. That should be reintroduced for tourist-related projects.  Many people took advantage of it at the time to instal proper indoor facilities, such as swimming pools, saunas and so on.  Seaside resorts have been badly affected by bad weather. Some new scheme will have to be introduced to bring some vitality back to the dying trade in these resorts.  The season could be reduced to four or five weeks but a couple of bad week-ends could mean a bad season.  Yet these people are expected to pay rates, insurance, etc. Perhaps the Government could introduce a rates and tax relief system over a 15 or 20 year period for traders in seaside resorts which would enable them to put money back into the resorts.  Then the local authorities could put money back into the towns by building proper facilities so that, in the event of bad weather, traders would not lose business.</P>
    <P>Golfing is a new sport in Ireland but there are others, like water sports which could be developed.  I do not agree with what Senator Ryan said about the second marina in Dingle.  I would not mind if there were ten marinas in Dingle because then there would be at least ten people promoting tourism.</P>

      <P>I was in Sicily last August and 38 different marinas were being developed on that small island.  At present there is a marina in Kilrush but there is a need for more marinas along our coast.  There is great need for a marina in the Tarbert-Ballylongford-Balybunion area.  Many people are interested in walking and water sport holidays. These are natural amenities in this country and much more emphasis will have to be placed on this growth area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Kerry, 17.5 per cent of the work-force are involved in the tourism business; in north Kerry, no jobs have been <Col N="320" /> created in the industrial area in the past number of years.  However, since we joined the Shannon development scheme some jobs have been created.  We have become more tourist-orientated in the northern part of the county even though we do not have the scenery of south Kerry, west Clare or west Cork but we have real items of interest.  We have archaeological sites, museums and ring forts.  These are of great interest to European and American tourists.  Statistics show that tourists visiting Ireland only spend one and a half days in County Kerry.  Any tourist coming to County Kerry could easily spend a week there and enjoy it.  We must encourage tourists to spend more time in the area.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the proposal to overfly Shannon.  I hope that region will be protected because it would be a catastrophe for the area if that proposal were agreed.  That service and the Swansea car ferry from a tourist point of view, are keeping life in the region.  People on a package tour spend a week and a half in the UK, but only a week in Ireland.  They may spend a day and a half or two days in Dublin and then go to Wicklow, Wexford, and west Cork and by the time they get to Kerry, it is time for them to go home.</P>
    <P>There is need for extra accommodation and smaller guest houses must be brought up to proper standards; a new type of grant system will have to be introduced to bring accommodation up to standard.</P>
    <P>I have travelled quite a bit in my time. I was in Sicily and Malta last year but nowhere was there accommodation as good as it is in Ireland.  Nowhere are the facilities as good as they are in Ireland. We are on a par if not ahead of most countries but we must do more.  There is potential for growth in this area.  Many people have not discovered Ireland. There was a study carried out in France recently which showed that 65 or 70 per cent of French people did not know where Ireland was.  Another vital statistic is that only 5 per cent of the American people own passports.  I do not think our landscape will ever be destroyed.  Our <Col N="321" /> season is short but we must try to extend it.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take into account the fact that the tourism industry is outstripping the agricultural industry in County Kerry.  This country is seen as stable and safe and that is why people come for that reason.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to contribute to this debate.  It is interesting to hear the contributions of those from the traditional tourist regions, particularly Kerry.</P>
      <P>I live in a major tourist area, in Westport, County Mayo.  I looked at the statistics issued by Bord Fáilte. I grew up in a region where tourism did not exist and I saw it grow through the voluntary efforts of local committees into a major money spinner.  I am very proud that, if one excludes Dublin, the region defined as the west runs very close to the south-west when it comes to numbers of visitors and the money they spend.</P>
      <P>Around west Mayo this summer it was amazing to see, for example, Italians driving Fiats with registrations from Rome, Bologna, Milan and Venice.  It is remarkable to reflect that a young couple in a little Fiat might have driven all the way from Palermo, Sicily, to spend a holiday in Westport County Mayo. Somebody somehwere must take credit for that.</P>
      <P>I agree completely with the comments made by Senator Cassidy about the debt we owe the people who travel abroad and are seen as ambassadors for this country. He also mentioned Irish culture, Irish music and Irish groups, such as the Chieftians. We still have strange attitudes in this country.  There is a kind of pseudomentality among so many of our Irish people living in this country, who might deem themselves to be well educated, who look with disdain on this native culture.</P>

      <P>We are into something approaching high farce on this issue when the Minister tells us according to his statement issued yesterday, there has been gross misrepresentation of his directive to the ESB.  It is not just me, or indeed the media, who are involved in this. Apparently the board of the ESB misrepresented him too.  I have the letter from the board of the ESB, dated 30 January 1992, in which they refer to the Minister's letter &ldquo;regarding the use of the ESB of its billing system to provide its customers with credit facilities&rdquo;.  That is what the board of the ESB believed.  Was that misrepresentation?  In the second paragraph of their letter, the board continue:</P>
      <P>Your directive requires the instant discontinuance of a service to the whole community, which has been in existence for over 60 years and in which the Board is specifically empowered to engage under the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927.</P>
      <P>That is what the board thought the Minister meant, as did the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the trade unions.  I thought so too.  It is a little rich to have all that represented as somebody else's mistake, that he got it right and the rest of us got it wrong.  Let us remember what the Minister's position was last Thursday, and I quote from his remarks to the Dáil. I am grateful to his office and for the speed with which they supplied me with a copy:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My decision will not prevent the ESB from selling white or brown electrical goods and will not prevent the ESB from providing alternative credit arrangements for such sales, as long as they are arranged on an arm's length <Col N="323" /> basis just like any other appliance dealer.</P>
    <P>There are questions to be asked about what that meant.  Does that mean they are not supposed to use people's electricity bill performance as a rough and ready index of people's credit worthiness? That is one of the advantages of the ESB; it is one of the reasons it can offer such a simplified service.  Let us go on.  The Minister said last Thursday:</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to repeat that it is now up to the ESB to adjust to the new competitive situation in which they will find themselves and to arrange for alternative credit facilities for their customers at arm's length from their core monopolistic electricity business, just like any other electrical retailer.</P>
    <P>The truth is that it is very hard to get alternative credit facilities if you are poor, if you do not have a bank account and if you are trying to borrow small sums.  Our great big banks do not believe in lending less than £500 any more.  The ESB's 150,000 customers who find these existing credit facilities useful were supposed to be told last Saturday, at a moment's notice, to find alternative credit facilities.  The Minister pleaded misrepresentation and, apparently, the board of the ESB misunderstood him. They hold him:</P>
    <P>There is no alternative credit system available which we can develop, and if you insist that the present arrangement be discontinued the Board can see no alternative but to cease trading in electrical retail and shut down many of its local outlets which of course are both shops and customer service centres. Without financial support of the retailing activity there will be no economic justification for maintaining ESB centres in many of the provincial towns in Ireland.</P>
    <P>At this stage we have the Minister on a competition crusade which is more committed than the person who has the legal <Col N="324" /> obligation to protect competition, the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade.  No matter how selectively the Minister quotes from his report, the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade concluded that the ESB was not in breach of any competition policy as he understood it.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us he was misrepresented yet again, and in his latest statement, yesterday, he forgot about competition.  It was not mentioned in his statement and, now, he is suddenly concerned about the customers getting the wrong impression and he says:</P>
    <P>The Minister was concerned that customers for electricity appliances be fully aware that their electricity account is a separate issue from the payments of sums due on credit sales or hire purchase transactions.  Any sum tendered for electricity supplied must be credited for that purpose.  No recourse may be had to any possible discontinuance of electricity supply by the ESB to achieve payments of sums due for goods bought by ESB customers. The ESB should collect its debts for these sales in the same way as any other trader does, under the law.</P>
    <P>There was nothing new in that because the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade in his report for May 1990, makes it prefectly clear that, under the law, the people already have the right to all of that.</P>
    <P>The Minister is now making it up as he goes along.  Competition is gone.  All the talk that we used to have about a level playing field is gone.  The problem is that the ESB has been successful.  As the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade showed, once it reorganised itself, it began to bite at people who had a cosy little arrangement among themselves.  It gave people the things they wanted and now we have a position where we have forgotten about competition.</P>
    <P>Most people want to know what precisely is going on?  What has changed? What is the reason for the directive? What is the directive?  What will it mean <Col N="325" /> for the ESB appliance sales?  Last Thursday there was a directive to provide alternative credit arrangements at arm's length, now it is a touching concern for the ESB's customers so that they would not make a mistake and confuse their appliance bill with their electricity bill.</P>
    <P>I believe that ordinary people are perfectly capable of managing their own affairs.  I thought the Progressive Democrats took the same view because they had a lot of talk about people's capacity to manage their own money and getting the State off people's backs, but the average ESB customer needed the intervention of the Minister for Energy to explain the difference between an appliance and electricity.  If that is the case then so be it, let us get it sorted out.</P>
    <P>I think what happened was that the Minister decided he would look after the private sector at the expense of the public sector and discovered to his amazement, but not to mine, that the Irish people take a very different view about things like that.  The Minister tells us that all he wanted to do was look after the customers. The Radio and Television Retail Association still think he is talking about competition.  Everybody is confused.  I saw a member of the Opposition trying to get clarification in the Dáil this morning, so perhaps we will get clarification. It would be wonderful if we did.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister tell us what he means?  Does he want separate bills in the same envelope or even separate printing on the same bill or is he still telling people that you cannot get credit from the ESB directly, you must have some sort of arm's length arrangement?  What does he mean by that?  Can people pay their electricity bill and their appliance credit instalment at the same time, in the same place?  What is going on?  The country is in total confusion.  If we understand what the Minister is saying, then he has done a somersault.  To his credit, at least, he has responded to public opinion.</P>
    <P>I would like to know what is going on. The world outside, the poor people of this country who rely on the ESB, the whole of our society which regards the ESB as giving a good service, at a good <Col N="326" /> price, would like to know what is going on.  The recent opinion polls show Irish public opinion rated the ESB as a far better and far more acceptable partner in society than either House of the Oireachtas and rated it as more highly thought of than the Church itself.</P>
    <P>The ESB looks after its customers well and has a good system for doing so.  It checks their credit rating, it gives credit, often interest free, it enables people to plan their purchases and to buy much of what are now almost the necessities of life, all in an uncomplicated way.  People know what they are doing.  The problem is that the ESB is too good at it.  The ESB went from being a loss-making joke in the retail business a few years ago to being profitable, competitive and well able to compete with the rest of the private sector.  It did that by doing precisely the same things it had always done, using the billing system to advertise its products, using what was available to it creatively, to its own benefit and that of its customers.  Because of that it made a profit.</P>
    <P>I get the impression that whatever is said about the left and profitability, the people most hostile to profit in our State are the ideological right-wingers who resent seeing a State enterprise make money, because it disproves all their ideological nonsense.  That is the bottom line on this whole controversy.  The Minister who usually has a bit of sense foolishly walked into ideological claptrap last week.  This ideological nonsense deems the existence of a public sector monopoly to be a bad thing.  Its capacity to serve its customers is deemed to be a bad thing, ideologically and out of that ideology came a nonsensical decision which I hope is in the process of being reversed.</P>
    <P>The ESB is a large successful organisation, internationally respected.  I know this as an engineer.  The quality and the technical expertise in the ESB, in a whole host of areas including electricity generation, project management, cost assessment, etc., is internationally recognised by the engineering profession.  It is a substantial earner of revenue for this <Col N="327" /> State by its international contracting service. It builds large projects in budget and on time.  One of the reasons for that is that it is run by engineers and I say that with the arrogance that always goes with my profession.  Engineers work on very simple things.  They work on the facts and look for a solution that will work.</P>
    <P>The problem about this decision as it originally stood, when it was based on competition as distinct from the touching concern for the customers, is that it ignored the fact that this system actually appealed to the people.  The reason it was successful was not because of any abuse of a monopolistic position, or some threat but because people liked it.  People liked it because it was simple, straightforward, friendly and manageable.</P>
    <P>It is an outrageously wrong decision and a terrible reflection on the increasing remoteness of this Minister and, apparently, his party from ordinary life, to imagine anything else.  I do not know why so many Members of this House, including our ex-Cathaoirleach, Members of the party in front of me and the parties over there and so many Members of the other House became involved in this.  Do they really believe it would be better for consumers to be locked into perpetual renting of various electrical appliances, never owning anything, with the appalling waste of money that goes into renting, instead of having the guarantee of security and continuity and the guarantee that the company will always be there that goes with the ESB?</P>
    <P>I conclude, in deference to the Minister's wishes to be out of the House reasonably speedily, as I have no desire to cause an election by delaying him here. I, the country, the media and the trade unions would like to know a number of things.  Can the ESB still use or do they propose to use customers' performance in paying their electricity bills as an assessment of creditworthiness?  Can the arrangements about credit be made on the spot when people are buying their appliances?  Can people pay for the appliances when they go into the ESB to pay their electricity bill, will they get their <Col N="328" /> appliance bill along with the ESB bill, or will the ESB now be put in the ridiculous position of having to pay double for the postage?  What is going on?  Nobody, at this stage, including myself, understands anything other than that, apparently, the Minister is in a desperate rush to back off from a position he walked into rather foolishly less than two weeks ago?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>First, let me set out my position clearly and simply so there can be no confusion.  First, all ESB shops will remain open for business as usual; second, the sale of goods in the shops will continue as usual; third, goods may still be bought on hire purchase; fourth, goods bought on hire purchase in ESB shops will be paid for on one bill, and fifth, consumers' electricity will be paid for on another bill.</P>
      <P>Now let me set out the background. The Senator will be aware that on the 22 January 1992 I wrote to the Chairman of the ESB requesting him to make the necessary arrangements to cease the use of the ESB billing system in facilitating the sale of new goods with effect from 1992.  The board considered my letter at their meeting on 30 January 1992 and, following a request from the board to postpone my decision for some time to enable them to consider the consequences and the options open to them to prepare for the change.  I extended the deadline from 1 February to 1 March 1992.</P>
      <P>May I state, at the outset, that my decision was based on a view that it is not appropriate, from a public policy point of view, for the ESB billing system, which exists to service the ESB's core monopoly business of electricity supply, to be used in connection with electrical goods, which take place in a competitive market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="329" /> The Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade in his May 1990 report clearly stated that his investigation raised complex questions about the dividing line between competition policy and public policy and concluded that the question of whether a statutory monopoly should be allowed trade in areas outside the area of its statutory monopoly is a matter of public policy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The only restriction I have placed on the ESB retailing business is that, in the public interest, they can no longer include charges for goods sold on credit in electricity bills.  Amounts owing in respect of electrical goods must be shown on separate bills.</P>
      <P>I would like to emphasise that my decision will not prevent the ESB from selling white or brown electrical goods and will not prevent the ESB from providing credit arrangements for small or large appliance sales for low income families or any other family.  Let us be quite clear about this.  I want the ESB to keep its shops open and I want it to continue to provide credit facilities.  Statements which welcome my intention to keep the shops open infer that, somehow, I had previously asked that they be shut; this was never the case.  Similarly, statements welcoming my intention to allow credit sales infer somehow I stated that credit sales be discontinued; this was never the case.  I am especially conscious that the ESB has always provided a source of credit for the less well off and it was never my intention to curtail this in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me explain clearly why I have asked the ESB to change its system.  Customers for electrical goods should be fully aware that their electricity account is a separate issue from the payment of sums due on credit sales or hire purchase transactions. They should have no doubt that any sum tendered for the electricity supply must be credited to that purpose, and they should also know that no recourse may be had to any possible discontinuance of electricity supply by the <Col N="330" /> ESB to achieve payment of sums due for goods bought in ESB shops.</P>
    <P>The ESB has always stated, when asked, that it would not cut off electricity just because of arrears on goods.  Nevertheless, and I am not contesting ESB's bona fides, I believe that up to now many customers either did not know that or, if they knew it, were unwilling to exercise their rights against a supplier of such an important service as electricity.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that this misconception, in fact, represents a significant commercial advantage for the ESB.  In effect, the ESB's appliance business has been benefiting from its monopoly electricity business and my decision is simply intended to correct this situation and put the ESB's retailing business on a par with others.</P>
    <P>Now let me set out equally clearly what I have asked ESB to do.  I suspect Senators will find a strange contrast between my actual requirements and the extreme comments in the press.  I simply want the ESB to prepare one bill for electricity and a separate and distinct bill for money owned in respect of goods. That way there will be no confusion in any customer's mind.</P>
    <P>This extra administration may, indeed, give rise to some small extra cost for ESB shops but this will certainly not be out of line with costs for competitors.  I have no doubt that the ESB's shops will be able to absorb this cost without placing the burden on any particular section of its customers &mdash; such as those on low incomes.</P>
    <P>Today I met with the president of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to reassure him that there was no question that the ESB's credit facility would have to be withdrawn from low income families in spite of the totally unjustified and misleading statements made by the media.</P>
    <P>During the course of my meeting with the president of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul he said that the society had asked the ESB sometime ago to facilitate customers by issuing two separate bills, one for power supply and one for goods bought on credit.  This request was refused by the ESB.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="331" /> I note also from a statement by the Consumers Association today that they also believed that there should be two separate billing systems, and possibly two separate companies in the ESB.  I do not intend to go to the latter extreme, but it is clear that I am not the only one who feels the need for separate bills.  Indeed, I have had representations from over 50 Members of the Dáil and Seanad in regard to the continuing use of the electricity billing system by ESB shops.  Incidentally I do not have any record in my files in the Department of any representations by Senator Doherty, as was widely reported by the media.</P>

      <P>Finally, I want to contradict as strongly as possible the outrageous suggestions that my decision will lead to the loss of 1,000 jobs.  This is utter nonsense.  It is scaremongering of the very worst kind.  It is the voice of one interest group which has no regard, as I must have, for the jobs of people in competing business which totals, I understand, well over 3,000 jobs.</P>
      <P>As I said before, my decision will impose a small administrative burden on ESB shops.  That is all it will do.  It will not result in the end of ESB credit sales and there is no question of job losses in the ESB or anywhere else.</P>
