      <P>I have notice from Senator O'Toole that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to raise within the European states and with the South African authorities the non-recognition of the South African Democratic Teachers' Union, the only non-racial teacher organisation in South Africa, while it recognises teacher unions which are organised along racial lines and to convey to the South African authorities the views of the Irish Government on this matter.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator O'Toole as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>I am ordering the business today in such a way that, although we will conclude the Bills today, I hope that the time allocated will give everybody an opportunity to speak.  It is proposed to take items 1 and 2.  It is also proposed that, notwithstanding anything in Standing <Col N="1726" /> Orders, proceedings on the Second Stage of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1992, if not previously concluded, will be brought to a conclusion at 4 p.m. by the putting of the question by the Chair and that the Report and Final Stages of the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunication Messages (Regulation) Bill, 1992, if not previously concluded, will be brought to a conclusion at 6 p.m. by one question which shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by the Government.  Business will be interrupted from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.</P>

      <P>Is Second Stage being concluded today or is it all Stages of the Housing Bill?</P>
      <P>In view of the decision by the American Embassy, could the Leader of the House arrange to discuss with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and also perhaps the Government Chief Whip, our concern in relation to the fact that representations will not be accepted by the Embassy?  Obviously if there have been breaches by Members it is a thing we would all view seriously; but it is a privilege that we have, I hope, exercised in a proper manner.  Would the Leader look into this matter?</P>
      <P>Finally, there have been a number of reports recently, including one in relation to the national lottery and one in relation to safety at work.  Would the Leader of the House at an early stage, perhaps at the resumption, allow time for these reports to be discussed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like also to express my concern that the American Embassy has decided to discontinue accepting representations from Members of the Oireachtas.  I had a case myself recently when I ran into that problem.  I am also very concerned at the reports that appear in the media that the embassy appears to be treating some people in a manner that they consider to be rude.  I think that is unnecessary, undesirable and something that I would sincerely hope would be cleared up at the meeting which is taking place today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1727" /> May I ask the Leader if, after the break, he will allow a full debate on Telecom Éireann and particularly on the attitude which that company adopts to their consumers?</P>
    <P>In relation to the guillotine which the Leader has imposed today, in a way I regret it and I would suggest that the Leader should let these things run.  If he has the stomach to let that happen, they usually run out of steam.  He is particularly fortunate, in the case of the Housing Bill, that he has Minister Danny Wallace to deal with it, because during the Electoral Bill Minister Wallace showed remarkable stamina and I think he will be more than a match for anything that can be brought up from this side of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Upton that it is a pity to see two guillotines falling on the same day.  It is getting towards Bastille Day and the French Revolution.  There is no doubt about that.  Certainly, the Housing Bill would have run its course by 4 p.m. and it should have been left to do so.</P>
      <P>May I ask the Leader of the House if he would bring to the attention of the Minister for the Environment the fact that Dublin city councillors found it necessary to march to the Department of the Environment yesterday in protest at the failure of the Department of the Environment to make any business grants available to Dublin out of the national lottery?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is an absolute insult to the city of Dublin.  Perhaps we will set up our own lottery in Dublin. This would be the way to go about it, and perhaps Senator Cosgrave might set up a lottery in Dún Laoghaire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>A joint venture.  Perhaps we would take over from the national <Col N="1728" /> lottery and allocate the money to ourselves and to the benefit of the city.</P>
      <P>May I refer also to the United States Embassy?  I have had many reports also about an unfortunate, unfriendly attitude of officials in the embassy in relation to people who are bona fides seeking holiday visas.  It is something that I certainly have not experienced last year or before.</P>

      <P>On the issue raised by Senators Cosgrave, Upton and Costello in regard to the situation at the American Embassy, I can tell Senators that I will be part of a delegation going to the embassy this morning.  I hope I will represent the views of the House.  I am sure that with goodwill all round we will get back to the type of co-operation that, in my view, is necessary for all of us to carry out our work.</P>
      <P>May I also mention that we will be sitting on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of next week and we will be dealing with the Housing Bill, the ICC Bill, the Family Planning Bill, the Higher Education (Grants) Bill and also one which is coming into the House today, which is the Foreshore (Amendment) Bill.  I am sure there will be agreement in the House to ensure that that is passed before we break for the summer recess and go off to the beaches we are trying to protect.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Leader of the House has given considerable time <Col N="1729" /> to the discussion of the Housing Bill and that we have had a change of attitude compared with the other evening when an attempt was made to bring it to a close.</P>
      <P>It is generally accepted that we are entering into the silly season in politics. This House today is entering into the farce season because we are here discussing Bills which have been put through the Dáil, knowing that the Dáil is going into recess and that the Government will not accept amendments to any of the Bills.  One such Bill is the Housing Bill which is now before the House.  I drew attention to this farce at about this time last year and it is no harm to draw attention to it again.  In the reform of the Seanad this is something which should be taken into consideration.  I fully appreciate the Minister's position, that he cannot accept amendments.  All we are doing here today is rubberstamping a Bill.</P>
      <P>I appreciate and I want to acknowledge the change of attitude on the part of the Leader of the House in allowing us to discuss the matter until 4 o'clock this afternoon, but nobody can put forward amendments.  All we can do today is speak about the housing situation and the Bill before us.  No amendments can be accepted by the Minister.  It is absolutely ridiculous and daft that year after year we put Bills through this House knowing that we cannot amend them.  One of the main functions for which the Seanad was set up is being denied to us during this week and again next week with whatever Bills are coming to us, including the Family Planning Bill, etc.  I believe a serious look should be taken at the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to take from the day we experienced yesterday when President Robinson addressed both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Most of us enjoyed her speech and found something worthwhile in it.  It was an excellent exercise.  We have, starting in the Dáil either today or tomorrow, the Adjournment debate which is generally statements on the state of the nation.  It will be interesting to hear what is said in the other House on the Adjournment debate and compare it with <Col N="1730" /> the speech we heard from President Robinson yesterday.</P>
    <P>I wonder will the Taoiseach announce some interesting figures in his address to the Dáil later on.  Very interesting figures, which are relevant to the housing situation, are that 1.4 million people are in employment in this state and 1.2 million are living on State assistance.  That is an extremely interesting figure.  It is like watching the pint going to £1 and then the pint going to £2.  Is the day fast approaching when we will have more people in the State living on State assistance than we will have in employment? Never before in the history of the State were there as many people unemployed. Will we hear the figure from the Taoiseach in the Dáil today?  Never before in the history of the State were more people living on State assistance; never before were there more homeless people in this State, and never before were as many families in need of housing.</P>
    <P>That is a serious situation.  I am sure that, with the Adjournment debate in the Dáil and an analysis of the President's speech today and over the next few days, not much attention will be paid to what is said in the House but those are the facts.  Despite what the President said yesterday and the lift which she tried to give the nation &mdash; and I am sure she will succeed in that &mdash; we have to come back to the reality of life in this State.  I am sure that for most public representatives, people count but there is a group of silent people from whom we have heard very little over the last few years, and they are the people in need of decent housing. More and more people are in need of housing.  We stopped the grants for the refurbishment of houses.  We changed the system and, with a fanfare of trumpets, brought in what was called a <i>Plan for Social Housing</i> with a former Minister announcing all these new schemes for housing which basically have not worked.</P>
    <P>We have many schemes in the <i>Plan for Social Housing</i>.  We could have had an analysis of the schemes from the Minister in his speech introducing the Bill.  I regret that he did not tell us how the schemes were operating, because I can see nothing <Col N="1731" /> in this Bill to improve the situation of those in need of housing.  What we need is the Government and the Minister responsible to look at the many families who are in need of housing.  It has reached the stage where we must take responsibility for housing out of the Department of the Environment.  We need a Minister for Housing.  Since the last election, we have seen a power struggle within the major party in Government and it is generally accepted that little or no work was done because of that power struggle.  It went on for so long that the nation was saying that the power struggle should have taken place when the party was in Opposition not in Government. They were given the responsibility to carry out the affairs of the State but, they were dealing with the problems within the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>You have moved from the subject matter of the Bill.  I would ask you to come back to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling.  I wanted to point out that many thousands of families were awaiting action on housing by the Government because the <i>Plan for Social Housing</i> is not working.  There were many families and individuals looking forward to this Housing Bill to relieve their situation and they have been looking forward to it for a number of years. We have before us a Housing Bill which will not alleviate the problems or the suffering of those people who are in need of decent housing.  I do not want to refer back to the power struggle within Fianna Fáil and I accept the Cathaoirleach's ruling on it but it is a very relevant point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very little was done regarding the housing problem since this Government was formed after the last election.  One was looking forward to the time when those difficulties would have been resolved within the major party in Government.  One thought that that had happened in February and one expected that we would see Bills coming before the Houses of the Oireachtas to deal with the problems within the State, and this is <Col N="1732" /> one of the major problems.  If a person has not a comfortable home it is a serious problem.  It is the duty of the State to ensure that every family and every individual is given the opportunity to have a home in which to live and rear their families.</P>
    <P>I cannot find a great deal in this Bill to alleviate the housing problem.  I would ask the Minister to take seriously my suggestion that we are now at the stage where we need a special Minister for Housing and to take this issue out of all the other Departments.  In the Dublin area for some years we appointed a housing co-ordinator.  There are some who would say it made no difference, but I believe it did and the facts prove it.  We were scaling down our house building programme and the list of housing applicants was dwindling, but that is not the case today.  I do not know the number of applicants for housing in the country, but in my county it is just under 2,200.  As far as I can remember and I have been on the local authority since 1965, it was never that high.</P>
    <P>There is nobody in Government making any effort to improve the situation. The greatest problem I have had to deal with is housing individuals and families, but I cannot remember the figure ever being over 2,000 applicants in County Dublin; the highest was just when 1,900 &mdash; I am speaking from memory.</P>
    <P>There are many measures I would like to see carried through but none of them is provided for in the Bill before us.  The <i>Plan for Social Housing</i> would probably have worked if everybody at whom we were aiming it was in employment and the families had a decent income, but that is not the case.  An analysis of those who applied for the shared ownership housing will show that only those who could afford it &mdash; and that was a small percentage of the applicants in the County Dublin area and I have no reason to believe that it would be different in any other part of the country &mdash; were in the higher level of the lower income bracket.  Those at the lower levels had no hope of obtaining a house in this way or <Col N="1733" /> in any of the other schemes under the <i>Plan for Social Housing.</i></P>
    <P>The Minister must have a rethink.  I would suggest that he take measures to ensure that those who have been on the housing list for some time will have a reasonable opportunity of obtaining a house in the near future.  He should also consider increasing the grant for house purchase to at least £36,000 if not £38,000.  It is ridiculous to think that the loan today for a house purchaser in any area, but particularly in the Dublin area because it is the one with which I am most familiar, is £25,000 and for a special category £2,000 is added.  The cheapest house in my area is £40,000.  The Government are completely out of touch with today's market.  That is one of the main reasons the housing list is escalating.</P>
    <P>Dublin County Council will not be able to maintain the <i>status quo</i> when it comes to the housing list this year because the number of houses being provided will not match the number of new applicants coming on the list.  The list is getting longer as the months and the weeks pass. As I said, I would like to see the Minister increase the grant from £25,000 to £38,000.  A sum of £36,000 would be a reasonable grant but to make any inroads on the housing list, it would have to be £38,000.  The grant should be increased for those obtaining their houses through the shared ownership scheme and it should be extended to the purchasers of previously occupied houses.  The grant at present is £2,000.  It should at least be doubled, if not brought to the figure of £5,000.  The grant for those building a new house on their own site should also be increased.  People in my own area have had great difficulty, even when the site is provided by the family in raising sufficient finance to erect a house on the site.  Few people in County Dublin can now provide a house on nominee sites. A problem that was always there to an extent seems to be worsening.</P>
    <P>I will give some interesting figures to the Minister, and I know that County Dublin may in certain instances be an exception.  People obtaining their house through house purchase loans in <Col N="1734" /> Dublin county last year numbered 99.  We heard Senator McGowan here yesterday say that people believed that if the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition was back in power all our housing problems would be solved.  Nobody is suggesting that but it is interesting that the last time the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition were in office in 1986, 958 people obtained houses in County Dublin through the house purchase loan scheme.  Last year the figure was 99; in 1987, 884; in 1988 &mdash; the first full year of the change of Government &mdash; 315, a significant drop.  It dropped again in 1989 to 162 and in 1990 to 82.  There was a slight rise last year to 99.  Those figures speak for themselves.</P>

      <P>I extend a sincere and warm welcome to Mayor Susan Hammer of San José, California, and the members of the San José-Dublin twinning committee.  On behalf of the Members of Seanad Éireann, I wish them a very warm welcome and hope that they enjoy their visit.</P>

      <P>You have spoken for all of us.  I am sorry a distinguished party from abroad has to listen to our mundane housing problems.  I hope they will find their visit interesting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not have to elaborate on the problems encountered by those who wish to house themselves with house purchase loans.  Along with the measures I have already suggested to the Minister, the immediate provision of finance to local authorities to enable them to get back to building houses is necessary.  We reduced the responsibility of local authorities to provide houses on lands acquired by them and to allocate them on a points system.  I can only speak for County Dublin but I have no reason to believe it is not the same in other parts of the country, with possible exceptions.  I made an attempt yesterday to find out how many houses were being built in other parts of the country and although I could not find a county that was not building any, I found a county building one house <Col N="1735" />&mdash; County Carlow.  That is the situation we have reached.  I remember a Fianna Fáil Member in this House say way back in the sixties that there was not then the price of a bag of cement to build a local authority house.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>It may have been; I was not a Member of the Oireachtas at the time.  Senator Hussey knows whom I am talking about.  We have got to that stage again and it would be appropriate to express it in the same terms.  I will give the Minister some interesting figures from my own county.  In 1986, the last year of Coalition Government of Fine Gael-Labour, just under £17 million was allocated for housing.  The output of finished houses in that year was 603.  The allocation this year is just under £2 million and it is hoped to finish 30 to 31 houses in Dublin county.  Those figures speak for themselves.  In 1987, £5.164 million was allocated and 190 houses were built.  In 1988, £2.365 million was allocated and 80 houses were built.  In 1989 just under £2 million was allocated, with an output of 29 houses.  In 1990 it was £2,300,000, with an output of 29 houses.  In 1991 it was just under £2 million, with an output of 33 houses.  We are down to 29 or 30 houses this year, an extremely serious situation for all those who do not have a decent house in which to rear their family.  While I am sure they got some satisfaction and lift from the President's address to both Houses of the Oireachtas, this morning they are back to the problem of having to provide for themselves and their families in disgraceful housing conditions.  It appears that the Government are not going to do anything to solve the problem.</P>
      <P>In relation to those figures, the Fianna Fáil speaker is going to get up and say that I have not taken account of the other schemes.  Just in case someone would hit me with that when I have finished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the Senator's colleagues might.  I could not blame him for doing it either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be a mutual admiration society between Senators Hussey and McMahon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the other schemes one might think of referring to is the shared ownership scheme.  It is estimated that in Dublin county there are 200 applicants for that scheme this year and that 100 will qualify by the end of the year and be facilitated.  The mortgage allowance scheme has attracted 18 or 20 applicants, the number of casual vacancies is estimated at around 170 and the number of houses built at 40.  I am being generous in these estimations.  That is a total of 328 people coming off a housing applicant list of 2,200.  Those are the other schemes that some of my colleagues on the other side may feel like referring to and comparing them with the figures I gave earlier.</P>
      <P>Senator McGowan went to lengths the other evening to suggest, as I understood it, that nobody had an answer to the housing problem.  That is ridiculous.  We cannot lie back and allow the situation to continue deteriorating as it has been doing over the last few years.  There was the message given in the Oireachtas only yesterday, which I am sure few will have noted except those depending on the Government to make housing provision for them.  That announcement was made by the Minister for Finance.  Of course, bigger things happened in the Oireachtas yesterday, although I am not complaining about that.  Yet it is a pity that the Minister announced that next year is going to be a harder year than any of the immediately preceding years, with cutbacks in all areas.  Is that not a lovely prospect for people crying out to be housed or to be assisted into homes by the State?  We have conferences on the environment, on waste bottles, and on womens' affairs; but I do not see many conferences on housing needs.  It is about time somebody spoke up for them and that the Government began to take heed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1737" /> I would say to Senator McGowan that in 1975 Dublin County Council finished 1,002 houses.  That was during the time of a Labour-Fine Gael Coalition Government. In 1986 we allocated £17 million and finished 603 houses under a Fine Gael-Labour Government.  In 1992 the figure is £1,979,000 and we hope to finish 30 or 31 houses.  It gives me no pleasure to give the Minister these figures and to make the comparisons I have just made. My colleagues on the other side might not believe me, but it would be more pleasurable for me to congratulate the Minister on the job the Government are doing.  I am afraid that cannot be done in relation to housing.  I ask the Minister to put it to his colleagues that it is time to appoint a Minister for Housing and to give in his reply figures for other counties as I have given for Dublin county.  Let us see how serious the situation is.  No ray of hope or light that our President might have given to the Oireachtas yesterday will alleviate the problems of people in need of housing and this Housing Bill will not do so either.</P>
    <P>Every Irish family wants to own its own house.  Those who have opted for the shared ownership scheme have said to me that they know that they are getting into a house which they can call their own but that they will never own it in their lifetime.  It is about time that we took a serious look at that scheme.  I know we are not going to get a Minister for Housing immediately, but I appeal to the Minister to make finance available so that local authorities can get back to building and allocating houses on a points system.</P>
    <P>The officials of the housing departments in both Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council do an excellent job in so far as the Oireachtas permits them.  In Dublin county sites exist in Clondalkin, Lucan, Skerries, Portrane, Balbriggan, Lusk, Rush and Mulhuddart which were developed for individual housing co-ops with all services.  All we need is money to provide the houses for the people who need them.  I appeal to the Minister to make money available to County Dublin and to other counties to meet housing needs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1738" /> I am sure if he consults local authority members throughout the country he will find that most counties would request money to go back to building local authority houses.  Let other schemes run alongside them, to be availed of by those who can go that road.  Unfortunately, 75 or 80 per cent of housing applicants in County Dublin are on social welfare and none of them can avail of the schemes under the <i>Plan for Social Housing</i>.  No schemes have been aimed at those people, so I appeal to him to make money available immediately before the list of homeless people lengthens.  It is rising weekly in this city.  One has only to go down the streets at night to meet homeless people.  Is there anybody who will say a word for them?  The Minister makes provision in the Bill for shelters and the housing of homeless people, but the finance is not available.  We can pass all the Bills we like in this House; but, whether we amend them or not, if money is not available then local authorities cannot do the job.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that I have had to give the Minister such a bad time this morning. As was said earlier today, Minister Wallace is a nice Minister to have in the Seanad and I would prefer to address my remarks to somebody whose shins I could kick more easily.  It was not easy to hit Minister Wallace with all I have hit him with this morning.  I compliment him on his patience during previous visits here in the recent past.  He put in long hours here, as all of us do, and takes criticism like a man, remaining receptive to the suggestions of the Seanad.  I hope the Minister will be receptive to the suggestions I have made this morning and will carry them to the highest level.  I hope the next Housing Bill to come before the Oireachtas will bring some relief for the many families and individuals about whom I have spoken this morning.</P>

      <P>We might all agree with those sentiments and I start where Senator McMahon finished by complimenting the Minister on his patience and endurance over the last number of weeks.  In all the Bills he has brought through this House, he has given careful consideration to suggestions put forward by Senators and I am sure he will put many of those suggestions into effect. The same will probably apply to the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1992 that we are discussing here this morning.</P>
      <P>I have listened to Senator McMahon for a long time and I agree that he made a very strong case for Dublin and highlighted the problems affecting his area. However, he conveniently omitted the fact that Dublin pays no service charges. I am sure that service charges there would yield a considerable amount of money, perhaps millions of pounds.  If we collected the money that householders in Dublin do not have to pay and which we in rural areas do, the Minister would have a much freer hand to deal with some of the other issues raised by Senator McMahon this morning.</P>
      <P>I welcome this important legislation.  It provides the legislative framework and authority for the housing policies that were spelled out in the <i>Plan for Social Housing</i> earlier in the year.  It restates the broad and long established objectives of the Government's housing policy which is to ensure that every household has a dwelling suitable to its needs, located in an acceptable environment and at a price or rent the household can afford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The <i>Plan for Social Housing</i> that has been discussed so ably by all Senators is new and should be welcomed.  Senator McMahon blamed the power struggle within Fianna Fáil for some of the problems we are faced with.  I do not accept that and I am sure the Senator is merely making a political point because Fianna Fáil always promoted the building of houses whether in the private sector or by the local authority and have always been prepared to come up with new housing ideas, even though those ideas may <Col N="1740" /> not always have been popular.  They were prepared to promote them nonetheless because they felt they were in the best interests of the people and that by doing so they would enable many people to obtain housing who might not otherwise have been able to do so.</P>
    <P>The range of innovative measures included in the plan is designed to provide a broader, more diverse response to social housing needs, to ease the path to home ownership for households of modest means and to improve the position of tenants in both the local authority and private rented sectors.  There are many ways by which people can be assisted to provide their own house and I know that some local authorities are pushing this scheme and making progress, but others are not doing so well.  I hope that the Minister in the not too distant future will take up this matter with the local authorities who are not promoting the scheme to find out why.</P>
    <P>This plan offers various options to applicants and there is no reason they should not share housing costs with local authorities.  I have always suggested, even before this plan came into operation, that where second hand houses become available in towns local authorities should by them and refurbish them.  That would be a cheaper option than providing a house under the traditional system.</P>
    <P>The cost of providing a local authority house runs to something like £42,000 and every local authority house built is subsidised to the tune of £85 per week by the taxpayer.  That cannot be allowed to continue; the era of free lunches is over. There is no reason the Government should not consider other ideas.  The State cannot continue making presents of houses to people at a cost of £42,000 without analysing the situation and finding the cheapest way of providing housing. If the <i>Plan for Social Housing</i> is operated properly ways will be found of providing houses for tenants at a much cheaper rate than the traditional building system.</P>
    <P>In the course of my canvass for local and other elections in housing estates I <Col N="1741" /> noticed that estates are being allowed to run down.  Some responsibility should be placed on houseowners who have received local authority houses to be responsible for the maintenance of the house.  They should be made responsible for the fixing of doors and windows, for painting and so on.  It is a tragedy that that was not insisted upon in the past; beautiful estates have been allowed to run down.  When I or other councillors knock on doors looking for votes the first thing we are told is that a broken back door has been reported to the local authority, and that no one has come to fix it or that the range is broken and no one has come to fix that either.  The responsibility should be placed on the tenants do to that kind of work because the cost would not be significant.</P>
    <P>Housing estates built in the past were too large; it would be better to confine estates to about 20 houses making upkeep easier.  Residents' associations which should be established on all estates should be given some responsibility as regards estate maintenance.  This would give people a pride in their houses and in their estates and residents' associations could be very effective in that area.</P>
    <P>Halting sites for travellers has been a contentious problem over the years.  I would like to see more halting sites built in areas where there is a need for them, such as County Galway.  We have done much in County Galway for the travelling people and there is still much to be done. Where halting sites are provided no traveller should get a house until they have spent at least two years on a halting site; this would prepare travellers for house ownership.  Sometimes we blame travellers for treating houses badly but often they have had no experience of running or maintaining a house.  A two year period in a halting site would be a good training time before being given the keys to a local authority house.  A back-up service should be provided by a social worker and by people who would maintain and keep the halting sites tidy to make sure that the site was properly kept and to help travelling people to learn <Col N="1742" /> respect for a house.  It is not just a house but a home and should be treated as such.</P>
    <P>Great play has been made about the home improvement grants.  I would like to see some kind of a home improvement grant introduced at the earliest possible opportunity.  I do not want to see a scheme like the 1985 one referred to by Senator McMahon, which cost approximately £260 million.  That scheme gave very generous grants to people who did not need them.  I would have reservations about a grant scheme which provided such generous handouts of taxpayers' money for what might be non-essential work.  The vast sums of money required by the 1985 house improvement grant scheme severely restricted the resources which could be devoted to other necessary purposes across the entire housing area.  That has definitely put a drain on the resources of the Department of the Environment since then because they are still paying out the grants to which that Government committed themselves during the 1985-87 period.</P>
    <P>I know a grant scheme would encourage people to fix up their own homes.  It is surprising what a small grant can do. If a person knows he will get a grant for the installation of doors or windows or for fixing a leak in the roof, he will do it. It generates employment and gives some work to the builders' supplier and so on. I would certainly like to see that scheme reintroduced, if possible.</P>
    <P>The essential repair grant scheme administered by the local authorities is a very good scheme.  Unfortunately, there is not enough money there to go around. I would like to see more money provided under that scheme because it is far better to give money for a scheme such as that and for people to do up their own homes rather than to provide mobile homes or prefabs.  These are not a good idea because after nine or ten years they deteriorate to such an extent that they become dangerous to live in.</P>
    <P>In every local authority area there are a number of sites lying idle for a number of years which have not been availed of. In the bigger centres they will eventually be built on, but in small towns many of <Col N="1743" /> those sites could be sold off to private people to build their own homes on.  I think there is something in the social plan that allows that to happen.  Local authorities should proceed with the sale of those sites to people in small towns or villages who are prepared to build on them and that people should be provided with those sites of a modest charge.</P>
    <P>Criticism has been made of us here today because this Bill is being guillotined. I do not think we have any reason to worry about that, because there were 17 amendments to this Bill in the other House and any useful change that could be made has already been made.  I have no fear of this Bill going through as it is here today.  I have every confidence in the Minister and the Government tackling the housing problems with the resources and manpower they have.  I believe that we will see a vast change in the housing needs of this country when we see this <i>Plan for Social Housing</i> implemented by all the local authorities and pushed forward by them with dedication and commitment.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that happens.  I see this plan as a means for which people can get their own houses at a much cheaper cost to the taxpayer than the £42,000 per house it is costing local authorities at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I would like to thank all the Senators who participated in this very interesting debate.  Housing is, of course, a matter of great interest to all public representatives.  I have listened attentively to the various issues which were raised during the course of the debate and I will attempt to address these as positively and constructively as possible during the course of my reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Senators &mdash; including, I am glad to say, Senator Brendan Ryan &mdash; have welcomed the broad thrust of the new measures in the <i>Plan for Social Housing</i> and the Bill.  I must say I agree with the sentiment that if we had these measures in effect some 20 or 30 years <Col N="1744" /> ago we would not be faced with many of the social problems which are of great concern to us all in the 1990s.  The day of the large scale local authority housing estates is gone &mdash; for good social and economic reasons &mdash; and it is obvious that most Senators agree that we need new more sensitive approaches to meeting social housing needs.  We need a multifaceted response to the housing needs of those who cannot afford to house themselves by conventional means instead of the one track policy of the past.</P>
    <P>It is depressing to hear Senator Naughten harking back to the old ways.  Shovel the money out to local authorities and they will do the job as they have done for decades &mdash; that was his message. However, it is a message that ignores fundamental changes &mdash; changes in social patterns, changes in the nature of the housing problem, changes in the economic context in which we must operate. It ignores the lessons of past experience and what is happening in other countries. On reflection, and having listened to this debate, I would hope that Senator Naughten would agree that the problems of the present and the future need something more than the outdated solutions of the past.</P>
    <P>Contrary to what was suggested by a number of Senators, the extent of real housing needs is not being underestimated by the Government; nor am I going to deny that needs have been increasing over the past couple of years. The latest statutory assessments carried out by local authorities in March 1991 indicate that some 23,200 households have been approved for local authority housing.  Even though this represents an increase of approximately 20 per cent over the 19,400 households recorded in 1989, it is still substantially lower than the 30,000 households which were on the housing waiting lists in the early 1980s. It is worth noting that of the total need of 23,200, 6,700 are one person households and another 2,800 are couples without children.  A full analysis of needs has been published in my Department's 1991 annual housing bulletin &mdash; indeed <Col N="1745" /> Senator Brendan Ryan quoted directly from this bulletin.</P>
    <P>I think public representatives should resist the political temptation to exaggerate the extent of real housing needs.  It is not responsible to paint an unjustifiably black picture of housing prospects. Indeed, it is a disservice to those in genuine need.  I believe that they would be better served acknowledging the opportunities presented by the new measures under the <i>Plan for Social Housing</i> and encouraging people to make maximum use of them.</P>
    <P>There was criticism from some Senators over the lack of resources to implement the <i>Plan for Social Housing</i>, stating that there was inadequate funding which will result in the non-achievement of its objectives.  Such criticism is not accurate.  The true position is that substantially increased funding has been made available in the plan.  The overall 1992 capital provision for housing, including Exchequer and non-Exchequer resources will be some £158 million in 1992, an increase of one-third on last year's expenditure.  The Exchequer's contribution to this will be some £78 million compared with £51 million in 1990. This substantial increase on the 1991 provision is mainly attributable to the increased take-up of the various new housing measures and especially the shared ownership scheme.</P>
    <P>A provision of £35 million has been made to cover the capital funding requirements of this scheme in 1992.  The allocation for the provision of local authority housing is £41 million in 1992 compared with £33 million in 1990, while that for the remedial work scheme, including the provision of bathrooms, has increased from £15 million to £18 million during the same period.  In addition, the provision for voluntary housing has increased from £9 million to £11 million with a further £5 million being made available for the rental subsidy scheme with allocations in 1992 for the improvement works-in-lieu scheme.  The provision of sites scheme and the mortgage allowance scheme totalling £4.4 million did not exist in 1990.  That these allocations <Col N="1746" /> have been made available during a very difficult period for Government finances is a clear demonstration of our commitment to the social housing needs of the people.</P>
    <P>Senator Naughten was critical of the shared ownership system and suggested that people would never own their own houses under the system.  The shared ownership system is designed to enable low income households to get into the first rung of the house ownership ladder. It does not purport to be a solution to all housing needs.  It is one element &mdash; albeit an important element &mdash; in the full range of measures contained in the Social Housing Plan, and in this Bill, which are designed to meet all categories of housing need from the very lowest income groups to those on the margins of home ownership.</P>
    <P>It is wrong, therefore, to criticise the shared ownership system on the basis that it will not meet all housing needs.  It was never claimed that it would.  However, shared ownership is, I believe, a welcome addition to the range of housing options available to low income households and should be welcomed as such.  Indeed, I suggest that if we had not introduced a shared ownership system we would be criticised for failing to introduce a scheme which has worked elsewhere by the same Senators who now criticise us for introducing this measure.</P>
    <P>Senator Naughten is of the view that shared ownership had little or no application in his area, being a rural one.  Yet, Senator Ó Cuív said that the scheme was particularly effective in rural situations where, for example, the applicant would have a site available.  I believe Senator Ó Cuív is right and perhaps Senator Naughten might benefit from taking a look at how the scheme is operating in the neighbouring county.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Cuív was concerned that the indexation of the unpurchased equity by reference to consumer price indexation would be a disincentive to persons availing of the shared ownership system.  It must not be overlooked, however, that the authority must borrow the money to buy the house in the first instance and <Col N="1747" /> must pay interest on their outstanding borrowings until they clear their debt when the buy-out of the lease is completed by the shared owner.  Therefore, the buy-out cost of any equity during the lease period could be frozen at its initial value only if the shared-owner's rent payments were high enough to cover the housing authority's borrowing costs in full.  This would increase the outgoings on the house to an extent that would make shared ownership no longer viable.</P>
    <P>Indexation does not mean that the buy-out cost remains the same in real terms or in terms of value of money.  On the other hand, a person who cannot start to purchase, is entirely at the mercy of the property market which can prove much more volatile than general inflation.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Cuív raised the question of the £10,000 cost limit for improvement works-in-lieu of rehousing in so far as it applies to islands.  Of course, I acknowledge that building costs are higher on the islands, and indeed this fact has been recognised in loan and grant limits over the years.  I will, therefore, look at what can be done to provide a more appropriate cost guideline for this scheme in the case of works that are being carried out on the offshore islands.</P>
    <P>Senators Ó Cuív and Naughten also referred to difficulties associated with the need to have fully registered ownership for the purposes of the improvement works-in-lieu scheme.  To address this problem, section 5 has now been amended to remove the statutory requirement for a housing authority to take a mortgage in every case and to provide that such a mortgage may be registered without the need for the putative owner to be registered as the owner.  I hope this amendment meets the concerns expressed by the Senators and that it will remove an obstacle to making full use of this widely welcomed scheme.</P>
    <P>I will look into Senators Neville's and Foley's contention that this scheme is proving impractical because of insistence on overly demanding standards in relation to houses.  While, obviously, household's requirements cannot be <Col N="1748" /> regarded as being met unless the accommodation provided is of a decent standard, I would not like to see an excessively fussy approach inhibiting the sensible operation of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I was somewhat perplexed with Senator Naughten decrying a greater role for voluntary housing organisations and then he going on to praise the very good work achieved by the rural housing organisation in providing good quality accommodation in co-operation with the local authorities.  In fact, the essence of this Bill and of the <i>Plan for Social Housing</i> is to secure greater co-operation between local authorities and voluntary housing organisations, indeed the very type of policy that is well exemplified by the RHO in the early 1980s and more recently by organisations such as Respond, which is based in Waterford but is now carrying out new housing developments throughout the country including, I am glad to say, in Cork, where Respond have plans for a 38-house project in Douglas.</P>
    <P>The new rental subsidy scheme will increase the provision of accommodation by the voluntary sector this year and I am satisfied that the enhanced role for voluntary bodies envisaged in the <i>Plan for Social Housing</i> is appropriate.  The involvement of the voluntary sector is essential if we are going to deliver a balanced and flexible response to housing needs and to benefit all the resources, both human and financial, that are available to help meet this objective.</P>
    <P>Senators McGowan and Hussey also referred to the high cost of maintenance and management of local authority housing and suggested that tenants might be made fully responsible for the maintenancy of their dwellings.  It would represent a fundamental departure from the norms of landlord-tenant relationships to make tenants fully responsible for maintenance. I doubt if it is a practical proposition while the local authority remains the owner and the the tenant just that &mdash; a tenant.  Look, for example, at the difficulties that would arise in the case of flats.  If the tenant fails to maintain, is a publicly funded asset to be allowed to <Col N="1749" /> depreciate rapidly?  Is the tenant who maintains to be charged a different rent to the tenant who does not?  I am glad to say section 9 of the Bill recognises the potential for group tenant participation in the running of their estates, by enabling local authorities to delegate responsibility for maintenance and management to properly constituted tenant groups.  I believe the direct involvement of tenants in this way will bring about an improvement in the maintenance and management of local authority housing.</P>
    <P>Senator Naughten professes not to see the difference between the rental subsidy scheme and the direct provision of local authority housing.  There are, however, a number of significant differences.  First, the voluntary movement have a record of providing housing at very competitive prices.  Secondly, it is providing a means for people to help themselves, rather than waiting for others to do it for them. Thirdly, it will promote greater tenant involvement and a more positive attitude by tenants to the maintenance of their housing.</P>
    <P>The accommodation of travelling people was raised by a number of Senators.  It is important that I should again outline the reasons for the inclusion of section 10 in the Bill.  Section 10 is a measure designed to help solve the accommodation problem of travellers, not to penalise them.  I would ask Senator Naughten to note that it is not the policy of the Department, or of myself, to force travellers into permanent housing.  We respect the preference of most travellers for a mobile way of life.  That is why the major policy emphasis has, for some years, been on the provision of accommodation for caravans, to ensure that travellers do not have to suffer the deprivations of life on the roadside.  An annual capital allocation of £3 million has been made for the purpose in recent years.</P>
    <P>Although funding has not been, or will not, be a problem progress on the provision of halting sites has not been as good as I or my predecessors would have liked; the main reason is the opposition of the settled community to the location of new sites.  Some of this opposition has <Col N="1750" /> come about because some travellers are inclined to remain parked on the roadside in the vicinity of serviced sites that have been provided for them.  Section 10 of the Bill gives local authorities power to deal with these cases in order to reduce the potential of the sort of local opposition to which I have already referred; it is not designed to penalise travellers.  It is there to help travellers in general by allowing local authorities to take action to resolve a problem that creates unnecessary conflict, hindering the authorities settlement programme and ultimately reduces the prospect of all travellers getting adequate and satisfactory accommodation.</P>
    <P>There has also to be a balance between the needs and wishes of travellers and the interests of the rest of the community.  It is not unreasonable to expect travellers to make use of halting sites that have been provided to a very high standard with good amenities at considerable expense to the taxpayer and effort of the local authority.  Parking instead on public roads or other public areas causes dangers to traffic, damage to amenities and other problems, especially when large numbers congregate.</P>
    <P>Finally, I again want to emphasise that this scheme only gives the local authority power to act where there is a vacant berth on an official halting site in which the temporary dwelling concerned could be accommodated.  It is by no means a draconian power: it can only be used in very well defined circumstances.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan referred to the travellers' situation in Cork.  In my opinion, the people who have caused problems recently in the Cork area could not be regarded as ordinary travelling families.  It is obvious to any observer that these are substantial traders with considerable resources.  Local communities should not have to tolerate the destruction caused by the arrival of convoys of large caravans and vehicles parked indiscriminately without regard to the safety of the general public.</P>

      <P>These activities make it much more difficult to successfully tackle and meet the needs of the ordinary travelling people.

      <P>I want to pay tribute here particularly to the people in Cork because they have responded very positively in taking their share and facing up to the needs of the travelling community, as Cork Corporation and county council are about to do.  Unfortunately, far too often, I have personal experience of people being penalised for that.  We have obligations and I want to make a strong appeal to all local authorities to face up to their responsibilities.  These people are human beings and they must be treated as such. Far too often it comes across that some local authorities are not facing up to their responsibilities.  This is not fair to those who have done so.  I would make a strong appeal to the councillors in local areas to take this on board.  If we do we will be making strong inroads into dealing with this serious problem.</P>

      <P>Senator Brendan Ryan expressed concern that the provisions of section 26 of the Bill might allow local authorities to sell tenanted houses to voluntary organisations without the consent of the tenants.  I want to make two points about this.  First, the sale of a local authority house or flat, whether tenanted or not, to an approved voluntary housing body is subject to a resolution of the elected members of the housing authority who will be aware of the views of, and represent, the tenants.  Second, the question of tenant consent to the transfer of a local authority house to an approved body is specifically provided for as a matter which may be covered by regulations. Clearly, consideration will have <Col N="1752" /> to be given by the Minister to the question of tenant consent and the manner in which it is to be obtained.</P>
      <P>Senator Brendan Ryan also referred to the overall level of new housebuilding. The number of new houses built annually declined each year between 1981 and 1988.  In 1988, only 15,700 new houses were completed.  Since then, housing output has increased to a total of 20,000 per annum.  In fact, on the basis of available indicators, I would expect new house completions in 1992 to be over the 20,000 mark.  There is no reason to believe that the current level of overall housing output is inadequate.  In fact, it will exceed the projected housing requirements contained in the NESC report, <i>A Review of Housing Policy.</i></P>
      <P>Senator Naughen felt that the social housing plan and this Bill are transferring power from local authorities.  I would see it as the opposite.  The operation of the whole range of new measures was devolved to local authorities from day one.  Local authorities now have an incomparably better set of tools with which to tackle the housing problems of their areas than ever before.  They retain their traditional functions but they can now be complemented by new powers. As I said in my opening speech, their role has changed fundamentally but it has certainly not diminished.  Surely, it is good that local authorities can promote voluntary and co-operative effort in housing as an alternative to local authority housing.  It is better to foster a spirit of self-help than dependency.</P>
      <P>Senator McGowan suggested involving the elected members in securing the implementation of the new measures in the social housing plan.  I agree that councillors have a vital contribution to make to the success of the plan.  They can do much to inform public attitudes and to help spread an understanding of the range of new measures available to meet housing needs.  Indeed, they have a responsibility to ensure that their own authority makes full use of the measures and resources available to meet the housing needs of their area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1753" /> I think it is particularly irresponsible for politicians, at national or local level, to attempt to undermine the new measures, often without even taking the trouble to understand them properly. There is an onus on all of us as public representatives to seek to make the best of the various measures available to improve housing conditions.</P>
    <P>It is not correct to say, as Senator Naughten did, that the £2,000 new house grant was a thing of the past because of the tax clearance requirements associated with the grant.  I would like to point out that the Government are providing £9 million to pay 4,500 new house grants in 1992, which hardly suggests that these grants are &ldquo;a thing of the past&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The tax clearance requirement is reasonable and is consistent with the policy of successive Governments to ensure that public funds do not go to those who are not paying their due taxes. This is a device to counteract the black economy.  There is no intention of trying to deprive legitimate first time house purchasers of the grant.  I sincerely hope that the Fine Gael Party do not condone black economy operations which have been the scourge of the building industry in the past.</P>

      <P>Senator Naughten said it was a disastrous decision to abolish the house improvement grant scheme brought in by the last Fine Gael-Labour Government; even though this scheme only came into effect very late in 1985, it was terminated in early 1987 and it had cost the taxpayer over £200 million. When it was abolished applications were still coming in at the rate of £5 million a month.  The scheme was poorly focused and open-ended and expenditure arising from it could neither be predicted nor controlled.  It gave large handouts of taxpayer's money to individuals, regardless <Col N="1754" /> of their means and in respect of often inessential or cosmetic works.  Neither did it halt the decline in construction employment which was a hallmark of that Government's period in office.  The 1985 grants scheme squandered the lion's share of the money available for housing over a number of years, money that could have been put to far better use in other ways.  When Senators in Fine Gael and the Labour Party question the adequacy of funds provided for social housing, they cannot ignore the legacy of commitments they left behind them and which has taken five years to pay out.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;having regard to the Government's policy of keeping interest rates as low as possible.  In the past many who had to borrow when rates were high and fixed for the life of the loan were at a disadvantage when rates declined, as they have done recently.  All in all, I believe that the reintroduction of fixed rates could give rise to a similar situation in the future.  The local authority rate is set at the lowest prevailing building society rate, that is, 10.75 per cent from 1 July 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McGowan suggested that local authorities should borrow money for local authority housing from the European Investment Bank.  I am afraid this <Col N="1755" /> is not a solution.  When the Exchequer provides capital for the local authority housing programme this is now done by way of a capital grant and no repayments or interest charges fall to be met by the local authorities.  The full cost of borrowing this money is met by the Exchequer &mdash; in other words, by the general taxpayer.  Our basic economic difficulties derive in large measure from previous borrowings and the extent to which servicing these debts absorbs funds which could otherwise be used to provide badly needed new investment in key areas such as housing.</P>
    <P>Borrowing from the European Investment Bank provides no answer.  Such debt would still have to be serviced and repaid and, as the Senator knows, the rent received from the houses, after taking account of the maintenance and management costs, would make little or no impression on servicing the loan.</P>
    <P>Senator Naughten referred to the rural resettlement organisation and I am pleased to be able to inform Senators that I will be meeting with Mr. Jim Connolly, the founder of that organisation, this evening.  Many of the schemes dealt with in the Bill, such as shared ownership, the mortgage allowance scheme and the improvement works in lieu, are, I believe, potentially beneficial to many of <Col N="1756" /> the households who are relocating to the western counties with the help of the rural resettlement organisation.  The mortgage subsidy scheme, in particular, will provide a subsidy of up to £3,300 spread over five years to assist persons leaving local authority housing and acquiring their own home with the aid of a mortgage loan.  In fact, most of the new measures are available to persons leaving local authority housing even if they are moving to a different part of the country.</P>
    <P>Senator McMahon regrets that circumstances do not allow amendments to the Bill to be accepted in this House.  I would not agree with him that this makes the debate futile.  The Bill provides the broad framework for the various schemes and the points made by Senators will certainly be taken on board when drafting the detailed regulations.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like once again to thank the Senators who participated in this debate.  I think I have covered the main issues that were raised.  It would be inappropriate in a debate like this to go into the housing position in each local authority area.  The House will get down to the nuts and bolts of the Bill on Committee Stage and there will be an opportunity for Senators to dwell in more detail on the individual provisions of the Bill.</P>

      <P>In page 4, line 1, after &ldquo;person&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or the ascertainment of the contents of the postal packet without opening it (by electronic means or otherwise)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is a repetition of a Committee Stage amendment.  We have tabled it again because the Minister promised to come back to us on it.  He said he would consider the general principle behind it.  Essentially we are trying to make provision for a set of circumstances where, by using appropriate imaging technology, it is possible to ascertain the contents of a letter without opening the envelope.  There are many methods of doing that and these methods are used in many areas of life, for example in medicine through imaging, ultra sound, etc., and in criminal investigations. It is possible to see what is going on at the other side of the wall if one uses the appropriate technology.  I await the Minister's response and I hope he will accept the idea behind the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I undertook to do on Committee Stage, I considered this question in the interim.  First, amending the definition of &ldquo;interception&rdquo; in section 1 of this Bill as proposed in amendment No. 1 would in itself achieve nothing because what the Bill does is to regulate the power of the Minister for Justice to authorise interceptions.  It is section 84 of the 1983 Act that contains the prohibition of the opening, etc., of postal packets. Amendment No. 1, therefore, would prohibit nothing.</P>
      <P>Even amendment No. 17 to section 84 of the 1983 Act will achieve nothing as far as this Bill is concerned.  The amendment could, solely in the context of the 1983 Act, make it an offence to ascertain the contents of a postal package without opening it.  That is as far as it would go because of the definition of interception in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (a) (ii) of the definition limits the meaning of interception for the purposes of the powers of the Minister for Justice under this Bill to interceptions that, apart from a direction by the Minister for Communications to An Post under section 110 of the 1983 Act, would <Col N="1759" /> constitute an offence of unlawful interception under that Act.</P>
    <P>The way in which the power of the Minister for Communications to issue such a direction is related to the power of the Minister for Justice to issue a warrant for interception is covered in section 3.  The effect of paragraph (a) (ii) of the definition of interception is to exclude from the Bill interceptions which would not in any case require a direction by the Minister for Communications and hence a warrant by the Minister for Justice. An example would be the opening of an undeliverable letter.</P>
    <P>The effect of what I have just said is that the amendments, as proposed, would be outside the scope of this Bill. The implications of the amendment would be for the 1983 Act and would more properly fall to be considered in that context.  For any such amendment to have an effect on this Bill, it would have to be inserted into the 1983 Act in such a way as either to relate to directions by the Minister for Communications or to amend a substantive law as to privacy generally in relation to postal packets. There is no occasion to amend the law in either of those ways.</P>
    <P>Finally, interception of a postal packet means more than just opening it.  It also means delaying or obtaining the postal packet.  The person to whom the warrant is addressed could properly delay or detain a postal packet for a reasonable period if this was necessary in order to comply with the warrant, but anybody else who delayed or detained it would be guilty of an offence under section 84 of the 1983 Act unless the case fell within one of the exceptions provided for in that Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that it is possible to scan the contents of a letter using appropriate technology and to be within the law; this appears to be a relatively minor offence.  I thought the purpose behind this Bill was to exclude the possibility of that happening.  There seems to be a way round what the Bill sets out to <Col N="1760" /> do.  I wonder if this Bill is a mirage, a Bill by mirrors almost.</P>

      <P>In page 4, line 14, after &ldquo;of&rdquo; where it secondly occurs, to insert &ldquo;the contents or existence of&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to make illegal the recording of the sequence of telephone numbers which are dialled.  While that may not be as good as telephone tapping, if one knows the numbers dialled, it provides very useful information and violates an individuals privacy.  We are seeking to outlaw that except in the circumstances provided for in the Bill.  It is like having access to somebody's diary.  If you know the names and the telephone numbers in a diary or have access to the numbers dialled on a particular phone, they will tell you quite a lot of private information about the individual.  It should not be possible to obtain that information under the provisions of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I said on Committee Stage that this amendment might not be necessary. Having examined it further, I can confirm that it is unnecessary and in any case, as submitted, it would not achieve the desired objective.</P>
      <P>Any amendments that may have been necessary to achieve the objectives of the amendment would have to be made not to the definition of &ldquo;interception&rdquo; in section 1 of this Bill, but to that of &ldquo;interception&rdquo; in section 98 (b) of the 1983 Act as that subsection is to be replaced under section 13 (3) of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is section 98 that creates the offence of unauthorised interception.  What the Bill does is regulate the power of the Minister for Justice to authorise interception. Therefore the amendment would prohibit nothing.  Indeed, in principle the points made in the debate in regard to amendments Nos. 1 and 17 about the definition of &ldquo;interception&rdquo; as it relates to postal packets could also be <Col N="1761" /> made on this amendment as it relates to telecommunications.</P>
    <P>The amendment refers to two matters: firstly, the contents of a telecommunications message and, secondly the existence of such a message.  I will deal with these separately.  Take the first, that is, the contents.  Under section 98 of the 1983 Act as it is to be amended by section 13 (3) of this Bill, it will be an offence to intercept a telecommunications message and intercept will mean listening to or recording the message &ldquo;in the course of its transmission&rdquo; that is to say between the point where the words are spoken by one party to the conversation and the point where they are heard by the other party.  The Bill is not concerned with listening in without mechanical means to other people's telephone conversations any more than it is concerned with ordinary eavesdropping on conversations not carried on by telephone.</P>
    <P>It is important to bear in mind that the scope of the offence is in any case limited, as I have mentioned.  I see no reason to extend the scope, and since the amendment is not related to section 98 of the Act the amendment would not have any effect.  Moreover, even if a similar amendment were put down to section 98, this would still make no difference.  Both provisions speak of listening to or recording &ldquo;a telecommunications message&rdquo;. The amendment merely changes this to listening to or recording &ldquo;the contents of&rdquo; such a message.  This amounts to the same thing, in my opinion.</P>
    <P>The other matter to which the amendment relates is the existence of a telecommunications message.  What I have just said applies generally to the question of existence also except, of course, that there is no question of listening to its existence.  That would be a nonsense. In particular, the offence of recording a message applies only to doing so &ldquo;in the course of its transmission&rdquo; in the sense that I have mentioned.  The question of recording in other ways the fact that telecommunications messages took place &mdash; that is, metering, is dealt with in the new subsection (2) (a) which is to be inserted <Col N="1762" /> in section 98 of the 1983 Act by section 13 (2) of this Bill.  Metering consists of the use of a device which registers the numbers dialled on a particular telephone and the time and duration of each call.  This process is mainly used by Bord Telecom for the purpose of ensuring that subscribers are correctly charged, but the information obtained from it is on occasion disclosed to the Garda to assist them in criminal investigation.</P>
    <P>Section 13 (2) puts the disclosure of metering information and any other information relating to the use of the telecommunications service on a statutory basis.  In the normal way, to disclose such information will be an offence again very much in keeping with the apparent intent of the amendment.  There are exceptions, which are set out in section 13.  It will be noted that these include (1) for the prevention or detection of crime or for the purpose of any criminal proceedings and (2) in the interests of the security of the State.</P>
    <P>To sum up, therefore, the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act as to be amended by this Bill prohibits the disclosure of a telecommunications message which has been intercepted without authority in the course of its transmission. To go further would be outside the scope of this Bill.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;or</P>
      <P>(c)  an act&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  that consists of the use of apparatus for wireless telegraphy (within the meaning of the Wireless Telegraphy Acts, 1926 to 1988) or any other device, to record a spoken communication between persons, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1763" /> (ii)  that, if done otherwise than in pursuance of an authorisation, constitues an offence under section 2A of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926 (inserted by section 2),&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is another amendment the Minister promised to have a look at.  It is a very important amendment.  It deals with the bugging of personal conversations and also, to some extent, the recording of telephone conversations without the consent or awareness of one of the people making the call.  It is very important that some control should now be introduced in relation to people's capacity to bug conversations.  I dwelt on this at some length on Committee Stage.  These phenomena seem to occur primarily in the business world where people who are involved in business dealings seem to feel in some circumstances that it is necessary to record conversations.  That is done most of the time without the awareness or knowledge of one of the parties.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable that it should be possible for somebody to record a telephone conversation by simply pressing a button.  There are people, including myself, who make remarks they would not want taken out of context and perhaps transmitted verbatim.  They would not want a recording of their remarks made available to outsiders not involved in the conversation.  These remarks are made on the understanding that they will not be recorded.  There is quite a sharp difference between this type of activity and an exchange of letters.  When people write to one another it is done on the basis that the written word remains.  I do not see any problem where conversations are held on the basis that that they are being recorded.  Sometimes that happends in the case of press interviews. The journalist asks if one minds if the conversation is recorded.  One makes one's comments in the context of the interview being recorded and transcripts being used and so on.  Other than that, recording should not be allowed and it is very important that some move should now be made to prohibit it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1764" /> I understand that in some of the states of the United States there is a restriction on the recording of telephone conservations using answering machines.  I am not quite sure what the situation is in relation to the use of bugging devices. There have been a number of unsavoury incidents in relation to this matter in this country.  I do not want to dwell on them at this stage.  I also understand that there have been quite a number of these incidents in the business world as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. We should have controls in the area of recording conversations.  Industrial espionage has now been developed to a fine art.  Most people are aware of this but it is not often discussed.  There should be some controls over interfering with what most people regard as a private conversation.  For a third party to have access to that without the knowledge of one of the persons involved is unacceptable. I support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to comment in relation to the unfair advantage some people have in business as a result of using these types of devices.  I made the suggestion last week that the fax machine was an efficient way to conduct business. As far as I can ascertain it is practically impossible for a fax machine to be interfered with in any way.  The only way I could find was if a camera were to be positioned over a fax machine the messages could be recorded and the information could be transmitted or videotaped and held for future viewing. That augurs well for fax machines.  They should be used as much as possible, particularly in the world of business and in relation to matters pertaining to the Stock Exchange where financial deals involving enormous sums of money are transacted on a daily basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to close off the loopholes in the bugging of information, chief executives could carry on conversations on fax machines without anyone knowing the content of them.  They would be relayed at practically the same speed as one <Col N="1765" /> would carry on a conversation on one's telephone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Cassidy has made a very interesting point.  He is right to be concerned about the fax machine.  As we all know, the fax machine is a marvellous invention and the possession of such a machine is practically a <i>sine qua non</i> for any successful business or professional operator.  It has facilitated things we did not envisage when the machine was invented &mdash; for example, the Government's programme of decentralisation has been made much easier.  It was facilitated by the existence of such devices as the fax machine.</P>
      <P>As Senator Cassidy has rightly said, it is not technically possible to extrapolate information from a fax machine unless one had a camera, which would presumably be hidden in the immediate vicinity of the machine.  In relation to the installation of that type of device without the consent of the owner of the fax machine, I will deal with that in my reply.</P>
      <P>The amendments in the name of Senator Upton replace an amendment on Committee Stage which I undertook to have another look at.  While these amendments are more detailed than the Committee Stage amendments, they essentially attempt to achieve the same result, that is, to introduce into this Bill the concept of making it an offence to eavesdrop on people's conversations by means of any type of device, whether or not attached to a telephone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the amendments could relate to telephone conversations, the intent of the amendments would be covered in section 98 of the 1983 Act, which prohibits interception of telecommunications. However, the definition of &ldquo;interception&rdquo; in that Act is being amended in this Bill to make it clear that &ldquo;interception&rdquo; means interception of the message in the course of its transmission and also that interception is not illegal where either the person on whose behalf the message is transmitted or the person intended to receive the message has consented to the listening or recording.  The Senator was concerned about that <Col N="1766" /> matter, but that is the legal position.  That this is entirely reasonable is clear when it is considered that section 98 (2) of the 1983 Act allows, for example, for interception by the Garda of a complaint by a person receiving calls of &ldquo;an obscene, menacing or similar character&rdquo;.  This provision would not cover, for example, calls involving fraudulent proposals or false pretences where one of the parties to such calls might wish to have them listened to by the Garda.  The revised definition of &ldquo;interception&rdquo; closes off that weakness.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the subject of devices and telephones, I would mention that under section 98 (4) (a) of the 1983 Act the Minister for Communications may make regulations prohibiting the provision or operation of overhearing facilities in relation to any apparatus connected to the Bord Telecom network otherwise than in accordance with such conditions as he or she considers to be reasonable and prescribes in the regulations. My understanding is that those regulations have not yet been made.  Perhaps now would be the time to consider making them.</P>
    <P>With regards to other forms of bugs and devices used to monitor conversations, as I said, under no stretch of the imagination could they be classified as postal packets or telecommunications and are, therefore, outside the strict scope of this Bill.  However, even if they were within the scope of this Bill I could not undertake to deal with the subject in this Bill as to do so would delay the Bill further to an unacceptable extent. Despite the additional material introduced in these new amendments, they do not by any stretch of the imagination cover all the types of situations that would need to be covered.  One would have to set out clearly what type of behaviour it was intended to criminalise.  There would be exceptions &mdash; for example, to catch a blackmailer.  There would have to be provisions relating to who could use such eavesdropping devices and who could not use them; in what circumstances they could be used; their use by the Garda in the investigation of a crime; various definitions and so on.  In <Col N="1767" /> fact, the subject would warrant a Bill of its own if it were ever decided to tackle it legislatively.</P>
    <P>While there is no suitable statute law controlling the use or abuse of bugging devices, the circumstances in which they are used &mdash; for example, if trespass were involved, or if the information were used, for example, in blackmail &mdash; could give rise to litigation.  The constitutional right to privacy with regard to telephone conversations has been dealt with in the Kennedy-Arnold case and it could well be that what the court held in that case could be extrapolated to include intrusions into privacy by means of bugging devices. That could also apply to Senator Cassidy's point about the fax machine.  In any event the amendments would be inoperative because, as I explained in relation to amendment No. 2, in order to extend the scope of the meaning of &ldquo;interception&rdquo; it would be necessary to amend section 98 of the 1983 Act in the manner described in the debate on amendment No. 2, not section 1 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I could not undertake to include in this Bill any provisions in relation to listening devices which are not included under the general heading of telecommunications.

      <P>I am a little encouraged by the Minister's last few sentences.  In the meantime the moral of the story would be: whatever you say, say nothing.  I am also reminded of &ldquo;Washington Behind Closed Doors&rdquo; when &ldquo;President Monckton&rdquo; was dealing with the man who was about to be appointed ambassador to one of those South American countries.  They had to go out into a very large park to discuss the finer details of which South American country he would be appointed to.  It finally came down to some preference his wife had with regard to the climate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the capacity of the Minister for Communications to make regulations about telephone answering <Col N="1768" /> machines and so on, the sooner that is done the better, because I understand there are people who hold conversations and if the going is not to their satisfaction they make statements such as &ldquo;Do you realise that this conversation has been recorded and could be used against you?&rdquo; Something needs to be done to control this type of activity.  As far as this Bill is concerned, what has happened is a lost opportunity.</P>

      <P>This amendment was one which the Minister said he would consider.  It is basically a technical amendment.  It deals with differing methods of transmitting messages &mdash; electro-magnetic radiation, fibre optics, microwave radio, etc.  What we are primarily concerned with here is that some of that technology would not be covered adequately in the Bill.  What we were trying to do was to see if our concerns were legitimate when looked at from a technical point of view.  I am interested in what the Minister has to say.

      <P>Senator Upton's excellent contributions on Committee Stage gave us a lot of work.  As the result of the amendment he put down on Committee Stage, we consulted with the Department of Communications, who in turn consulted with An Bord Telecom.  The information we have received is that the matters which Senator Upton wishes to have included are included and, therefore, that the amendment is unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators will note that the term &ldquo;telecommunications&rdquo; is not defined in the Bill.  It is described as having the meaning it has in the 1983 Act; however, it is not defined in the 1983 Act either.  Senator <Col N="1769" /> Upton was quite right to point that out the last day.  To get an idea of its meaning one has to go back to the Telegraph Act, 1869, which defines &ldquo;telegram&rdquo; as meaning &ldquo;any message or other communication for transmission by telegraph&rdquo;.  The term &ldquo;telegraph&rdquo; is defined in the same Act as including any apparatus for transmitting messages or communications by way of electrical signals. That definition is understood to be wide enough to include a system of electrical signals with or without wires.  The fact that a particular method of telegraph or telecommunications was not invented, or even contemplated, at the time when the definition was enacted in 1869 does not prevent that method from falling within the terms of the definition, or, in the case of telecommunications, its meaning.  This understanding of the meaning of the term &ldquo;telegraph&rdquo; is based largely on case law.  The fact that &ldquo;telecommunications&rdquo; itself is not defined means that the meaning is not restricted in any way.  We were afraid to define it in case we would restrict the very wide definition it has been given in court cases which have taken place since the term was first defined statutorily in 1869.</P>

      <P>In page 4, line 35, to delete &ldquo;aged 21 years or over&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;of full age&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a minor amendment which seeks to change the definition of a responsible person from &ldquo;aged 21 years or over&rdquo; to &ldquo;of full age&rdquo;.  The last day we discussed this Bill I gave the main reasons I am in favour of this change &mdash; essentially they relate to the fact that people are granted a vote at 18 years of age and so on.  I wonder why an anomaly exists whereby it is necessary for people to be over 21 <Col N="1770" /> years of age before the provisions in this part of the Bill apply to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. At one stage when one reached the age of 21 one got the key of the door; it was referred to as the age of maturity, but that is now an outdated concept.  The &ldquo;21 years&rdquo; provision should be amended.</P>

I clearly understand the tenet and concept of Senator Upton's proposed amendment.  I would like to have this matter cleared up because my view is that the age of majority is now 18 years for all purposes, including contractural purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Basically it makes no difference whether the expression &ldquo;of full age&rdquo; or &ldquo;aged 21 years or over&rdquo; is used. The net effect is more or less the same and whichever term is used it would have no adverse effect on any individual. However, stating the age has advantages and, for that reason, it would not make sense to accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>The essential point is that paragraph (a) of the definition of &ldquo;serious offence&rdquo; defines the offence and not the person. The reference to 21 years has the merit of making it clear that what is being referred to is an offence which if committed by a 30-year old could, on first conviction, be punishable with imprisonment of five years or more.</P>
      <P>The stated age of 21 is not sacrosanct. Any other age over 21 could be specified and it would make the same point. However, while not directly related to the former age of majority, &ldquo;21 years&rdquo; has the advantage of being convenient and obvious.  It simply refers to a national offender aged 21 years or over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also referred on Committee Stage to section 2 (3) of the Age of Majority Act, 1985, which provides that in any statutory provision passed or made before the commencement of that Act, a reference to 21 <Col N="1771" /> years of age has the effect as if it were a reference to full age &mdash; in other words, 18 years of age.  There are exceptions. Among references to 21 years of age not affected is any statutory provision relating to prisons, to St. Patrick's Institution or to any other place for the custody of persons.</P>
    <P>Under section 13 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1960, a person aged between 16 and 21 may be sentenced to be detained in St. Patrick's Institution in lieu of a term of imprisonment.  To use the term &ldquo;full age&rdquo; in our definition could conflict with any future change in the law that may state that 18 or 19-year olds could never be imprisoned.  As it is, it leaves out of account the restrictions on imprisonment in the case of young offenders. Therefore, while, as I have said, it is not a major point, the balance of convenience and clarity clearly lies with retaining the phrase &ldquo;aged 21 years or over&rdquo;.  That was also realised in the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987, where the definition of &ldquo;serious offence&rdquo; means &ldquo;an offence for which a person aged 21 or over, of full capacity and not previously convicted, may be punished for a term of five years.&rdquo;  Nothing has changed since 1987 to warrant a move away from that form of words.</P>
    <P>To sum up, whether the phrase &ldquo;aged 21 years or over&rdquo; or &ldquo;of full age&rdquo; is included in the definition is essentially a drafting point and, where there is no difference to any person whichever formula is used, the balance should lie with the phase which provides for greater clarity as to its meaning.  In this case the balance lies with &ldquo;aged 21 years or over&rdquo;.</P>

    <P>2A. &mdash; A person who uses apparatus for wireless telegraphy or any other device to record a spoken communication between persons shall be guilty of an offence, and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine of £1,000 or to imprisonment for a term of 12 months or to both such fine and such imprisonment; unless either:</P>

      <P>In page 5, between lines 4 and 5, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;5.&mdash;No interception shall be lawful unless carried out under and in accordance with an authorisation under this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 9 is in many ways the most important amendment to this Bill. Section 84 (1) and (2) of the 1983 Act provides for interceptions to be made <Col N="1773" /> under a number of different headings. Some of these are perfectly acceptable, such as interceptions which would have to be carried out for the maintenance of the system and so on, but the section also provides for other interceptions carried out under lawful authority.  The difficulty arises because &ldquo;lawful authority&rdquo; is not defined in the 1983 Act and I am concerned that the term &ldquo;lawful authority&rdquo; could be used as a way of getting around all the provisions of the Bill.  Interceptions of telephone messages and so on could be made under the notion of lawful authority as contained in the 1983 Bill.</P>
    <P>I would never underestimate the dexterity of certain elements in the system who are very wise &mdash; indeed, we are only too familiar with their wisdom as portrayed in &ldquo;Yes, Minister&rdquo;.  We may have created a delightful camouflage in this Bill by providing all sorts of restrictions in terms of who can do what.  There is a whole series of procedures to be followed such as ministerial authorisation and so on.  In many ways it could all be just a bottle of smoke and may be quite harmless and irrelevant if the lawful authority provision in the 1983 Act provides a way of getting around the provisions of this Bill.  That is my main concern.</P>
    <P>I anticipate the Minister will reply by saying that what we have specified here is very restrictive.  In many ways I accept that but the basic reason the amendment has been put down is to deal with the question of lawful authority which is not defined in the 1983 Act.  I wonder whether it would be possible for somebody in the system who wants to intercept phone messages to circumvent all the provisions of this Bill on the basis of the lawful authority clause?  I would be very interested in what the Minister has to say by way of reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. I consider this to be perhaps one of the most important amendments.  The Bill was introduced as a result of concerns expressed about abuses that took place in the past through improper interception of messages.  It is important that when introducing legislation we ensure that the <Col N="1774" /> loopholes are closed and that there is no means whereby people, by some device, can circumvent the lawful authority.</P>
      <P>I would like to hear the Minister's reply as to the interpretation of lawful authority in the 1983 Act, how it is to be defined and whether it would be possible to deal with this matter without infringing on the legislation.  To ensure that there is not a repeat of the event that occurred in the past we should conform to the specifics of this legislation.  Authorisation should be given purely and simply under the terms of this Bill rather than by some wider and vaguer authority.  Privacy is very important and should not be infringed upon except for very good reason and under statutory provision. For those reasons I consider this amendment very important.</P>

      <P>The contribution of my colleague, Senator O'Donovan, illustrates the value of a classical education. In relation to Senator Costello's query, my understanding is that unauthorised interceptions are unlawful unless they fall within the exceptions set down specifically in the 1983 Act, which is linked to this legislation.  I do not know what Senator Neville was talking about when he said that some method had been suggested of getting around the 1983 Act.  I did not hear any such suggestion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment was debated on Committee Stage and I felt at the time it was unnecessary but well intentioned.  Sections 84 and 98 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, make it an offence to intercept postal packets and telecommunications messages.  Therefore, all such interceptions are unlawful apart from when they are carried out under one of the exceptions referred to in those sections. The principal exception is where the interception is carried out in pursuance of a direction issued by the Minister for Communications under section 110 of the 1983 Act.  Under that section one of the directions which the Minister may issue to either An Post or Bord Telecom is &ldquo;to do (or refrain from doing) anything which he may specify from time to time as necessary in the national interest&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 3 of this Bill provides the link between the 1983 Act and this legislation. That section provides that a direction by the Minister for Communications, if it is one requiring an interception, shall be given or remain in force only if and for so long as there is in force an authorisation by the Minister for Justice applying to the interception.  Therefore, in the context of interceptions carried out under warrant for the prevention of crime or in the interests of State security, the amendment is unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other exceptions to the prohibition of interceptions in sections 84 and 98 <Col N="1776" /> of the 1983 Act include such matters as interception for the purpose of an investigation by a member of the Garda Síochána of obscene or menacing telecommunications messages, but all these exceptions are irrelevant for the purpose of this Bill and of the amendment.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (a) relating to postal packets and paragraph (b) relating to telecommunications messages, in the definitions of interception, restrict the interceptions to which the Bill will apply to those which require a direction by the Minister for Communications and hence an authorisation by the Minister for Justice.  Accordingly, the amendment is unnecessary as regards interceptions under authorisation by the Minister for Justice and is irrelevant to other interceptions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>A statement to the effect that interceptions are permitted in the national interest is a very vague statement. There is no definition of lawful activity.  There is provision in the 1983 Act for other lawful activity as a basis for interceptions.  I still believe that there is a way around this Bill.</P>

      <P>In page 5, line 5, to delete &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;High Court&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment provides that the High Court would give the authorisation for the various interceptions. We do not have any great problem Minister giving authorisation for interceptions in the case of criminal investigations.  That is reasonable and we have no objection to it.  We do not have any real problems with matters that relate to the interest of the security of the State; it is not our ambition to make the State insecure.  However, difficulties arise in relation to what the Minister's concept of the interest of the security of the State might be.  I understand that this Bill arises from one Minister's concept of what the security of the State was at a certain stage in our history. It is a matter of historical fact which give rise to the concern I am expressing here. I would like to think that a third party would be involved who might not be as potentially biased as a Minister can be in relation to the concept of the security of the State.  In that context, it is more appropriate, that these matters should be decided by the High Court rather than by a Minister.  This Bill arises out of an abuse of what the concepts of the interests of the security of the State were. It is for those reasons we are moving this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. To take up the last point made by Senator Upton, this Bill arose out of what might be described as an abuse of power by a previous Minister's interpretation of what was the security of the Cabinet at least, if not the security of the State.  The provision in the Bill specifically writes into law that a Minister shall interpret and be responsible for allowing an interception to take place on the grounds of the security of the State.  It is similar to what we are describing in the previous amendment.  It is very vaguely defined.</P>
      <P>There is the national interest, the security of the State and lawful authority. These matters are subject to interpretation and different definitions but they are not specifically defined in the legislation.  What might be one Minister's interpretation of security, depending on a perception or paranoia at the time, as we had in the not to distant past, would not necessarily be another's.  It is very important that we have an independent third party who will have the opportunity of looking at the reasons for interfering with the individual citizen's privacy, whether it is in the interest of an alleged criminal offence or whether it is within this very woolly concept of the security of the State.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Security&rdquo; is a very broad term and it is certainly the broadest of terms in the vocabulary of the Department of Justice. I am experienced in recognising the use of that terminology.  It is used to cover a multitude of areas to which it may not be necessarily related and that may not be relevant to the extension of the term.  I am concerned that we would not have an independent third party for defining security.  This amendment suggests one mechanism, there could be another.  We would like the Minister to allay our fears in relation to this section.</P>

      <P>I oppose the amendment. The concept of getting the High Court involved in what is basically investigation is an encroachment on the separation of powers concept enshrined in our Constitution.  That is a dangerous position.  Second, inbuilt in this legislation are very stringent and defined requirements which must be complied with, including the appointment of a complaints referee and the eventual appeal to the High Court if it is deemed necessary.  In other words, there are many hurdles to get over before any slip up can be made in relation to this legislation. The Bill clearly sets out very strict, stringent rules that must be complied with before an authorisation is made.  To involve the High Court at that stage of the investigation would be imprudent and improper.  I think the courts themselves would be loth to get involved.</P>

      <P>I agree with the spirit of the amendment which has been put down because of recent experience.  As we outlined in great detail on Second Stage, there were concerns with previous Ministers in this area.  However, I agree with Senator O'Donovan.  I do not think the High Court is the institution to get involved in any investigation as the final arbitrator of justice when evidence is presented to them.  I do not think the High Court should be asked to decide whether investigations should take place. They should be separate from investigating any issues.  It is a police matter; it is a matter for somebody other than our courts.</P>

      <P>As Senator O'Donovan said, we must have regard for the concept of separation of powers.  The power to investigate crime and the right to protect the security of the State is very much an executive function.  My interpretation of this Bill is that it puts on a statutory basis the practice which exists under which the Minister for Justice may authorise interception of telecommunications messages. It not only puts it on a statutory basis but it controls it and brings in some very new safeguards to restrict in every possible <Col N="1780" /> way the exercise of that power by the Minister.  The task of deciding whether a communication should be intercepted in particular circumstances or whether the security of the State is endangered is essentially an executive function.  It has been regarded as such by every Government since the foundation of the State. The Minister will have the advice and recommendation of a nominated officer of his Department to assist him in making his decision.  A judge would not have such assistance.</P>
      <P>It would be most undesirable and, in my opinion, unconstitutional to involve the Judiciary directly in secret operations in relation to the investigation of crime or the security of the State.  The more logical and reasonable approach is to have the authorisation issued by a member of the Executive and to have the oversight of the system carried out by a member of the Judiciary.  This approach is fully in accordance with the relevant articles in the European Convention on Human Rights, as held in the Malone case and other cases.  In the Malone case the court held that the tapping of Malone's telephone was in violation of article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, in that the interference was not &ldquo;in accordance with the law&rdquo;.  In order to comply with that Convention, the conditions for the authorisation of interceptions should be laid down by law. It is not sufficient that they should be the subject of undertakings by the Executive. That is precisely what we are doing here. We are laying them down in law and controlling them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Council of Human Rights also held in the Malone case that there had been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention in another respect.  This was on account of the process known as &ldquo;metering&rdquo;, which consists of the use of a device which registers the numbers dialled on a particular telephone and the time and duration of each call.  This process was designed mainly for the purposes of ensuring that subscribers were correctly charged, investigating complaints and the like; but the Post Office did on occasion provide the police with information <Col N="1781" /> obtained from metering when this was necessary for police inquiries in relation to serious crime.  The court held that the existence of this practice, unregulated by law, constituted a violation of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
    <P>There is one other provision in the European Convention on Human Rights, Article 13, that I should mention in this context because it, like Article 8, is directly relevant to the Bill.  Article 13 reads as follows:</P>
    <P>Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in this Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before the national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.</P>
    <P>Malone submitted that no  remedy was available for the  of Article 8 of which he complained and that consequently there had also been a violation of Article 13; but the court held that, having regard to its decision on Article 8, it was not necessary to rule on the issue of Article 13.</P>
    <P>The present Bill takes full account of the requirements of the provisions of the Convention on Human Rights.  First, it sets out in detail the conditions under which the power of the Minister for Justice to authorise interceptions is to be exercised and it regulates the procedure for the issue of authorisations.  As a result, interceptions will be carried out only &ldquo;in accordance with law&rdquo;, in the sense in which that phrase was interpreted by the court and, of course, only to the extent permitted by Article 8. Second, it ensures that information obtained from metering is not disclosed save as permitted by Article 8.  Third, it provides for &ldquo;an effective remedy before a national authority&rdquo;, as required by Article 13, for a person whose rights under Article 8 are violated.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 11 would give the Minister power to authorise an extension to the period for which an authorisation given by the High Court is in force.  It is <Col N="1782" /> consequential on amendment No. 10 and is therefore also unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 12 does not make sense in the context of amendment No. 10.  If, as proposed in amendment No. 12, the High Court was to give the authorisation, how could the Minister consult the High Court before it gave the authoritsation? The purpose of the provision allowing the Minister to consult the designated judge before deciding whether to give or extend a particular authorisation is sensible.  He can consult the judge where he is doubtful about a particular authorisation or where, for example, the judge has made some comment in one of his reports, the Minister might want a point clarified.  As I said, it is sensible and I see no reason to change it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a fairly good discussion on this the last day.  There is not a great deal I want to add to what I said the last day except to again point out the general principle behind this amendment.  As I understand it, it was suggested in the course of a judgment in a European Human rights case involving a gentleman called Klass in Germany in the last few years.  That is the basic reason why we tabled this amendment so that the concepts which are being suggested as worthwhile and suitable for inclusion in legislation by the European Court of Human Rights should be embodied in this Bill.  There is a notable contrast <Col N="1783" /> between the manner and the degree to which concepts and notions emanating from the European Court of Human Rights are incorporated in law arising from the Department of Health and law which arises from the Department of Justice. That is very clear, particularly in relation to the Mental Treatment Acts and so on which are presently being discussed in the form of a Green or a White Paper.</P>

      <P>I oppose this amendment. It is totally unnecessary and would run against the total concept of this Bill. These are interceptions in extreme cases where, for example, the security of the State is at risk.  If, for example, in the normal course of investigating a crime, the Garda have somebody under investigation and it goes on for six or eight months and they cannot pin the crime on him, do the Garda then go along and say &ldquo;Look, we have been following you for the last six or eight months.&rdquo; Once an authorisation has been made, once the proper channels have been gone through, there should be no duty on the Minister to go back to the person whose telephone has been tapped lawfully, and say &ldquo;Look, this has gone on and we are now ceasing.&rdquo; It would be foolish to include the amendment in the Bill because it would run counter to the thrust of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully agree with Senator O'Donovan's last point.  To do as the amendment suggests would run totally counter to the whole purposes and thrust of the legislation.  As I understand it, the basis of the legislation is that nobody has the right to find out whether or not his phone is being tapped, but everybody has a right to find out whether or not there has been a contravention of the Act in his particular case.  I would be seriously concerned if this amendment were to be taken on board.  I would be seriously concerned that it would create such a weakness in the system of interceptions <Col N="1784" /> that the legislation would be made practically inoperative because it would seriously weaken the whole thrust and content of the legislation if such an amendment were to be taken on board. There is no injustice to the person whose communications were intercepted in this way in not readily knowing whether or not there was an authorisation.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides the specific remedy of a complaints referee to which any person who feels his phone is being tapped may complain.  The complaints referee will investigate the situation.  If the authorisation has been given and if the complaints referee finds that the authorisation was proper, then the authorisation will be upheld and nothing will be said.  If the complaints referee finds that an authorisation has been given and it  not properly given, that there is a  and the complaints referee is  an obligation not only to report to the person who made the complaint but also to submit a report to the Taoiseach. Among the matters he may do then is to recommend the award of compensation, which will have to be paid by the Minister for Justice.  If the referee concludes that there was no contravention of the specified provisions of the Act relating to a relevant authorisation, he will notify the complainant to this effect.  In other words, he may find that his phone is being tapped but it is being properly tapped.  Then he will notify him, not that his phone is being tapped but that there is no contravention of the Act.</P>
      <P>Finally, and this is a very important point also, any authorisation given under this Bill will be given in the knowledge that that authorisation can come under the scrutiny of an independent judicial authority of high standing.  That is the surest guarantee that authorisations given under the legislation will, almost invariably now, be proper.</P>

      <P>There are one or two points I want to make particularly in response to what Senator O'Donovan said.  There is an exclusion clause at the end of this amendment which seeks to provide that <Col N="1785" /> the person shall be informed by the Minister of the fact of the authorisation unless the Minister considers that to do so would jeopardise a criminal investigation or prosecution or the security of the State. I cannot see how this would make the criminal investigation and prosecution of criminals inoperative once that exclusion provision is contained there.  I do not think the Minister dwelt at all on that aspect of the amendment in the course of his contribution.  This amendment arises from an idea which came initially from the European Court of Human Rights.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&mdash;A person who carries out an interception in accordance with this Act shall not be guilty of an offence under any of the following provisions:</P>
      <P>(a)  sections 50, 51, 53 and 62 of the Post Office Act, 1908;</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 14 was tabled the last day and we had a considerable discussion on it.  During the debate the Minister said that he would come back to the House after he had considered this amendment. It simply seeks to provide protection for people who carry out lawful phone tappings and indeed mail interceptions as well under a variety of Acts &mdash; the Post Office Act, 1908, the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926 and so on.  It is simply tabled to ensure that people who carry out that type of function under those various Acts would not be at risk of being prosecuted in the context of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I have now had the opportunity since Committee Stage of examining <Col N="1786" /> the provisions referred to in the Senator's amendments and I have concluded that the amendment is not really necessary.  A person who acts lawfully on foot of a warrant for interception issued by the Minister for Justice could not be charged with any of the specified offences.  He is, after all, acting lawfully. However, should he exceed the authority given to him in the warrant, for example, after intercepting a postal packet he then fraudulently retains it, I can see no reason why he should be immune from prosecution which would be the case if the amendment were accepted.</P>
      <P>I want to add, for the record, that section 50 of the Post Office Act, 1908 was repealed by the Larceny Act, 1990.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;6.&mdash;The implementation of an authorisation shall intrude on the communications of the person concerned only to the minimum extent necessary to achieve the object of the authorisation.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to provide that the degree of intrusion in the communications of the person concerned in an investigation should be kept to the minimum extent necessary to achieve the objective of the authorisation.  I hope the Minister will accept this amendment.  I cannot see any difficulty about it.  It is fairly straightforward and is a basic commonsense type of an amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment, while it is well intentioned, is somewhat aspirational. The Bill is designed in such a way that the substance of the amendment is achieved.  For example, and these examples are not exhaustive by any means, a warrant has a duration of only three months, unless extended, when all the original reasons for the authorisation <Col N="1787" /> being granted must still exist if it is to be extended.  Under section 7, the Commissioner or Army officer can have interceptions stopped before the three months are up where they are no longer required. Also, the designated judge, under section 8 (6), can cause the Minister to cancel an authorisation where he considers it should not have been given or because of circumstances that have arisen since it was given.  Section 12 deals exclusively with restrictions of disclosure of the existence of authorisations and of the contents of any communications intercepted.</P>
      <P>It is also relevant that interceptions can only be authorised for the purpose of criminal investigation and in the interests of the security of the State.  The Minister cannot give an authorisation unless he considers that the conditions specified in sections 4 and 5, and they are pretty specific, stand fulfilled and that there has not been a contravention of section 6 in relation to the proposed interception. These are very stringent requirements which will have the effect of ensuring that the implementation of authorisations will not be intrusive and of course, as with all other aspects of the legislation, the designated judge will be in a position to ascertain that the conditions are being complied with at all times.</P>
      <P>Therefore, it is fair to say that the intent behind the amendment is well catered for.  I agree with the spirit of the amendment but I think it is catered for in so far as legally and technologically we can cater for it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;7.&mdash;For the purpose of ensuring fairness in criminal prosecutions, communications between a person and his or her lawyer which are relevant to any criminal matter or offence in respect of which that person has been, is being or may be investigated or prosecuted, shall not <Col N="1788" /> be intercepted by the Garda Síochána; and copies of such communications shall not be made available to any person involved in the investigation or prosecution, and shall be destroyed upon their nature becoming known.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I understand this principle was suggested in the European Court of Human Rights case, Malone <i>v.</i> the United Kingdom.  It is also in accordance with any notions of due processes of law and a right to a fair trial.  It is important that the prosecution should not be in a position to have access to client/lawyer conversations.  That is fairly well understood at present.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be able to agree to this amendment given that the type of principles which are involved are those I have said.  It would be quite unfair if it were possible for the State to intercept conversations which were taking place between a lawyer and his client in relation to criminal proceedings.  I was always under the impression that those type of conversations were privileged when they took place in the lawyer's chambers or office or wherever else.  The moral of this would be for somebody who is involved in a criminal investigation when they are talking to their lawyer to take themselves to his or her office or chambers or wherever they have their meetings, rather than to start ringing them up and discussing these matters over the phone with them.</P>

      <P>In seconding the amendment I would like to agree with Senator Upton that we must always protect the confidentiality of a client with his lawyer. I am sure Senator O'Donovan, as a lawyer, will agree with this as well.  It has been a bedrock of our criminal justice system that the conversations and communications between the lawyer, the representative in court, and the person charged be totally confidential.  This excellent amendment will cover that and I support it.</P>

      <P>I oppose this amendment subject to the Minister's reply.  In <Col N="1789" /> this type of interception, whether by phone or package or whatever, the authorisation, particularly in regard to the phone call will go through Bord Telecom to the Garda.  I cannot envisage a situation where the concern of Senator Upton would be justified.  I cannot envisage a situation where the Garda will be involved or where the solicitor-client privilege will be broken as there are very strict and confined limitations to the lawful interception envisaged here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes in a different format an amendment tabled on Committee Stage.  I am opposing the amendment for a number of reasons.  First, it is unclear in its intentions and in some respects it is unworkable. It is unclear in that it would appear to prohibit the Garda from intercepting communications between a lawyer and another person, but that is in any case prohibited under the 1983 Act.  If it is intended to prohibit such communications under warrant, that is not stated; and in any case it is not the Garda Síochána who do the actual interception when a warrant is in force.  Also the amendment states that communications between persons and lawyers relevant to any criminal matter or offence in respect of which the person has been, is being or may be investigated or prosecuted shall not be intercepted.  How can it be known in advance that these conditions can be complied with?</P>
      <P>However, by highlighting inadequacies in the amendment I do not want to give the impression that I would be prepared to accept this intention even if it were technically in order.  I would be opposed to granting any category of persons the type of privilege suggested by the amendment. It would be invidious and discriminatory to make exceptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a warrant was issued to intercept the telecommunications of, for example, a suspected subversive or criminal, all his phone calls would be intercepted.  It would not be possible to avoid intercepting the irrelevant or even personal calls to his lawyer or otherwise.  All irrelevant material would be destroyed.  Of <Col N="1790" /> course it could be that the apparently innocent call, or even totally innocent call, could give the vital clue for which the Garda are waiting to prevent or solve a crime.</P>
    <P>On section 12 of the Bill, which is relevant to the last part of the amendment, the Minister has a statutory duty to limit to the absolute minimum the disclosure of the fact that an authorisation has been given and the contents of any communication intercepted pursuant to such an authorisation.  He must also ensure that copies of any such communication are not made to any extent more than necessary and that they are destroyed as soon as their retention is no longer necessary.</P>

      <P>These amendments relate to the role of judges and so on in the review of the operation of the Act.  We suggest that the Chief Justice should be primarily involved in this review process.  In addition, consultation with the Minister should not be necessary, nor is it desirable that judges should have to consult with Ministers; there is meant to be a separation between judicial and the legislative functions and so between judges and politicians.  The more hands off the relationship is between them, the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 21 seeks to give judges some security of tenure.  During the last debate on this Bill the Minister spoke of the difficulties which might arise when we suggested that the term of office of judges on this review process should be five years.  We have now sought to remove by a restructuring of the amendment <Col N="1791" /> those difficulties which the Minister outlined on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is good reason why a Supreme Court judge should not be appointed to act as the judicial review person or whatever in this legislation. The reason is that there are five Supreme Court judges who will adjudicate on an appeal from the Central Criminal Court on a point of law or otherwise.  I remember debating this on Committee Stage.  If the President of the High Court decides to appoint one of the High Court judges as the review judge or the person to deal with these aspects, then in essence this judge is being sidelined because he or she would be prohibited from dealing with any criminal case where the knowledge they may acquire as a result of a particular interception might cause a conflict of interest.  Consequently, if one were to appoint a Supreme Court judge &mdash; and I accept that when this Interpretation Act was first proposed a Supreme Court judge appointment was envisaged &mdash; it would mean that a High Court judge might have to step aside in a particular criminal appeal and if a Supreme Court judge had to take the same action in a serious criminal case it would mean that the full Supreme Court would not be entitled to sit.  This is a serious reason why this amendment is not feasible in reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Donovan has anticipated what I have to say.  The invariable and desirable practice is that when there is an appeal on a criminal matter from the Court of Criminal Appeal to the Supreme Court, which is the direct chain of appeal in those cases, the full Supreme Court, will hear the appeal.  There are circumstances in which three Supreme Court judges can sit as the Supreme Court on appeal, but in criminal cases it is almost invariably five. That has been the practice since the foundation of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore in those circumstances a <Col N="1792" /> Supreme Court judge could not be invited to carry out this task.  Having regard to the duties which have been imposed on the designated judge under section 8 there could be no question of the judge being invited to act or to take any part in any criminal trial or in any appeal from a criminal trial.  That is because the nature of the information concerning persons believed to be criminals or engaging in criminal activities which might come to the notice of the judge.</P>
    <P>In the context of the designated judge being a judge of the High Court, it is appropriate that the President of the High Court invite him to undertake the duties specified in section 8.  That is because of the duties of the President of the High Court in the allocation of business among High Court judges.  I can see no reason, given the nature of the duties that the judge will be taking up, why the President of the High Court should not consult with the Minister.  The judge will be designated by the Government after his name is brought forward by the Minister.  The President of the High Court only has to consult with the Minister; it will be the decision of the Minister whom to invite.  The Minister has no right to overrule the decision of the President of the High Court.</P>
    <P>It would be inappropriate to specifically designate a judge for a fixed term such as five years.  He will hold office in accordance with the terms of his designation and this could be for a term which is suitable to him.  Five years might not suit everybody.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 21 does not make sense in the context of the other three amendments we are discussing which refer to a judge of the Supreme Court.  If the judge appointed here were a judge of the Supreme Court the knowledge of the matters which would be investigated pursuant to an authorisation would exclude him from sitting as part of the Supreme Court to which an appeal would we made arising from a criminal court.  There are only five Supreme Court judges and we have regarded it as desirable and necessary that, all five Supreme Court judges <Col N="1793" /> should sit as the appellate court or Court of Criminal Appeal in criminal cases.</P>

      <P>In page 10, line 22, after &ldquo;Circuit Court,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or, if no such judge is available and willing to serve,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The central part of this series of amendments is amendment No. 26.  The other amendments are relatively minor in terms of their possible impact and significance; they deal with the different types of judges which should review cases and cover the question of the availability of Circuit Court judges.  If no Circuit Court judge is available, then a District Court judge should be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nub of the matter is the question of practising barristers being in a position to adjudicate on these cases.  I have no objection to practising barristers adjudicating on these cases, but I am concerned <Col N="1794" /> about the possibility that the practising barrister may be a member of a political party adjudicating on a matter of considerable political sensitivity.  I do not pretend that we do not have political hacks in our own party who are barristers. We have a plentiful supply of them, and a plentiful supply of solicitors as well.  If our party were a football team we would probably transfer some of these out and buy in other types of players but that is not relevant to this Bill.</P>
    <P>My point is to ask how such an individual could be credible as a referee.  A referee should not only be fair but should be seen to be fair and his or her impartiality should be beyond question.  One does not find a Cork referee refereering the Munster final between Cork and Limerick and I do not doubt that certain Cork referees if given the job would be perfectly fair.  I also do not doubt that there are certain political hacks who are also barristers or solicitors, and who, if asked to adjudicate, would be perfectly fair.  The fact that they are known to be hacks takes away a certain amount of credibility from them.  People will not accept the decisions of such people regardless of whether they are fair or not and it is highly undesirable that that situation could arise.</P>
    <P>It is for those reasons that we are suggesting that the referee may not be a member of a political party or a person who has been a member at any time within the previous five years.  That is a minimum requirement to ensure confidence in the judgment of the referee and to make him acceptable to the general public.  Any other provision would not make impartiality a reasonable expectation.</P>
    <P>It is important not only that a judgment should be fair but that it should be acceptable to people who feel they have been wronged.  If somebody feels they have been wronged by a Minister of a political party other than their own, and if the referee of that dispute happens also to be a member of the same political party as the Minister who made the decision, credibility is unacceptably drained.  I <Col N="1795" /> would apply those principles to our own party no less than to other parties.</P>

      <P>I second the amendment. The appointment of a referee is an important aspect of this Bill.  It is crucial in order to achieve credibility for the procedure that the referee be of the status of a Circuit Court judge or a judge of the District Court.  We know from the history of this State that a person otherwise appointed is likely to be a member of a political party or being rewarded for supporting a party.  That has been tradition and practice through the years of this State.</P>

      <P>It is important that a referee appointed under this section of the Bill should have public credibility.  I did not second the first part of the amendment because I want the referee to be of the status of a judge; to appoint a referee of lower status reduces the status and credibility of the position with those for whom they will undertake investigations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt if barristers or solicitors are appointed to this position that it will be as a reward for support of a political party.  They will then have to judge whether the decision of a Minister whom they support is fair, honest and objective.  I am asking for face credibility <Col N="1796" /> on this issue and people accept judges impartiality, no matter what political party they came from.  Once judges go on the bench there is an assumption that they make independent and objective judgments.  For the sake of status and face credibility this amendment should be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose the amendment and disagree with the sentiments that have been expressed on it.  I am disappointed in Senator Upton, many of whose past arguments I have been in sympathy with.  His statement is an example of the way in which Irish people do themselves down and politicians are not an exception.  What is needed here is a statement of the flag we sail under.  We should be proud to be Labour, Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael politicians and not tolerate this situation in which people declare they have not been a member of a political party for five years; they are entitled to be party supporters for the past 20 or 30 years.</P>
      <P>There is a need for transparency and as Senator Neville rightly says, well known supporters and active members of various political parties have been promoted to the bench and thereafter have been regarded as impartial.  We would have a healthier political society if we were prepared to declare our political allegiances, have them know and then take on responsibilities as judges have done so well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the sentiments expressed by Senator Conroy in this matter.  A solicitor of ten years standing can be appointed as a district judge and a solicitor-barrister of 12 years standing can be appointed to the High Court. If that is the case I cannot see why a judge with ten years' experience, whether of the District or Circuit Court, emanating from either branch of the lawyer's profession, cannot act as a referee in this instance.  That is an unjustified aspersion on my profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sometimes in this House we hear praise for the Judiciary from all sides and at other times snide remarks are made <Col N="1797" /> alleging political hackery.  I am aware in my life as a lawyer of three or four appointments in Munster where the person appointed was known to be of a different political persuasion than the appointing Minister.  I do not think political appointments are made at the rate at which we are to believe.  In this House one cannot praise judges from the Supreme Court down saying they are doing an excellent job, and on another occasion say that some of them are political hacks.  Those two descriptions are not compatible.</P>
    <P>It should also be borne in mind that for a barrister at junior counsel level with a good practice appointment as a circuit judge is a backward step from a financial point of view.  In many instances practising lawyers who could do much better financially on their own have accepted appointments to the High Court and Circuit Court.  We have an excellent Judiciary and I refute remarks made occasionally in this House and in the Dáil that judges may be political hacks.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to a point Minister O'Dea made in his reply on Committee Stage.  A person in public life acquires vast experience &mdash; we all come from different professions &mdash; by becoming involved in environment debates, finance debates, etc.  A public representative such as a Senator, TD or county councillor has a greater diversity of experience than a barrister who has specialised in certain actions such as road traffic accidents and is adept at estimating how much a broken leg is worth or the appropriate compensation for a scar on the face of a 19 year old girl.  In that tunnel vision situation there is no opportunity for breadth of experience.  However, we must not criticise the legal profession.  Public representatives acquire much experience; in my three years in the House I have gained experience in areas other than my own, as I am sure have other Senators.  Currently even in large legal practices, with 14 or 15 solicitors, persons tend to specialise.  If one brings a conveyancing problem or a case of defamation or libel to a probate expert he will not have a clue because for the last ten <Col N="1798" /> or 15 years he has specialised in probate and is probably doing an excellent job as such.</P>
    <P>I stand by our Judiciary, who have acquired broad experience from their public offices.  In my experience of courts right up to the Supreme Court I have yet to be convinced that political hacks occupy judicial positions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>If this amendment were accepted the position in this country would be as follows: a barrister of 12 years' standing and a member of a political party could be appointed as a member of the Supreme Court but could not be appointed as a complaints referee. There would be nothing to debar a person appointed a member of the Supreme Court from being appointed Chief Justice immediately if there were a vacancy in that office.  There is the even more ridiculous possibility that a person of at least 12 years' standing at the Bar who is a member of a political party could be appointed Chief Justice of this country, but yet would not be eligible for appointment as a complaints referee under this legislation.</P>
      <P>I find that absolutely incomprehensible. I am not belittling the position of complaints referee or diminishing its function or importance.  The referee will be of considerable importance but I do not think referee status should be equated to that of Chief Justice.  If a person is not prohibited by membership of a political party from being appointed Chief Justice I cannot see how on a point of logic, equity or justice a person could be debarred from being appointed complaints referee for the purposes of this legislation.  The role of the referee will be important.  Under the terms of his office he will have similar status to a judge.  However, it is a different role.  It is one of investigating complaints and would be suited to the categories of persons specified in section 9 (2) (b).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person who will be appointed to be the complaints referee will be appointed for a term of five years and will then be eligible for reappointment. Therefore it will not be a question of <Col N="1799" /> employing a person or a different person every time a complaint is made to investigate that complaint.  The person who accepts appointment to the office of referee will have to be prepared to take on a fairly long term commitment.  Any time within that period of five years, or maybe longer, he will have to be in a position to carry out an investigation.  Of course, it remains to be seen how many investigations will be necessary as that cannot be predicted at present.</P>
    <P>Given the long term commitment of the job, it is only right that the Taoiseach be not too restricted in whom he can appoint.  It will be important to get the right person with the necessary legal experience who can make the commitment in advance to the job.  That person might well be a judge of the Circuit or District Court.  All paragraph (b) of subsection (2) does is to give the Taoiseach great options when making the appointment.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise that the complaints referee should be a suitably qualified person with the necessary experience.  The suitable qualification is a legal qualification and the necessary experience would be experience over an extended period as a practising barrister or solicitor.  To exclude those categories from the persons who could be appointed a complaints referee would narrow the field to a considerable extent, as would any proposal to exclude circuit and district judges who are persons with the necessary legal qualifications and experience. Indeed the qualifications and experience required for appointment as District and Circuit Court judges are similar to those required for appointment as complaints referee.  As I have said, the referee will have the same status as a judge.  He will be independent in the exercise of his functions and may be removed from office only for stated mis-behaviour or incapacity on resolutions passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas. In England a tribunal performs the type of functions which it is proposed to give to the referee and it does not seem to have caused any problems or controversy <Col N="1800" /> there that the tribunal consists of barristers, solicitors or advocates of at least ten years' standing.</P>
    <P>I am happy that the position of complaints referee should be held by a person belonging to one of the categories provided. It is possible that the inclusion of the judges has given rise to a belief that the barrister or solicitor would not have the same status when acting as the referee. Of course, nothing could be further from the truth.  I have no doubt that whoever is appointed will carry out his or her duties in a fair and impartial manner and with a level of competence that could only be achieved from the legal qualifications and experience required for the job.</P>
    <P>The effect of amendments Nos. 23 and 24 would be that a complaints referee, if not a judge, could be considered by public opinion to be second best, someone who is hardly worthy of the job and who was only appointed because one of those persons who should have been the referee could not and would not accept the appointment.  That would be a totally unacceptable situation, as would trying to debar members or former members of fairly recent vintage of political parties from the job of complaints referee.  Professional people are often asked by the State to perform particular functions, to accept appointments and to give advice commensurate with their professional qualifications and experience, and it would be deeply offensive to such persons to suggest that that advice etc.  would be covered by a particular political leaning or belief.  I have no doubt that the complaints referee, whoever he or she might be, will act in a totally professional manner and to attempt to suggest otherwise is to attempt to undermine confidence in the complaints procedure before it even gets started.</P>
    <P>Finally, the designated judge will be able to review the operation of the complaints procedure and to report to the Taoiseach on the manner in which complaints were handled either generally or in relation to specific cases.  That is the ultimate guarantee that the complaints <Col N="1801" /> procedure will be operated in a proper, reasonable and fair manner.  As I said, the essential point is the qualification and experience of the person who will apply appointed and those attributes will apply equally to all the persons who could be appointed, whether judge, barrister or solicitor.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matter. - Non-Recognition of South African Teachers Union.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am raising the question of the recognition of a teachers' union in South Africa.  I appreciate the willingness of the Department of Foreign Affairs to deal with this subject on what I recognise as very short notice.  I thank them for their efforts.  I have received information from the South African Embassy in London and from Geneva this afternoon which indicates that the Department of Foreign Affairs have, as usual, been working very hard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The source of the matter I am raising lies in the organisation of workers in South Africa.  Apartheid is an education system as much as anything else and determines the organisation of education in South Africa.  Legislation still on the Statute Book there dictates and requires education to be carried out on racial lines; unions are also organised on racial lines.  Consequently, there were separate unions for coloureds, black teachers, etc. The union to which I refer tonight is SADTU &mdash; the South African Democratic Teachers' Union.  It is the only organisation in South Africa which is <Col N="1803" /> organised on non-racial lines.  It is an attempt to pull together the different racial groups.  Groups like the Transkei teachers, the coloured teachers and others are now coming into the South African Democratic Teachers' Union.</P>
    <P>This union was established on 6 October 1990 and has been operating very successfully since.  It is a non-violent teachers' organisation and condemns violence.  It is the only teachers' organisation in South Africa which is organised on non-racial lines.  Legislation in South Africa, unfortunately, still requires education to be organised on racial lines.</P>
    <P>Having been established in 1990 it is still struggling to obtain recognition and is being asked to meet impossible conditions by the National Education Department.  I would like the Minister to ask his Department to deal with this.  The South African Embassy today made the point to me that this union has not formally sought recognition.  That may be the case, but I know they have had a series of meetings and have been given a number of impossible conditions to meet prior to recognition.  One such condition, for instance, is that they should be recognised by each of the 15 provincial Departments of Education before they could get national recognition.  That is impossible as things are organised in South Africa at the moment.  In one of those areas it is unacceptable for a teacher to be a member of SADTU, in fact, it is a sacking offence.  Now the Government are saying that, unless the union is recognised by a provincial education authority, which is sacking any teachers who join, it will not be recognised nationally.  This is an impossible criterion for them to meet.</P>
    <P>It is with a sense of anger that I raise this matter because this union is affiliated to the same international organisation &mdash; the World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession &mdash; as my own union.  I have spoken at length with them, with the International Labour Organisation and with the organisations of the South African Democratic Teachers' Union.  They have all indicated that they have done everything possible <Col N="1804" /> to comply with the Government's demands and the Government have refused to meet them.  This has been exacerbated further by the fact that the Government have, in the intervening period, given recognition to a number of other unions which are organised to accommodate the racial organisation of education in South Africa.</P>
    <P>The NAPTOSA union is a classic example.  It is with a certain sense of anger that I have learned that that has been organised.  It is a slap in the face to a progressive teacher movement under the leadership of SADTU which, by international recognition is working on the basis we would require, accept and recognise.  The recognition of NAPTOSA by the outgoing Minister for Education would seem to me to have been a sweetheart deal by a retiring Minister in order to give support to a union whose operation is still dictated by the apartheid system.</P>
    <P>SADTU believes in freedom of association and in the rights of other teacher organisations to enter into recognition agreements with anyone of the respective Departments of Education in South Africa but it is fundamentally opposed to any teacher group being organised on more favourable grounds than itself which is what is happening at the moment.  The non-recognition of SADTU smacks of discrimination.</P>
    <P>At a time when South Africa is endeavouring to create a better international image it is impossible to understand why it does not give freedom of negotiation and full recognition to the South African Democratic Teachers' Union which is attempting to bring to education in South Africa the ideals, freedoms and the developments which we, in the rest of the world, have demanded of South Africa for many years now.  This act by the National Education Department in not recognising SADTU and in recognising another organisation of teachers which is organised on racial lines, seems to be one of the last vestiges of apartheid rule and it has greatly angered those teachers in South Africa who are opposed to racially organised education.  Energy always finds <Col N="1805" /> an outlet.  It is impossible to suppress this kind of commitment and it will express itself and manifest itself in violence, at some stage, if they are not given recognition, the freedom to negotiate and the freedom to represent their members.</P>
    <P>The South African authorities must move to ensure that full rights and recognition are given to SADTU.  It is intolerable that South Africa should remain in contravention of the ILO conventions. I am asking the Irish Government to make their opposition to such discriminatory arrangements known to the South African authorities and to use our influence in the European Community to ensure that certain things happen, and especially that ILO conventions are recognised.  Also, the Department of Education in South Africa should be asked to recognise SADTU or, if they do not recognise it, that they outline clearly the conditions they must meet in order to gain recognition.</P>
    <P>I also ask that the Government request South Africa to note the intransigence of the Ministries of Education which is leading to frustration and anger among these politically correct, constitutional, non-violent teachers who want to do their business properly, as is the international norm.  I ask the Irish Government to put pressure on the South African Government to recognise that a legally constituted teachers' organisation will, on behalf of their members, provide education and bring a teacher perspective to the changes which we believe must take place in South Africa.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for responding on this matter.  It is an important, when South Africa is worried about its international image, that we should be seen to be keeping the checks and balances in place to ensure that apartheid is removed, that apartheid legislation dies and it is replaced by an acceptable form of education and organisation within South Africa.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Daly) Brendan Daly">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland's stance on South Africa and on apartheid is well known, both to our partners in the <Col N="1806" /> European Community and to the South African Government.  We have consistently opposed and condemned the apartheid system and have worked actively for its elimination.</P>
      <P>Although considerable progress has been made since President De Klerk took office in late 1989 and the so-called &ldquo;pillars of apartheid&rdquo; were abolished in June 1991, the legacy of apartheid will live on for a considerable time.  In the past two and a half years, the Government of South Africa have announced and implemented policy principles, which would have appeared unthinkable to their predecessors.</P>
      <P>From the release of Nelson Mandela, after 27 years in prison, to participation in CODESA, the South African Government have shown a strength of will and commitment that few would have suspected. Movement by the Government has been matched by the ANC.</P>
      <P>In December of last year, the main parties and organisations in South Africa, including the South African Government, ANC and Inkatha, began to work together in the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) to bring about the transformation of South Africa through negotiations.</P>
      <P>The Irish Government have fully supported the Convention in its work and were disappointed the parties were not able to reach agreement at CODESA 2 in May.  Mr. Mandela's suggestion that the Management Committee of CODESA try to find agreement on the outstanding differences gave us renewed hope.</P>
      <P>Our expectations were based on the expressed commitment of the parties to the principle of peaceful negotiation and on the pace of events over recent months. Differences in public between the ANC and the Government appeared, at each stage, to be resolvable.  That has been put at risk by the escalating violence, epitomised by the brutal massacre at Boipatong on 17 June.  Boipatong was yet another terrible incident in the reign of violence which has surged through South Africa since 1990, resulting in the deaths of over 7,000 people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1807" /> The suspension of negotiations because of the violence has realised our worst fears; that the violence would halt the negotiation process.  It has been said, with reason, that there are political forces behind the violence, the killings and maimings. It is equally true that the failure of the Government to recognise their responsibilities and to take the necessary action has allowed the instigators of the political violence free rein.</P>
    <P>The new South Africa must be able to deal with the legacy of apartheid and to find solutions to the needs of the people, particularly in housing, health, employment and education.  A South Africa born out of violence cannot do this.  It is necessary that the conditions be created to enable the talks to resume, whether this be in the framework of CODESA or another mutually agreed forum.  We believe that it is in the interest of all South Africans that the talks should resume as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The problems faced by the South African Democratic Teachers' Union, and highlighted by Senator O'Toole today, are part of the legacy of apartheid.  Education is an area particularly marked by the apartheid system, where the inequalities continue.  That reform is necessary is recognised by all.  The present range of education authorities resulting from racial segregation and the homelands policies must be abandoned in favour of a single integrated system of education for all the people of South Africa.  The difficulties faced by an organisation such as the South African Democratic Teachers' Union are a direct result of the present racially-based educational system.  With the reform of the system, the difficulties should be removed.  This will be one of the primary tasks that face the interim Government of South Africa, <Col N="1808" /> which we hope will soon be agreed by the parties in South Africa, following the resumption of their negotiations.</P>
    <P>Our priority at the present time, therefore, must be to encourage the parties in South Africa to take the necessary steps to resume their negotiations.  Simultaneously, we will maintain our support for all efforts to find a solution to the problem of violence.</P>
    <P>We will also investigate the problems raised by Senator O'Toole to see if there is anything that we can do, nationally or with our European partners, to resolve the difficulties faced by the South African Democratic Teachers' Union.  Directly, where possible, and together with our partners in the European Community, we shall continue in our contacts with all parties to encourage them to remain steadfast in their commitment to establish a united, non-racial and democratic South Africa; and to renew their contacts, discussions and negotiations.</P>
    <P>Successive Irish Governments have worked actively in the United Nations and with our partners in the EC to bring about an end to apartheid.  We will continue to do so until its last vestiges have been eradicated and until there is a truly non-racial South Africa that respects equally the value and dignity of all its people.</P>
    <P>In the light of the concern expressed here this afternoon by Senator O'Toole we are taking up these matters and the matter of the recognition of the Democratic Teachers' Union with the South African Embassy in London and we will keep in touch with him as to how the matter develops and proceeds.</P>
