      <P>I have notice from Senator Cassidy that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to make resources available to the Midland Health Board to enable them to provide additional bed spaces for longstay patients at St. Peters Hospital, Castlepollard, Co. Westmeath.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to make a special amenity area order for the Dargle Valley.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Cassidy and Ross as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Cassidy's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Ross may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>The business for today is Item No. 2 to be taken between now and 4 p.m.  I suggest that 15 minutes be <Col N="554" /> provided for the spokespersons of each party and ten minutes to each Senator thereafter.  From 4 p.m. until 6 p.m. it is proposed that we take item No. 3.  There should also be a timeframe on that item, which can be arranged later.  There will be a sos between 6 p.m. and 6.30 p.m.  It is proposed that we take item No. 44 from 6.30 p.m. until 8 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Leader of the House inquire from the Government, who in turn would inquire from the Judiciary, whether there are guidelines in existence that govern the precise circumstances in which it is proper for judges to make statements or speeches which are, in effect, interventions in matters of ongoing political controversy? Many of us find the silence from the Judiciary on this issue unacceptable and the Judiciary owe it to the public to indicate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <P>Senator, you are making a speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;whether such guidelines exist.  If they do, what they are, and if they do not, whether it is intended to have such guidelines provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to again raise several issues I have spoken about in the past weeks.</P>
      <P>The fact that the situation in Northern Ireland continues to decline leads me to ask the Leader to make a commitment in the House today that the first significant discussion on an non-legislative matter in the new session will be on the North of Ireland.  Since I first raised this issue, 40 people have been killed in the North, 40 people have been buried &mdash; young people and old people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like the House today to recognise the fact that in London yesterday a 15 year old schoolgirl was atomised, blown to pieces, by people purporting to act in my name, in your name and in our name.  The grief of her distraught parents on last night's international news brought shame on Ireland. <Col N="555" /> I feel that the House should at least indicate its complete rejection of that kind of activity and those who purport to act on our behalf.  It is a disgrace that the strain and stress, the killing and the loss for that family all result from actions carried out supposedly in our name.  I shall not go any further with the issue now, it does need to be discussed.  I stress that words are important, debate is important.  It is not a matter of asking ourselves what we can add to it; we can make it clear by our words exactly where we stand in relation to such activities.</P>
    <P>The other issue I wish to raise has been raised on several occasions in past months and years, that is, the question of a presidential pardon for Nicky Kelly. It would be fair to say that this is not a party issue.  People from both sides of the House have equally strong views on the issue.  In the next week I intend to circulate a petition to every Member of the House asking the Government to request a presidential pardon for Nicky Kelly. I ask that all Members, in alphabetical order, add their names to that petition to indicate our view on the issue.  This is not a party issue; this is an initiative that I, as an Independent Member, should want to take and I urge the Government to respond.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the condemnation of the bombings that occurred in London during the weekend.  I express my dismay and disgust at what happened.</P>
      <P>I support the call from Senator Manning that guidelines be introduced so that those who are above the political process would know when and where they could enter the political process and, indeed, what is acceptable and what is unacceptable from people who are paid enormous amounts of money to behave in a certain way and to maintain public confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also ask the Leader when we may expect the publication of the White Paper on the Maastricht Treaty.  It is very important that the White Paper be published as a matter of urgency.  I again express my concern at the degree of <Col N="556" /> public confusion on matters regarding the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty and the subsequent referenda that appear to be in the pipeline.  On that note, I stress my view that it is very important that the wording of all of the referenda be available to the public before the public have to make up their minds on 18 June.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should again like to express my concern about the oil pollution that county councils in the west of Ireland have had to clear.  I understand that Kerry County Council had to pay about £65,000 from their own funds to clear the mess resulting from oil pollution.  A similar problem also exists in County Clare.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to express my horror, shock and condemnation of the appalling tragedy which took place in London.  Not very long ago, we in this House, were referring to the bombing in this city in which so many innocent people lost their lives.  It is appalling that three innocent people, one a 14 year old girl, died.  It is ironic, as that girl's mother said, that the young girl had said very nice things about this country.  In relation to the situation in Northern Ireland, she had hoped there would be a peaceful solution, she has now been blown to pieces.</P>
      <P>With one's condemnation, one joins the Government side in welcoming the new Northern Ireland Secretary; I hope that together we may perhaps approach this very difficult and intractable problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the remarks made by previous Senators in relation to the appalling tragedy and bombing which took place in London.  I believe all sides of the House should be seen, as I am satisfied we are, to be totally opposed and to register our abhorrence at every opportunity in relation to these unfortunate events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the call by Senator Manning and Senator Upton in relation to guidelines for the Judiciary regarding matters on which they can speak publicly.  In addition, I ask the Leader to provide time <Col N="557" /> in this House to discuss the unfortunate dismissal of Mr. Justice O'Hanlon.  It is a very serious issue and regarded by some people as indicating an attempt by the Government to intimidate the entire Judiciary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Senators Senators">
      <NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
      <P>Rubbish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the seriousness of the matter I believe it is of concern to this House and I am, therefore, asking the Leader to provide time to discuss the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to convey my abhorrence of the atrocities related to the Northern Ireland issue.  I would like to again raise the issue of the need to have all wordings before us before we vote on the Maastricht Treaty because of the utter confusion in the minds of women, particularly in this country, in relation to the travel and freedom of information.  It is essential that we know what we are doing before 18 June.  Secondly, I would like the report &mdash; The Gender Equality on Education &mdash; which was commissioned by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights and researched by Jim Gleeson, to put before the Seanad for discussion in the next session. We are obviously delayed because of the lack of publication of a Green or White Paper and this would be an excellent opportunity to debate educational issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Miss Keogh Miss Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Miss Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, add my voice to the expressions of horror and revulsion at the appalling atrocity that occurred in London.  Once again we have to ask for a debate on Northern Ireland but at this time in particular, we should wish the new Northern Ireland Secretary well.  We should also look forward to the resumption of talks, I hope at the end of this month.  The awful horrors we have seen have underlined the necessity to again get dialogue going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, join my colleagues in expressing the deepest sense of outrage and abhorrence at the bombings <Col N="558" /> in London over the weekend.  Time and again, in this House we have expressed a very clear view on the subject but it is important to continue to do so lest anybody thinks there is a doublethink as far as this House is concerned.</P>
      <P>I would like to take the opportunity to extend our congratulations to all the Members elected in Northern Ireland.  I wish the new Secretary of State well in his task and express the hope that the talks will start at the earliest possible opportunity.  Will the House be prepared to invite the people engaged in the talks to participate under the new regulations here in a debate on Northern Ireland? We should demonstrate that, as democrats, we want to work together and leave no shadow of doubt in the minds of the British people that we are democrats, that we are prepared to talk and work together for the common good and to contribute towards peace and reconciliation on this island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I too would like to be associated with the condemnation of the atrocities in London over the past week. No words could adequately condemn those acts.  Allied to that is the question we discussed before, of the need for this House &mdash; and the other House &mdash; to be constantly alert to discussing matters pertinent to Northern Ireland.  We must make certain that we contribute, in whatever way we can, to alleviating and lessening the severity of the problems in the North.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader state the position with regard to the forthcoming referenda? Prior to the referendum on 18 June on the Maastricht Treaty the broad parameters of the other referendum arising out of the consequences of the Supreme Court decision should be available because it is extremely important, in the interests of the Maastricht Treaty referendum being successful, that people would have an idea of the broad parameters of the second referendum.  I fully support &mdash; as right thinking people support &mdash; the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty.  It is so serious&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Has the Senator a question for the Leader?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the importance of the Maastricht Treaty the referendum should be conducted in a way and against a background which ensures that people have no fears or doubts in relation to the referendum arising out of the consequences of the Supreme Court decision or indeed, the abortion issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I will not make a speech.  Do we fully realise the enormity of this matter and the gravity if the referendum is not passed on 18 June?  It would sound the death knell for our economy. Finally, with regard to the position <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Irish farmer, the situation from an income point of view in 1992&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could we again have a full debate on the seriousness of the position of Irish agriculture?  It is my considered opinion, and that of many people that the income of Irish farmers in 1992 will be very dismal indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to address myself briefly to the remarks made earlier about the dismissal of Mr. Justice O'Hanlon. No one would gloat in regard to that matter, I am sure he is a fine, honourable man in many ways but he crossed a number of very important boundaries, particularly the boundary of the separation of powers.  The Government were left with no alternative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I am concerned it has nothing to do with his membership of any organisation of which he chooses to be a member.  The Government had absolutely no alternative and I look forward to hearing somebody put the official position of Fine Gael on the record of this House, since the matter has been opened.  I applaud what the Government <Col N="560" /> did but I do not gloat.  They had no alternative. It is a sad situation when a distinguished man loses a position in public life.  While I am not glad, I am at ease in my mind that this has happened.  What would have happened if he had not been dismissed?  If a case like that of the 14 year old girl had come before him what would have happened?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not relevant to the Order of Business, and you know that, Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for your indulgence.  The two other matters I wish to raise are directed to the Leader of the House.  First, item No. 1 is a welcome and very complex set of regulations for the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment.  I would like to ask, in the light of the fact that this has been produced with commendable speed, when we will have a similar instrument to create an Oireachtas joint committee on foreign affairs.  An indication was given that we would have it, but there are many matters such as East Timor, which Senator B. Ryan and I, placed on the Order Paper, it is unlikely we would get a debate on this but in the foreign affairs committee we could have some impact on Irish foreign policy.</P>
      <P>Second, I would like to join with other Senators in calling yet again for a debate on Northern Ireland.  I share their sentiment. It was a shaming experience to hear a six year old girl asking her father why she had been blinded for Ireland.  Is it not possible that we can do something to counter a situation in which continually these appalling events are claimed from Dublin?  Can the Government not say officially that this does not come from Dublin because these claims confuse people?  I look forward to that debate.  May I say in a nasty minded, mean spirited way, for which I do not apologise, I am very glad Gerry Adams was not elected in Belfast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>It has nothing to do with the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="561" />
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Members in condemning the slaughter of innocent people in the UK.  About ten million people of Irish descent live in the UK.  I think it was foolhardy to plant a bomb to cause destruction and death in the UK.  I call again on the Leader of the House to arrange a debate on the problems facing people in the North.  Day after day Members express their concern about what is happening in the North &mdash; and without being too critical of those expressions of concern &mdash; some of those Senators have not been in the North, and have only a very superficial knowledge of what is happening there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Chair says you are, you are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have noticed that the first to speak is given more latitude than the later contributors.  I join with other Members in appealing for a debate that will allow everybody to contribute because it is not right to exclude Members from a debate on an issue as important as the problems in the North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to listen to the pleas for a debate on regional development in the West.  The Leader will be aware that on a number of occasions I raised this issue of great concern as those who attended the packed meetings convened by the bishops can testify.  The Seanad would show its concern by agreeing to a debate on that issue.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Norris' view on a foreign affairs committee.  I am one of those who have been pleading for the establishment of this committee over the past three years.  We have heard a great deal about it, and it would be desirable if the Leader could advise on the present status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, by way of a point of order, did Senator McGowan say it was appalling <Col N="562" /> that bombs were planted in the city of London because about ten million people of Irish extraction live there?  It is equally appalling if it is going to injure people of English, Welsh or Scottish extraction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Leader to impress on the Government the urgency of publishing a White Paper on Maastricht and of then having a debate in this House on that topic?  I am deeply unhappy and concerned at the Government's approach to this matter.  I have no doubt that the right to travel and to information should be clarified in advance of this referendum.  Nevertheless as the position has been outlined it is absolutely essential that clarity emerges from both Houses to ensure the public is fully informed.  There should be no attempt to &ldquo;roll back&rdquo; the recent Supreme Court judgment.  That would be totally unacceptable and I believe it would be unacceptable to the majority of the Irish people.  We have to go forward from this judgment.  Because of the Government's approach, we urgently need a debate on the matter, a White Paper on the Maastricht Treaty should be published immediately.  That issue must be totally disentangled from the other matters that have unfortunately become directly and centrally involved in it.  There is a heavy responsibility on the political process to ensure the Maastricht Treaty is passed in its own right with a resounding, yes vote, and that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>In conclusion, a Chathaoirligh, no attempt should be made to roll back to the pre-1983 position. The right to travel, to information and to non-directive counselling should be established and the Government should so indicate in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with those requesting a debate on Northern Ireland.  May I express my revulsion at what has happened in the UK and in Northern Ireland?  In doing so, I congratulate the <Col N="563" /> SDLP on their excellent election results. Now more than ever they are the only spokesman for Nationalists.</P>
      <P>May I ask the Leader of the House to fix a date for a debate on aviation policy in the light of the massive turnout in Limerick last Saturday, when the people in the mid-west and the West expressed their deep concern about the status of Shannon Airport?  Will the Leader nominate a date on resumption of the House to discuss this vital issue on which over 30,000 people made such an eloquent statement on the streets of Limerick last Saturday?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Leader, as he was asked on several occasions, to make it a priority that the Minister for Health, Deputy John O'Connell come to the House after the Easter recess with a view to discussing the future role of acute general hospitals?  I believe Comhairle na n-Óspideal, another sacrosanct body, is about to make a vicious attack on the county hospitals.  I hope he will clearly affirm that the county hospitals still have a role to play in rural Ireland and that they will continue as active, virile and viable units.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>When a hen lays eggs out of the nest on the first occasion you say it is regrettable, when it happens on a second occasion you certainly say it is foolhardy.  Therefore, I concur with the other Senators who say the Government had no option but to ask the Chairman of the Law Reform Commission to resign.  I am quite surprised at Fine Gael's prevarication on this issue, with their Leader asking questions and Senator Howard very much opposing it.  I wish they would make up their minds once and for all on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The joy at the election of Dr. Joe Hendron was shared by all of us until it was tempered by our sorrow at the atrocities committed in London.  We can only hope that Sir Patrick Mayhew will ensure that talks commence between the various parties in the North and that on this <Col N="564" /> occasion something worthwhile and meaningful will occur to bring about peace.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions the Leader of the House has been asked to let us have a debate on air transport.  Being from the Cork area I am well aware of the spin-off from the stop-over at Shannon.  We are very supportive of Shannon.  I would like to raise another issue, however, and that the unfair competition which exists between Shannon and the third international airport &mdash; Cork.</P>

The point is that we need to have a debate on competition between our international airports, particularly because Shannon has a budget of £4.8 million to promote that airport.

      <P>May I, through you a <Col N="565" /> Chathaoirligh, impress on the Leader of the House the absolute gravity and urgency of the matter raised today by Senator Staunton.  There is unquestionably a haemorrhage of people, of human resources, from the west of Ireland.  The depopulation of that whole region and of the north-west is of chronic proportions.  People are being replaced by trees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Leader when can we have a debate on fisheries policy?  There is a major problem in inland fisheries in Ireland especially in the salmon area.  Bord Fáilte brochures are promoting abroad in a major way hunting, shooting and outdoor pursuits. No salmon is being caught inland at present.  Certain hoteliers feel that they are selling a non-product.  Something has to be done.  There is no doubt but that illegal fishing is one of the major reasons salmon are not getting into the rivers.  If they do not get into the rivers they cannot spawn.  This is a major problem that has to be addressed and I would ask the Leader of the House to arrange for debate on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="566" /> On many occasions in this House we have condemned the atrocities of murderers and thugs and the other people involved in mass murder whether they be the IRA, the UVF, UFF or whatever. We should also condemn the attitude that has been taken by a group who do not represent anybody &mdash; the INLA &mdash; who last week threatened the life of a soccer player, David O'Leary, who has given great pleasure to many people the world over.  I would hate to think the INLA would get away with issuing that threat to a sportsman of world renown.  We should condemn the threat to his life just as much as we condemn the deaths of people.  I would like the House to send to the INLA the message that they do not represent anybody, that they are only thugs and murderers; I am not afraid to say that in any forum.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Leader when we can expect a debate on the problems of the west.  I accept there are other problem areas, but it is not simply a problem of unemployment in the west; it is a problem literally of the people moving out and services becoming uneconomic as a result.  It is important that we have a debate on the issue.</P>
      <P>I join in the condemnation of violence. Every now and then a particular atrocity takes place that shakes all of us.  If we are to come to grips with this problem, condemnation is not enough.  I hope we can see our way to having a debate on this issue because it has gone on now for over 20 years and radical solutions are needed.</P>

I refer to the weekend bombing in London and I condemn also the INLA, one of whom yesterday walked up to an off duty officer in Britain and shot him in cold blood at point blank <Col N="567" /> range.  He died this morning.  Those types of atrocities must be condemned as they bring shame and degradation on the whole country.  As citizens we are absolutely devastated that this is going on purportedly in the name of Irish people.  I ask the Leader of the House to arrange for us to have a debate on Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I would also like to to express the hope that the negotiations on the bank dispute which are at a very critical stage reach a successful conclusion so that this unfortunate dispute ends at the earliest possible opportunity.  We wish both sides in the dispute every success in reaching a solution.</P>

For instance, there is no mention of such funding for the area where I live and where there are thousands of acres of land lying idle, awaiting some type of development.  In case anyone should think that unemployment has not hit my region I join with other speakers in requesting a debate on unemployment.  I can assure the House that of every four people in north Kerry today, one is going to school, one is drawing old age pension, one is drawing the dole and the other is working.  Of course, I, too, would welcome a debate on unemployment.</P>

      <P>We are about to debate the question of reforms in the House. Unless there is goodwill on the part of all its Members what we achieve in the next hour in passing the relevant motion will be of no avail.  Unless the Order of Business <Col N="568" /> relates to legislation we will get nowhere.  When we pass the motion today I hope we take on board the whole idea behind reform.  If the Order of Business were to continue until 3.30 p.m. each day, as has been the practice, it would not be in the interests of the House.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning raised the issue of guidelines to the Judiciary.  I agree that there is a need for such guidelines.  I will communicate with the relevant Minister in the Government in that regard.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole and a number of other Members raised the issue of Northern Ireland.  I would like to extend my welcome to the new Secretary of State, Sir Patrick Mayhew and to wish him well in his new post.  It is in all the interests of this island that he would do well.  I share the revulsion of everybody else in the House at the weekend bombings in London.  I will convey today to the Minister for Foreign Affairs the absolute desire of this House to have a debate on Northern Ireland.  I would like to make one comment.  If I thought a debate was going to solve the problem in Northern Ireland we would have one every day of the week.  It is not as simple as that.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I will convey the desire of this House, as expressed on many occasions, for an opportunity to express our feelings on the issue of the North.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole also mentioned the Nicky Kelly file.  Over the weekend the Taoiseach asked that the report be sought as quickly as possible from the Attorney General so that a Government decision can be made on the matter.  I hope that will be the case.</P>
      <P>Several Senators, including Senators Upton and Cullen, mentioned the White Paper.  It is my understanding that this will be available within the next two weeks and I hope it will be one of the first items the House will debate after the Easter recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An item that has been raised several times &mdash; I am sure it is worthy of debate on a Thursday under the Seanad reform &mdash; is oil pollution.  Unfortunately, several maritime councils have had to face this <Col N="569" /> problem in recent months.  I hope we will be able to formulate a wording which could then be debated.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris mentioned item No. 1 which deals with the Joint Committee on Employment.  I hope we will pass the order tomorrow and that the committee will be appointed during the recess.  I hope also that a foreign affairs committee will be formed between now and the summer recess.</P>
    <P>Senators Staunton, O'Reilly, Ó Cuív and others asked if there was any possibility of a debate on regional policy.  I would have thought that the debate on the Culliton report would provide everyone with an opportunity to express their views on industrial policy for the country as a whole rather than for any particular region.  As I mentioned, that debate can continue for as long as Members wish.  I genuinely believe that matter should be discussed during that debate and I hope the Senators avail of that opportunity.</P>
    <P>I gave a commitment to have a general debate on aviation and transport.  I hope we will be able to have this debate after the Easter recess.  I hope also that this debate will not centre on any single sector or geographic region but on the general issue of air transport, which is of importance to this country.</P>

    <Title>Report of Committee on Procedure and Privileges: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges (T. 288) dated the 2nd April, 1992 be adopted.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this motion is to adopt the report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on changes in procedure and practices in the Seanad.  This report, which has been circulated to Senators, is not a complicated one and is, to a large extent, self-explanatory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report centres on the reorganisation of business within the Seanad itself and recommends changes in the existing practices and procedures of the <Col N="570" /> House.  The recommendations can be implemented by adapting the way business is ordered and by amending the existing Standing Orders Relative to Public Business.  The aim of the report is to ensure that the business of the House is ordered more effectively and efficiently and to make the House more responsive to the needs of Members.  The proposals relate solely to the reorganisation of business within the House and are an endeavour to enhance its effectiveness within the existing parameters.</P>
    <P>When the Members of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges examined the statements made by Senators on the role of the Seanad, we found that there was a strong consensus of opinion on all sides of the House and that we needed to provide Members with a legitimate means of raising matters other than on the Order of Business.  We all agreed that the primary role of the Seanad lies in the initiation and revision of legislation, but we must also accept that it should provide a forum for debate on important and topical matters.  It was felt that topical issues were being discussed in every forum except on the Floor of this House.</P>
    <P>One Senator summed up the frustration and resentment of most Members when he said: &ldquo;It is very frustrating to come in here on occasions and find that while a debate is taking place on radio, on television and in newspapers on the street, yet because of the rules of the House, it is very seldom possible to get a debate going on an important topic on the day on which the topic arises.&rdquo;  I hope we will get an opportunity to deal with that issue.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, as Chief Whip and Leader, I have endeavoured when ordering the business to facilitate Members by making arrangements to have statements made as quickly as possible on matters of urgent and public importance.  However, in the absence of established procedures and proper machinery to deal with matters of concern to Members, it has become the practice for Members to use the Order of Business to raise all matters of local and <Col N="571" /> national interest.  This happened yet again today.</P>
    <P>Any matter can be raised on the Order of Business by simply asking the Leader of the House if he would make time available for a debate on it or if he would convey the views of the Senator to the Minister concerned.  This has led to an inordinate and disproportionate amount of time being spent daily on the Order of Business and to the same matters being raised by Members day after day and by Member after Member.  This is what happens most days.</P>
    <P>I genuinely believe, in relation to the reforms we are attempting to implement today, that unless there is goodwill on all sides in implementing them, they will be of no avail.  While there is a time limit, we all hope that the reforms will be implemented in the best interests of the House to ensure it is run efficiently.</P>
    <P>In this respect the committee are recommending that changes be made in procedures to facilitate Members raising topical matters and to provide better and increased opportunities to debate matters in a legitimate and structured manner.</P>
    <P>The Committee on Procedure and Privileges considered a synopsis of all the recommendations put forward by Senators in the debate on the role of the Seanad.  I wish to take this opportunity to thank the many Senators, &mdash; some of who have long experience in the House &mdash; who made responsibile contributions and expressed their views over many months on how the House could run more efficiently.  The committee selected the key areas where we could introduce changes immediately and literally put our own House in order before any other major changes could be made.</P>
    <P>Some of the changes proposed, such as a fixed time for the Adjournment of the House or the introduction of statements as part of Thursday's business, can be implemented with the agreement of the House on the Order of Business each day.  Fixing a time for the Adjournment will not amount to a major change but it will facilitate both the Senator whose <Col N="572" /> matter has been selected for discussion and the Minister concerned and eliminate the uncertainty which prevails at present, especially on a Thursday when a Senator can spend the afternoon waiting in the wings trying to estimate how long a debate will last and the office of the Minister concerned must stay in constant contact with the staff to monitor progress in the House.  Adherence to the time fixed on the Order of Business would enable them to schedule their day properly with the minimum of disruption.</P>
    <P>In relation to ordering statements on Thursday afternoons, I foresee no difficulty with this except on the days when we have a heavy legislative programme to fulfil and it is necessary to give priority to a debate on a Bill.  However, the party Whips are aware of their responsibility in relation to the passage of legislation, so this is a matter which can be decided on a commonsense basis.</P>
    <P>The report makes three recommendations which require an amendment to Standing Orders.  First, it proposes that a Private Members' motion be taken in full each week.  I welcome that proposal. In my first couple of weeks as Whip, I felt that a motion lost its impetus when carried forward a week.  I think this will be of benefit to the House and should lead to a more concerted and effective debate and ensure that the impetus will not be lost as can happen under the present system.  The overall time will be reduced to two hours and the debate will commence at 6 p.m.  The time allowed for the proposer will be reduced to 15 minutes when moving the motion and a further ten minutes when replying.  A maximum of ten minutes will be allowed to the seconder and any other Senator contributing.  In view of the reduction in the overall time, the time allowed for the Minister's contribution is also being restricted to 15 minutes.  The effect of this change in procedure is that it will double the number of motions discussed. On the adverse side, there will be a reduction in the time allowed to speakers but most people should be able to adequately express their views in ten minutes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="573" /> Motions will be selected on the basis of a six week rota in proportion of Government two, Opposition four.  This rota is based on the numerical strength of the groups and the only group who will be adversely affected are the Independent Group who up to now enjoyed equal standing with other groups in the Opposition, in particular Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>Second, the report recommends that the time allocated for debate on a matter on the Adjournment be reduced to 15 minutes, with ten minutes for the proposer and five minutes for the Minister to reply.  The Chair will select two items for discussion each night which again, in effect doubles the number of matters which can be discussed.  The only disadvantage is the reduction in time but most matters can be dealt with adequately in the time allocated.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, and finally, the report also introduced a new concept in Standing Order No. 29a set out in the schedule to the report and deals with matters of concern to Members.  The problem in regard to the structure of the Order of Business is dealt with in this half hour.  If Members do not see this as an opportunity to raise matters of concern instead of raising issues with the Cathaoirleach and the Leader on the Order of Business each day, the Order of Business in the three months time will be as it has been up to now.  It is vital that we get across to Members that this half hour is available to Members to raise matters that up to now were raised at the Order of Business.  Most of them have nothing to do with the Order of Business or with legislation and, in most instances, have nothing to do with a national issue.  This procedure will obviously have an effect and the Committee hope it will help improve the position at the Order of Business.  We should be able to deal with legislation before 3 p.m. each day.</P>
    <P>Under the new procedure on a Wednesday night, after the conclusion of the debate on the motion for the Adjournment, a Member may make a two minute statement about any matter of which prior notice has been given to the Cathaoirleach.  There is an overall <Col N="574" /> time limit of 30 minutes which means that up to 15 matters can be raised.  The names of Members concerned will be announced in the House in conjunction with the motions on the Adjournment by the Cathaoirleach before the Order of Business.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that the introduction of this procedure will channel away much of the peripheral debate from the Order of Business and, in this way, lead to a better and more efficient Seanad.</P>
    <P>This report is merely a step forward. It does not contain any major change and does not purport in any way to meet all the wishes of Senators.  I am aware that many Senators are calling for more fundamental and extensive changes including amendment to the electoral system and the electorate.  Such changes would require amending legislation in some form and, as I said, the committee at this stage are concerned only with matters within their own control.</P>
    <P>The recommendations will be implemented on a trial basis during the next session and their effectiveness will be monitored and reviewed after the summer recess.  We agreed that we would review them before we break for the summer recess.  There are other areas where changes can also be implemented and other Standing Orders which can be reviewed, in particular Standing Order 29 but these are matters for another day. As a start we have the proposals in this report and I recommend their acceptance to the House.</P>
    <P>I should like to put on record my sincere thanks to the Members of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, to the leaders of the groups, to the former Cathaoirleach and to yourself, both as the former Leader and now Cathaoirleach for help informulating the proposals before the House.  I know it is the desire of all Members that we will be more efficient and more in tune with political life today.  I hope that, in these changes, we will make one small step towards that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting what was said by the Leader of the House, I should <Col N="575" /> like to say that the reforms suggested in this report are a modest but significant step forward in the way this House orders its business.  I should like to take up where the Leader of the House left off and pay a tribute to the Cathaoirleach for the role he played when Leader in chairing the committee.  I should like to pay tribute to the Leader of the House and to Members of the committee because the proceedings of the committee were conducted in a totally nonpartisan manner with one common objective, to try to make this House more effective.  It is only right that we should put on record the part played by the former Cathaoirleach, Senator Doherty, because this process began in his time as Cathaoirleach.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the proposals is to make this House more efficient and more relevant but, most of all, to ensure that the opportunities for participation by Members are enhanced.  The proposal to double the number of statements on the Adjournment will give an opportunity to ordinary Members to raise relevant issues.  The decision to permit more topical debates on a regular basis provides an opportunity for the Seanad to react in a speedy and positive way to what happens in our society or outside it.  Also, the possibility of raising matters of concern gives Members an opportunity through the broadcasting facilities, to reach out from here to their communities. I welcome these proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I echo the sentiment of the Leader of the House that these reforms are merely the start of a process which we believe will be ongoing.  All of us who take this House seriously &mdash; that is most Members &mdash; know that at present this House is operating only at a fraction of its potential. We must look over the coming months at many of the ideas which surfaced during the long debate on Seanad reform.  At this stage these ideas should include everything short of measures which would necessitate constitutional reform.  When we have considered those which do not require constitutional reform, we can start looking at those <Col N="576" /> which would.  We should consider first what is possible by consensus.</P>
    <P>I do not rule out the possibility of constitutional review.  There are many aspects of our political system which could benefit from an all-party review.  It is now 25 years since the last review of the Constitution.  There are many aspects, including the electoral systems of both Houses, the role of the President and the powers of the Seanad and the Dáil which could be reviewed.  That is for another day.  We should not consider Seanad reform in isolation.  Parliaments all over Europe, indeed all over the world, have lost out power in recent years for reasons which I and other Senators outlined in our contribution on the main debate such as the growth of bureaucracy and of a presidential style of Government, the presence of pressure groups, the powers given to the European Community and the role of the media.  These have reduced the roles of parliaments compared to what they were 20 to 30 years ago.  The reasons are the same in virtually all countries of the European Community. What is significant for us is that in many of these countries Parliament fought back to try to find a new role, to try to recover some of its lost powers and to try to enhance its position generally.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Leader of the House that through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges this House start talking in a structured way to the other seven countries of the European Community who have a second House.  There may not be much we can learn; there is not much we have in common with the House of Lords, for example.  However, there are countries where the second Chamber plays an important and significant role.  In virtually all of those countries the second House has had to go through a process of self-examination. I suggest, whether through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges or through the Inter-parliamentary Union, that over the coming months we begin this dialogue with other parliamentarians. All of us know that we have more in common with the members of other parliaments within the European <Col N="577" /> Community than we have with any other single group.  Their problems are similar to ours and their outlook across party lines are very similar to ours.  Through that type of dialogue we identify our common problems and see how we can strengthen our own position.</P>
    <P>My party will be pressing for further changes over the coming months.  We want the committee to look seriously at the possibility of, in some way in the future, providing for representation for some of our emigrants within the Seanad, whether it means increasing the membership or granting the right of audience to their representations.  We believe that idea should be looked at.  We should consider in the Italian Parliament &mdash; this applies to former Presidents &mdash; making former Prime Ministers honorary members of the Seanad so that the wisdom and experience of such people would be available on an ongoing basis to the body politic.</P>
    <P>We believe also that the Committee structure in both Houses should be greatly increased so that the Seanad can play its part.  This House has a unique opportunity to become the European House within the Irish parliamentary system, the House which devotes much of its time to discussing, analysing and monitoring what is happening in Europe and, as such, acting for the public as a conduit on what is happening in the Community.  We have a role, too, in discussing matters such as the reports of the Law Reform Commission which are published on a regular basis and contain many valuable ideas.  They are rarely discussed in either House.</P>
    <P>That is in the future.  We have an opportunity now to look at the whole style of parliamentary government.  For far too long we have modelled ourselves on the confrontational and sterile style of the British House of Commons.  We should now raise our heads above the system operated in the House of Commons, with its wasteful divisiveness and its disproportionate system of election and look instead at the parliaments that actually work, the parliaments of Germany and the Scandinavian countries <Col N="578" /> that try as far as possible to relate their activity to the way in which people behave in normal life through discussion, consultation and accommodation, and reaching a basis of consensus.  In the German Parliament there is considerable scope for the Opposition and members on the Government side to introduce Bills as a right.  The system also ensures that about 80 per cent of Bills are based upon a consensus in the House.</P>
    <P>It is important that we use our imagination in this debate to get away from the accepted conventions and the accepted way of looking at parliament which, sadly, is largely the British way, one of the worst models we could adopt.  It is one of the facts of our history that we have looked largely to Britain.  That is a great irony in that our history was aimed at getting away from Britain.  As part of our membership of the European Community, we should in a serious way look at those parliaments that work effectively and we should be imaginative in so doing.</P>
    <P>When we talk about reform of the Seanad we should not put our trust in Government.  We should not expect that Government will help us to bring about parliamentary reform in any serious way. If we want reform and renewal, the lead must come from ourselves.  Government have no particular interest in a strong second House.  Strong Houses irritate Governments; in their eyes they hold up Government activity and require the presence of Ministers.  We know how impatient Ministers of all Governments become with both Houses, but especially with this House.</P>
    <P>If we want reform we must rely on ourselves.  Only if the ideas come from us, only if we can show there is genuine consensus across all parties and that we are determined to take ourselves seriously will we have the muscle to make the reforms happen.  That is why I commend to this House the series of reforms. They are small and modest in scope but they will make a very real improvement. More than that, they will send out a signal that this House is intent on taking itself seriously and on trying within itself to improve the service it gives to the Irish <Col N="579" /> body politic, and in that way to the Irish public.  I join with the Leader of the House in commending these reforms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important at the outset to reiterate what I have said every time we have discussed the operations of this House, that it is in the main undemocratic, unrepresentative, very often irrelevant and too often remote.  The reason I welcome the proposition before us, which has come unanimously from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, is that it takes us a step down the road at least towards relevancy.</P>
      <P>I wish to correct one or two minor points in the agreed document to which my name is appended.  There is a reference to the other two groups in Opposition. I say on behalf of the Independent Senators that we remain independent. We do not embrace Opposition any more than we embrace Government.  We are the voice of independence in this House and will continue to be so.  We must look beyond the present to increasing the relevancy and the democracy of this House and ensuring that it becomes representative of all the bodies of all the people in Irish society.  This is a progressive step forward.  The Cathaoirleach and the Leader of the House have both been as good as their word when they said they were prepared to move in this direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to relate this in statistical terms to the opportunities created for Members.  It means in effect that in a two-day sitting four Adjournment debates will be allowed and 15 items of concern may be raised on a two-minute basis.  There is also provision for Private Members' time.  In the course of a two-day sitting this will allow 20 Members, one-third of the total, to raise, discuss and debate matters of concern.  If we include the seconder to the Private Members motion, the figure goes beyond that.  That is a massive move forward. There is to be a trial run in order to see how it will work.  In terms of Private Members' time, the Independent group are giving more than they will receive.  It <Col N="580" /> is important to do that and to allow us to establish our credibility.  I cannot quibble with the demands of the main Opposition party that they deserve more of Private Members' time.  There is no reply to that logic.</P>
    <P>I have thought much about the proposals. It is probable that the two minutes allowed to raise a matter of concern will be increased to three minutes.  The main problem is that it will be difficult for the Cathaoirleach to intervene in a two-minute contribution to inform a Member that he has 30 seconds left.  Such an interruption would break the whole flow of the debate.  Perhaps we should consider introducing a system of lights.  There should be a light on the Cathaoirleach's desk to indicate that there are 30 seconds remaining and at the end of the two minute or three minute period a gong should be sounded to end the contribution. Asking me to conclude has never worked.  There has to be a definite cut-off point.  I suggest that the use of a light and a gong would enable the system to work.  Turning off the microphone would not work.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to fix the Adjournment time.  Under the present system the Member who is to raise a matter on the Adjournment is forced to watch the monitor all day long in order to ascertain when debate may conclude and to re-arrange appointments and meetings accordingly.</P>
    <P>We have a long way to go in creating a more democratic and more representative structure, especially in terms of access to people outside the House. We have discussed and considered this matter.  Senator Manning suggested we should benefit from the experience of former Taoisigh.  I would have some reservations about that but I would not object to it.  There should be a right of audience for Euro-Commissioners, at our invitation.  I propose that there be participation in this House by Members of the European Parliament who should be answerable and accountable to a forum in this country, and this is the ideal opportunity to provide for that in a structured way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="581" /> The whole system of election to this House must be addressed.  I have said time and again, using my own position as an example, that the term University Senator is a misnomer.  If we are to have such an exclusive panel &mdash; I have reservations as to whether we should &mdash; at the very least the graduates of every third level college in the country, whether they be RTCs, colleges of education, colleges of art or new universities, should have a right to vote.  There is no reason in the nineties, as we approach the 21st century, that people from certain universities only should have a right to vote, with the exclusion of other university and third level graduates.  That is an unacceptable position and one that will have to be changed sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>As I have said on many occasions, we must consider the system of panels that exists at present.  I am involved at the most senior level in the education and the organised labour trade union areas. Some Senators are elected to this House on a labour panel and some on an education panel, but despite my wide experience in both these areas, because I am not a member of a party, I have no chance of being elected on either panel.  The fact that this House is based on groups and panels rather than on parties is illogical. This matter should be considered, but not in a flippant way as has been suggested by this side of the House, including from my own benches, and not as a reason to have a go at duly elected county council and local representatives.  I have no objection to those people having a vote in Seanad elections, but their vote should be confined to the inside panels, nominated by Oireachtas Members.  The outside panels, whether it be labour, education, agriculture or fisheries, should be elected by people working in fisheries, agriculture, trade unions and education.  In that way we would have a properly elected, fully representative second Chamber, allowing for a wider level of participation and thereby becoming&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would agree with the Chair were it not for the first item in the report which I will read for the record.  It states that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, in their overall capacity, undertook a general examination of the procedures and practices in the Seanad. I take the widest possible interpretation of that.  Nevertheless, I duly note the Chair's direction and I will continue in a slightly more introverted and circumscribed pattern, referring to the operation of this House.  The proposals for changes in Standing Orders are to be welcomed.  I take the points raised by the Leader in that these changes must be considered in conjunction with the operation of the Order of Business each day. The time for raising matters of concern should be limited and in the future, the Order of Business should be confined to references to items on the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One matter which I neglected to refer to earlier is the debate on Thursday afternoons. Over a two-day period 20 Members of the House may raise different items, and we have agreed that on Thursday afternoon motions or statements on topical matters will be taken. This report proposes a solution to the difficulties of people who wished to raise matters but could not do so heretofore. In future all these matters may be addressed, but on the Order of Business people will no longer be allowed to demand debates or raise various matters.  This can be done in a professional way and Members who know in advance that they will have two minutes to make a speech will have time to prepare it and to issue a script to the papers.  This will reflect well on the person making the speech and on the operation of the House and it will allow for an important response to <Col N="583" /> the constituents who make representations to Members of the House. The system up to now has been lacking, with Members attempting to raise matters quickly on the Order of Business before anybody noticed they were out of order.</P>
    <P>I welcome this report and I welcome the contributions of all concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the proposals before us.  Change is absolutely inevitable as far as this House is concerned.  Otherwise the whole functioning and credibility of this House of the Oireachtas will become untenable.  To some extent this House is on trial at present.  Political parties, as part of their policy, believe this House should be abolished.  To some degree, that is the tip of the iceberg.  For that and other reasons it is essential that we are prepared to make changes.  To the extent that these changes are proposed, albeit very modest and small changes, I very much welcome them.  It is a first step in a long process.</P>
      <P>I noticed from the Leader's speech that the existing parameters of the House will remain.  However, once changes have been made we will have to consider how we can alter the existing parameters of the House.  There are some areas where I would like to have seen the Leader go a little further.  For example, the question was raised as to a limited Question Time, which is worth considering.  There is also the matter of the involvement of outside agencies in the affairs of the House &mdash; for example Members of the European Parliament, the President, former Taoisigh, as suggested by Senator Manning, and others.  That proposal is very desirable and is well worth further consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to some of the points of detail contained in the report, I very much welcome the proposal that a time limit be placed on speeches.  That is highly desirable &mdash; Senator Cassidy is looking at me to see whether I will be as good as my word, and I propose to be.  It is very important that people prepare their contributions rather than ramble on <Col N="584" /> and on, at the end of day saying very little, or making a contribution that could have been made in perhaps 10 per cent of the time.  The proposal that there be more Adjournment debates is also welcome. That will give Senators an opportunity to voice their concern in a relatively structured way.  The idea that there be a fixed time for matters to be raised on the Adjournment is fair to the Senators who wish to prepare matters for the Adjournment and also to Ministers who have a very busy schedule and have to try to organise their time.  It is unfair to Ministers to have to wait on tenderhooks for a full day wondering whether a debate on some obscure legislation or statements will fall if, for example, some country Members decide to go home early because of a change in the weather. Such a practice is quite unfair to Ministers and it would be only proper&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I hasten to add that similar reasons might be found by urban Members.  I made the point in relation to rural Members because urban Members, such as myself, do have the luxury of being able to go about our business in our constituencies and then come back to the House.  That is more difficult for someone who has to drive to County Clare and back.  I am pleased to note that progress will be monitored in June.</P>
      <P>It is also sensible that the matters covered by Standing Order 29 and the functioning of that standing order be reviewed.  It seems ridiculous to have a condition that has not been used for ten or 15 years.</P>
      <P>There is one other aspect to which I wish to refer, and in this I was provoked by Senator O'Toole who talked about the way people are elected.  I am unable to understand&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief because there are two other Members who wish to speak on the motion, the longest serving Member in the House and Senator McKenna.</P>
      <P>I welcome the motion.  Being a Member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges has been a great privilege and was a great experience in my helping to formulate the proposals before the House today.  It was great to have all parties and all groups in the House come together to try to make the best contribution possible for the successful future progress and debate of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to speak on three points.  The freeing of the Order of Business, which is abused every day, will give every <Col N="586" /> Member the opportunity to highlight matters of concern in his or her area during the proceedings of the House, whether it be on the same day or on the following day.  It is extremely important to note that when a Member did raise a matter of importance in his or her area it was not covered on local radio.  Under the proposal before the House today the issue will be covered by local radio stations, and individual Members will therefore have an incentive to raise an issue on Matters of Concern.  It is very important that when issues arise in one's own area &mdash; issues that are possibly the most important matters in a locality at a particular time &mdash; they be given national publicity.  It is gratifying that this opportunity is being afforded in the proposal before the House today.</P>
    <P>I would agree with any proposal for former Taoisigh to be made automatic Members of Seanad Éireann.  They would enhance the membership of Seanad Éireann because of their wealth of experience and worldwide contacts. It would be a great honour for us, as Senators&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that relevant to the motion before the House?  The motion concerns reform of the House as constituted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to your guidance. However, because other Members were able to highlight the issue, I trust you will afford me the opportunity to express my delight at the idea that I might have Jack Lynch or Deputy Charles Haughey on this side of the House or Liam Cosgrave or Deputy Garret FitzGerald on the other side.  I shall say no more in that respect and bow to the wishes of the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope some thought might be given to the very good idea that, with the EC Presidency changing every six months, we might have a Commissioner from the country holding the Presidency come to the House and let us know of that country's priorities.  It would be helpful to have a Commissioner discuss those priorities with us and to give Seanad Eireann <Col N="587" /> the opportunity to express our views on matters of importance.  As Paudge Brennan said here on one occasion, it is never the wrong time to do the right thing.</P>
    <P>Those two simple proposals might be considered in the future.  I welcome the motion before the House and I am honoured to have been associated so closely with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief.  I have not yet had the opportunity to make my contribution to item No. 10 on the Order Paper, Statements on the Role of Seanad Éireann, but, with the help of God, I fully intend to do so when we next debate it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I will be awarded injury time for that intervention. In accordance with the wishes of the Chair, I shall make three very brief points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report before the House today is concerned with Standing Orders 28, 29 and 41.  I believe that the proposed changes will prove satisfactory.  The only aspect that bothers me is the proposed new Standing Order 29A.  There is a possibility that matters might be raised and aired very briefly but then left hanging. I should like greater powers to be conferred on the Leader of the House.  I note a potential difficulty here; we might as well forget about the idea if it means an amendment to the Constitution. However, I should like the Leader of the House to be appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, a post already in existence, although dormant at present.  If the Leader attended Cabinet meetings, as happened in the past, he would be able to report on points made <Col N="588" /> in the House.  That would give the House more power and would leave us less dependent on Ministers and Ministers of State.  From that point of view, I should like the Government to seriously consider making this House, as a constituent House of Parliament, more self-sufficient and self-reliant.</P>
    <P>In view of the time constraint, I shall hold the other points I had intended to make until we debate item No. 10.  I thank you for facilitating me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>In the brief two minutes left to me I congratulate the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on the tremendous work done in relation to the reform of Seanad Éireann.</P>
      <P>Since I became a Member of the Seanad I have heard here, on a fairly regular basis, comments, disputes, accusations and different suggestions as to the way the Seanad should be reformed that the general public were watching us and so we should try to conduct our business as we would be expected to.  If we want constructive reform then we should first put our House in order and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges have set about doing that, and for that they are to be complimented.  They have come up with very positive and worthwhile proposals. Given the opportunity to work, I predict that the proposals will be very successful.</P>
      <P>I should like to comment on one or two items specifically.</P>
      <P>Senator Cassidy made an extremely important suggestion in relation to the EC.  There is a forum here that the EC could use in terms of Commissioners and indeed eminent people here or in Europe who will be coming here to speak to us at fairly regular intervals.  There is an opportunity for those people to address this House.  It would add to the stature of the House, not take from it.  I think the Committee on Procedure and Privileges would be disposed towards that suggestion.</P>

      <P>I note the very interesting statement in the motion.  The statement and the submission are very timely, apt and interesting in the context of what we are experiencing at present in our progress towards the implementation of the Internal Market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard the earlier debate in the House, if you would allow me to digress a little, in which the Seanad, quite rightly, is seeking to be relevant by updating its procedures, measures and methods of operation.  I applaud all sides, particularly the new Leader of the House, for his speedy implementation of such measures and the diligence he has <Col N="590" /> brought to bear on his task, particularly the all-party response which he has evoked by his measures.  I noted the last comment, that eminent persons would address the Chamber from time to time. Let us hope I may qualify from time to time for such an appellation.  As an ex-Senator of two terms, I have always been very swift in whatever position I have held, in coming to the Seanad and I am very glad to be here today.</P>
    <P>We will be voting on the Maastricht Treaty on 18 June.  We have all been concentrating on one aspect of it recently but on page 50 of the book dealing with the Treaty entitled <i>11 Consumer Protection</i> it is very interesting to read that the Community will contribute to the attainment of a high level of consumer protection.  It then goes through various measures relating to the Internal Market and member states and what they should do to bring about a high level of awareness of consumer protection.  That sets the scene for what we will be talking about today but in particular it makes this debate relevant and timely.</P>
    <P>I should say at the outset that as well as being responsible for both trade and marketing, I have responsibility for consumer affairs, about which I am very pleased.  It is a topic which concerns everybody worldwide.  It permeates every area of life.  There is no end to it, every topic talked about, every time picked up and everything you look at and read about concerns consumers.  I intend to take it very seriously and I am conscious at all times of the need for fair play all round; we must balance the rights of consumers with the rights of suppliers and, as political people elected through one franchise or another, we tend to be on the side of the consumer.  That is as it should be, as long as we are aware of all the background knowledge because we in essence are <i>pro bono publico.</i>  We represent people is interests and we work for the public good.</P>
    <P>Since I took office I met Mr. Willie Fagan, the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade.  He came to my office and we had a most interesting discussion. I then met him and his staff in their offices <Col N="591" /> and I was greatly impressed by their professionalism and dedication to the myriad aspects of consumerism as they operate here.  During the next few days, I will meet the Consumer Association in Ireland and then I plan to meet my Northern Ireland counterpart when his or her name is announced today or tomorrow. I also plan to meet the Consumer Association in the UK and the Consumer Consultative Council in Brussels, all in the lead-up to the consumer council meeting which will be held at the end of June and which will mark progress to date in the member states and make plans for the future.</P>
    <P>Over the next few years there will be a radical change in the shape of the Community, and we all know what economic and social cohesion will bring about, we have talked of that in so many spheres and now it is imminent.  As I said, I welcome the Maastricht Treaty and what it embodies for consumer protection.  It commits the Community to contributing to a high level of consumer protection through measures adopted for the completion of the Internal Market.  The interests of consumers are reflected in other Community policies as has been made clear in the three year plan of the Commission.  The Maastricht Treaty and the Commission's three year plan contain ambitious targets, adding to the measures, Bills and directives already implemented in this country.  They will flesh out the measures already there.</P>
    <P>The measures already enacted here vary and involve a considerable body of legislation which will benefit consumers. They include toy safety and misleading advertising regulations.  There are also &ldquo;doorstep selling&rdquo; regulations designed to protect the consumer, where he or she could be &ldquo;surprised&rdquo; by a trader and, as a result, enter a contract without adequate opportunity to consider the commitment. I am sure one way or another we have all been at the wrong end of the stick in relation to many of the irregularities which led to the implementation of the measures.  There are regulations to tighten up information on food labels as to <Col N="592" /> the shelf-life of food, embodying a &ldquo;use by&rdquo; rather than a &ldquo;best before&rdquo; date and requiring an indication when foods have been treated with ionizing radiation. These regulations also extend the rules to canteens, restaurants and similar establishments, and that brings us to another sphere about which I will talk later &mdash; the environmental health agencies.</P>
    <P>Regulations to ensure that textiles which are being placed on the market for production must be marked with the names and descriptions of the materials contained therein.  That has come in; we are all aware that when you purchase a garment there is a description of its washability and durability.  There are regulations to control the use of materials, including simulants in contact with foodstuffs, regulations to prevent the importation, manufacture, sale, assembly and export of products which could be mistaken for other consumer products, thereby causing risks to consumers, especially children and regulations to improve the presentation of information about prices of consumer goods.  All these are already in place and indeed are assiduously followed up and brought to the attention of the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade, although he and his staff have very limited resources.  We will have to examine the need to bring consumerism and the knowledge of consumer rights and affairs though the education process in schools, seminars and adult education classes and also to make it available in a physical sense through, what I would hope would be a network of consumer offices where information would be available.  That is all for the future, but there is no harm in thinking about the idea.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act provides that measures will be taken to free the market from barriers to trade based on a high level of consumer protection.  A number of measures has been agreed; the Liability for Defective Products Act which introduced into Irish law for the first time the principle of strict no fault liability. The Act should make it easier now for the injured party to take, and to succeed in, legal action as he or she does not need <Col N="593" /> to prove negligence on the part of the producer.  I should mention at this point that companies which operate to high quality standards in management and production processses should have no problem with the new measures.  That is why so many companies now are seeking to qualify for the ISO 9002 &mdash; the quality standards mark for management and personnel relationships for running their firms.  Irish consumers, of course, benefit from this also.</P>
    <P>It is proposed &mdash; this will be of great interest to Members of this House and to people throughout the country &mdash; to introduce a consumer credit Bill that will control the conditions under which credit is extended to consumers.  This Bill is in preparation at present in the Department of Industry and Commerce.  The expression &ldquo;consumer credit&rdquo; is a description of the broad spectrum of credit business and arrangements, including the various types of loans provided by banks, building societies, moneylenders, pawnbrokers, credit unions, etc.  It covers overdrafts, hire purchase, credit sale, trading cheques, credit cards and budget accounts.  The arrangements governing the transactions vary from case to case with the regard to the amounts involved, the repayment periods involved and the legal nature of the agreements, for example, ownership of goods.  In some cases the transactions are linked to the purchase of goods or services and in others no goods are involved.  There is, however, a sufficiently strong relationship between them all to justify their being made amenable to an application of uniform rules.</P>
    <P>The proposed draft Bill is intended to give effect to the EC Council Directive on consumer credit.  The general intent of this legislation will be to lay down rules which will, as far as possible, apply to agreements under which credit is supplied to consumers, especially moneylending agreements.  If we were to think about it, what will be the main effect of this Bill?  It is a large Bill which in many instances seeks to consolidate and update existing legislation as well as introducing fresh measures.  Indeed, it goes <Col N="594" /> beyond the EC Directive on consumer credit.  The Maastricht Treaty makes the point, that while it lays down in broad terms what should be done in regard to EC Directives on consumer protection, each member state is free to go beyond the directive and act as it sees fit.</P>
    <P>If I were asked what will be the main effect of the Bill, I would say it will ensure that a consumer, when taking out a loan or otherwise availing of credit, will be given the maximum amount of information so that she or he is fully aware of the commitment being undertaken.  That is the essence of the Bill.  If one is taking out a loan, be it from an agency or establishment, it is the lack of information which leads to trouble later.  Many people do not read the small print and do not realise, or are not made aware of, the effects of the rate of interest, the period of the loan, or the accumulation of money due.  The main effect of the rules will be to ensure that a customer will be given the maximum amount of information and that he or she will not be told to read the small print on his or her own.  The information in the small print will be very explicit and clear.  In fact, there will be no small print &mdash; that is the best way of putting it &mdash; everything will be made so clear.</P>
    <P>The legislation will also lay down rules in relation to such matters as early repayment by the consumer, repossession of goods by the creditor, the use of promissory notes and other such matters.</P>
    <P>Moneylending is one form of consumer credit which is governed by detailed legislation. As I said, it has been necessary to review this and relevant legislation in the context of the draft Bill.  The legislation dates back in time and, therefore, obviously requires massive updating.  The Moneylending Acts, 1900 and 1933, which provide for the licensing of moneylenders, the form and content of moneylending agreements and various other matters, will be repealed and the provisions will be embodied in the new draft Bill.</P>
    <P>The Hire Purchase Acts, 1946 to 1980, which make provision in relation to hire purchase and credit sale agreements, and <Col N="595" /> the Pawnbrokers Act, 1964, provides for the licensing of pawnbrokers, the content of pawn tickets and the pawning redemption and sale of pledges, will be updated to bring them into line with the EC Directive. Section 14 of the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, and the Consumer Information Consumer Credit Order, 1987, set down rules for advertising the cost of credit, and credit linked to the purchase of goods and services and they, too, will be brought up-to-date and consolidated in this consumer credit Bill.</P>
    <P>When we talk about moneylenders &mdash; there is no doubt this is an emotive term &mdash; we think about this as a problem. When I spoke in the Seanad on the Friendly Societies Bill, these problems were brought to my attention when dealing with my constituents.  When we talk about the wrongs of moneylending we should make a distinction between the illegal or unlicensed moneylenders and the licensed moneylenders.  There are obviously two types of moneylenders &mdash; licensed or unlicensed and legal or illegal; either term is interchangeable.  It is, of course, the illegal or unlicensed moneylenders, we want to circumscribe by regulations and make sure they do not flourish.  The Combat Poverty Agency drew up a report in 1988 for the Minister for Social Welfare which was made public, and showed clearly &mdash; and they would be dealing with this at first hand &mdash; that unlicensed moneylenders outnumbered licensed moneylenders by 5:1. As you can see immediately, they are much more numerous on the ground.</P>
    <P>Second, the customer has no information or knowledge of the rate of interest which can be exorbitant in some cases.  They do not know who is licensed or unlicensed when the moneylender sets up in business.</P>
    <P>I want to make a distinction between licensed moneylenders, who operate their credit transactions in a businesslike way according to the rules, offer one form of credit &mdash; indeed, in some instances they can operate reasonably satisfactory &mdash; and unlicensed or illegal moneylenders who outnumber them by 5:1 and <Col N="596" /> charge exorbitant rates.  The customer has no notion if the lender is licensed or unlicensed and, of course, in a time of stress and huge financial difficulty he grabs at what seems like an attractive proposition.  So often that all that turns to tears leading to very difficult times. That if where the evils &mdash; which is the right word to use &mdash; of the operation and the manifestly incorrect and unprofessional operations of the illegal or unlicensed moneylender who preys on people become apparent.  They prey upon circumstances in which the consumer finds himself or herself, at a loss and needing credit.  Engaging in credit transactions can be worrying and confusing for consumer who find it necessary to do so.</P>
    <P>The proposed new measures will ensure that consumers are adequately informed about what they are taking on. There is no substitute for knowledge of your product and of your rights.  Providers of most forms of credit will be required to give consumers information on the conditions and cost of credit and on the obligations of the consumer.  The main requirements will be to provide information about the true cost of the credit &mdash; in other words how much you are paying back, at what rate of interest and the cumulative amount that will eventually be realised &mdash; and other terms in advertisements and in written agreements.</P>
    <P>In dealing with consumer legislation we would need to refer to the Competition Act, 1991, which implements in domestic law provisions similar to Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome. Further regulations will be introduced shortly to require that prepackaged foodstuffs bear a reference to the manufacturing or packaging lot to facilitate identification and recall of a product in case of a health risk.  We read in the newspapers from time to time of some firms recalling all their tins or packages of a specific product because of a defect discovered.  This labelling procedure will enable such a lot to be called in very quickly and, therefore, minimise the risk to consumers buying that commodity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="597" /> My colleagues in other areas are responsible for measures which will also benefit consumers: the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications are presently, I understand, examining the legislation of transport and the improvement of controls on the provision of package tours; increased safety control on food production and processing, that comes under the environmental health officers in the Department of Health; and the improvement of information on the labels of medicinal products, energy appliances and products claiming to be environmentally friendly will be shared between various Departments. One would wish that all consumers could be treated under one Department or under one item of legislation. It would be a massive feat and would involve expertise not obtainable within one Department or section or one consumer office.  They in turn would have to call in professionals in one area or another.</P>
    <P>A proposal for a directive on general product safety will establish at Community level that member states ensure that only safe products are produced and marketed.  We hope that proposal will be adopted by the Council of Ministers in June this year.  It will guarantee that consumers will enjoy adequate protection from exposure to unsafe products while at the same time allowing free circulation of goods.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier about the Commission's three-year plan for consumer policy.  It seeks to help the consumer realise to the full the economic benefits of the internal market and sets out priorities for the development of consumer policy in the Community in the areas of consumer representation, consumer information, consumer safety and consumer transactions. We are examining these measures and will be involving ourselves in widespread consultation.  These measures include a proposal for a council directive on the liability of suppliers of services in respect of the accuracy of advertisements which refer to competing products or services; a proposal for a council directive on unfair terms in consumer contracts; a draft proposal <Col N="598" /> for a directive on &ldquo;distance selling&rdquo;, which aims to protect the consumer from fraudulent operations by practitioners of distance selling using techniques such as mail order, telephone, telefax and tele-shopping.  Who has not been the victim of distance selling?  You may get something in the post advertising a product to make you beautiful overnight &mdash; maybe not quite overnight &mdash; or promising an unending supply of books for a very small amount of money.  In one way or another we all fall for the soft touch in one of those areas from time to time and a proposal to protect consumers from that would be very interesting.</P>
    <P>There are also proposals in the area of food labelling.  A proposal to protect consumers from certain practices in relation to timeshare selling is being prepared. We have all seen claims that for a small amount of money you can take a stake in a villa or a flat somewhere and you will have unlimited sun holidays.  I do not know much about it, I just read the ads, but I understand many of the descriptions have been found to be very much exaggerated or inaccurate.</P>
    <P>An innovation which has already started &mdash; and I know many Senators will be aware of it &mdash; is the small claims procedure in the District Court.  Consumers can have claims up to a limit of £500 dealt with speedily, cheaply and informally. Claims can be made for bad workmanship and faulty goods but not for debts or personal injuries.  The procedure is already operating on a pilot basis in Dublin city and county, in County Cork and Sligo town.  We hope to evaluate their progress, but their development all depends on resources.  I learned early on when I came into Government that you can say what you like as long as you qualify it with &ldquo;according to available resources&rdquo;.  I intend to go to those courts and to see how they are progressing.  I understand they operate informally but that they are very successful and while they come under the Department of Justice, they are monitored by the Director of Consumer Affairs and his staff.</P>
    <P>There is considerable momentum in the development of Community <Col N="599" /> measures to protect the consumer.  But, we should not draw the conclusion that the initiative in framing such measures is entirely the preserve of the EC Commission. The most important consumer measures in place in Ireland are the Consumer Information Act, 1978, and the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980.  The 1980 Act provides the legal base for the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs.  The enforcement of much current, and future, legislation is carried out by him &mdash; Mr. Fagan at present &mdash; who has powers of prosecution. His has wide-ranging functions in the enforcement of the laws which he seeks diligently to implement, but again we need to have greater resources in personnel. My aim is to highlight the matter, by speaking about it.</P>
    <P>I am pleased there is such an interest in consumerism and the consumer and that many parties have appointed spokespersons who are responsible for this area. In that way we will make it an everyday practical, political issue whereby the rights of people will be very clearly spelled out.  Information can be had through schools, modules, perhaps, and VPT courses, adult education, explanatory leaflets which frequently the Director of Consumer Affairs brings forward, and through the resources of the Department. I very much support all that is going on.  I believe that information is the most improtant resource for the consumer. The area of consumer rights consumer information, consumer directives, consumer legislation is vast.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, we seek to bring fair play to all but we also seek to explain consumer rights in a very basic sense so that everybody will know where to go for information as to how they can get justice in areas of difficulty or where they have been wronged.  Consumers are our constituents, throughout Europe and throughout this country.  I see consumer rights as the vehicle by which the ordinary man and woman can become aware of what Europe is about in the fullest sense. I commend the House on their initiative in arranging the debate and I look forward <Col N="600" /> very much to what Members will have to say on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I begin by welcoming the Minister back to the House this week. When she was here last week we had a very fruitful discussion and I anticipate today's discussion to be as fruitful.</P>
      <P>I wish to comment on the Minister of State's speech and raise a number of points during the course of my contribution. First, it is obvious from the Minister's speech that she has taken over a Department in which little or no work was done prior to her arrival.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make it easy for the Minister of State who is not long in the Department.  She has listed a litany of regulations which should have been made long ago.  I agree with her when she says that there is a need to strike a balance between the rights of the consumer and the supplier.  This is essential and, in fairness, a reasonable attempt is being made to do this.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said a consumer credit Bill is being prepared and that Bill will deal with the question of credit, with particular reference to moneylending. Such a Bill is long overdue.  I agree totally with her when she says, in relation to credit, that the best way to protect the consumer is to ensure maximum information is provided.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State is aware, consumer protection has been discussed in this House on many occasions and there is legislation in place.  Indeed given her comments today it is clear that we will discuss this subject on many occasions in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should however have been far more active and introduced many of the regulations that the Minister of State mentioned.  Indeed it should be said that far too often in the past consumer legislation was introduced on foot of EC directives when we should have taken the initiative.  The last time we discussed this issue was during the course of the debate on the Liability for Defective Products <Col N="601" /> Act which updates the law in relation to damages.  Indeed, it strengthens the protection for consumers.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the question of faulty or defective products which has assumed greater importance in recent times. Unfortunately, having regard to our performance in the past, we contributed to this problem.  Prior to our entry to the European Community when we protected home produced goods, we permitted a situation to develop where poor quality goods could be produced and sold.  We found that even when trade opened up many manufacturing firms and providers of services continued to produce goods and provide services of poor quality.  However, everyone now realises that there is no place for that attitude because we will only be able to trade our goods and services in a free and fair market if they are of good standard.</P>
    <P>We should also accept that the vast majority of our manufacturing firms now produce goods and provide services of excellent standard.  Indeed it has been established that our manufacturers can compete with the best of them in terms of the quality of product produced.  That should be the source of some satisfaction for us.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of consumer legislation is to provide the necessary safeguards, in particular at retail level.  The Minister of State dealt with this matter in some detail in her contribution.</P>
    <P>Following the completion of the internal market there will be free movement of goods and services within the Community.  That is another reason we need to be even more vigilent in relation to substandard products, and conscious of the fact that there is no place for them in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to the contribution the Director of Consumer Affairs has made in this area.  That office provides an added safeguard.  Indeed, there is a clear need for such an office especially when we take into account the fact that during the past few years this office has received on average 20,000 complaints per annum.  Despite what the Minister of State said, that office is understaffed <Col N="602" /> and many members of the public complain regularly that it is difficult to get through to it by phone.  While many members of the public do make a written complaint, the fact is by the time they get round to putting the complaint &mdash; which can be justified &mdash; in writing it has assumed less significant proportions and as a result they may decide not to proceed any further which is regrettable.</P>
    <P>There is a need to strengthen the powers of the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade, especially as they relate to product safety. For example, I understand the director does not have power to order that unsafe products be taken off the shelf.  I therefore suggest that the Minister of State should remedy that as a matter of urgency.  In her speech the Minister referred to toys sold prior to Christmas. This is a typical case of where the absence of the power to remove unsafe products can manifest itself.  While I am aware that the director can prosecute a retailer for selling unsafe products, given that the Christmas toys market is confined to a few weeks the retailer who is a chancer may feel it is worth the risk selling these toys in the knowledge that they cannot be, legally, removed from the shelves at the point of sale and that by the time a prosecution is taken the profits will have been made.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to the efforts which have been made by the Director of Consumer Affairs and publicised the options that are open to the consumer.  I have here two leaflets provided by his office, a guide to the Sale of Goods and Services Act, 1980 and a guide to the Consumer Information Act, which are very useful.  However, their circulation is not sufficiently widespread.</P>
    <P>I would like to address the question of housing finance.  It is a mine-field with many hidden costs which are not disclosed by the financial institutions.  In recent times there was advertising to the effect that one could get approval in principle for a mortgage within 24 hours.  In real terms that claim means nothing but people bought on the strength of verbal approval only to find later they were refused <Col N="603" /> the loan.  Formal approval, in the case of those who were successful, took anything from ten days to two weeks at best.  The consumer must be protected against that type of advertising, against meaningless claims in public advertising.</P>
    <P>Some financial institutions have recently offered incentive bonuses to brokers who successfully introduce clients for housing loans.  That is unfair competition.  Another objection to this is that the cost will inevitably be passed on to the consumer.  There is a need for a code of conduct in relation to this because the people we are trying to protect here are largely young people making the biggest decision of their life, to purchase their own home.</P>
    <P>Competition between the financial institutions is welcome in the context of repayment rates, maximum terms and types of loans.  However, it is unacceptable that the cost of processing should vary so much between the different societies.  The legal fees charged by one financial institution for processing a loan are double that of another, and the public should be made aware of this.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not refer to Telecom Éireann.  In its current report the consumer magazine <i>Consumer Choice</i> shows clearly that the rental charge and the charges for long distance calls are by far the highest in Europe.  The proportion of time spent by the Ombudsman in endeavouring to sort out complaints about telephone bills, the majority of which are found to be unreasonable anyhow, proves the point I make.  It is unfortunate that we do not have the appeals procedure that is available to other countries in the EC.  Perhaps when the Minister has dealt with this raft of regulations here she might look at that?</P>
    <P>The Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade has been very responsible in all cases.  Consumer protection can be provided in a number of ways.  It can be provided by legislation which, to date, has mainly given effect to EC directives or by the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade &mdash; and clearly much use is being made of that <Col N="604" /> office as the 20,000 complaints per annum over the past couple of years show.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of consumer protection, that is, the demands and survival in the marketplace and the acceptance by the majority that goods can only be successfully marketed when high standards of quality are observed.  Despite that, there are always those who try to pass off substandard goods to unsuspecting customers.  Further safeguards are, therefore, necessary.</P>
    <P>I want to place on record the valuable part played in consumer protection by the Consumer Association of Ireland who constantly draw public attention to anti-consumer practices.  Their work is an added safeguard for consumers.</P>
    <P>While in other areas I might not be so generous with my comments, I have to say that the media have played a very valuable role in this area.  I refer in particular to newspapers who provide weekly columns that highlight the exploitation of ordinary people by shoddy operators who engage in sharp practice.  In many cases these columns have succeeded in getting satisfaction for consumers. Radio and television programmes have also provided an opportunity to redress certain situations and, equally important, have created an awareness among consumers of the right to complain and seek redress when the occasion demands.</P>
    <P>The message is clear.  Despite the legislation and the penalties, the number of complaints submitted to the director's office each year and the fact that the complaints columns and the various media programmes are as busy as ever are evidence that shoddy goods and services are still on offer to the public in some places.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note the areas where most complaints occur.  They occur mostly in relation to consumer goods, household goods, airlines and holidays. Other areas are finance, banking and insurance.  Further examination by us, as legislators, is required and whatever legislation is needed should be put in place.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's contribution. <Col N="605" /> My regret is that many of the regulations she referred to have not been put in place up to now but perhaps it is a case of better late than never.  Bearing in mind the commitment the Minister has shown to these various matters today, I sincerely hope, she will be able to devote the time and energy necessary to put in place very pressing regulations.  I look forward to this House receiving at an early date the legislation she has promised under a number of headings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I have noticed quite distinctly that she has a habit of visiting this House when the other House is in recess, but the Minister is welcome at all times.</P>
      <P>We have many regulations in place and many of the provisions are adequate.  I want to compliment the Minister on this genuine effort to bring all the pieces together in terms of consumer legislation and consumer protection.  We can certainly say that in the past the emphasis was on protecting the manufacturer and supplier rather than taking an overview of the rights of the consumer and the protection the consumer deserved.  Many of these protections have now been put in place.  Although they are in existence and the Minister is now putting them together, perhaps the consumer is not aware of their existence.  The Minister is to be complimented on the fact that in pulling all the strands together she is ensuring that there will be far greater protection for the consumer because he or she will be a far more knowledgeable person.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister what programme she has in mind whereby the consumer will be far better educated with regard to the existence of the various provisions, rights and protections under the Act?  There is little point in having provisions enacted unless the people are aware of them.  I know this is exactly what the Minister is trying to get at in piecing these together. I would like to know her views and how she can communicate all this information to consumers to make them far more aware than they are at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the fact that in the old days the <Col N="606" /> supplier/manufacturer was protected, it is important also that we now strike a balance.  Whether we like it or not we are in an era where we want to create jobs rather than have in legislation restrictive practices in favour of the consumer that may do away with jobs.  We must try to arrive at a happy medium where both can co-exist.  We must ensure that the protection is there for the consumer and, at the same time, that extraneous demands are not made on the supplier to the detriment of cost and sales at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>The Minister's term in the Department of Education was typified by the fact that she was out there meeting people, consulting people, asking their opinions and at the end of the day taking meaningful decisions.  In this Department I see that she is adopting the same very progressive approach.  The Minister has met the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade.  She is arranging to meet her counterpart in the UK and that consultation process will mean we are going to get very good consumer legislation as a result of the Minister taking all shades of opinion into account.  That is what we expect of her and I congratulate her again on that aspect.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard mentioned the Christmas period and the appearance of toys on shop shelves and the fact that many of those toys could be unsafe.  It is correct to say that in the past there was a fairly high incidence of toys appearing on the shelves which could be dangerous for children but it is only right that we should acknowledge there is a major improvement in that area.  All products now are required to have the CE mark which is a mark of quality and safety. Difficulty might arise in relation to products which we import from low-cost countries. What is the position in relation to those imports which may not be as safe as we would like them to be?  There are not in place the same regulations with regard to standards.  We may have bought such toys for the children over a period of time, but it is only having bought them that the danger is recognised.  What defences are there for the consumer relative <Col N="607" /> to the importation of toys, in particular, from low-cost manufacturing countries?</P>
    <P>I notice in the regulation a sentence which provides that wholesalers or retailers may be able to plead certain defences.  That leads to another question. What defences can they plead?  Does it, for instance, provide an avenue for wholesalers or retailers to evade responsibility?  What is their responsibility if a defective or dangerous toy appears on the market which does not comply with the regulations?  I wonder if the Minister would be good enough to elaborate on the defences that wholesalers and retailers can use.</P>
    <P>I come now to door-to-door selling. We are all aware of how the door-to-door salesman operates.  Of necessity he is as good as the next sale.  Obviously the door-to-door salesperson has to make leads, contacts, obtain names, arrive at doors and convince householders that the products he or she is selling are products they cannot do without and that if they do not have them they are not as good as anyone else.  Door-to-door salespersons play on emotions.  There is nothing wrong with that.  A good salesperson has to build up a rapport between the customer and himself or herself in order to ensure that there is that relationship between them which, hopefully for the salesperson, will result in a sale at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>One of the provisions I welcome is the cooling-off period.  Sales are an emotional thing.  Some of us make up our minds maybe to change a car but the financial constraints will tell us that we cannot change it.  When we do change it you can be sure we have been thinking about it perhaps for 12 months or two years but it is very easy to make up your mind when somebody calls to your door and represents a sale to you in terms of its costing 10p a day or 70p a week.  That is the salesperson doing a job and saying &ldquo;one packet of cigarettes a week and you would have this product for your child.&rdquo; You would deny yourself that one packet of cigarettes or whatever it is in order to <Col N="608" /> buy the product.  A good salesperson can build on the positives and at the end of the day definitely feel that the sale is made.  You couch it, therefore, in the lowest possible denominator in order to explain to the customer that you are not really spending much money but, at the end of the day when the interest is charged, many people have a difficulty.</P>
    <P>I have received complaints as a result of direct selling where forms are filled out showing the amount to be paid weekly or monthly in terms of credit sales, but very often the total amount at the point of sale is not filled in until later.  The result is that the person making the purchase does not see the full amount of the credit transaction until two or three weeks after it has been processed.  When the customer's copy comes through the letter box, the person then realises that what costs £20 a month will cost £700 or £800 at the end of the term.</P>
    <P>I have difficulty, therefore, with the seven day clause.  I accept that the salesperson must outline all the details, but I know of a number of instances where it took three weeks for the sale to be processed and the full details of the credit price to be revealed and it was at that stage that the difficulty arose when the seven day cooling off period has elapsed, the consumer does not know whether they still have rights.  The Minister will agree that if the salesperson did not collate all the details and fill in the form completely the consumer has rights.  We all know that the consumer may not be aware of their rights under legislation and, consequently, may be stuck with a sale they cannot afford and in which they would never have got involved had they known they were being hoodwinked.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider the seven days clause in view of the difficulties that can arise.  I must point out lest this be misconstrued, that the number of people who act in that way is minuscule.  These people work on a commission basis and unless there is a sale, they have no cash.  After all, it is the pound that matters at the end of the day. A salesperson has to show some sales in <Col N="609" /> order to generate commission and cash in his pocket.</P>
    <P>The matter of bold print and small print is a major&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>There should be one print.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>There should be one print; I am glad the Minister made that point.  In the past people have been using small print to hoodwink the customer. Naturally people will read larger print rather than small print but we should always read the small print.</P>
      <P>As regards door to door selling, contracts for less than £40 are exempt &mdash; and insurance is one item so listed.  I would like clarification on this point.  If I take out a life assurance policy and premium is, say, £10 per week, is that a monthly contract for £40 or will an insurance contract be considered in terms of its overall cost to the consumer?</P>
      <P>I would be glad if the Minister would elaborate on that point.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to newspaper advertising, particularly classified advertisements and the level of control on these advertisements.  It seems that anything goes as far as classified advertisements are concerned.  They are cheap; it is easy to take out such an advertisement; generally speaking, many people read them and it is easy to make claims that are far from being factual.  I would like the Minister to address this question and say whether there have been complaints in this sphere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to the sale of videos through rental.  On the one hand, the Minister for Justice appoints a person to censor films and videos coming into this country; I welcome his proposal to increase the number of censors as a result of the massive increase in the number of videos being made.  Videos which are rented give trailers of videos that have been outlawed including video nasties and crime films.  In terms of rental sales, should the showing of such trailers be outlawed?  If the censor has asked that they be taken off the shelf, surely these trailers should not be shown to titillate <Col N="610" /> the viewers and encourage them to try to borrow that video.</P>
    <P>Moneylending should be part and parcel of any debate on consumer protection. In many instances I have called for a debate on banking.  It is interesting to compare the totality of charges by banks as against licensed moneylenders. In many instances, there would be very little difference between them.  Hopefully, we will have an opportunity to discuss the role of the financial institutions and we will say much more about them on that occasion.  The prevalence of unlicensed moneylenders is a cause of major concern.  The Minister rightly pointed out that people who are desperate for money suffer great stress.  They go to the financial institutions who are not interested in lending them money because they have no collateral.  These people look for a few extra pounds to buy food, shoes, clothes or whatever. The temptation is there and if they can lay their hands on money they take it, regardless of the consequences.  Unfortunately, unlicensed and unregulated moneylenders will not conform to the practices laid down for legal moneylenders. These people must be rooted out and we must make every effort to ensure that they are brought to court for their evil ways.  In many instances people suffer great trauma because they are unable to repay the money borrowed. In the past, jackpot-tactics were employed by many moneylenders to get their money back, thereby causing even greater trauma and, in many instances, disruption on families.  In raising that point, I again express my concern about the knowledge of consumers of their rights.</P>
    <P>This is an occasion when all of us in public life must pay tribute to credit unions for the way they operate and the kindness they extend to those in difficulty. They are a people's bank.  Credit unions have helped every one of us allay the fears and deal with the problems people have from time to time.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether the Minister, who has special responsibility for trade and marketing and consumer affairs, could <Col N="611" /> play a role in co-ordinating an effort between the Department of Social Welfare and the credit unions, for example, to make people more aware of what is available.  In other words, information should be available so that community welfare officers might be better versed in what is available.  It is inevitable that those in distress will first go to community welfare officers to find out what is available. Help is provided.  However, in-service education on the interaction between credit unions, social welfare agencies, community welfare officers and consumer legislation might be worth while and of benefit to consumers.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to discover that the term &ldquo;better before&rdquo; is to be replaced by the term &ldquo;use by&rdquo;.  It is about time that step was taken.</P>
    <P>I was also very interested to hear the Minister talk about an environmental health agency.  The Minister spoke about produce having an environmental impact.  I should like the Minister to expand her comments a little further and tell us how she envisages the environment will play its role in consumer protection.</P>
    <P>I have very little else to add other than that I am glad to have had the opportunity to make several points on this subject. I am happy that the Minister is placing all her emphasis on getting information to the consumer.  By doing so, she realises that the consumer will be even more protected.  We know we have the legislation and that the Minister will ensure that better protection is provided. The question we must now ask is how we can use that information on the rights of consumers.  I know the Minister will do a good job and I have every confidence that she will be successful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I also should like to welcome the Minister to the House.  I congratulate her on her appointment, particularly on her new responsibility for consumer affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of necessity, the consumer will always be at something of a disadvantage when dealing with big corporations and businesses. Big businesses have the resources <Col N="612" /> and the capacity to study consumers. They have the capacity to analyse consumers and spend much of their time doing just that.  When in doubt, they commission extensive surveys and employ psychologists and other specialists to analyse the thinking processes of consumers and work out how consumers will behave.  On the other hand, the consumer is faced with dealing with huge corporations that have immense resources and experience when it comes to handling an issue.  The business corporations are able to adopt any attitude necessary, from &ldquo;I'm glad you asked me that question&rdquo; to &ldquo;Get stuffed&rdquo;, depending on what is the most appropriate.  It is very important that some effort be made to redress the imbalance in favour of the consumer.  I do not think it will ever be easy to create a completely fair environment for consumers dealing with big business.  Big businesses will always be able to manipulate their relationship with consumers and they will be able to manipulate the circumstances.  That is what they spend their time at; they are constantly changing and thinking of new ways to benefit the consumer or &mdash; if one were to express it in different terms &mdash; to exploit the consumer.</P>
    <P>Misleading advertising is a very big problem.  There is a particular problem with aspects of subliminal advertising, in which messages can be given without the use of actual words &mdash; an impression can be created, an aura generated.  That is a very important aspect of marketing.  In many ways, it is a way of making a consumer feel he or she should purchase some product which he or she has no need for.  Indeed, if a consumer stood back and thought about the product for some time he or she probably would have no wish to purchase it.</P>
    <P>I was particularly interested to hear the Minister talk about various aspects of the food industry.  That is an area in which I have had much interest and involvement in over the years.  I am pleased to hear of the intention to introduce regulations to ensure that foods exposed to ionising radiation will be labelled as such.  It is only fair that consumers should know <Col N="613" /> whether food has been exposed to ionising radiation and make up their minds about whether they wish to purchase such a product.</P>
    <P>Reference has already been made to the change from the term &ldquo;best before&rdquo; to the term &ldquo;use by&rdquo;.  That is a welcome change but there is a need to go much further than that in relation to the hygiene standards of food.  In the latest issue of <i>Check-Out</i> magazine it was stated that about 70 per cent of the cooling cabinets in use did not conform to good hygiene practices in that their temperatures was higher than that considered desirable.  I do not want to make a big issue of that, but I draw attention to the fact that as many as 70 per cent of those cabinets are said to be not working properly.  That implies a risk to the consumer and I cannot think of a way in which it could be easily monitored.  There is considerable difficulty in the regulation of hygiene and in the monitoring the hygienic state of foods.</P>
    <P>Regulations in relation to ingredient and nutritional labelling are welcome developments.  However, again there is a great need to go further.  In particular, there is need for the Minister to deal with manufacturers' claims.  I think specifically of items that carry a label such as &ldquo;low cholesterol&rdquo;.  What exactly is &ldquo;low cholesterol&rdquo;? What is &ldquo;light butter&rdquo; and what is a light spread?  What are healthy foods and what are home-made foods?  What is home-made soup?  Is it a soup made entirely from ingredients produced in someone's home?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fair question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it soup made in someone's home out of a package that was purchased in bulk, or is it soup made to the notion of home-made soup.  Perhaps a head chef might announce to his or her junior chefs that he or she is about to make home-made soup and a business is then able to put up a placard outside the door advertising home-made soup, or home-made pies or other home-made delights.  How does one define the terms &ldquo;pure&rdquo; and &ldquo;environmental&rdquo;?  What <Col N="614" /> does one do when someone legitimately and popularly claims that a produce is high in fibre?  I might add that there is no gripes with that claim and everyone accepts it is true.  But how does one deal with such advertising when at the same time the product might be high in salt and high in cholesterol, two items that a consumer would speed away from.  The only mention of the high salt and high cholesterol content of the product might appear at the bottom of a long list of ingredients, which only the truly committed would bother to read.</P>
      <P>What can we do about the claims made by superstars and personalities in the promotion of products?  Celebrities do not have to advertise food; a superstar might say that he or she rides a particular bicycle but that does not change the quality of the bicycle.  A celebrity eats a particular food and then announces solemnly that he or she feels much better afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>And they might use a particular cosmetic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not mentioning cosmetics, an area about which I must confess a considerable degree of ignorance but I have no doubt that such advertising is used very effectively in regard to cosmetics. Is that fair and to what extent can you control it?  What is to be done in relation to claims, even when you have tight regulations, which move away from advertising and arrange for sympathetic articles to be written in newspapers which effectively amount to a plug but which are written as copy rather than as advertising? If you go too far in restricting the use of those type of claims you will, understandably, be involved in issues relating to the freedom of the press, an area that I do not particularly want to get into.  However, it illustrates a series of dilemmas relating to how the use of different claims promoting products, which in many ways are quite spurious, can be controlled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are the questions of totally unrealistic advertising and how you deal with it.  How, for example do you deal <Col N="615" /> with the way Royal Jelly is promoted?  It is represented as a product which is a cure for everything.  That is not an exaggeration, there is a book listing all that Royal Jelly can do for you.  One section lists most of the major diseases of western society and case histories are included of people who have recovered from cancer or heart disorders as a result of taking Royal Jelly.  If there was an easy cure for these type of problems then it would have been used.  This product is used and sold in significant amounts and is quite expensive.  What is to be done about that and how will it be controlled?</P>
    <P>What is to be done about slimming products?  It is no exaggeration to say that there are thousands of slimming books, all of which claim that if you follow its instructions you will slim down rapidly and live happily ever after.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>You will get the man of your choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is right; that is thrown in as a bonus with a case history or two to illustrate the point.  These ladies and gentlemen appear on chat shows and other programmes to promote this type of tomfoolery and nonsense.  How will that be dealt with?  As far as slimming is concerned, the reality is that over 90 per cent of people who are seriously overweight and who have the best slimming treatments will be back to their original weight in five years' time.  Slimming is a preoccupation of modern society.  If there was a simple answer people would move on to solving some new problem.  I suppose the most incredible and ridiculous dimension of this type of thing is hair restorers.  They do not seem to be as popular as they used to be but there was a time&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator does not need them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not used them but, again, they illustrate how ridiculous these claims are.  Of course the reality is that the claims would not be made if they did <Col N="616" /> not help to sell the product and indeed some of them are pushed very vigorously. There are slimming products which are pushed not only vigorously but highly dangerously also and, to be fair, the Department of Health have issued warnings about the manner in which they should be used, but their sale has been pushed effectively from door to door and by people who are exceptionally anxious to seek redress by invoking the law against anybody who speaks badly of them or contradicts the type of claims they make.  These people would haul you through the courts at the drop of a hat if they got the slightest opportunity, yet their products do not work and are dangerous for a certain proportion of the population.  It is enormously difficult to cope effectively with those matters.</P>
      <P>Ecological labelling and the standards which have been laid down are very welcome, but quite a number of products get around those labellings or certainly they are used to give a misleading impression of the products.  I was pleased to hear the Minister say that where comparative advertising was used at least it would have to be controlled.  I am a bit scared of comparative advertising.  Nobody makes unfavourable comparisons about their own product.  Inevitably there will be an element of less than the full truth in that kind of practice and I would much prefer to see some independent organisation make those type of comparisons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the concerns of all the Senators who spoke in relation to money lending and credit.  It is essential that consumers should know what they are letting themselves in for; much of the time I am certain the do not, otherwise they would not sign certain contracts.  I agree that the cooling-off period should be greater than a week.  I also acknowledge that no matter what cooling-off period you have &mdash; unless you say it is something like 20 years &mdash; inevitably the sales pitch and the methods of working of these organisations will be adjusted to cope with the way the rules have been changed.  If you say the cooling-off period will be one month they will adjust their tactics and practices to cope with that and if you say <Col N="617" /> it will be one year they will come up with some new stunt.  The whole area of consumer affairs is developing and, essentially, any Minister dealing with it will have to run very hard to stand still because, inevitably the people with whom they are dealing will keep on inventing new ways around rules and regulations.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Senator O'Keeffe, has waited for almost a year for a debate on banking, something to which we are all looking forward.  Certainly the number of calls for it would be well into the hundreds, even as many as one thousand. As a weekly ritual I like to speak on the Order of Business and make my call and I am told that we are not allowed to have such a debate.  I know that the banks are very busy at present with their own problems but perhaps when they have sorted out their difficulties they will relent and allow the Department of Finance to authorise this House to go ahead with a debate, if that is not some terrible constitutional contradiction.  It is very important in relation to banking charges that people should be able to work out easily what they are being charged.  I do not know whether I am an average member of the public as far as the banks are concerned but I do not have a clue in regard to what I am charged by the banks.  It would take me a week to work it out and I simply do not have the time, energy or resources to do that. The whole history of the banks suggest they are certainly not into anything that is free to their customers.</P>
    <P>There are just one or two other minor points which I want to mention, one relates to the collection of data base information by certain corporations. Telecom Éireann got involved in data base collection; in other words, they asked people to kindly fill up a whole series of questions about themselves and to let them have that information.  I am not sure the average person has any idea what will become of that information.  It is used to bombard appropriate sectors of the market with junk mail and goodness knows what other type of marketing and selling techniques available.  I have the <Col N="618" /> greatest reservations about the use of that kind of information.  If it is to be used then it is highly desirable there should be some kind of warning in fairly stark terms of what becomes of the information, how they propose to use it, indeed to whom they may sell it and what restrictions are on third parties using that information when it is sold to them.  That is jolly fine if Telecom Éireann are doing it but perhaps a little deduction &mdash; indeed, even a reasonably significant deduction &mdash; from the telephone bill would not be out of place if somebody filled in that type of information.  There is nothing for nothing in this world, and when dealing with those types of organisations, there is nothing for nothing.  That might be one way to approach this matter rather than trying to hook people on illusions and dreams by offering them a ticket in a free draw for a motor car.</P>
    <P>My final point relates to how Telecom Éireann conduct their business with their customers.  Telecom Éireann have had a very long, troubled, and difficult relationship with their customers.  I understand that approximately a quarter of all the complaints the Ombudsman has to deal with arise from disputes about telephone charges and so on and about a quarter of these complaints are upheld by the Ombudsman.  That seems a large fraction of the total number of complaints of which are upheld.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann is a very important organisation in this country, and a telephone is now a necessity.  I would like to see considerably greater degrees of protection afforded to the consumer in the manner in which Telecom can deal with them.  I would like to see guidelines, and a code of practice laid down on what is acceptable and what is unacceptable in the way Telecom deal with their customers. I had to deal with Telecom about a specific case and the responses I got were unacceptable.  I resent the manner in which I was treated when I was making representations on behalf of a constituent who came to me with a case I thought worthy of more consideration than it got. Whatever about the question of giving it more consideration, I expected more <Col N="619" /> courtesy than I got from the people in Telecom Éireann.  Their attitude was &ldquo;why don't you mind your own business?&rdquo; which is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to have the opportunity to say a few words on this very important topic.  First, may I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate her on her appointment.  I know she will give it the same commitment, and bring her enthusiasm and expertise to bear as he did in her former Ministries.</P>
      <P>The fact that this debate has received such widespread recognition from all sides of the House is indicative of how important and appropriate it is that we should debate consumer legislation and the laws to protect the consumer.</P>
      <P>Due to the opening up of the Single Market a multiplicity of products and services will become available, in addition to what is already available, and it is extremely important that we do our bit to inform the consumer of his or her rights and enact legislation that is in the best interest of the consumers.</P>
      <P>It is important to point out, as the Minister said, that organisations and companies which produce quality products, or are endeavouring to produce quality products and services, need not fear this legislation.  There is a great deal of legislation in this area dating from the Sale of Goods Act, 1890; the Hire Purchase Acts, 1946 and 1980; the Consumer Information Act; the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act; and the Defective Products Act, 1991.  A multiplicity of legislation has been brought forward to try to protect the consumer and it is appropriate that we discuss these Acts today and try to highlight them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of local authorities have a further responsibility.  To an extent information emanating from this House and the other House reaches a relatively small proportion of the population, but the local authorities operate at local level and their discussions and negotiations are reported in the local press.  The majority of people buy the local paper and may <Col N="620" /> read reports of those discussions.  The advent of local radio is also extremely important.</P>
    <P>Those of us who are also members of local authorities have a responsibility to convey that information at local level.  It would be very appropriate if local authorities would, as a matter of course, put items of this nature on their agenda for discussions and in that way inform consumers of their rights under the law.  The difficulty is that you may introduce fantastic laws but the number of consumers who are aware of their rights under different legislation are few and far between. For example, how many are aware of their rights under the Hire Purchase Act, 1946?  How many consumers are aware of their rights under the Consumer Information Act, 1978?  Our intention is to inform the consumer of his rights.  How many consumers know that under the Sale of Goods Act that it is against the law to mark an item at a reduced price unless it was at that higher price for 28 consecutive days in the previous three months?  The number of people who know that are few and far between.</P>
    <P>As a matter of interest somebody sought my advice on this point and I had to look up the Act because I was not aware of all their rights under the legislation. I heard of a person who purchased an item and got an invoice for it, but on the back of the invoice the retailer had written that the item was not subject to the description that had been applied in the first instance.  The retailer tried to indicate there was a change in conditions and that the acceptance of goods was on a different basis because he had written on the back of the invoice that the conditions were different from those ordinarily applying.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to persuasive advertising.  It is important that people are aware of the position in relation to persuasive advertising.  All the previous speakers mentioned it but it is extremely important that we highlight the difficulties. Again we may enact as much legislation as we like but unless the consumer is aware of his rights, it is difficult to know what exactly we can do about it. <Col N="621" /> As a nation, we are very slow to complain. If you complain about a product, you may be made to feel as if you had two heads, and that people are saying &ldquo;here he is again, he does nothing but complain&rdquo;, a great many people have that attitude and because of that attitude many of the products being sold today are of inferior quality.  They are sold on the assumption that the individual would be embarrassed to return and complain particularly if there are a number of other people in the shop and if they think the shopkeeper will be annoyed with them.</P>
    <P>I do not know what we as legislators can do about that.  All we can do is continue to inform the general public of their rights under the legislation and hope that in time attitudes to the purchase and sale of goods will change.  Of late people are quite prepared to come forward and complain about products, whereas in the past they would not have been anxious to do so.  The Director of Consumer Affairs has a very onerous responsibility and he is doing a very good job.  I am aware of a number of people who had occasion to get in touch with him and the response they received was positive and he followed up particular cases.  One major international company that had been advertising different goods on the basis that they wanted to reflect different attitudes in the present day world in terms of war, etc., did so in a manner that was unacceptable to the general public but again the Director of Consumer Affairs got involved and tried to deal with it.</P>
    <P>While insurance may not come within the remit of this motion; there is a linkage with the whole insurance area, particularly life and endowment policies etc.  People who have problems in this particular area tell me of the persuasive approach adopted by brokers and agents who when selling policies to individual consumers, like to explain and highlight the benefits of those policies but, on the other hand if some type of growth bond is involved they never explain the fact that in future years that bond may not be as successful as they had anticipated.  They will tell you that after ten years your policy should be worth an enormous amount of money, <Col N="622" /> and you are almost guaranteed that. When you check it out after that period you will be told, &ldquo;we are extremely sorry, we expected those growth bonds to be far more successful but we had a very bad year last year or the year before&rdquo;; the result is that the policy is worth, perhaps, half what the person had expected.  In many cases, apart from a life assurance policy, the investment is worth absolutely nothing.  Alternatively if a person invested the money for ten years even with these licensed money lenders &mdash; whom we are always criticising &mdash; or with the banks or building societies or whatever they would be far better off.  I am not suggesting that people should not take out life assurance.  In fact, it is an absolute essential in the modern age, endowment policies leave much to be desired.  It should be spelled out in very simple language and in no uncertain terms exactly how people will fare in particular circumstances with life assurance.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that a consumer credit Bill to control the conditions under which credit can be extended is to be introduced, that all the Bills which I mentioned will be tidied up and repealed, and that we will have very modern legislation. One could go on discussing it because it is such a wide area with many important aspects.  I am absolutely delighted we had the opportunity to debate this motion and that the Minister of State came into the Seanad today to debate this very important topic.  I wish her every success in the future.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senators who contributed to what was an extremely interesting and lively debate.  As Senator McKenna said, you could see the thought processes of Senators as they spoke and developed their themes.  Senator Michael Howard for Fine Gael, Senator Batt O'Keeffe for the Government side, Senator Pat Upton for Labour and Senator Tony McKenna addressed various issues as they arose throughout the <Col N="623" /> debate.  Is it in order to answer some of the queries and generally sum up?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not mention the questioners but the actual points.  On the safety aspect, the Minister, can, under the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards Act, 1944, make an order concerning the safety of a product, and the Director has further roles within that area.</P>
      <P>Senators Howard, Upton and O'Keeffe addressed Telecom.  The Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications and my Department are presently in consultation in regard to making the activities of that body amenable to the requirements of the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, in the matter of liability for the quality of service provided.  I think that was the general tenor of the complaints which ensued.  A telephone is a very important daily requirement now.  We are examining ways in which the level of service provided can be improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All Senators referred to the need to increase the resources available to the Director of Consumer Affairs, the office staff was increased in 1990 from 23 to 30.  When the Consumer Credit Bill is enacted obviously more resources will be needed, subject to the resources available, which is the talisman under which we all have to operate.  In view of the nature and complexity of the regulations, the directives and legislation and the rights of consumers there will be a much greater need of resources.  If I had a magic wand or if somebody waved one for me in the period when I would be examining this entire area, I would wish that consumer offices existed throughout the country which members of the public could visit, learn their rights and go about having those rights addressed.  I hope it is not just a pipe dream and, perhaps, it is a matter to which we should address ourselves but, of course, the resources come into play.  It is a matter we should <Col N="624" /> have on our list of priorities, and the Bill to be introduced will highlight the need.</P>
    <P>There were questions about toys.  Toys must, as we know, conform to the EC toy safety regulations.  Defective toys are confiscated and those trading in them, therefore, are at a loss.  Apart from the toy safety rules, any product which causes physical damage to property or to a person would be subject to the provisions of the Liability Act, 1991.  Cases taken by the director are highlighted from time to time, but how many escape our notice simply because he or his staff cannot pursue them or because, as Senator McKenna said, the public do not complain. It is not that the public are stroppy; it is that they are becoming well aware that it is up to them to complain.  When I was young I would die of shame if my parents or elders started to complain in a restaurant or shop &mdash; I would be fit to crawl under the table.  Thankfully, young people today are far livelier, are better informed and will not buy or keep a product if there is anything wrong with it.</P>
    <P>With regard to advertisements, the Minister for Industry and Commerce made a consumer credit order in 1984 which dealt with classified advertisments. It stipulated that the advertisement should indicate where the seller was active in the course of a business.  At present any misleading claims in relation to food would contravene the food labelling regulations.  However, there are proposals at EC level in this area as the Senator mentioned.</P>
    <P>We need to look at that matter also to see what can be done.  With regard to claims made in respect of diets and fads, these will be dealt with by the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned at the outset many Departments, including the Departments of Industry and Commerce, Health, Environment, Tourism, Transport and Communications and Justice, are involved in this area but I would like to see the matter dealt with by one Department. However, it would be very difficult to do this given the professionalism needed.</P>
    <P>Many queries were raised in regard <Col N="625" /> to the cooling off period.  The consumer credit Bill provides that an agreement will not take effect until after the cooling off period.  Senator Howard, who mentioned Telecom Éireann, rightly said that we have been tardy and asked us to move a big faster.  I cannot quibble with that. The Senator said it in a kind way and I take it in that vein.  As I said, I intend to get it together.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Keeffe referred to products and toys from countries with low labour costs.  I should say however that toys from EC countries or countries with low labour costs have to meet the same standards.  On occasion, the product found to be defective comes from a country with low labour costs.  Senator O'Keeffe also wondered how we were going to educate people.  However I will address that point later.</P>
    <P>Senator Upton mentioned &ldquo;unreal advertising&rdquo; and painted a piquant picture of the ways the subliminal message is put across.  The thought struck me as he spoke that perhaps the political parties should take note of what he said, given that we all seek to send out messages particularly at election time.  Perhaps we should make regulations about ourselves. In any event we will have to be more careful about the claims we make with regard to our prowess or the unlimited vistas we open up to the electorate at election time.  Now that these regulations and directives are to be put into force we may have to comply with a very strict job description and fulfil any promises made.</P>
    <P>Senator McKenna also wanted to know how we are going to educate people, a topic on which I hold strong views.  Perhaps in the few minutes that remain we could discuss this question.  No matter what way we look at it, it comes down to a question of education.  The purpose of the consumer credit legislation that I set out today is to consolidate all the legislation that has been passed dealing with consumer credit in our Bill.</P>
    <P>In response to Senator Howard, it is comprehensive legislation, and contains 60 &ldquo;heads&rdquo; approximately.  Regulations are already in place and we hope to implement the proposals in the directives. <Col N="626" /> While there will always be a need to adapt these directives to suit the needs of the country, above all there is the need for consumer education.</P>
    <P>Consumers' need should be highlighted in a simple fashion for young people in civics in primary school.  I understand that the Director of Consumer Affairs met with Albert Ó Ceallaigh of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment to discuss the possibility of providing a module on consumer affairs and protection in second level schools.  I would envisage it as a module in the vocational, preparation and training programmes which run throughout the country.  Consumer information is admirably provided by the Consumers Association of Ireland through their magazine, by bodies such as the ICA and others, while night classes and outreach courses are organised in most towns and villages by vocational schools.  I note also that in the United Kingdom a student of the year competition is organised for young people at primary, post-primary, and third level.  It attracts great publicity and is availed of by young people.  I will explore these ideas when I meet my counterparts to find out what is happening in other countries with regard to consumer legislation.</P>
    <P>We want to ensure fair play all round &mdash; Senator Howard made this point also &mdash; and, obviously, we do not want to restrict business or to see false claims being made with the result that there would be no commercial interaction between vendors and purchasers.  Buying and selling is the oldest task in the book but we need to give it shape and strike a balance between the rights of the consumer and those who sell, the retailers. As legislators, we must always be on the side of the consumer, assume that the consumer needs protection and ensure that the consumer receives up-to-date information.  That is what I intend to do.  The caveat, <i>caveat emptor</i>&mdash; let the buyer beware &mdash; is relevant.  However the buyer will not be aware unless he or she has all the necessary information.  I envisage many more debates before this <Col N="627" /> legislation is finally introduced and I am committed to introducing it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>In debating this last week we touched on many areas.  I want to move past the point raised last week to a <Col N="628" /> new area.  The announcement last night by the Minister for Justice was pertinent to the matter we discussed here last week. It worries me when I hear that the answer to crime is the establishment of some conference for the law enforcement agencies. On too many occasions we have lost the opportunity to look at crime prevention. I have always taken the view that there is something wrong in a society where we can predict so easily where our prison population might come from.</P>
      <P>Last week I criticised the approach of those who would measure the effectiveness of the prison system by the number of inmates detained in it at any one time.  Society can be tested in many different ways.  We can walk into the nursery of any maternity hospital in this city and look at all the children there. They all look exactly alike, covered by the same colour blanket in the same kind of carry cot, one indefinable and no different from the next except to a mature and discriminatory eye.  The sad thing is that a casual look at the home addresses of those children will allow us to predict broadly how those young children will spend their lives, how they will grow up and whether they are likely to be involved in crime.</P>
      <P>I often use this argument in talking to those people who would consider themselves to be very much in favour of life and qualify of life, pro-life and other aspects to it.  Why is it that if I see the address to be Darndale or deep in the inner city that I know that child has a very strong likelihood of finishing up in prison?  Look at it the other way.  Why is it if I go to any prison in the country and take the addresses of the inmates that the majority of them would come from certain types of neighbourhoods, certain areas?  Is it that these children are born with some sort of innate predetermination towards crime?  I do not believe that to be the case.  Something happens between the time they leave that nursery and the time they arrive in prison and it is very simple to follow through the train of thought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of those children will leave hospital and they will go to homes that <Col N="629" /> are warm and clean and spacious.  Others will go to homes which are overcrowded, cold, dirty, badly equipped, and immediately the difference begins.  Over the course of the next two or three years some of those children will learn to play with sand in the utility room or they will go on holidays or Sunday drives, trips abroad; they will have a wealth of experience which any child should have.  Others may not be allowed out to the balcony in case they fall down from the fourth storey.  They never get out, they never get to see beyond their own neighbourhood. Their parents cannot offer them the luxuries or the alternatives of pre-school or the local Montessori school, and they eventually arrive at their primary school.</P>
    <P>Some of those children will arrive at a primary school which is well heated, well lit, well equipped, painted regularly, in a neighbourhood where they are safe. Others will go to a primary school in a deprived neighbourhood, where the board of management do not have enough money to keep the school in operation, where the teachers are at their wits' end trying to hold the school together, and these children are already at a disadvantage compared to those who have come from a better off background because we have never helped them in between.  Their readiness to learn is impaired; their readiness to participate in the system is impaired.  They will go through the system.  They will go right through the primary school and every year the lack of privilege, the disadvantage, will be reinforced, consolidated by further deprivation, further cutbacks.  I am not pointing the finger at any particular Government or any particular system in dealing with this point, but the reality is that is what happens. They go through the primary system and by the time they come to change to the post primary school there will be a yawning gap between the haves and the have-nots in society.</P>
    <P>They will learn indiscipline through the world around them.  Schools, even at the best of times, can barely compensate. The only time we really put money into these people is when they arrive at the <Col N="630" /> courts and when they arrive at prison. We have the whole thing cockeyed.  I ask the Minister of State to bring this back to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Last week I was careful to say some positive things about this debate but the reality is that I am meeting a delegation of teachers tomorrow morning from a part of the north Clondalkin area of this city where they just cannot cope.  Would it surprise you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, to know that on two occasions in the past month principals of primary schools rang up my office with an unusual query: to ask me what they do in a situation when they have fifth and sixth class children driving to school in their own cars.  I know of another school in the same area where yesterday week they took three burntout cars from the school playground. These are primary schools, where the average age of the children is in the low teens.  Can anyone imagine what that area will be like in five or six or seven years time when these youngsters really find their feet?  A huge number of those kids will finish up in prison.  In years to come we will be debating the subject of crime and the figures in those areas will be high.</P>
    <P>I said last week that I am sick and tired of craw-thumping pieties every time there is a prison suicide.  Do we now look forward to a situation where we will sack the principal if there is a school suicide or blame the parents if there is a suicide at home?  The motion before us is far too facile.  It is an insult to the intelligence. It is the role of the Opposition to take the Government to task and they are right to do so.  The Government have to take responsibility because they are in control and have to carry the can, but they cannot be held wholly to blame. We should see a balance of proposals. Enough is not being done by the Government but the answer is not to build more prisons or to fill existing prisons.  The answer is to prevent crime before it begins through serious investment in the elimination of under privilege in an attempt to wipe out disadvantage and to compensate for the difference between the privileged and the under privileged <Col N="631" /> by investing in education, particularly primary education.  This is the only area where not only can we compensate for under privilege but we can also break the vicious cycle of under privilege which leads to crime and imprisonment.  We should be talking about prevention, not enforcement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the good wishes extended to the Minister of State.  I congratulate him on his appointment and wish him every success.</P>
      <P>Last week the Minister for Justice addressed the House on this motion and he gave a balanced account of the crime situation and of the Government's response to it.  He did not seek to understate the seriousness of the problem or to deny the fact that the crime rate is increasing.  He pointed out that while the official figures for 1991 are not yet available the indications are that they will show an increase of between 7 per cent and 8 per cent on the 1990 figures.  Any increase in the crime rate must be regarded as a serious matter.  It is also important, however, that a totally exaggerated picture is not presented.  We must be conscious of the effect which any overstatement of the problem is likely to have.  Many people, particularly the elderly and those living alone, are living in constant fear.  They see themselves as vulnerable to crime and in many cases they have been the victims of crime.  Any exaggeration of the seriousness of the problem will only make life more difficult for these people by increasing the fear and apprehension they feel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to put the matter in perspective it is important to bear in mind that the crime rate here is very low compared with other European countries. We have approximately 25 crimes recorded per 1,000 of the population compared with 74 per 1,000 population in England and Wales and 71 per 1,000 in Germany.  It is also important to remember that the crime figures here fell from 99,727 in 1984 to 87,658 in 1990. Even allowing for an 8 per cent increase in the 1991 figure which would bring it <Col N="632" /> up to between 94,000 and 95,000, the total would still be 5,000 below the 1984 figure.  The objective, however, must be to continue to endeavour to halt the upward trend which has been evident in the past couple of years and to reverse that trend by stamping out criminal activity to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    <P>One certain way of stamping out criminal activity is to prove to the criminal that crime does not pay.  Unfortunately that would not appear to be the case at present.  According to the 1990 crime report the total value of property stolen in that year was in excess of £36 million, of which only slightly over £3 million worth was recovered.  I do not know whether any attempt has ever been made to quantify the value of the illegal drug trade.  It is reasonable to assume that very substantial profits accrue to those criminals who engage in the sale and supply of drugs.  Crime in this country pays very handsomely.  This must be changed.  I was pleased to hear the Minsiter state that he proposes to introduce legislation in the near future which will provide for the confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking and of other serious crimes.  Criminals must no longer be allowed to enjoy their ill-gotten profits. I am confident that when this legislation is enacted and enforced against drug traffickers in particular we will see a significant reduction in the availability of drugs, with a consequent reduction in drug abuse.  This will lead in turn to a reduction in the level of drug-related crimes such as house breaking and theft, the purpose of which is to get money to buy drugs.  That is why it is so important to win the war against the drug traffickers. I join with the Minister in congratulating the Garda on their success in dealing with this problem.  It is very encouraging to note that in 1990 there was an increase of over 50 per cent in the number of persons charged with drug offences and an increase of almost 50 per cent in the number of drug seizures.  I hope the 1991 figures will show further successes in this area.</P>
    <P>A question which needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency is that of <Col N="633" /> bail.  Any criminal, irrespective of the seriousness of the crime with which he is charged, is almost certain to be granted bail.  I understand the only grounds on which bail is likely to be refused are the likelihood that the criminal will leave the jurisdiction or the probability that witnesses will be interfered with.  Once granted bail, there is every incentive to commit further crimes while awaiting trial.  If there is a strong case against him he will have a fair idea of the length of the prison sentence the court is likely to hand down.  He will know from experience that any further sentences that may be imposed will be ordered to run concurrently. Therefore he has nothing to lose in engaging in a further series of robberies while on bail.  The worst that can happen is that he will be caught, but it is unlikely that the length of his sentence will be affected.  If he is lucky, he will not be caught and he will have the full benefit of the proceeds of these further crimes when released.  This situation must be changed and I would strongly urge the Minister to give serious consideration to the matter.</P>
    <P>Sentencing policy also needs to be looked at.  I understand this question is being considered by the Law Reform Commission and I do not intend to go into any great detail, except to say that the general public are not convinced that the courts are consistent in relation to sentencing or that the sentences imposed for serious crimes are sufficiently severe to act as a deterrent.  The defence is entitled to plead for leniency for a defendant and to seek to convince the court that a lengthy sentence should not be imposed.  The prosecution does not have a similar right to demand a stiffer sentence or to appeal to a higher court to have a more severe sentence imposed. I hope these matters will be addressed by the Law Reform Commission and that their recommendations will be implemented in legislation.</P>
    <P>Another criticism frequently made of the courts is that at times there seems to be more emphasis on technicalities than on establishing innocence or guilt.  It is very important to the victims of crime <Col N="634" /> that the courts be seen to be on their side rather than on the side of the criminals. This is something which came across very clearly on the recent &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; which dealt with the crime problem in the country.  For those viewers who are fortunate enough not to have experienced the trauma of crime, this show was an eye opener.  First, the extent of the shock and distress suffered by the victims of crime came across very clearly in that programme.  The second point which surprised many people was the revelation that in a number of the incidents which were discussed it was not adults or teenagers who were involved but very young children.</P>
    <P>Up to recently crime was seen mainly as an urban problem.  Rural areas generally were relatively free from serious crime.  However, that position has changed very drastically.  I live in the Garda division of Roscommon-Galway east.  Traditionally this division had one of the lowest crime rates in the country. I do not know what the 1991 figure will show but certainly from reading the local papers and listening to local radio it appears that the number of robberies, break-ins and thefts in that part of the country is increasing rapidly.  It is generally believed that many of these crimes are committed by well-organised, ruthless gangs from Dublin who make their way down the country.  Indeed, the cases which the Garda have been successful in bringing to courts and the criminals they have succeeded in apprehending seem to bear this out.  Many of those who have apeared before the courts have Dublin addresses and, indeed, many of them have long criminal records.</P>
    <P>It also appears that a number of factors have influenced these individuals to move their operations out of Dublin.  Many of these criminals are well known to the city gardaí and, therefore, the risk of being caught is much greater.  Second, business people, property owners and householders in the larger urban areas are more security conscious than are people living in rural areas and, therefore, it is much easier for the criminal to operate in rural areas.  This is part of the problem.  I would <Col N="635" /> like to see people in rural areas becoming much more security conscious.</P>
    <P>It is in everybody's interest to make things as difficult as possible for criminals and schemes such as Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch have a major role to play in this regard.  If we are to be successful in defeating criminals, the community and the Garda must work hand in hand.  It appears there is a ready market for goods which are stolen. Unless these goods are marked, which is very seldom the case, even if the Garda have their suspicions as to the receivers it is impossible to identify the stolen property and, therefore, it is impossible to bring the thieves or the receivers of the stolen property to justice.  I understand there are many ways in which goods which are liable to be stolen can be invisibly marked.  If this were done it would increase the likelihood of detection and conviction.  I would like to see the Garda undertake a publicity campaign to urge people to consider the advisability of marking items.</P>
    <P>Another point made to me in recent times during discussions on the crime problem is that there should be much more regular night-time patrolling of rural areas and also that there should be more Garda check-points at strategic locations, such as the bridges on the Shannon.  There is no greater deterrent to the would-be criminal than an obvious Garda presence.  Among those who have suffered most in recent years at the hands of the criminals have been tourists, visitors to our country.  Apart from anything else, the publicity resulting from this type of crime has been very damaging to the country's image.  There have been many cases where tourists have been beaten or mugged, their property has been stolen and their cars have been broken into and in some cases badly damaged or stolen. There was also the tragic case last year of the young German tourist who was brutally beaten to death.  I am very pleased that the problem of crimes against tourists is being addressed in the Criminal Evidence Bill, 1922.  This legislation, when it is passed, will make it <Col N="636" /> easier to bring to justice those who commit these despicable crimes.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his speech, referred to the problem of thuggery and intimidation on our streets.  This is a very serious problem, especially late at night, in certain areas where groups of drunken or half drunken young blackguards congregate and, by their behaviour, succeed in terrorising law-abiding citizens going about their business.  The Minister has stated that he proposes to bring in a Bill to deal with this problem, and I welcome that announcement.  I am glad the Garda will be given powers in that legislation to deal with thugs who terrorise people late at night on our streets.  I certainly hope the penalties proposed will be sufficiently severe to act as a real deterrent and that the effects of the legislation will be to rid our streets of that type of problem.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in this very important debate. Crime is a matter of concern to every citizen.  One of the most important duties of any Government is to ensure that as far as possible people are safe in their houses or on the streets and that their property is protected from damage and theft.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  It is the first time he has been here since his recent promotion and I wish him every success in his Department.</P>
      <P>As the previous speaker said, the present debate is one of the most pertinent and most serious that has come before this House.  It is relevant to us all. The motion in the name of our spokesman, and supported by members of this group, in relation to both urban and rural crime is relevant and important.  It is a matter that needs to be addressed by us all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>None of us could fail to have been moved by the recent &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; on crime and the people who appeared on that programme.  There is no doubt that in the past victims of crime unfortunately have been the neglected persons, the forgotten persons.  For far too long we have concentrated on the rights <Col N="637" /> of the criminal, improving their facilities and looking for excuses why they have committed various crimes, without any thought as to what can be done for victims of crime.  I hope the Minister can assure these people that they are going to be considered.</P>
    <P>Obviously there are many factors as to why crimes are committed.  It is at times far too easy to regard problems of social inequality and deprivation as justification for community crime.  That is one reason I would partly disagree with the comments made by Senator O'Toole about the need to examine the causes and the events leading to crime.  Basically, that seems an attempt to excuse the criminal. Senator O'Toole talked about criminals coming from under-privileged areas, but many people from those areas do not commit crimes.  Many of the youth from those areas have parents who see to it that their charges are well behaved and do not commit crimes.  We must also remember that many of the criminals from those areas are not under-privileged but are doing reasonably well.  It is facile to try to explain away the incidence of crime by wheeling out various oft-heard excuses and to say that it all boils down to social deprivation.</P>
    <P>It is important that we agree with the Minister that it is the responsibility of all of us.  We have to support the Garda.  We must not turn a blind eye to crime, if it is not oneself or a friend who is a victim of crime today, it could be oneself or a friend who is the victim tomorrow.  It is obvious that parenting plays a certain role in crime, particularly in relation to a child's early years.</P>
    <P>It is important that we all support the Garda in their efforts to prevent and combat crime.  I recall that when the Dáil was debating criminal justice legislation a couple of years ago Members were given a hundred reasons that we should not tamper in any way with the rights of the criminal, yet once again it was forgotten that it is the victim who suffers.  We are all aware of the vast amounts spent on the prison system, on rehabilitation and crime prevention.  Tonight I say to the <Col N="638" /> Minister that something has to be done in relation to criminal injuries compensation. The fund in that respect was abolished but it should be reintroduced to assist the victims of crime, for far too long the victims have been the forgotten people.  It is important, too, that victims of crime receive follow-up contact from members of the Garda and from social workers.  All of the time and the concern should not be concentrated on the welfare of the criminal.  There are once-off criminals who have to be looked after, rehabilitated and brought back into society but we should not forget the victims.</P>
    <P>We must examine the way in which the court system works.  At the District Court level particularly, gardaí are often compelled to attend a court sitting for a couple of hours merely to consent to a remand sentence.  In this regard procedures should be changed to enable gardaí to be out on the streets, where they are needed most, and communicate with the people.  In the case of an application for a remand sentence there should be a consent facility such as the facility used at times in civil matters.</P>
    <P>A welcome provision is the proposed change for &ldquo;Garda Patrol&rdquo;, which is aimed at modernising the procedure and gaining more public involvement.  Most of us to have watched the English &ldquo;Crimewatch&rdquo; television programme.  First a programme is screened earlier in the evening, seeking responses and appeals for help, and later there is a programme providing feedback to the public. Resources should be put into the production of a similar programme in Ireland.  RTE have a role to play in that regard.  Any change that wins more public involvement in the area of crime &mdash; whether in relation to petty robberies, more serious crimes, crimes involving attacks on individuals or whatever &mdash; has to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The question of sentencing policy and variations in that regard have to be considered. Special regard has to be had to crimes against the person.  On occasions we have witnessed inadequate sentences being imposed on those who may have <Col N="639" /> committed horrific crimes such as, the rape of an 80 year old woman or of an old man or old woman being attacked and beaten up in their own homes.</P>
    <P>A matter that I hope to raise on the Adjournment debate, or which I shall certainly raise on a future date, concerns a case we heard about only last week in which a couple of individuals were convicted for the rape of an under aged girl.  Basically, they were let off by way of a couple of years' suspended sentence and the payment of £1,000 by way of compensation.  I say to the Minister that such a sentence is not good enough; it is just not right.  The United Kingdom has a facility that provides for appeal when sentences are considered inadequate.  If an excessive sentence is imposed, a criminal here may appeal to the Minister or to higher courts to reduce the sentence. There should be something done to ensure that inadequate sentences can be reviewed, particularly in the case of crimes against the person.  A criminal may get out of jail after perhaps six months or a year, perhaps with a fine or a suspended sentence, but the poor victim is left carrying the legacy of a few minutes' attack, assault or crime, probably for the rest of his or her life. More has to be done to protect our old people whether they be in the urban or the rural areas.  The Minister's constituency straddles both ends of the divide, I think, so I am sure that he is aware of the problem.</P>
    <P>All of those areas have to be examined. It is time for some of the pussy-footing to end.  It is time we had a concerted policy, particularly in relation to those who attack the elderly.  I am thinking specifically of a recent horrific case in which a man in his thirties was convicted of the rape of an 80 year old woman. Such crimes must make all of us in the House cop on to what we are about. In the light of today's announcements, reforms and welcome innovations, it is about time that we in the Oireachtas sent out a message, along with a message to the Judiciary, that what has gone on for far too long has got to stop now.  In <Col N="640" /> relation to the message to go to the Judiciary, I must add that I do know there are many justices who are very much up to date and who will not take lightly attacks on individuals, particularly on older people and women.</P>
    <P>Another matter that has to be considered is that of bail.  It is nearly too easy to get bail and then be out on the streets committing further crimes.  While consecutive sentencing, as distinct from concurrent sentencing, may apply in some instances, the chances are that someone convicted of committing more than one crime will not have those crimes dealt with on a <i>pro rata</i> basis.  As was said, if a person on bail knows he will be convicted, he will make enough to support himself and his family when he is serving time.</P>
    <P>Obviously another question which must be looked at is Garda training and retraining.  Every Member supports the Garda Síochána in their various and difficult tasks and we must ensure that the people trained to be gardaí are doing what they were trained to do, not pen pushing, filling out forms for a dog licence or some other basic job that could be carried out by someone else needing a job but not trained as a garda.  Retraining and upgraded trading must obviously be part of the job.  There should also be a review and update of the Neighbourhood Watch scheme to see how it is now working, where it had been working reasonably well or where there was initially a very active committee.  However, enthusiasm may have waned and the Minister should examine the Neighbourhood Watch scheme to see if it can be improved.</P>
    <P>Obviously a lot of our crime is drug related and every effort should be made to convict all the drug barons, to go after their ill-gotten gains and, where possible, to put them away for a very long time.  I support the motion on crime put down by our spokesperson, Senator Neville, in relation to crime, urban or rural, petty or serious &mdash; involving murder, assault and rape.  The whole question must be examined.  I hope the Minister will take on board some of the matters I mentioned <Col N="641" /> here tonight.  We should discuss crime every few months to ensure that the people who voted for us are satisfied that we are aware of the problem, which is apolitical and must be tackled by all. We must support the Garda Síochána because the problem affects everyone and we cannot ignore it.</P>

      <P>I listened to Senator Neville last week describing O'Connell Street.  Possibly in a couple of years' time it will be a no-go area.  I assume he was referring to O'Connell Street, Dublin, and not in Limerick.  I assure him that O'Connell Street is not as bad in relation to crime as he thinks.  I have been in business in that area for almost 30 years and during that time I have had no major problems.  I have had small problems, like everybody in business, but no real problems.  I cannot see it changing; it has been like that for 30 years, maybe longer. It has not got any worse and I cannot see it getting worse in the future.  There is no question of it being a no-go area as far as I am concerned.  There is no doubt there is a problem with crime in the city, indeed in every city, Cork, Limerick and Galway.  The same applies to cities abroad and I do not think there is any easy solution.</P>
      <P>People demand the appointment of more gardaí but that raises a budgetary problem.  I am sure the Minister for Justice would love to put more gardaí on the street if he had the money to do so. However, when he cannot get it, his hands are tied to some extent.  Perhaps a solution might be to release many of the gardaí doing office work in the Depot, Harcourt Square, and other places which could be done by civilians.  This would release gardaí to patrol the streets where they might be of more benefit to the public.</P>

    <P>The same people seem to cause most <Col N="642" /> of the problem in relation to crime because, as has been said by other speakers, they are let out on bail of £50.  They are then back on the street creating the same problems and committing the same crimes for which they were imprisoned. That system will have to be tightened up very quickly.  The other problem is that even when they are sentenced to 12 months they may be out one week later although they are hardened criminals.  I accept they are released due to overcrowding, but this is a major problem and we need more places of detention. Unfortunately, that also costs money and I do not know how we will solve that problem.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána are doing a fantastic job in the city centre.  I have been closely connected with Store Street division down the years and they are doing trojan work there with the present manpower. I would be very happy to accompany Senator Neville on a tour of the area, and he will find there is no major problem there.</P>
    <P>When people are sentenced they should stay in jail until they finish their sentence, which might have some effect on them.  At the moment they are tumbing their noses at the police a week after they have been sentenced.  Dublin city centre is not as bad as Senator Neville suggests.  It will always have small problems but I have no problem trading there and to the best of my knowledge, very few of my friends have either.  The Minister should look at a system of trying to release more office staff on the streets.</P>
    <P>As Senator Cosgrave said, everybody supports the Garda Síochána.  I was at a Neighbourhood Watch function recently and prizes were given to the different areas that won.  It was a great pleasure to see how crime had been reduced in the areas in which the show was operating. It is up to us all to help the Garda Síochána as much as possible; it is the best way we can reduce the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy O'Dea, to the House and wish him well in his new portfolio.  I will not <Col N="643" /> go back over all the points that have been made; some very valid points were made in the debate here last week.  Everybody spoke with sincerity and the Minister made an excellent address to this House. In some ways it was heartening.  He pointed out that our crime rate compared very favourably with the crime rate in Europe and that we are in a better position than most other countries.  While that is heartening, it does not mean we can be complacent, because people are genuinely living in fear in certain parts of the country. The day of the &ldquo;door on the latch&rdquo; has disappeared in rural Ireland.  That is sad because there was a tradition in this country where a neighbour, friend or anybody who called could put their hand on the latch and walk straight into the kitchen, and there was no big deal about it.  That day has long since gone.</P>
      <P>I intend to concentrate on the policing of rural areas but prior to this may I agree with Senator Bohan's point on the number of gardaí who are engaged on administrative duties.  It is quite unnecessary that we should have so many trained, uniformed gardaí carrying out clerical duties in the administration of the Garda Síochána.  Surely these duties could be carried out by capable and qualified clerical officers, male or female, and the people who are trained to detect and prevent crime could be out doing the job they were trained to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect that is very hard to understand is the numbers of gardaí whose time is taken up in attending at court.  It is an absolute disgrace to find dozens of gardaí waiting, for days in some cases, to be called to give five minutes evidence.  I ask the Minister to see if a way can be found to alleviate this position.  It may be necessary to enact a new Bill whereby Garda evidence could be given by sworn affidavit, and the garda could be brought back to the court if complications arose.  The Garda Síochána should not be asked to sit in the corridors of the courts day in day out when they could be out on the streets.  If you multiply the numbers to be found in one court by courts in the land one will have an idea <Col N="644" /> of the numbers of gardaí who are in court on any day of the week the courts are sitting.  That is a total waste of resources.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister consider this seriously and, if necessary, enact legislation to cover situations where gardaí could give evidence on tape.  In recent legislation we made provision for children under 17 years and the mentally handicapped to give evidence in this way in cases of sexual abuse.  Surely something similar could be provided for the Garda Síochána and should complications or doubts arise the garda could be called to give evidence directly.  Any procedure would be far better than what we have at present.</P>
    <P>I believe it was a backward step to reduce the number of gardaí in rural areas.  I am not talking about recent decisions but about what has happened over a period of perhaps ten years or more, where the number of gardaí in rural stations decreased.  I can identify several stations in the Roscommon-east Galway divisional area, which is quite close to me, which had a sergeant and two gardaí some years ago, but now has only a visiting garda.  That is a pity.  It has opened up the rural area to the extent that the criminal has pretty well a free hand, because houses and even shops are isolated.  There may be three or four miles between two different retail outlets and the opportunity for crime in that situation has increased dramatically due to the fact that we have no gardaí on the ground.</P>
    <P>In the past the local garda toured around, and was involved in local organisations; perhaps he played with the local GAA team, or was involved in the local sports club or community centre, the local credit union or whatever.  He was involved in some activity in the locality and was always in a position to know exactly what was happening because people took him as one of their own. They thought it was in their interest to protect him and the one way to protect him was to ensure that outsiders or people who intended to break the law or were in any way going to bring destruction or despair on the community were <Col N="645" /> made known to the member of the Garda.</P>
    <P>Today the local people do not know their garda, they may know his name but they do not know him personally.  The day when the local Garda attended Mass in the parish or attended the match on Sunday or was present at whatever was going on during the week is gone.  That is a dreadful mistake.  This has caused fear to take a grip on the rural communities, particularly among the elderly. The elderly in rural areas have more to fear than in the city.  They are isolated; there is no public lighting system; they do not have neighbours close by, the nearest neighbour may be a mile away and some do not have a phone.  It is frightening for people in rural areas.  I have got numerous representations from people in my area, South Roscommon, requesting the presence of a resident Garda.  In fact, in the past few weeks a whole community got together in Taughmaconnell, which is a sprawling parish a few miles from me, and signed a petition to have a resident Garda.  I remember when there was a sergeant and two gardaí in that station.  I also remember there was no crime there at that time because if anything went wrong, the culprit was brought to justice in due course.  Today sheep are being stolen when people have gone to their relative's funerals, and cattle have been taken at night.  Practically every shop has been raided.  It is a mistake not to have a Garda presence in a rural area.</P>
    <P>Having gardaí travelling from the nearest town in a squad car, spending two or three hours in the local station for the signing of dole sheets or whatever and touring at night to see if the pubs have closed on time, is not the proper way to police an area.  It allows criminals who have been identified in the cities to move in for easy pickings in those rural areas.  I say to the Minister there should be a review of this.  There are five Garda stations with houses attached which would be ideal for a member of the force, his wife and family.  The children would have an opportunity to attend local schools and live with a nice established <Col N="646" /> community, I urge the Minister of State to re-examine the question of rural policing. I request that we replace members of the Garda Síochána in the local stations, thus cutting off an outlet for crime and giving peace of mind to many people in rural areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Sometimes I wonder whether I am living in the real world.  I had not read the Minister's speech, which he made last week, until this evening and I must say I am surprised at the tone of it and at the lack of constructive suggestion in it.  It seems to me that when a motion of this sort comes before the Seanad the Minister comes forward with a fairly trite and facile reply which does not address the motion.  Above all I resent, and we are entitled to resent, the totally self-congratulatory tone of what the Minister had to say in his speech last week.  It is absolutely absurd for the Minister to come before this House and say: &ldquo;we are doing very well, crime is only increasing by 8 per cent&rdquo;.  If crime is increasing by 8 per cent something is fundamentally wrong.</P>
      <P>It is ridiculous for a Minister to say, we are not doing as badly as other countries. It is very easy to make selective comparisons with other countries and then say we are not doing as badly; we could do this in regard to every sphere of Government and every Department if we wanted.  If we look far enough internationally there are people doing worse than us in terms of statistics in every Department of State, but by the Minister's own admission, the statistics which show an 8 per cent increase in crime are, if anything, conservative.  The fact is that our crime rate is increasing by at least that percentage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister in his speech was so bankrupt of ideas concerning what to do about crime.  I am sorry also to note that when he decided to ask some unfortunate official what the Government had done in the past four or five years about law and order and about crime, he could only come up with five minor Acts.  It is indicative of the bankruptcy and the emptiness of Fianna Fáil <Col N="647" /> thought about crime that they have only introduced minor Bills in a response to urgent matters.  They could have included an enlightened Act abolishing the death penalty but presumably that is one, of which they were not particularly proud, because it was not done at a Fianna Fáil initiative but at the behest of the Progressive Democrats.  They mentioned four or five Bills they introduced which are paltry and pitiful.</P>
    <P>We need a balanced argument on this issue and, obviously, there are two very distinct sides to the crime issue &mdash; as there have been since Adam and Eve &mdash; one is the very liberal attitude to it and one is the law and order attitude in which case law and order wins and there is a sort of kneejerk reaction.  I belong to the liberal side but I sympathise enormously with the speech of Senator Cosgrave earlier when he talked about the victims of crime.  I would like to raise a specific case. A short time ago I was talking on the telephone to Mr. Eamon Gavin of the &ldquo;Tallaght Two&rdquo; case.  I am not going to say anything which will offend the <i>sub judice</i> rule.  I was talking to him about the great public sympathy for the &ldquo;Tallaght Two&rdquo; and the lack of public sympathy which attaches to him, the victim of crime.  I am on the side of those who believe that the verdict in the &ldquo;Tallaght Two&rdquo; case was unsafe.</P>
    <P>The tragedy of that case is that Mr. Gavin, the victim of that crime, is now portrayed by most of the media as the villain of the piece.  We have to be very careful that we do not fall into that trap particularly if we are taking the liberal road on crime and crime prevention. Senator Cosgrave was right in saying that the victims of crime are frequently forgotten.</P>
    <P>It is very wrong to take a kneejerk reaction to the increase in crime here or in other countries.  It is of course tempting for many of us to say the answer is more custodial and longer prison sentences; lock them up, throw away the key and they will not bother us again.  I do not believe that ever was the solution, I do not think it is the solution but I do not <Col N="648" /> think the Government have any ideas or that any fundamental or radical thought has gone into this.  I find fault with almost every aspect of the Minister's speech because he took all the criticism loaded against him and did not answer it properly. What we need is that radical thought be put into it.  Crime will not be cured by introducing kneejerk Bills which simply reply to the immediate situation and are purely pragmatic.</P>
    <P>I live in the town of Bray which has a very high incidence of crime.  That is directly related to high unemployment and that is where we should start.  We should ask: why is there so much crime in areas where there is so much unemployment? We should ask also: why are the unemployed committing so many crimes?  It is no good putting the cart before the horse and saying we have got to lock them up so that they will not commit crimes again.  We have to tackle the reasons the unemployed commit so many crimes: it is quite simple.  One of the reasons is that there is so much recidivism among the unemployed because people who have been in prison for one crime are not looked after when they come out of prison.</P>
    <P>At my clinic yesterday a man who had just come out of prison came to me and his situation was appalling.  He was homeless and unemployed.  He is on parole and has to sign at the Garda station every week but nobody is taking any interest in him at this stage.  He is tempted, like so many other prisoners, to commit another crime because, as he said, he has got a good chance of getting away with it and he might become a millionaire overnight Nobody is taking any interest in finding him a house or a job and he is sleeping rough from friend to friend, from night to night.  That person will sooner or later, unless he is very lucky, go back to crime. It is a miracle he has not done so already and the Government's suggestions as to how we should deal with him are zero. There is nothing in the Minister's speech about catering for prisoners when they come out of prison because he does not care or has not given it any thought.</P>
    <P>In his speech he produced a recipe for <Col N="649" /> those who come out of prison to return to crime.  The Bills he suggests will simply be a response to specific problems; we may lock them up for longer, be more effective in gaining evidence against them but we certainly will not stop them committing crimes again.  The attitude of the Minister and the Government is at fault. It is most important that we do not adopt it and congratulate ourselves on minor measures.  The reasons for these crimes must be examined and then the problem tackled root and branch.</P>
    <P>The Minister congratulated both himself and the Government for providing more places at Wheatfield Prison.  That is the wrong attitude to adopt because the Minister can open another prison tomorrow in Dublin, Limerick, Cork or whatever he likes and it will not solve the crime problem.  All that will happen is that a few more people, who are likely to commit some more crimes when they come out, will be locked up.  There is not a line about that problem in the Minister's speech.  On the other hand, there is a great deal of self-congratulatory verbiage about the new institution which accommodates 320 people.  That is no good.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that the only people who should be sent to prison are those who are a danger, in a physical, violent sense, to other people outside prison.  I see no reason we should lock up people for non-violent theft and where they are not a danger to the public.  Our attitudes are antediluvian, archaic and simplistic and will not lead to a solution. Fianna Fáil have always reacted in this extraordinarily shortsighted and pragmatic way to the problems posed by prisons and prisoners; no radical thought has ever been put into it.</P>
    <P>The Minister could have enlightened us on the Government's thoughts &mdash; if the Government think at all about this issue &mdash; on, for instance, the question of whether it is right that nobody in this country has ever been sent to prison for fraud.  I happen to think it is right but I would like to hear the Minister's views on that matter.  I do not think people should be sent to prison for fraud.  As <Col N="650" /> they are not a physical danger to someone walking the streets, they should be fined an enormous amount of money, perhaps bankrupted, by the State.  While I do not believe they should be locked up perhaps the Minister does.  It is therefore important that we hear the Government's views on this matter as well as on community service orders.</P>
    <P>The remedy for a large number of the crimes for which people are wrongly sent to prison, is to get them to pay their debt to society &mdash; to use that clichéd phrase &mdash; by doing some productive work.  The worst thing we can do is put them in prison where they will rot, where immeasurable harm will be done in terms of their morale, where they will be nonproductive and where they will plot their next crime.  If we do we will then have to build more prisons for their friends and children.  It seems that the Government have not even broached this subject; they seem to think they are attacking the problem in an immediate sense and congratulate themselves on it.  The Fine Gael motion is therefore highly appropriate and I do not believe that it is critical enough.  Indeed it should be far more critical not only about the fact that there are not enough resources available for the Garda but about the fact that the Government are doing nothing about the crime problem, do not care about it, have not given any thought to it, and that the problem will continue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wish the new Minister and Minister of State the best of luck. I am sure they will be successful.  The Minister in particular had an excellent track record in the Department of the Environment during the years and I look forward to him being equally successful in this very challenging and demanding portfolio.  The Minister of State has been a colleague of mine for a long time &mdash; we <Col N="651" /> are in the same age group &mdash; and has a lot of talent.  I look forward to both the Minister and the Minister of State producing worthwhile legislation in the future.</P>
      <P>I agree with that part of the motion which calls for adequate funding for the Garda Síochána and with many of the proposals which have been made tonight but in relation to the thrust of the entire motion I should say that this is a difficult problem.</P>
      <P>Previous speakers raised the question of rural policing.  Rural policing schemes &mdash; the Leas-Chathaoirleach will appreciate this &mdash; have been put into operation in one or two areas to bring people together in rural areas and have been extremely successful.  However, the major problem that exists in the north inner city of Dublin is due in the main to unemployment; people are not given a chance to start a career.  I am totally opposed to the provision of flats and inadequate housing for these people.  I hope I will have an opportunity to make a much longer contribution on this matter at an opportune time, as it is a subject that one could talk about for a long time.</P>

      <P>First, I wish to congratulate my colleague from Limerick, Deputy O'Dea, on his appointment to the post of Minister of State at the Department of Justice.  While the constituency of Limerick East fared well in relation to the changes that have been made, it is an understatement to say that my constituency of Limerick West did not. However, I wish the Minister of State good luck.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am impressed that all sides of the House are in agreement on most of the issues that I raised last week.  It is unfortunate, therefore that an amendment has been tabled, for political reasons, by the Government side because, from their speeches, one would deduct that they accept the proposals I made last week.  I am extremely disappointed that, in his contribution to the debate, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Flynn, ignored two key proposals.  These proposals, if implemented, could contribute immediately <Col N="652" /> to the more effective control of crime.  These were that the laws on bail should be reformed &mdash; this view was eloquently expressed by Senator Bohan &mdash; and that changes should be made in relation to the right to silence when a person is under Garda interrogation.</P>
    <P>I called on the Minister for Justice to reform our bail laws and to hold the necessary constitutional referendum along with the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty in June.  This is an excellent opportunity for the Minister to introduce constitutional changes to allow our bail laws to be reformed.  Murderers, rapists and robbers are being freed by our courts and our bail laws facilitate this outrageous situation.  The amendment I propose is required to stop people charged with crimes being freed and compounding the situation by committing further serious offences because they know they will be punished in any event. The law needs to be amended urgently so that the courts do not have to free people likely to commit further serious crimes.  Our bail laws are the most lax in the world.</P>
    <P>The problem is that bail cannot be refused by the courts on the grounds that there is a likelihood that further offences will be committed by the accused.  The constitutional amendment is necessary to restore discretion to the courts.  The Government must, as a matter of urgency, arrange the necessary referendum to allow the laws be changed. The Minister must address this.  I am disappointed he did not take the opportunity of this debate to announce his decision to do so last week.</P>
    <P>Over the years, notorious organised criminals have had little difficulty in getting bail and, in turn, abusing it.  For the most serious offences, such as rape and bank robbery, there is little ground in Irish law for objecting to bail, even if prosecutors know that the accused is likely to commit these crimes again.  In some cases of rape and murder it is a crime in itself to release the offenders back into society on bail where they may commit further offences.</P>
    <P>We have seen shocking scenes of <Col N="653" /> organised criminals out on bail who engaged in gun battles with gardaí, putting the lives of all at risk.  These people had been caught by the gardaí for serious crimes, such as bank robbery, and granted bail, only to be caught in the act once more.  I am glad Senator Bohan highlighted this and agreed with what I said last week.</P>
    <P>The provision for consecutive sentences in the 1984 Criminal Justice Act has had a deterrent effect on petty crime, but it has little or no impact on organised serious crime.  Organised criminals who know they are going to jail on one serious offence have no compunction about committing other crimes because they are aware that they will serve only a fixed period in the overcrowded prisons.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that our bail laws are too liberal and must be tightened up. Alternatives have to be found to just releasing well known criminals back into the community on bail.</P>
    <P>I again urge the Minister and the Government to take the opportunity of the forthcoming Maastricht referendum to ask the people if the Constitution should be changed so that criminals who insist on committing crime can be remanded in custody if the likelihood is that they will commit crimes again while on bail.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister did not take the opportunity to give his views on my proposal that a new approach to Garda interrogation should be considered. The right to silence, when suspects are being questioned, is a relic of the last century when individuals had no access to free legal aid and when punishments were much harsher.  Moreover, as it stands, the right is currently a major obstacle to the Garda in their investigations into organised crime.  A suspect can refuse to answer questions or give any explanation whatsoever about matters that are put to him in the course of an interrogation.  Experienced criminals do this as a matter of course and subversives are particularly adept at it.  While the abolition of the right would greatly help Garda investigations, it would also protect suspects in cases where over-zealous <Col N="654" /> police officers might try to extract confessions.</P>
    <P>The abolition of the right to silence would diminish the importance of obtaining a self-incriminatory confession in many investigations.  The right to silence was introduced at a time when an accused was rarely represented in court and could not give evidence, but today the rules are only helping an increasing number of professional criminals to avoid conviction. The system which I propose would simply mean that it would not be an offence to refuse to answer questions or give explanations, but an adverse inference could be drawn from silence on particular issues.  The Minister for Justice should, as a matter of urgency, examine the situation and introduce the necessary reforming legislation.</P>
    <P>This legislation would not be unique in the Irish context.  The present right to silence does not protect self-incrimination in a variety of statutory offences especially under the Road Traffic Act, such as drunken driving, where suspects are required to provide blood or urine samples on which they may be later convicted of an offence.  Likewise, the new genetic fingerprinting legislation passed by the Oireachtas last year, obliges the subject to provide DNA samples and if he does not, the court will be allowed to draw any inference from that.  As I already stated in my contribution last week, in revenue cases a person being investigated cannot use the right to silence to mask giving potentially incriminating answers to tax inspectors.</P>
    <P>Criminal interviews should also be video recorded to protect the Garda from false allegations and ensure the rights of the individual are protected during detention.  This would also provide the courts with a true picture of the realities and difficulties facing the Garda in such circumstances.  It is disappointing that the Minister did not address these issues when given the opportunity and when I raised the matter last week.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment recently to having the recommendations on the Martin inquiry into criminal procedures legislated for in the near future. <Col N="655" /> However, I wish to draw the Minister's attention to the extreme concern of the Garda with one aspect of this report &mdash; that it will impede police work and hamper investigations into every kind of crime.  I refer to the recommendation that the Garda should wait for a suspect's solicitor to arrive before questioning him or taking a statement.</P>
    <P>The Garda point out that in the first instance it would slow down investigations considerably.  If the Garda must wait for the arrival of a solicitor there would be inevitable delays and officers would lose the edge in interviewing a suspect.  Moreover, if a crime is to be investigated effectively it is vital that a Garda have the right to question a suspect as soon as possible after that crime has been committed.  The Garda also point out that having a solicitor permanently present would interfere with the confidentiality felt between the police officer and suspect and any transfer of information between both sides will end and some of the informality of interview will also go.</P>
    <P>As things stand, officers are already obliged to pass on any information communicated by an interviewee to a solicitor when he arrives.  The Garda see this as a fair method.  Indeed, the Martin report itself states that the Garda regularly call solicitors on behalf of suspects.</P>
    <P>I request the Minister in enacting the Martin report to take note of the concerns of the Garda on this question of immunity for suspects from questioning until the arrival of his or her solicitor. There is no doubt, as I stated last week, that the criminal justice system has clearly swung around to favour society's deviants rather than protect law abiding citizens.  Rather than tipping the balance back in favour of the citizens, this provision would make it even easier for the guilty to escape conviction in the courts.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister of State to initiate a programme of crime reduction in the mid-west and southern regions.  Last year the highest increase in crime came from the Cork West Garda divisional area with an increase of 60 per <Col N="656" /> cent.  Limerick was ahead of the national average at 9 per cent, as was Tipperary at 15 per cent; Clare and Kerry also showed increases of 2 per cent.  These figures show a serious upward trend in the region which we all feared.  We have a duty as a State to protect our citizens and allow them feel safe in their homes.  Resources must be given to the Garda to deal with criminals who rob, assault, rape or even murder people in their homes or on the streets.  Too many lives have been destroyed by such attacks.</P>
    <P>The discussion on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; of Friday, 27 March 1992, highlighted the extreme trauma that people who have been attacked go through.  It also highlighted that the vast majority of them felt let down by the responses of the criminal justice system.  These people had the reasonable desire to have justice done.  It was depressing for many victims to understand that little appeared to be happening to prevent the criminals from engaging in crimes again.</P>
    <P>In the most recent addition of <i>Garda News</i> the publication of the Garda sergeants and inspectors, the editorial states:</P>
    <P>Absolutely nothing effective is being done in this country to root out the causes of crime.  Nothing is being done to study why crime appears to be endemic in some areas and some families and nothing is being done to break the vicious circle of criminal children of criminal parents.  In the face of crime figures which are once more on the increase it is now more urgent than ever that we carry out a thorough examination of our criminal justice system and ascertain if it serves the law-abiding people of this country well.  We need to study the social services and their interaction with the gardaí, the courts and the prison and detention systems, systems which we have inherited largely unchanged from previous regimes, to see if their combined efforts are really the best that can be achieved for the massive investment involved.</P>
    <P>Urgent action is needed to reform our <Col N="657" /> criminal law system.  Many of our laws date back to the last century and are totally inadequate to deal with the situation facing us today.  Fine Gael believe that we should immediately establish a criminal law reform commission to help us update and codify our criminal law.  We should give our courts greater powers of forfeiture to confiscate assets derived from the proceeds of crime.  We should also provide by legislation for the review by the Court of Criminal Appeal of over-lenient sentencing.</P>
    <P>With the alarming increase in the numbers in our prisons, at a very high cost to <Col N="658" /> the taxpayer, it is time we re-examined the whole system.  Prisons should be for persons who are convicted of serious crimes, either against a person or property.</P>
    <P>There should be more alternatives to prison for minor offences and for nonpayment of fines.  The Minister should introduce a system where those convicted of serious offences would serve their full prison sentence, allowing only for normal remission for good behaviour.  A totally different approach should be adopted to those who commit less serious offences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Health on his appointment.  I have been a friend of his for a long time and I am delighted to see him in this portfolio where I know he has enormous expertise and experience.  I wish him well and look forward to working with him during the lifetime of the present Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am calling for a residential and day <Col N="659" /> care centre for the elderly of north Westmeath to be provided at St. Peter's Hospital in Castlepollard.  In May last the Midland Health Board, on my suggestion, unanimously agreed to put this proposal to the Department of Health.  In raising this matter on the Adjournment tonight I wish to highlight the need for this service for the elderly of north Westmeath.  Castlepollard is the central town of north Westmeath, the most rural part of the county &mdash; from Clonmellon, Delvin, Collinstown, Drumcree, Fore, Castletown, Finnea, Coole, Lismacaffry, Botherquill, Rathowen, Ballynafid, Ballinalack, and the tidiest town of all, Multyfarnham.  All these villages surround the town of Castlepollard, forming what we know as the most rural part of north Westmeath.</P>
    <P>As I am aware, the replacement of St. Mary's Hospital in Mullingar has very high priority in the Midland Health Board's capital programme for special hospitals.  This planned development is in accordance and consistent with the recommendation of the working party report and services for the elderly entitled &ldquo;The Years Ahead&rdquo;.  As Castlepollard falls within the catchment area, the initiative to provide specific facilities there can be addressed in the overall context of this proposal.  On this basis a strategy team has been set up by the board in collaboration with the Department of Health comprising all the various expertise available to the board.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health have indicated that, where necessary, they will provide back-up medical and technical advice to the team.  The impact of the implementation of the Nursing Home Act is another aspect to which the team must have regard taking into account the degree and intensity of service provisions for the elderly.  It is vital that regard be given to the quality as well as the quantity of life.</P>
    <P>There are many proposals to be considered in relation to St. Mary's Hospital, Mullingar, which has served the people of County Westmeath very well for over 150 years.  Taking this into account, facilities <Col N="660" /> should, therefore, be provided locally in small centres where long term sick people can be cared for and to which friends and neighbours have ready access.</P>
    <P>In considering a comprehensive and modern day care and residential centre for patients in the north Westmeath area, account should be taken of the current and prospective population in excess of 65 years of age.  In this context the number of existing long stay beds, their location and the needs that are likely to arise over the next quarter of a century must be also taken into account.  St. Peter's Hospital, Castlepollard, which is controlled by the board, has provided an excellent service for the mentally handicapped, particularly younger people. That hospital has an excellent staff of 106 people, and there are 108 beds.  As the Cathaoirleach, who is also a member of the board, knows the hospital provides many facilities.  There is an excellent laundry service, great kitchen staff and a recreational centre, which was opened by the previous chairman of the board.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister tonight to allow a feasibility study to be carried out on behalf of the Midland Health Board in relation to the elderly of north Westmeath. These people are in their golden years and have given long service to north Westmeath.  In a rural area such as north Westmeath, many people live alone.  Up to now incapacitated people and those who were unable to look after themselves had to go to St. Mary's Hospital, Mullingar, which is more than 20 miles from Finnea and the far end of Castlepollard parish, including Clonmellon.  This is a great opportunity when considering the prospect of a new hospital in the grounds of St. Mary's at some time, to ensure that those people can live in their own environment, near their families.  They should be able to enjoy visits from their family and local neighbours.  Many of those patients are often hospitalised for up to ten years.  It is a big change for a person who has been used to country life to be hospitalised in a big town.  I am aware that the care and attention given at St. Mary's Hospital is first class. However, to be hospitalised means a <Col N="661" /> complete change in a person's lifestyle. If a person has lived in a small locality for longer than 20 years he or she knows everyone there.  Up to 50 per cent of those who will be going to day-care centre or the long-stay hospital will have lived in Castlepollard or the neighbouring small villages all their lives, 60 or 70 years.  At present in St. Mary's Hospital there are four people from our area who suffered strokes.  Those people may be hospitalised for a long time but their friends can visit them.  I need not elaborate on the positive elements of visits by friends.</P>
    <P>At present we have a day-care service once a week.  Only a limited number of people can be taken on the mini-bus and there is a waiting list.  Many of those people will never have the opportunity to avail of a day-care facility even once a week.  The day-care facility is fantastic, particularly for people who live alone. Their greatest problem is one of loneliness. In the remote parts of Westmeath I am talking about people often have to rely on a neighbour to collect their pension.  To be able to meet their friends once or twice a week would be of tremendous benefit.  They would have their tablets checked, could attend a chiropodist, have a meal and enjoy a game of cards. They cannot do that at present.  The health board do their best but there is room for improvement.</P>
    <P>I could talk about this subject for a long time.  I seldom raise an issue on the Adjournment unless a serious matter arises in my area.  I know practically every person in north-west Meath; like a doctor in a sense.  I was a postman for almost five years and I know the people of the area.  They have all made a great contribution to voluntary and farming organisations. As the Minister is aware many of them have old wounds from their games with the best hurling teams in the county, and many of them suffer from hip problems. It is with the greatest pleasure that I make my plea tonight on behalf of those people.  The people from that area at present in the surgical ward in Mullingar Hospital could convalesce in their own environment, particularly long-stay patients and those recovering from hip operations and so on.  There is an outstanding staff and tremendous laundry, <Col N="662" /> kitchen and recreational facilities available in the local hospital.  Those people raise funds three or four times every year so that they can take patients on holidays. We have a great parents' and friends' association, who look after patients and raise funds if any facility is needed in the new centre.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to find employment in our area.  I presume the new centre would consist of about 50 beds and would involve about 30 or 35 new jobs.  In remote parts of the country, such as in my area, there is no greater employer than the Government.  A monthly cheque coming under one's door for guaranteed employment is a big advantage.</P>
    <P>The Minister should give me an assurance that he will issue a recommendation to the Midland Health Board, and his officials, to carry out a feasibility study immediately so that plans will be in place when the money becomes available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I thank the Senator for his very kind words and good wishes, which are much appreciated.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for providing long-stay accommodation for the elderly in County Westmeath lies with the Midland Health Board, as the Senator knows.  The recommendations on services for the elderly contained in the report, &ldquo;The Years Ahead&rdquo;, have been adopted by the Government and are being progressively implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1990 and 1991 the Government allocated substantial additional funds to the Midland Health Board.  Those funds amounted to £465,840.  During the past two years the board have considerably improved services for the elderly throughout the region.  In 1990 the board used the funds to enhance community services for the elderly.  The home nursing, home care and home help services have benefited, while liaison nurses have also been appointed throughout the region.  Respite care beds have also been introduced in the long-stay hospitals. Arrangements have been put in place for assessing applications for places in the board's long-stay hospitals and welfare homes.  Those arrangements ensure that those people most in need of such accommodation <Col N="663" /> actually get it.  Overall, there has been much improvement in the services being provided for the elderly and in the co-ordination of those services.</P>
    <P>The traditional approach of attempting to meet all the needs of frail, elderly persons by admission to long-stay hospitals is now generally regarded as misguided.  It is now accepted policy that greater attention needs to be paid to the development of community-based services so that elderly persons can continue to live, with assistance if necessary, in their own community for as long as possible.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I would not see us adding to the stock of long-stay nursing beds in the foreseeable future.  At the same time, of course, it has to be acknowledged that some of our long-stay accommodation for the elderly does not meet modern day standards and needs to be replaced.  As the Senator is aware, the replacement of the old St. Mary's Hospital in Mullingar has a high priority in the board's capital programme for special hospitals.  This planned development is consistent with the recommendations contained in &ldquo;The Years Ahead&rdquo; document.  The number, type and location of the beds required to replace St. Mary's Hospital need to be evaluated.</P>
    <P>As Castlepollard falls within the Mullingar sector for service provision for the elderly, the initiative to provide specific facilities there can be addressed in the overall context of St. Mary's Hospital.</P>
    <P>A strategy team to plan for the future has been set up by the board, in cooperation with my Department.  My Department will also provide technical and medical advice to the team when necessary.  At present there are 1,005 public long-stay places available for the elderly in the Midland Health Board region which is generous when compared to the norms recommended in &ldquo;The Years Ahead&rdquo; and to the level of provision elsewhere.  In addition to the health board homes, there are 441 places in private and voluntary nursing homes, of which 144 are subvented by the health board.</P>
    <P>The Senator will be interested to know that I intend to implement the Health <Col N="664" /> (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, later this year.  That Act provides for a new relationship between health boards and nursing homes.  The health boards will register nursing homes, both private and voluntary, and will monitor standards by six-monthly inspections.  The Act will also enable a health board to pay a subvention towards the cost of care in a nursing home for a person whom the board have assessed as needing nursing care and who cannot afford to pay for such care.  The Act will therefore provide the health board with another option in meeting the needs of the dependent elderly, both locally and flexibly.</P>
    <P>I must point out to the Senator that there has been a fair share of positive action in so far as services for the elderly in the Midland Health Board are concerned. I ask the Senator to accept the Government's commitment to the development of services for the elderly in the Midland Health Board area as shown by the generous additional funding for services for the elderly in the past few years.</P>
    <P>To sum up, the need to provide long-stay beds for the elderly in Castlepollard will be considered in the context of the plan to replace St. Mary's Hospital.  This matter is to be reviewed by the Midland Health Board in conjunction with my Department.  While we must await the deliberations of that group I must take serious note of what the Senator says.  I realise and appreciate that the Senator has put up a very good case and I recognise that he is <i>au fait</i> with the situation in Castlepollard.  Because of that, I will ask my Department to discuss with the Midland Health Board the question of a feasibility study being undertaken.  I assure the Senator that I will ask my Department to do this as soon as possible because his remarks make sense.  I hope the study will be undertaken without too much delay.</P>
