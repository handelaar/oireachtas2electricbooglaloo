      <P>I have notice from Senator Shane Ross that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications to outline the present position of the extension of the DART to Greystones, County Wicklow, and to provide extra subvention to Bus Átha Cliath to ensure adequate bus services.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator Ross as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>On today's Order of Business it is proposed to take items Nos. 1 to 5.  Notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders the following arrangements will apply.  In relation to the proceedings on the Third, Fourth and Fifth Stages of items Nos. 1, 2 and 3 the proceedings shall be brought to a conclusion in accordance with the following timetable and where the proceedings have not concluded by the stated time they shall be brought to a conclusion by one question <Col N="842" /> in each case which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to the amendments, include only amendments set down or accepted by the Minister for Justice.  The suggested timetable is: the Thirteenth Amendment will be dealt with between now and 11.30 a.m.; the Fourteenth Amendment will be dealt with from then until 12.30 p.m. and the Twelfth Amendment will be dealt with from then until 3 p.m. with a sos from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.</P>
      <P>In relation to item No. 4, the Referendum (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1992, the contribution of each Senator on the Second Stage debate shall not exceed ten minutes and proceedings on all Stages of this Bill and on the motion of concurrence with the Early Signature of the Bill by the President, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 4 p.m. today by one question which shall, in relation to the amendments, include only amendments set down or accepted by the Government.</P>

      <P>I have no difficulty with these arrangements partly because I think everything that has to be said on this has probably been said by now, especially since nobody is listening, so the arrangements are all right with me.</P>
      <P>In the event of these Bills being passed today &mdash; and that of course is not a certainty, given that the Senators who took one small step yesterday by staying in their places might take one large step today and cross the floor &mdash; so the Bills might not necessarily be passed but if they are passed when does the Leader of the House expect that they will be signed by the Presidential Commission?</P>

      <P>I have no major problem with the ordering of business.  I suggest however, that we do not have a sos from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.; it seems a very long sos. We had a sos yesterday for half-an-hour. I think half-an-hour is quite adequate and it would give us a little more time to deal with the major item, which is the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill. Either we have no sos or we simply have a half-hour-sos.</P>

      <P>Tairgim leasú a 1:</P>
      <P>I leathanach 5, idir línte 13 agus 14, an méid seo a leanas a chur isteach:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(a)  i bhfo-alt 2º den téacs Gaeilge, trína focail &lsquo;agus ceart chun taisteal laistigh agus lasmuigh den <Col N="844" /> Stát&rsquo; a chur isteach i ndiaidh na bhfocal &lsquo;agus maoin-chearta&rsquo;;</P>

    <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>In page 4, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(a)  in subsection 2º of the Irish text, after the words &lsquo;agus maoinchearta&rsquo; of the words &lsquo;agus ceart chun taisteal laistigh agus lasmuigh den Stát&rsquo;;</P>
    <P>(b)  in subsection 2º of the English text, after the words &lsquo;and property rights&rsquo;, of the words &lsquo;and the right to travel both within and outside the State&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment seeks to insert after subsection (2) the words &ldquo;and the right to travel both within and outside the State&rdquo;. The purpose of the amendment is to put beyond doubt the right to travel both inside and outside the State.</P>
    <P>This amendment, like the other three amendments are worded in a negative form &mdash;&ldquo;shall not limit the freedom to travel between the State and another State&rdquo;.  What we want to do is confer the right to travel and specify it in the Constitution.  The direction the amendment should have taken was to confer the right rather than a negative statement restricting it or saying that the right &ldquo;shall not limit&rdquo;.  In this proposal we are adding a new subsection to state that the right to travel both within and outside the State shall be conferred on the citizens of this country.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment which proposes to insert additional words into Article 40.3.2º seems to be to create a positive right to travel as if such right did not already exist.  The suggested amendment seems to assume that there is no general right to travel under the Constitution.  I am <Col N="845" /> unable to agree that there is no existing constitutional right to travel.  Reading the judgments of each of the five judges in the Supreme Court in the X case it was clear that such a right does exist.  I would refer the Senator&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer Senators to the following statements of each of the judges.  The Chief Justice spoke of the very fundamental nature of the right to travel and its particular importance in relation to the characteristics of a free society in the context of harmonising <Col N="846" /> interacting constitutional rights.  Judge Hederman referred to: &ldquo;the exercise of the constitutional right to travel&rdquo;.  Judge McCarthy referred to &ldquo;the right to travel having been identified as one of the unenumerated rights guaranteed under Article 40 of the Constitution&rdquo;.  Judges Egan and O'Flaherty also referred specifically to a right as such to travel.</P>
      <P>In the face of those statements, it seems to be unarguable that there is a right under the Constitution to travel. However, the judges made those statements without reference to EC law.  In fact, it was made clear that no decision on any question of European law was necessary for the court to give its judgment.  If EC law is taken into account in considering the travel issue, since travel is of fundamental importance under the EC Treaties and since those treaties are part of our constitutional law, it is inconceivable that travel could be regarded as other than a fundamental right of persons in this country.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the wording of the Bill is correct in assuming that there is an existing constitutional right to travel.  The Bill removes the restriction imposed in the X case by reference to Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The exercise of the right to travel has, of necessity, to be subject to restrictions in certain cases.  For example, the law lays down conditions to be imposed by the courts on the grant of bail, including a requirement that the person concerned surrender his passport and reports at frequent intervals to a Garda station.  Persons who are wards of court cannot be taken out of the jurisdiction without the express permission of the court.  If a positive affirmation of the right to travel were to be written into the Constitution, as is suggested, that affirmation would have to be couched in such a way as to allow for exceptions such as these.  That would take us into an area of addressing issues which there is no need for us to address in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All that it is necessary for us to do is to remove the restrictions on freedom to travel which were imposed in the decision <Col N="847" /> in the X case by reason specifically of Article 40.3.3º.  That is what the proposed amendment to the Constitution does.  It would be unnecessary and it would not be sensible to do any more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not deny what the Minister is saying, that there is an implied right to travel in the Constitution, but there is no affirmed assertion of the right to travel in the Constitution.  It is there by implication.  The judges' decisions quoted by the Minister imply that the right did exist.  There is no assertion that there is a fundamental right to travel and what I am seeking to do is to insert a positive statement asserting the right of all citizens to travel within and outside the country.</P>
      <P>I am not sure that I can accept the point made by the Minister.  The Minister is referring to a situation where a crime is alleged to have been committed and obviously the law will cater for that situation; there is, I understand, a positive assertion in the European Convention on Human Rights and the United Nations Convention on Human Rights.  I cannot see the logic of the Minister's argument that there would be a problem with a positive assertion within the Constitution of the right to travel for the citizens of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a general right. People have many rights which are not specifically enumerated in the Constitution but they have been taken to be implied in the general human rights clauses in the Constitution.  The Supreme Court has on a number of occasions, and not just in the X case, laid it down in the clearest terms that people generally have a right to travel.  That is a fundamental human right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A difficulty arose in the X case.  In one specific type of case the Supreme Court decided by a majority of 3:2 that a person's right to travel outside the jurisdiction could be taken away in those circumstances.  The Bill proposes to remove any restriction that can be placed on a person who wishes to travel outside <Col N="848" /> the jurisdiction in the circumstances which occurred in the X case.  If we were to write into the Constitution a general right to travel we would have to couch it in such a way that it would be subject to such restrictions as may be imposed by law.  It is understood in the general right to travel given through court judgments that the right to travel is subject to the restrictions which the courts accept as being necessary, such as in the case of bail.  That is the general right that exists; it is a general right implied from court judgments that is subject to such restrictions as the law has to impose in certain cases.  A further restriction was found to exist because of the specific interpretation by the Supreme Court of Article 40.3.3º in the X case.  We are removing that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not dwell on it any longer other than to make the point that is precisely the reason I am putting forward this amendment.  The amendment to the Constitution that we are proposing here, namely, that this subsection shall not limit freedom to travel between the State and another state, only refers to Article 40.3.3º and does not confer a right to travel to a citizen in any other capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>It is there already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We disagree on that.  It is not there in a positive capacity.  The Minister said that the Supreme Court adhered to it as being there, but it is there by implication not by assertion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  The Supreme Court have asserted it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Supreme Court have, but the Constitution does not contain it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many rights asserted by the Supreme Court that are not specifically contained in the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Supreme Court has said is that it believes there was an <Col N="849" /> implied right for citizens to travel.  There is no assertion in the Constitution to that effect.  What we want to do is to state that, because all that the Bill does is state that there shall not be a limit on the freedom in relation to this subsection.  I would have thought it would be reasonable to expect that a fundamental statement of the principle of the right to travel within the State and outside the State would be acceptable to a lawyer and to the people of this country.  I will not pursue it beyond saying that it is something I would have liked to see asserted positively in the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Most human rights that citizens have by virtue of the Constitution are not specifically enumerated.  It would not make any difference to me personally whether I had a right by virtue of a decision of the courts or by virtue of the fact that it was written down in the Constitution or written into legislation. It would not make any difference in practice. I take the point about asserting it, but it would not make any difference in practice.  The courts have asserted it in no uncertain terms over a long number of years.  It is a well established fundamental right.  It can be clearly implied from the very broad terms of the fundamental rights provisions in the Constitution.</P>
      <P>If we were to write it in, one difficulty I can see is that we would have to write it in in the same way as the right to information is being written in.  It would have to be written into the Constitution that people would have the right to freedom of travel subject to such restrictions as may be imposed by law.  Maybe that would be just as well as for&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In Part II, page 6, line 7, to delete &ldquo;state&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;jurisdiction&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment is that we would substitute for the word &ldquo;state&rdquo; the word &ldquo;jurisdiction&rdquo;.  On this little island we have one State but you might say we have two jurisdictions.  Northern Ireland does not consist of a legal entity in terms of a Government or in terms of a state.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely the purpose of the wording.  In those circumstances, considering that there are different capacities in relation to the availability of services to terminate pregnancies which operate in a different way in Northern Ireland and in Britain, it would be useful for us to prescribe more clearly the availability of freedom of travel, that it should be not just within an entity in terms of a Government entity <Col N="851" /> but in terms of a jurisdiction which could be part of a state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment seems to be based on the suggestion that there is a distinction for practical purposes between the word &ldquo;jurisdiction&rdquo; and &ldquo;state&rdquo; which could have a bearing in some way on the right to travel. However, there is no basis that I can see for making that distinction and I am satisfied that the amendment is not warranted.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;state&rdquo; is used in Article 29.3 of the Constitution which provides that Ireland accepts the generally recognised principles of international law as its rule of conduct in relations with other states.  It would be preferable to keep to what is already contained in the Constitution. Moreover, international agreements such as the EC Treaties and the European Convention on Human Rights Treaties use the word &ldquo;state&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the amendment as framed will fully achieve its purpose and that no difficulty whatever should arise because of the use of the word in question. The purpose of the proposed amendment to the Constitution is to ensure that people travelling to and from Ireland cannot be restricted by virtue of Article 40.3.3º.  I am satisfied that the text of the Bill fully achieves that objective and for that reason it does not need to be changed.</P>

    <P>In Part II, page 6, line 7, after &ldquo;state&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or freedom to receive a service lawful in such other jurisdiction&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 is to add to the existing wording in the Schedule after &ldquo;state&rdquo; the words &ldquo;or freedom to receive a service lawful in such other jurisdiction.&rdquo; There is no limit on freedom to travel or to receive a service in the jurisdiction. The reason for this is to ensure that there would be no limitation on someone going abroad, to receive services lawfully available abroad, on the grounds that an injunction could be taken out without the amendment to the Constitution proposed in this Schedule in relation to freedom of travel.  Where somebody is going abroad to seek services that would not have been lawfully available in Ireland, it should be made clear that no injunction could be taken out either in relation to the travel or the purpose for which the person was travelling.</P>

      <P>It is not often I disagree with my colleagues in the Labour Party but their amendment is a kind of an obfuscation of our amendment.  Our amendment simply adds to the phrase in the Schedule the words &ldquo;for the purpose of terminating the life of an unborn&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My two colleagues and I are heartily sick of the fuzzy language, the nod and wink, the determination not to admit to what we are really doing in this exercise, which is to pretend that we have one set of high moral standards at home while <Col N="853" /> making every possible effort to guarantee that people can practise any standards they want, as long as it is not within our sacred jurisdiction.  That is not much of a cause to defend.</P>
    <P>In the amendment on the right to travel we are actually saying to Irish women that if they are pregnant and the pregnancy does not conform to our extraordinarily narrow constitutional, almost orthodox, Catholic view of their rights in this area, they can travel outside our jurisdiction to do whatever they like about their pregnancies.  But, we ask them not to do it here where it might upset our sense of the aesthetics of traditional Irish culture.  I am, and I suspect my colleagues are, heartily sick of it.</P>
    <P>The High Court did not stop a young girl from travelling to Britain, they stopped a young girl from travelling to Britain to have an abortion and this proposed amendment of the Constitution is a direct response to that.  It says we do not want to even pretend to attempt to stop people travelling abroad to have an abortion.  It is not a question of travelling abroad on holidays or to explore the cultural values of clinics in South London, but to have an abortion.</P>
    <P>It would be a great step forward for Irish society if we confronted Irish reality, not Irish myth, imagination or some sense of moral superiority.  That is why, without much hope of it being accepted, I want this amendment put before this House.</P>
    <P>The first step to deal with any issue in society is a willingness to confront it.  The prissy wording of the amendment of the Constitution, as proposed, is a denial of reality.  That is not the way to confront any problem, whatever view one takes on how it should be dealt with.  Our amendment, proposes to insert the words &ldquo;for the purpose of terminating the life of an unborn&rdquo; in the Schedule.</P>

      <P>In supporting Senator Ryan I would like to point out that, even according to what the Minister has been telling us and filling in the reason he thought Senator Costello's first amendment was unnecessary, by the <Col N="854" /> same logic he should accept ours.  I agree with the Minister's statement that there is not and never was a question of the general right to travel being limited.  He is perfectly right in saying that, apart from anything else, it is an integral part of our membership of the European Community that we should endorse this right.  By the same token, we should also endorse the right to full information. That is now being made clear.  If it is superfluous to insert into the Constitution that a person has a right to travel, subject to the usual limitations of criminal involvement, and so on, then the only purpose of this amendment is to ensure not a person's right to travel but a pregnant woman's right to travel.  That is really what is intended here.</P>
      <P>According to the Minister all this is made necessary by, and is within the terms of, the Supreme Court judgment and of Article 40.3.3º.  Specifically under Article 40.3.3º, it is not the Minister or myself who will be injuncted from travelling, but pregnant women, and pregnant women who are going to have an abortion.  Why should not we say what we mean?  Why not call a spade a spade?</P>
      <P>Like Senator Ryan I cannot take this hypocrisy, this pretence that what is at issue here is upholding a sexless person's right to travel, when the Minister has already admitted that is not necessary, that it is already in the Constitution.</P>

      <P>My colleague, Senator Doyle, talked about hypocrisy but if we go back to 9 June 1992 all the major parties, excluding the Independents, Labour, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael signed a charter, pre-Maastricht, on two issues.  They may not be in agreement on the substantive issue but on the two prongs of these referenda &mdash; the right to travel and the right to information &mdash; they broadly agreed on this method.  I cannot see why there is such a furore over it.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept what either Senator Costello or Senator Ryan said.  Senator Ryan disagrees with Senator Costello on the wording but the right to travel is much broader.  One cannot say it is being proposed by referendum simply to get over the problem of the X case.  That is only one objective it will achieve.</P>

      <P>Many people travel abroad for other reasons, whether we accept it or not.  Basically, what we are doing here is ensuring that what arose in the X case will not occur in others.  To narrow it down and say the right to travel <Col N="857" /> is to do with having an abortion abroad would totally defeat the purpose.  It is a much broader issue.</P>
      <P>If anybody is being hypocritical it is the people in Labour and Fine Gael on the other side of the House who agreed this before the Maastricht Treaty referendum, for the sake of Maastricht but who are now trying to throw the cat among the pigeons.  The situation is quite clear and unequivocal and, with respect to my colleagues across the way, I see no foundation for the argument put forward by Senators Costello and B. Ryan in relation to the wording.  It is very clear and succinct and I commend it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see a certain logic in what Senator Murphy and Senator Ryan are saying.  However, I am satisfied that the Bill as it stands will ensure that a woman who wishes to travel abroad to avail of a service in another jurisdiction &mdash; a service that is unlawful here but lawful in that other jurisdiction &mdash; would have the right to do so in the knowledge that an injunction may not be taken against her to stop her travelling.</P>
      <P>In answer to the point made by Senator Murphy there is no good basis for any suggestion that, even though a woman is by virtue of an express provision of the Constitution not to be injuncted from travelling abroad, she could still be injuncted from having an abortion after she travels abroad.  If we were to write in this extra wording we would be assuming that in some way a person who has been given the freedom to travel abroad could find an injunction being taken against her here in this country in relation to what she might do while abroad.  Whether a woman whose life is not in danger is having an abortion, or whether somebody is plotting against the Government of a foreign state or whatever, an injunction here could not be taken to stop them engaging in the activity after they have travelled abroad.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  We are giving the person a right to travel.  We are not allowing any restrictions on the right to travel under the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution Bill, which states: &ldquo;This subsection shall not limit freedom to travel between the State and another State.&rdquo;  This refers not only to travel to the other state but also to travel back because of the use of the word &ldquo;between&rdquo;.  If we were to add the extra wording, we would be assuming that after we had given her the freedom to travel abroad she could not do certain things abroad &mdash; in other words, that we could effectively take an injunction against her to stop her doing those things while abroad once she had exercised her right to travel which we are giving her.  I do not think we can operate on that assumption because it has no basis in reality.</P>
      <P>There is no good basis for any suggestion that, even though a woman is by virtue of an express provision of the Constitution not to be injuncted from travelling abroad, she could still be injuncted from having an abortion after she travels abroad.  Of the three Supreme Court judges who in the X case found that a general injunction against travel abroad could lie where there was no real and substantial risk to the mother's life, two explicitly rejected the idea of an injunction confined to restricting a woman from leaving the jurisdiction for the purpose of having an abortion outside the State on the basis that such an injunction would not be effective to protect the right of the unborn to life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, just to reiterate, if you look at Judge McCarthy's judgment in the <Col N="859" /> Supreme Court, he says there are various activities which are not legal here but which are legal abroad.  He thinks it is the law that we cannot injunct people from going abroad to engage in those activities.  He went on further to say that treason against the Irish Government, which obviously is illegal here, may be plotted abroad.  A person may exercise their freedom to go abroad to plot treason against the Irish Government here, which might have profound effects here, but there is no law or no provision which would allow such a person to be injuncted.  As a matter of fact, I would say there is no form of human activity, no matter how despicable it might seem to us, that is not legal somewhere in the world.  For example, I am informed that in some African states activities which would be regarded under the Irish law as murder can be freely engaged in.  If somebody wants to travel to central Africa to engage in a spot of head hunting or something of that nature, can we in practice stop those people?  We are not entitled to stop them going abroad and it would be impractical.</P>
    <P>That is the point about saying we are allowing people to travel, but we will not have abortion in this country.  People can travel to engage in head hunting and to engage in various other forms of activity which are not legal here.  Does the fact that they can do so mean we should make all those activities legal here?  I do not see the logic of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take the other parallel situation presented by the Minister: somebody who is on bail and whose passport can be taken so that they are not allowed to travel because of an offence in this state.  If this subsection applies to is 40.3.3º, which says it shall be unlawful to terminate the life of an unborn unless such termination is necessary to save the life as distinct from the health of the mother and if a woman is moving to another jurisdiction for the purpose of termination of a pregnancy which is not permitted within the terms of 40.3.3º, could it not then be argued that an injunction <Col N="860" /> could be taken, either in advance or subsequently, in relation to an offence contrary to the subsection where, for example, the health of the mother, the risk of suicide, or indeed rape or incest was involved?  Can an injunction not be taken out in advance or subsequently because services that would be unlawful in this jurisdiction would have been performed abroad?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but apart from that the difference between the Minister of State's analogy and this situation is that in this case we have written into the Constitution a high flown guarantee about the rights of the unborn which we as a society decided was sufficiently important.  I do not think there is anywhere else in our Constitution where we have written in one subsection a high flown statement of a noble principle and where the next section says are not going to do anything about it.  That is the problem. That is where the dual standard arises.  I do not believe there is anything in any part of our Constitution or in any part of our law which would enable one person to take another person abroad who had rights under our Constitution with the view to taking those rights from them.  I do not think we would allow that. We do not allow it in the case of families where there are disputes about custody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am saying and have said since 1982 is that this whole thing is a debacle, a mess, full of contradictions and an unwillingness to confront Irish reality.  I have also said the solution would be to get rid of Article 40.3.3º completely.  If we will not do that let us at least confront the reality of what we are doing.  We are writing high sounding phrases into the <Col N="861" /> Constitution and then bolting down a hole as fast as we can to make sure we will never be embarrassed in any circumstances by any of the unpleasant consequences of those high sounding principles.</P>
    <P>We are not talking about divorce.  This right to travel is the right to travel that might be affected by Article 40.3.3º and nothing else.  It is therefore the right to travel abroad to have an abortion.  I accept it is the intention of the Government that the amendment to the Constitution, as proposed, will have exactly the same effect whether or not the wording Senator Murphy and I propose is inserted.  I accept that is their intention, but I am slightly worried that might not be the effect.  It is high time we started to get around to being explicit about our intentions in this area.  If it is our intention to have a high flown guarantee in the Constitution followed by an equally low flown guarantee that it will not have any significance for anybody who has some money, what we are actually saying is that we will not enforce our rigorous laws on abortion on the rich but we will be very sanctimonious and very good Catholics about imposing them on the poor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>In that connection we might recall that when the Supreme Court gave its judgment in the X case the collective sigh of relief that this girl was at last free to travel was to be heard loudly around the country, not least by the Catholic bishops, because they were also let off the hook.  Our amendment is meant to pinpoint the hypocrisy of this whole thing as Senator Brendan Ryan has said.  It struck me while the Senator was speaking that he referred several times to the right to travel, but in fact the amendment does not say anything about rights; it uses the expression &ldquo;freedom to travel&rdquo;.  May I ask the Minister whether there is a distinction here and whether freedom is not as strong a legal concept as a right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to ask the Minister whether he is aware it is now claimed that, irrespective of what you put into this amendment and no matter how you <Col N="862" /> guarantee the pregnant woman's right to travel for an abortion &mdash; which is what is really meant &mdash; there may be other factors or concepts in the Constitution which are superior &mdash; the rights of the family, for example, which are stressed so strongly in the Constitution and which in a recent article are interpreted to mean that, irrespective of what you put into this amendment about the right to travel, the husband or the parents will still have a superior claim to determine the destiny of a pregnant woman whom they claim is under their jurisdiction.  Will whatever is put in be, in effect, cancelled out or in conflict with the superior rights of the family in the Constitution?</P>

It is at least a little breath of honesty, something to which we have not been treated by the Minister who said in his speech: &ldquo;The effect of the amendment is to afford full protection to the lives of pregnant women.&rdquo; Central to the legislation is to permit abortion.  It is time we stopped evading this issue.  I recognise the anxieties of all people.  It is a very human thing to want to live in a nice, neat ordered world where there are no jagged edges and we are not troubled by complex moral issues.  Unfortunately, we do not.  We have to face up to this reality, sad as it may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to echo what Senator Murphy said about the complexities of the constitutional situation.  He is of course perfectly right.  There is a phrase in the Constitution &mdash; I cannot remember it exactly &mdash; which says something to the effect that the family has rights antecedent and superior to all other rights. That would seem to me to be a fairly <Col N="863" /> weighty consideration in looking at this matter.  I am very happy to support this amendment.</P>

      <P>I would like to come back to the point I raised.  The Minister has not yet been able to respond to it.  It has also been referred to by Senator Brendan Ryan.  It is the implied different treatment of better off women versus the poorer women in our community in cases of crisis pregnancy.  There is an enormous problem here.  If by what we are doing here today we are allowing the country to breath that collective sigh of relief that has been referred to, I would like some assurance from the Minister that our health code will ensure equal treatment of all women in crisis cases by allowing those who cannot afford to avail of services abroad to get supplementary welfare or help on their medical card to avail themselves of whatever service any women in a crisis pregnancy feels she needs or is advised to avail herself of by her doctor and those counselling her. Could I have an assurance that this freedom to travel will allow all women to be treated equally?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the other points that have been made, the right to travel is a general right which has been implied from the fundamental rights provisions in the Constitution by the Supreme Court and by our superior courts generally, over a long number of years.  It was found that the writing of Article 40.3.3º into the Constitution caused that fundamental right to travel, which has been implied, to be restricted in this particular type of case.  What the <Col N="864" /> amendment I am proposing is saying is that Article 40.3.3º can no longer be interpreted to limit the general right to travel in any way in the future.  In other words, as a result of this an injunction cannot be taken in cases like the X case which may come up in the future.</P>
      <P>I did not fully follow all the logic of Senator Costello's case about an injunction to be taken after somebody has come back.  It would not be much good taking an injunction against somebody after they had done whatever it was they were to be injuncted from doing in the first place.  Maybe I am misreading what the Senator said.  It is well known that throughout the world people will always cross borders to avail themselves of facilities which they do not have at home. There is nothing reprehenisble about that.  That is a general feature.  Senator B. Ryan is backing himself into a logical <i>cul de sac</i>, if he will forgive me for saying so.  If we accept the reality that people cross borders to avail of services they are deprived of in their own country &mdash; if they could get them at home they would not be crossing borders to get them &mdash; it does not make much difference if it is by virtue of the Constitution, by legislation or by court decision they are deprived of them in their own countries.  We accept that and what we are doing here is allowing them to do so.</P>

      <P>May I respond to Senator Murphy?  He has raised a good point. The right is general and flows from court decisions interpreting the fundamental rights Articles.  The exercise of that right will not be in any way interfered with in the circumstances of the X case.  From that point of view I do not think there is any particular significance or any ulterior motive in the use of the word &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;right&rdquo;.  The Senator may be right.  It might have been more appropriate to use the word &ldquo;right&rdquo; but I do not think it will make any difference in practice because the intention is clear.</P>

      <P Just="Center">and</P>
      <P>In Part II, page 6, line 9, after &ldquo;information&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, counselling or assistance&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Again we have an amendment to the Constitution presented in a most negative fashion.  It reads:</P>
      <P>This subsection shall not limit freedom to obtain or make available, in the State,</P>
      <P>&mdash;it does not use the words &ldquo;right&rdquo; to information&mdash;</P>
      <P>subject to such conditions as may be laid down by law&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>Obviously the matter has to be legislated for in any case and that would have been the proper thing to do.  Now with the decision of the European Court of Human Rights the whole section is quite irrelevant because the decision has been explicitly stated in that particular case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What type of information?  Information <Col N="867" /> relating to services lawfully available in another state.  What is the character of that information?  What is the nature of that information?  How broad is it, how extensive is it, how useful is it?  In a sense we are buying a pig in a poke.  We are told that there shall be no limit to information; but we are not told what the nature of the information is to be, how extensive it is, how useful it is and whether it is to be curtailed by the legislative proposals that are stated here. I am saying in this amendment that we should at least spell out some further elements in relation to the freedom of information we are seeking and include therefore counselling or assistance relating to services lawfully available in another state.</P>
    <P>There should be a fullness of information available to people and we should terminate once and for all this sad situation of women who are pregnant making decisions on very limited information, deliberately being deprived of information, deliberately being deprived of counselling, deliberately being deprived of assistance.  The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that we are not simply left with the basic negative amendment but that there is an attempt to spell out, to some degree at least, some of the provisions we would expect to see in the legislative proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very good reason for this amendment.  I compliment Senator Costello, having tut-tutted slightly about another one of his amendments. I am very glad this is in because the people who have so arrogantly given to themselves the title of pro-life have said they are in favour of information on abortion being made available to people as long as it is information which tells them how awful it is.  They have no objection at all to information on services lawfully available in other states being made available as long as the information is calculated to dissuade people from using those services.  That has been made clear over and over again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the wording of this, is it <Col N="868" /> information which will give both sides, or is it information which will tell people how wrong it is?  I accept there is a phrase &ldquo;freedom to obtain or make available... information&rdquo;.  Since there is a capacity to regulate this by law, the regulation by law could, to say the least of it, demand that fairly horrific accounts of the extreme effects of abortion should be part of any information on the issue.  I am not saying this is the intent of the Government; what I am saying is that this is not quite as clear and explicit a constitutional guarantee of proper information, which, as the European Court of Human Rights felt obliged to point out to us, might in fact result in women deciding not to travel to Britain to have abortions.</P>
    <P>I support this amendment.  I think it is necessary.  Given the rather confused position of the Minister for Health on the whole issue, both inside and outside the other House, it should be written down that people are entitled to be told in a dispassionate fashion the options available to them, the consequences of the various options available to them and also that they be assisted in the execution of whatever choice they choose to make. Any other concept of information makes a mockery of the high flown guarantee of freedom to travel we had a minute ago. We are going to say: &ldquo;You are free to travel but we will not tell you anything about where you are travelling to&rdquo;.  This is a mockery of the intent of that.  It confirms my view &mdash; and it is one that Senator Norris has expressed more explicitly all the way through this &mdash; that the solution was never to have had this infernal amendment in the first place and the solution now is to get rid of it.  We are now involved in extraordinary intellectual and moral contortions to try to make to irreconcilables fit together in the interests of our feeling better about ourselves.  It should contain specific reference to counselling and to assistance. Otherwise information can be loaded or can be controlled in a way that will make it loaded.  We should not allow ourselves to walk back into another position of having some people dictate what kind of information should be given on it.</P>
    <Col N="869" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>At this point I would like to offer a word of explanation to Sentor Keogh, who took me to task for my phrase &ldquo;Mickey Mouse amendments&rdquo; in respect of the travel and information amendments.  It bears on what Senator Norris said a moment ago in exasperation that though we are here conscientiously doing our parliamentary duty, in another sense we feel that all this is hypocrisy, a waste of time, and would have been totally avoided if people had not caved in to crawthumpers in 1983 and are still caving in to crawthumpers.  That is what I meant when I said that these are &ldquo;Mickey Mouse&rdquo; amendments.  What I meant was that the mentality behind them was a petty mentality and a hypocritical mentality and that in any western civilised decent society we should not have to be talking about gauging how far you can give the right to travel or what precise amount of information you have to give. This is in any case totally contrary to the spirit of the European Community.</P>
      <P>There is an article on the recent court case in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> by Sandra Coliver legal officer of the centre against censorship in London.  She says:</P>
      <P>In the contemporary world of television and radio broadcasts, satellite and cable transmissions, telephone and fax machines, no state can realistically hope to impose a <i>cordon sanitaire</i> to prevent the free flow of information.</P>
      <P>Indeed, any interference with this free flow of information in turn interferes with the free movement of people and services which is the touchstone of contemporary European democracy.</P>
      <P>The Minister admitted that on the travel issue, and the remarks he made about freedom of travel being of the essence of the European Community apply equally to freedom of information.  Any pussyfooting about how far we should permit information is unrealistic and I would like to make that point clear.  I support Senator Costello's amendment before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was in the Dáil that the Minister <Col N="870" /> for Justice said the State has no business being involved in abortion information services.  Why not?  Why should the State not be concerned with what is an anxiety, a real social and moral agony of certain citizens?</P>
    <P>Again I refer to the contemporary discourse in the United States where someone like Mario Cuomo could maintain that, as a Catholic, not only would he make a distinction between his views as a Catholic and his duties as a legislator but as a legislator, his obligation might be not simply to provide full information on abortion services but to fund such services.  The State, in my view, should not be stepping back from involvement and if it really means what it says by &ldquo;information&rdquo; should give the total picture and not limit itself to certain areas of information.</P>
    <P>The point was well made this morning in connection with yesterday's Supreme Court judgment that it is a violation of human rights and of the rights of pregnant women in particular, in crisis pregnancies, to limit the information they have to telephone numbers in a directory, or other such uninformed services, instead of giving them full access to counselling as is envisaged in this amendment so that they may be in possession of all the information they require and not just a section of it.  In the end &mdash; and this was also behind the Mario Cuomo argument &mdash; the result of providing complete information may be a lessening of the incidence of abortion.  There are numerous reasons the supply of information should include every aspect of that including all kinds of counselling.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support this amendment for the reasons my colleague, Senator Murphy touched on.  I am interested not only in the question of information but I am very glad the Labour Party put in the question of assistance as well.  That takes us back to the point Senator Doyle was very appropriately making about the kind of class distinction that is implicit in the Bill making these services accessible only to people with a certain standard of income. <Col N="871" /> We are declaring that abortion is permissible, it is legal, it is available but it is not accessible to many people without assistance.  I wonder if the Minister is prepared to state that where the life of a mother is threatened &mdash; and these cases will be rare but they will exist &mdash; the State is prepared to subsidise the travel arrangements for this woman so that her life will be spared, otherwise this entire debate is about the price of a ticket to London and who can afford it and who cannot.  I find the whole thing disgusting. I think this prurient obsession with the mechanics of reproductive biology&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister believes it will not but I am certain it will.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;information&rdquo; is a catch all because language has been debased, vitiated and corrupted by the proponents and supporters of Article 40.3.3º already, and in the Minister's speech he deliberately obfuscates language when he is talking, for example, about directive and non-directive counselling. Either he does not know what it means or he is deliberately muddying the waters.</P>
      <P>I think I know what it means because for ten years I was a tutor and in that ten years I had about ten young women who came to me with crisis pregnancies.  I was able first, to listen to them and let their unhappiness emerge, take the temperature down and then get them to a non-directive counselling agency.  As far as I know, only one of those women had an abortion, the other eight or nine did not.  That was because they were able to receive information in the broadest sense, meaning counselling, in which all the options were laid out before them and the inevitable consequences, negative and positive, of either course of action were laid out before them.</P>
      <P>It is clear that for a number of people in the pro Article 40.3.3º lobby, and perhaps also for the Minister, &ldquo;information&rdquo; means only information which puts the sad idea of abortion in the most negative way possible, I can tell this House, as a tutor for ten years, with some experience in this, that that is guaranteed and calculated to drive young women to London in panic, distress and confusion and to have abortions that they might not otherwise have.  I presume this House has already on the record the relevant fact that The Netherlands, which has abortion on demand, as it would be described, which also has adequate and proper contraceptive services and education, which we do not have in this country and also abortion counselling&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;compulsory abortion counselling, has a lower <i>per capita</i> incidence <Col N="873" /> of abortion than we already have in this sparkling, sin-free society in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I am happy to strongly support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take up at the point where Senator Norris left off.  There is another tragic area of which I am sure the Minister is aware.  When access to information, counselling and help is not available to women in the tragedy of a crisis pregnancy, there is resort to self-inflicted abortion and the black market area.  We are inclined not to mention this anymore assuming that it has been cleaned up.  It has not.  There are desperate women who cannot afford to travel for what they feel is necessary and who resort to self-inflicted damage in the hope of causing a spontaneous abortion. We all know the stories of the three bottles of gin and the hot bath.  That goes on in our community still.</P>
      <P>Women are desperate when they discover they are in a crisis pregnancy for whatever reason, be it incest, rape, the menopausal woman who is absolutely terrified of a child in her 45th, 46th or 49th year, the teenager who just cannot face home because of the wrath of her parents when she finds she is pregnant. Many, particularly those who cannot afford to look at the option of travelling abroad, still resort to self-mutilation to try to rid themselves of the problems, with appalling medical consequences. This is an area that does not get an airing and it is another reason we must have the fullest information and counselling service available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The experience in other countries is that where they have the fullest supportive counselling and information service for crisis pregnancies of one kind or another, the abortion rate decline's dramatically.  If women feel they have the support of the State in the different care areas and that people are there to see them through, their desperation will decrease and they will get the strength to cope with the pregnancy.  I am very concerned that supportive counselling services and a whole range of facilities to help women should be available.  Abortion <Col N="874" /> counselling is only one small part of the possible options when a woman finds herself in that position.</P>
    <P>For the record I would like the Minister to indicate in detail whether the Government feel that yesterday's judgment in the European Court of Human Rights will be fully satisfied by this wording if it is passed by the people.  Are we totally in line now with what yesterday's judgment requires of us?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to agree with what Senator Doyle has said about support and counselling and social attitudes. People out there are faced with all sorts of problems, and crisis pregnancy is one.  Fear of the bank manager, of financial problems, is another matter we all come across frequently and wife battering is another.  As a politician, I give a lot of time to trying to ensure that people feel there is somebody out there to whom they can relate.  People should feel, no matter how big their problem, that there is somebody out there willing to listen.  We must promote that attitude generally in society.  No matter what problem a person has, or how they get into it, they should never feel that judgment will be passed and when they come for help they should get full support in resolving the problem.  That is something we all wish.  In general, in most facets of Irish society there is good progress in that direction.  We are less judgmental.</P>
      <P>I object to the constant suggestion in this debate that those people who believe the right to human life extends to pre-birth)do so purely on Catholic dogma. That is an injustice to the non-Catholics who hold that view.  I have met agnostics who have held that view and I think we all got some literature from an inter-church group promoting the pro-life view. Therefore, I think that to categorise those people who oppose the legislation of abortion as being totally some Catholic sectarian view of the world is not borne out by the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the information issue, it is proposed that it would be regulated by law. It is easy to say that nothing should be <Col N="875" /> regulated by law, that we should have total free information, but very few agree that information should not be regulated by law.  Let us take a very simple, mundane example.  There are legal restrictions on advertising of cigarettes; we do not say it is your own business, we restrict advertising by law.  We also make it legally obligatory to give information in a certain direction on every cigarette packet that is sold.  The regulation of information by law is not unique to what is being proposed here.  It is something that is common throughout all facets of human existence.</P>

      <P>Senator Murphy said it.  I did not say Senator Ryan said it but it was said from the Opposition benches. In my view, it is reasonable that information flow has to be controlled by some law or some system.  It is common in all societies but it seems to me that when we get to certain activities the normal rules that apply in society are meant to go out the window.  The normal recognition of having to draw a line somewhere that we accept in human behaviour, the facing of that reality, suddenly goes out the window when we come to discuss the so-called moral issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand why people cannot accept that most issues are moral issues.  To me, and to most people, morality consists of the common good and, therefore, the Social Welfare Bill is a moral Bill because it says we take from <Col N="876" /> the richer or better off and we give to the poor.</P>

My concentration on sexual morality issues would be concentrated in the same way as in other issues and that is protecting people as we would with battered wives or rape victims.  The abortion issue comes down to one fundamental point, whether a person is a person before birth or not. If you say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; you approach it in one way, you say there is a civil right there to be protected.  If you say &ldquo;no&rdquo; it is quite logical, and I said this yesterday, sexual morality is not involved; it is a question of civil rights.</P>

      <P>When I spoke on the substantive issue and the amendment on Second Stage I made two points which are relevant to this amendment.  All of us accept the right to travel as unquestionable; that is not an issue.  Implicit in the right to travel however, is the daily opportunity for Irish women to travel to England for abortions as they have been doing for many years.  It is not logical to disregard the implications of the right to travel.</P>
      <P>We cannot smugly escape reality by saying that we are not aware of abortion carried out across the water.  Abortion is readily available to Irish women abroad and we have to face that issue which brings us to the question of counselling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It cannot be said often enough that the most unattractive, horrific and most dreaded prospect for a woman is to contemplate abortion; it is the last thing a woman contemplates.  Many unfortunate women who have gone through that process, as we know from features in newspapers, magazine articles, etc. go through lives of hell after the event. Many have tragically been the victims of <Col N="877" /> long term psychiatric care because of a previous abortion.  If one accepts that abortion will be readily available once we have the right to travel and if one accepts that abortion is an extraordinarily unattractive and a last option, then we should have a State supported pregnancy counselling service staffed by experts to offer humane support to women in distress because of pregnancy.</P>
    <P>A woman properly counselled and with adequate emotional support will decide against abortion.  Over the past 15 years roughly 5,000 women per year have made the lonely journey to Holyhead with one dreadful consequence.  That calls into question our national attitude to sexuality, the sex education programmes in schools, our support system for unmarried mothers, our entire value system, and poses fundamental questions.</P>
    <P>All of us, with the horrific exception of a few paramilitaries who attempt genocide in the Northern part of this country are pro-life.  Being pro-life has a deeper meaning to it and more significant consequences than any statement of aspirations in public fora.  Being pro-life means being supportive of pregnant women and being in favour of an awareness programme in schools about sexuality and sexual problems.  In this context complete counselling services are needed which will seek out those in need of them. We cannot escape.  We are in this unique position, because of our contiguity to England.  Abortion is available to Irish women, for a small travel fare; the distance to travel is short.  That is why counselling is so important.</P>
    <P>No matter what amendment or legislation we pass in Ireland, people can make the trip to Holyhead with ease.  All pro-life people who are appalled by that scenario must actively campaign for State support services which must become one of the major functions of the Departments of Health and Education and of voluntary groups.  I am in favour of comprehensive counselling services and, like Senator Doyle, I would like the Minister's clarification on how yesterday's ruling affects the existing situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take up some points made by Senator Ó Cuív, one of which, strictly speaking, is irrelevant to the immediate consideration but since he got away with it I take it that I will also.  He made the point that objection to abortion is not merely a Roman Catholic standpoint; people who are not Roman Catholics also share a universal abhorrence of abortion.  Later on in his speech he said that one either believes that there is a person there from the beginning in which case one has to support the right to life of the unborn or one does not in which case one's attitude is quite different.</P>
      <P>This is precisely the difference between the Roman Catholic view of abortion and what I might call the humanist view, or even the Church of Ireland view.  The rigid belief that the fertilised ovum at the moment of conception is a person with rights, is the Roman Catholic point of view.  It is not shared by the other Christian churches as far as I know to the same rigid extent.  As the Senator rightly says, it determines one's view and that is why it is important for believing and practising Roman Catholics to try to rise above their personal convictions and see the wider picture as to what has to be done to safeguard the public good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Germane also to our immediate consideration are the wrong parallels drawn by Senator ÓCuív between the kind of comprehensive information we are talking about here and the restrictions put on certain advertising propaganda and so on.  Society rightly restricts the propaganda of tobacco companies and purveyors of racist propaganda but to compare these with a crisis pregnancy is totally misleading.  Western society allows the citizen the maximum information about smoking and non-smoking and permission in the light of full information to make up his or her own mind.  It is a wrong comparison.  All across Europe countries have varying degrees of permissiveness towards abortion.  Some have quite limited access but all agree that one must have the maximum information, including counselling, to allow the <Col N="879" /> mature citizen to make up her own mind. That is the difference.</P>
    <P>Finally, for Senator Ó Cuív's edification, I will quote Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, to which I take it he subscribes, and which lays down:</P>
    <P>The right to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Doyle on the counselling issue.  It would be remiss of us here today to leave without knowing what exactly the Minister intends to do.  His words yesterday were: &ldquo;That the Government would give careful consideration to the decision&rdquo;.  That is a general statement which means absolutely nothing.</P>
      <P>If we might refer for a moment to the breach of the European Convention on Human Rights.  The 1988 injunction, which prevented the dissemination of abortion information, has not made a whit of difference to the number of women leaving this country for abortions and, as Senator Doyle said, we are talking about women of all ages.  It was stated yesterday that during the term of that injunction the number of women leaving this country for abortions actually rose. So I cannot see why we have to look negatively, as we typically do in this country, at counselling.  There is no specific link that I can find between the provision of information and abortion.  The opposite is true; the numbers obtaining abortions increase when counselling and information are not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Minister's constituency, it took a long time for family planning services to find their way to Limerick.  How in the past if one lived outside Limerick, my constituency, could one gain access to family planning?  That is still an issue in rural Ireland today.  I ask the Minister to direct the health boards to provide in quantity and quality information centres on pregnancy.  I do not think there are many well-heeled women <Col N="880" /> today in Irish society as a result of our economic problems, but it would be easy for a woman with means to receive counselling from a consultant or GP who is also employed by the health board; but the same information would not be available to a woman with a medical card. That is divisive and unless the health boards are directed by the Minister to provide quality counselling, I cannot see us going anywhere.</P>
    <P>It is invariably women who, with support from medical, legal people, etc., run counselling services on shoestring budgets. If the Well Woman Centre and Door Open Counselling had not received their expenses, I do not know how they would survive.  Let us face facts.  I do not want the women of Ireland to have to suffer the consequences of a two-tier society. Women who can afford to travel will continue to do so, and those who cannot will be left in danger.  We must look positively at counselling; when all the options are put before Irish women they will opt for the positive one.</P>
    <P>There has been an increase in births to young unmarried women who choose to keep their babies.  Such births are on the increase in Limerick and Dublin maternity hospitals and throughout the country.  That is an affirmation of Irish women who have their children without adequate support services.</P>
    <P>In rural areas unmarried mothers are still looked upon with scorn.  Tongues wag and women suffer social ostracisation, especially from rural males, who completely disregard the fact that all babies have fathers.  This issue was not mentioned over the last few days.  Men whose girlfriends, spouses etc.  have left the country for abortions are the hidden statistic; we know nothing about them. They take no responsibility.  Young women who choose to keep their babies frequently bring them up in local authority flats while trying to hold down jobs, particularly in the catering industry. These women struggle to support their children and I find it hypocritical that it has been implied in the discussion relating to this amendment that Irish women rush off to have abortions with little or <Col N="881" /> no commitment to their children.  I will say more about that when we talk about the substantive issue.</P>
    <P>I expect the Minister to state today that we will have counselling available not only for pregnant women but also for fathers who should accompany their partners to centres to give them that support, whether they wish to enter marriage or not.  Single pregnant women are not anxious to enter into marriage either unless it is going to be a life long partnership of compatibility.  A counselling service must be publicly acceptable, not a door on which people will be afraid to be seen to knock.  We must get rid of that attitude.  Irish society must come of age through improved information from schools and clergy and genuine support for family life, not solely on paper but evident in openness and honesty.  Ireland parades itself on the world stage as morally superior to other countries in its support for family life.  Let us begin to grow up.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will concede that we should have supportive counselling services for young women everywhere and so geographically located that all can avail of them without the necessity for long train or bus journeys.  They must be situated where people can find them once they need help, warmth and support. Other areas of Irish political life must make available the financial support necessary to implement women's ultimate decisions.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to see universal support on this side of the House for our motion.  I hope the Minister will in his reply agree with the points so cogently and strongly made by people who feel deeply about this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is particularly important because the wording of the amendment Bill before us is a typical piece of Fianna Fáil wink and nod, saying that they will conform to the requirement to provide information but that they will be very circumspect about the information made avilable.  That is why they have put in &ldquo;subject to such conditions as may be laid down by law&rdquo; without the slightest <Col N="882" /> indication of what those conditions might be.</P>
    <P>We do not know what proposals will issue in forthcoming legislation.  Fianna Fáil are asking us to buy a pig in a poke in the matter when there is a need for unrestricted information in crisis pregnancy counselling.  Speaker after speaker on the Fianna Fáil side has said: &ldquo;We do not want information or advertising; we do not want that sort of thing happening around the country.  We are not going to tolerate that.&rdquo;  The Minister for Health has already indicated that he does not see a role for the State in the provision of pregnancy counselling services.  So what are we left with?  We have a provision to vote on and there is a huge question mark over the intention of the Government to provide a proper information and counselling service.  I hope the Minister will respond to all the points made and we will press this to a vote.</P>

I give him credit because the Labour Party have put down an amendment to state clearly that they want counselling and assistance included.  I respect their honesty which can be contrasted with the typical hypocritical approach of Fine Gael with their fine words and hyperbole.  If Fine Gael want directive counselling and assistance let them put down an amendment.  They should not try to be all things to all men and all women.</P>

      <P>I am not under pressure; Fine Gael obviously are.  If Fine Gael are in favour of assistance they should put down an amendment to that effect.  At least we know where the Labour Party and Independent Senators stand.</P>
      <P>I want to deal with a few points made by Senator Murphy.  His logic was as usual compelling but I am not persuaded by it on this occasion.  Senator Murphy referred to an article in <i>The Irish Times.</i> I did not catch the reference but I think he said the writer was a lawyer.  I do not accept that there is no distinction between rights to travel and to information in this context.  There is quite a distinction.</P>
      <P>In the context of which we are speaking the EC Court of Justice in the Grogan case recognised that there can be no absolute right to information on abortion. Each State is entitled to restrict the amount of information available in accordance with its own value system.  I am surprised that a lawyer should make a case that there should be no distinction between travel and information in this context.</P>
      <P>I think that reference was also made to the fact that people will be coming in now that there is freedom to travel, etc., and that therefore information can be disseminated. I do not accept that logic. There is a lot people can do in this country &mdash; people can get away with murder, larceny and assault on occasion, but does that mean we should not prohibit them travelling?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the genuine concerns of Senator Norris into account and bow to his considerable experience as a tutor and to his good work in this regard.  My response to Senators Norris and O'Reilly and others is that the Minister for Justice has already indicated both in this House and in the Dáil that if the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution is accepted on 3 <Col N="884" /> December, the Minister for Health will be bringing forward comprehensive legislation to deal with the matter.  I do not think that we can get into debate here today on the exact provisions of that legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello was wrong when he said that we have no indication what that legislation is going to contain.  The Minister for Health gave a comprehensive outline of what it will contain and the sort of counselling we are talking about which will be non-directive counselling giving the whole range of options available. Senators and Deputies on all sides will be pleasantly surprised when they see the proposals of the Minister for Health. Back-up services were requested to ensure that those proposals are effective; again Members will be pleasantly surprised in that regard.</P>
    <P>I cannot pre-empt a debate on that legislation or predict what it will contain but the Ministers for Health and Justice have given commitments in this regard. If this amendment is accepted and the Constitution changed, we will provide legislation and support services.  I accept all that was said and particularly the case made very strongly by Senators O'Reilly and Norris.  They said that the more pregnancy counselling we have the less people will resort to the ultimate option of abortion. That is true and I think the Minister for Health also accepts that.  The legislation will reflect that fact.</P>
    <P>I was asked to speak about the decision of the European Court of Human Rights yesterday.  I studied the judgment this morning and I can say now &mdash; and I am quite clear on this &mdash; that this amendment and the legislation which will follow it will correct the defect which the Court of Human Rights has found in Irish law. I understand that the Court of Human Rights found that we are in breach of the Convention on Human Rights because we do not allow access to non-directive counselling where there is not an economic link between the person providing the information and the person getting the information.  The Minister for Justice made very clear in his address on Second Stage that this Bill will permit non-directive <Col N="885" /> but not directive counselling. Directive counselling involves abortion referral and the intention of the Bill is to exclude that type of counselling from this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined details of the legislation which the Minister for Health proposes to bring forward for legislative controls on the supply of information in the event of the amendment to the Constituion provided for in the Bill being accepted in the forthcoming referendum. He made clear that the legislation will cover, for example, information provided by a doctor or an advice agency to a pregnant woman who seeks advice concerning her own specific circumstances. He said there will be a requirement that, in such circumstances, information must be given as part of non-directive counselling on the full range of options available to the person concerned. The Minister said that non-directive counselling means setting out all the available options in order to let the woman make an informed decision.  Freedom to obtain information regarding services lawfully available in another State which the Government's wording protects clearly allows for this type of non-directive counselling.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out that, following the 1988 Supreme Court decision concerning information, doctors have been unsure of their legal position regarding counselling in crisis pregnancies. In his view the proposed legislation will not only resolve this uncertainty but will go further to link the provision of abortion information in crisis pregnancies with the provision of full non-directive counselling.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment to the Bill tabled by the Labour Party would insert the words &ldquo;counselling and assistance&rdquo; into the wording of the Bill and clearly allow for abortion referral.  The Government are of the view that a provision of that kind is wholly unacceptable, and would not be in the public interest or in accord with other provisions in the Constitution.  The Fourteenth Amendment will open up the right to provide and receive information concerning services <Col N="886" /> available in other countries, not merely in those cases where termination of a pregnancy is lawful in the State but concerning all services lawfully available outside the State.</P>
    <P>I have made it clear that the Government are prepared to permit non-directive counselling but are not prepared to permit directive counselling.  The Government are advised that the word &ldquo;information&rdquo; in the Bill is sufficient, without any reference to counselling, to achieve that purpose; in other words, the word &ldquo;information&rdquo; includes counselling. In line with the Government commitment, the legislation the Minister for Health proposes to initiate should the people accept the proposal on 3 December, will provide for non-directive counselling and prohibit directive counselling. Non-directive counselling under the legislation will set out all the available options in order to let the person make an informed decision for herself.</P>

      <P>I was stating that I hoped the Minister and his colleagues will listen to the case being made now in relation to amending the substantive issue before this House. It is obvious from this Minister's attitude this morning that the Fine Gael case will not be acceptable to him as he has his eye on the ball as to what will happen next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue before us today affects the women from 14 years of age to 50 years of age.  Many women are very concerned as to why reference to their health is excluded as a consideration, no matter how serious the health issue may be.  I am not talking about a frivolous health issue; I am talking about serious health issues that could be life shortening or that could be life threatening at some other point down the road once the child was born.  Why do they have to be specifically excluded now?  I would go so far as to say <Col N="890" /> I would accept no reference to health in the amendment.  I would like to see that word excluded.  I do not like the reference that there is an exception on health issues; that is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>As we propose in our amendment, if the reference to the health of a woman were excluded altogether, women would be satisfied and would then be able to rely on the good judgment of the medical profession and accept the spirit of what is being proposed here, that it is really in the cases of utmost gravity which are genuinely life threatening, that limited access to termination of pregnancy &mdash; which, quite frankly, is limited access to abortion &mdash; will now be allowed in this country.  I urge the Minister, despite the political prejudices he has displayed this morning, to listen to the plea I am making in relation to this amendment.</P>

      <P>I accept the guidance of the Chair.  I do no want to add to the heat that has been generated in the last few minutes.  I am increasingly reluctant to <Col N="891" /> talk about it because it involves women in a way that no man can comprehend.  I have heard a lot about the commitment to women from the other side of the House and on my left as well.  I keep hearing over and over again that nothing will ever be done that will put a woman's life at risk.</P>
      <P>In virtually every State-funded maternity hospital in the country a woman is not allowed the choice of safely ending her capacity to have children by female sterilisation because of the moralistic antics of men on health boards and on hospital boards of ethics who decide that they know better than women whether or not they can have more children. They impose Roman Catholic morality on those women, not some sort of humanistic morality.  They stick Roman Catholic rigid morality down their throats in maternity hospitals and say &ldquo;No, you cannot have a sterilisation in our State-funded hospital&rdquo; and then they come in here and tell us they are concerned about the lives and health of women.  Stick it somewhere, will you.  You do not care about women.  You are afraid of the Catholic Church.  You run away from them on the simple issue of sterilisation and I am supposed to believe on this issue that you care about women.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The first two amendments are directed towards eliminating the distinction that is being made by the Government amendment on the referendum, namely, the distinction between the health and life of the mother.  I must say, reading the speech made by the Minister for Justice, it was very hard to figure out what point he was making.  He talked about a spectrum of gravity that could be defined in a life threatening situation.  Where is the spectrum of gravity in a health threatening situation where the effect of not taking action is to shorten the life of the mother or to seriously or irreparably damage the life that does not result in an immediate threat to her life?  What I find unacceptable is that it is left to the capacity of the Minister to more or less adjudicate <Col N="892" /> on a personal basis and be absolutely convinced that he can tell us exactly where the line can be drawn when it comes to a threat to health.</P>
      <P>It will be absolutely impossible to make a decision on that matter.  We will put the medical profession in an absolutely impossible situation.  There are no legislative guidelines to be prescribed here. How will we operate without legislative guidelines on this matter?  We were able to operate with legislative guidelines in relation to freedom of information.  In fact, the Minister said it was absolutely essential; but how are we to operate this when there is no specific provision for conditions subject to law?  It is stated as an absolute principle and it is only the Minister for Justice who clearly sees a health threatening situation being totally different from a life threatening situation.</P>
      <P>I am not prepared to accept the black and white prescription that is in this Bill. I ask the Minister to consider seriously the amendment that we put forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I second Senator Doyle's amendment and say that this will eventually be determined in the courts.  There is a lot of disagreement at present among medical people as to when health threatening becomes life threatening, but because we are now writing it into the Constitution it will eventually be determined by lawyers on the basis of interpretation of words.  Doctors and medics will be constrained from intervening when there is doubt as to when health threatening becomes life threatening and because of this women's health and lives will be in danger.  It is unnecessary to have such a wording.  It will create difficulties and bring us back to the 1983 situation again within a short time when cases will be tested, perhaps by the members of a family of a women who is in need of medical intervention or indeed by groups who may feel they have a point to make or that it is an issue to be determined by the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to waste the House's time by going over all <Col N="893" /> the ground again.  I support the amendment before the House because what is proposed by way of the constitutional amendment is unacceptable.  It has been said again and again that a main reason for this distinction is that it has arguably opened the floodgates elsewhere to wholesale abortion, that once you conceive that health is a criteria for determining abortion then that gradually gives way to abortion on demand.  I think I am right in saying this is a mainline objection to removing the distinction.  I suggest to the Minister that it does not follow that what has become perhaps the practice in another jurisdiction and in a very different culture would go the same way here, unless you accept of course the simplistic proposition that if you change the law you change morality.  As I made clear in my Second Stage speech, I do not accept the reasoning, of people like Cardinal Daly because there are a whole lot of factors in society that determine people's attitude to matters such as abortion.</P>
      <P>In Ireland we have, to say the least, a very strong family orientated tradition. For all our hypocrisy, there is a network of relationships that are life sustaining and, above all of course, we have a medical profession which is extremely conservative and hospital services which are similarly conservative.  I suggest that for those reasons and a whole complex of factors it is not at all reasonable to argue that if you give in on this distinction it will lead to abortion on demand.  We have a very different society, and are likely to have for a long time to come, and it will not be changed one way or the other by legislating for a minority of people who have to be legislated for.  Certainly the solution is not through putting this complexity into the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting the amendment in the names of Senators Manning and Doyle we are back again to discussion of the fact that there was need for legislation and that it is impossible in a matter of a few sentences to legislate for the myriad of possibilities and traumatic cases that will occur.  Senator Neville referred to it being brought to the courts <Col N="894" /> again.  Hopefully, it will not, but that cannot be ruled out.</P>
      <P>There is confusion among the experts and utter confusion among the electorate. Many people who would be very conscious about casting their votes have said to me they will not vote because the matter is so complex.</P>
      <P>The health of the mother can be separated into two distinct aspects, physical health and psychological health.  The amendment attempts to differentiate between an ailment which can be looked upon as life threatening as distinct from being life shortening.  Any serious ailment which a pregnant mother may have and which is not treated for a period of time because of her pregnancy is life shortening.  The Minister has listed a series of ailments which he says can be treated under the constitutional provision but the conditions are life threatening in the short term.</P>
      <P>One could argue with equal validity that a whole range of other ailments which may not be life threatening may be life shortening.  I will give an example of a young girl in her early twenties who has an ailment left untreated because of her pregnancy and this failure to treat it could result in her death in her thirties.  What are we talking about here?  We are talking about a specific case and what we are really saying is she is left to die.  Doctors will be loath to make decisions in specific instances.  There was a very humane response by the Irish people to the X case.  Rape and incest cases are on the increase as we know because women are coming forward and they are being open about them.  It is as if we said the X case is over and it will never happen again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are looking into the future and saying these few words will cover every eventuality.  The letters to the editors of newpapers, not from interested members of the general public but from obstetricians, psychiatrists, psychologists; gynaecologists etc., question the validity of amending the Constitution rather than having legislation to deal with the specifics. This is why we are so concerned with the distinction between health and <Col N="895" /> life.  I do not think we can draw a line and say one is life and one is health.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>We would not be in the position of putting down amendments if this matter were dealt with in a different way.  It has been taken over by Cabinet sub-committees, barrack-room lawyers, special interest groups, etc., and has led to considerable confusion.  In the midst of all that, women have been denied access to the deliberations and, as a consequence, they are afraid.</P>
      <P>Some of the women I spoke to are very concerned about the wording and its effects.  For example, their real concern is that if you use the word &ldquo;save&rdquo; it means that a woman could go to death's door before she would be treated.  That is the way it could be interpreted by consultants. If the word &ldquo;protection&rdquo; were used women would know that everything would be done in plenty of time to make sure that the protection was given which was necessary to save life.  People are scared of the word &ldquo;save&rdquo;.  They think it really means when one is at death's door or close to death then they will be treated but that someone will be left waiting for too long and all sorts of problems will be created.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesHanafin" hpid="Mr. Hanafin Mr. Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what confused me because it has no connection whatsoever with the other amendments listed. However, I have been advised that is the proper way to deal with it.  My amendment is to delete all words after &ldquo;it shall be unlawful to&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;act in such a way as to bring about the termination of the life of an unborn unless such termination arises indirectly as a side-effect of treatment designed to protect the life of the mother&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="896" /> The intent of my amendment is to rule out the direct killing of the unborn child and to ensure that the mother continues to receive all necessary care and treatment, even such treatments as have the indirect and unwelcome consequence of the loss of her child.  In other words, my amendment reflects current medical practice in Ireland, both before and after the Eighth Amendment and is entirely in keeping with the current guidelines of the Medical Council.  These guidelines stress the entitlement of the mother to all treatment she needs, even the most aggressive treatments where necessary.  The guidelines also point out that the intentional destruction of the life of the unborn is forbidden, and indeed this would amount to serious professional misconduct.</P>
    <P>The Minister's proposal is to make lawful such direct and intentional destruction of the life of the unborn; in other words, it provides for direct abortion. The Minister is almost saying that women have died in this country because of the absence of the abortion regime he is proposing.  There is no evidence that this is so; all the evidence is quite to the contrary.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to page five of <i>Current Controversies in Abortion</i>, an information update.  This has been circulated to all Members.  It says:</P>
    <P>In 1990, with 52,954 live births in Ireland, there were 2 maternal deaths (2); one from an acute asthmatic attack in a normal pregnancy, the other from a post-partum haemorrhage following a normal antenatal period and delivery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I would like to comment on what Senator Brendan Ryan said about the attitude of men. He seemed to be looking very harshly at me but I do not think he was having a go at me personally in relation to sterilisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sterilisation is a moral issue and there are guidelines concerning it in the Irish code of ethics of doctors.  It does not relate directly to the law of the land.  It would be wrong to include the question of <Col N="897" /> sterilisation in this very different debate. The reality is that sterilisation is available in most cities in Ireland although the Senator made the point, probably correctly, that it is not available in many health board hospitals.  I repeat, sterilisation is a matter for a different debate.</P>
    <P>Getting back to this amendment which has primarily to do with what is commonly known as the substantive issue, it arose out of the X case which eventually ended up in the Supreme Court.  On 5 March last the Supreme Court gave a very lengthy deliberation on the issue before it.  In the deliberation &mdash; it is important to note this &mdash; every one of the judges from the Chief Justice down made it clear that abortion would be allowed only where there was real and substantial danger to the life of the mother.  To this extent, the Government's proposal is consistent with the Supreme Court decision in every respect, except for the element of suicide.  We must be very clear in this regard.  The Government and the Minister had no choice but to take full account of what the Supreme Court decided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The thrust, wording and concept of this amendment is primarily derived from the Supreme Court decision, the essence of which was that the paramount concern was the life of the mother.  Where a miscarriage or abortion takes place, the life of the mother must, at all times, be protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition have put down an amendment proposing that the words &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; be deleted. There is some validity to their argument. This is a grey area.  We know the old phrase that doctors differ and patients die.  However, the view of the Government, and my view, is that we are closing the loophole that came to light as a result of the X case.  The deletion of these words would open a loophole as happened in Britain following the 1967 Abortion Act and the subsequent Bourne case in which <Col N="898" /> this issue as to what constituted health was decided in a British court.  It is a historical fact that the floodgates were opened in Great Britain as a result of the decision in the Bourne case.  If those words were deleted here they could be challenged and we would have a similar situation to that in Britain where there is a widespread abortion.  I am not sure of the figures but there have been in the region of three million abortions in Britain since the 1967 Act, was passed &mdash; a staggering figure.</P>
    <P>I am anti-abortion; our party and Government are anti-abortion.  In the framing of these referenda we are trying to put the country back to the position set down in the 1861 Offences Against the Persons Act.  That Act was against what was called unlawful abortion.  In 1983 a referendum copperfastened and enshrined in our Constitution the right of the unborn child.  Subsequently we had the case and the Protocol to the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>All these issues have nothing to do with the Government.  We were faced with the problem and in March of this year within days of the Supreme Court decision, the Minister for Justice set up a Government sub-committee to examine the situation. The Government had to find the wording that would be for the common good.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot of comment from the other side, but on 9 June, by agreement of all of the parties, the two prongs of this debate were decided on.  However, the real difference is on the substantial issue.</P>

      <P>The Government were faced with an unenviable task of deciding what to do because, if you analyse the result of the Supreme Court decision in the X case &mdash; and this was the opinion shared by most prominent and eminent lawyers &mdash; you created an open ended situation with regard to abortion. This Government communicated with all the other parties.  They may not have come to consensus on all three issues but they did on two issues &mdash; that relating to travel and the right to information. Despite a number of meetings, consensus was not achieved on the substantive issue.  I do not want to blame Fine Gael, Labour or the other parties, they have a point.  The Government were faced with a decision of whether to allow abortion and the Government said no.</P>
      <P>Some people in this country are prochoice in cases of rape, incest, etc., or where a woman in her forties is pregnant and may have a Down's Syndrome child. Do you allow abortion in that case?  We say no.  We were faced with the choice of bringing in legislation or having a referendum to deal with the problem which arose in the X case.</P>
      <P>I spoke on this issue last February or March, and said I had an open mind on whether legislation would cure the problem or whether we should have a referendum.  I am open to correction on this, but I think the parties who agreed to this pact last June decided a referendum should be held.  The Minister, Deputy O'Dea said earlier today, that legislation will have to be introduced specifying the sort of information that might be made available.</P>

    <P>No wording is perfect but we believe the wording offered by the Government <Col N="902" /> is pro-woman and pro-unborn.  It is an opportunity to reaffirm the State's commitment to both the unborn and expectant mothers.  This chance is not likely to be given again.</P>

    <P>It is wrong for the Government to imply that there is only one alternative if the Twelfth Amendment is defeated. There are obviously other ways of doing <Col N="903" /> this.  I merely want to show that if there is a will we can easily find a way to avoid abortion.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy O'Dea, referred to me in his speech last night.  I did not hear him &mdash; maybe I am better off &mdash; but I respect his point of view.  He is a man who should have got recognition before now; he is a man who will go far.  I hope he goes right to the top and makes me one of his 11 nominees because that will be my only chance to get back here.</P>

      <P>I have trouble composing myself because I am really moved.  My eyes are bright with unshed tears at the anguish which has been expressed by Senator Hanafin over his rift from Fianna Fáil.  In the presence of such tribal emotion one is really speechless.</P>
      <P>I do not see the point of Senator Hanafin's amendment.  Am I not right in thinking it is already the practice that what is called indirect termination is the norm, and the Catholic norm?  What is the point of this amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment implies that Senator Hanafin will not accept what is now, almost dogmatically stated by authoritative medical people, that there are cases in which a termination of pregnancy <Col N="904" /> is necessary.  These cases may be very rare, but they are there.  The wilful way in which Senator Hanafin and his colleagues and followers deny this fact makes one despair that they ever listen to the voice of reason.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to address myself to the amendment proposed by Senator Hanafin.  The emphasis on direct and indirect has two basic flaws. The first flaw is simple and relates to the purpose of a termination.  We must be clear that termination in certain circumstances has always been accepted. The purpose must be to save the life of the mother but it must be to also vindicate, where practicable, the equal right to life of the child.  It must be a positive thing.</P>
      <P>The second flaw is that if people are worried &mdash; and I would be &mdash; about possible interpretations of the Government's proposal in the future, lawyers would have a field day discussing the minute differences between direct and indirect termination of pregnancy.  What is direct?  What is indirect?  What is cause and effect?</P>
      <P>The Government are trying to lay down what has been common practice, i.e., to save the life of the mother and, as far as practicable, the life of the unborn.  I accept that in most cases that is done by what is loosely called indirect abortion, for example, in ectopic pregnancy treatments, etc.  As medical science develops it is already getting to the point where, when termination is absolutely necessary to save the life of the mother, there might be a variety of methods by which this could be done.  In these cases the saving of both lives is impossible.  That is the core issue and, to a certain extent, we are actually losing sight of the core issue in this debate.</P>
      <P>The thrust of what we want to do, as Article 40.3.3º sets out to do, is to ensure that the life of the mother is not put at risk and that there would be no unnecessary death or termination of the life of the unborn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would address the following points, specifically.  It is my <Col N="905" /> understanding that, in the event of terminating a pregnancy at 24, 25 or 26 weeks should this be necessary to save the life of the mother, as can happen in a case of toxaemia, the doctor would be obliged to carry out that termination of pregnancy in such a way as to maximise the survival of the foetus after birth and would not carry out what would be loosely termed a direct abortion.  There would be an obligation on him to act in that way because of the equal right to life of the child, but one would intervene medically to save the mother.</P>
    <P>Statistics prove that medical intervention in these cases in Ireland has an unparalleled record of ensuring not only the survival of the mother and the vindication of her rights but also a high rate of survival of the unborn child.  My understanding is that it would be obligatory to do all that under the wording put forward by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see that there is anything being introduced here that is substantially different from current medical practice in Ireland, and that record stands on its merit.</P>
      <P>As regards the proposals to delete the words &ldquo;as opposed to the health&rdquo;, the reality should be faced up to.  Everybody knows that if a court were to rule that &ldquo;life&rdquo;, &ldquo;quality of life&rdquo; and &ldquo;health&rdquo; were to be give the same value that would amount to the introduction of abortion on demand.  We know that from what has happened in other lands.  If people want that, fair enough, but they should at least be up front and recognise that possibility. That happened in other jurisdictions and that would be likely to happen if such a judgment were given here.  Therefore, for those people who want the choice not to have that scenario, the proposed wording, unfortunately, has to have that stark reality in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The stark reality of abortion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>The stark reality of <Col N="906" /> abortion has always been there.  If you take the definition of &ldquo;abortion&rdquo; as the direct or indirect termination of the life of the foetus, I know of nobody who does not, in certain circumstances, permit the taking of the life of the unborn.  I have not heard of anybody proposing that in no circumstances, directly or indirectly, will it be possible to take the life of the unborn.  As far as I am concerned, it has never been proposed that the taking of the life of the unborn should be ruled out in all circumstances.  In fact, the 1861 Act refers to unlawful abortion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>So, direct termination is possible in limited circumstances; abortion is possible in limited circumstances. I think we might be closer in agreement if we could get our wording together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>A student made a statement the other night that we should not kill.  That is a fine, easy statement, but all the students did not agree with that because everybody recognises there are circumstances when there is the right to kill, for example, in self-defence.  There have always been circumstances in which abortion, direct and indirect, has been recognised.  An ectopic pregnancy is one well documented example where everybody is agreed it is right morally, legally and every other way to terminate the life of the unborn to save the mother's life. There is nothing new in that.  That was always perceived under Article 40.3.3º. It was also perceived to be legal under the 1861 Act.  Terminations, abortions, call them what you want, have always been seen as acceptable in certain circumstances. Some people do not seem to recognise that fact in this debate; they do not seem to recognise that I have always recognised that fact and have no difficulty with it; what I have always opposed is the wilful destruction of the foetus, and I will <Col N="907" /> continue to oppose that.  It is my right to do so.  If people want to have a contrary view I accept that, but to say that people like me did not recognise any circumstances in which a termination could take place would be foolish.  What I am arguing is that the over-emphasis on the question of whether termination, direct or indirect, has been the slat tomhais, is open to abuse; if somebody found a very effective way of doing it indirectly that would be an abuse.  The slat tomhais must be that abortion would be carried out only when it was necessary to save the life of the mother.  That is the only reasonable measuring stick to ensure the protection of women and the protection of the unborn.  It is a balance.  There is nothing in life that is not a balance.  No matter where you draw the line you will always find marginal cases.  This is not recognised. We all know there will be marginal cases in any law we enact.  You will always get a hard case and I keep giving examples.  You draw the line which gives the maximum protection without overbalancing in one direction or the other.</P>
      <P>Without wanting intent in the law &mdash; because to measure intent in legal terms is impossible &mdash; the object of the exercise, from the perspective of the people on this side, is to preserve all life, the mother's life and the child's life, but in doing that you make sure you preserve the mother's life.  In other words, you do everything in a positive way.  Therefore, I could not agree with the amendment as proposed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what he said as the record will show.  I also welcome the fact that he invites people like myself to come out and make our position clear and he asks whether we are in favour of abortion. I am completely pro-choice.  I recognise the existence of abortion.  I am not caught up in the Fianna Fáil riddle: when <Col N="908" /> is an abortion not an abortion and how can we evade our moral responsibility in this way?</P>
      <P>I know we are appealed to to keep passions out of this debate, and that is very proper, but I felt a moral revulsion at the Minister's speech and references made by Senator O'Donovan to this question of seeking consensus.  The Minister referred to this also.  He said:</P>
      <P>Unfortunately that consensus did not prove possible but I believe that the process of trying to achieve it at the very least threw some light on many complexities involved.  To the extent that there are some who support, in effect, abortion on demand, clearly there never was a prospect of consensus with them.</P>
      <P>A very neat piece of political footwork. What he is actually saying is that some of the parties with whom he negotiated are proponents of abortion on demand.  I do not think that meets the criteria of honesty which one is tempted to suggest would be appropriate to this House if not to the beef tribunal.</P>
      <P>Senator Hanafin's amendment raises the question of direct and indirect abortion. He is entitled to do so.  There is no such animal known to law, of course, none whatever, but the principle of law is perfectly clear &mdash; a foreseen consequence is a direct and intended consequence as far as the law is concerned. It is as simple and clear as that.  But, of course, there is &mdash; and this is the interesting thing &mdash; a theological concept of the double effect; there is direct and indirect abortion as far as a Roman Catholic theologian would be concerned.  I mentioned yesterday that I regretted the intervention of the Pope, directly, politically, as a head of State, in calling for a referendum in this country.  He is quite entitled to discuss the theological implications but he has an ambassador here and he has in Senator Hanafin, who is a papal knight, a foot soldier&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>An officer and a gentleman <Col N="909" />&mdash; but what he is promoting is not a legal concept, it is a theological concept and let us be quite clear about that.</P>
      <P>The genesis of this was the X case. The tragic reality is that because of the restrictive nature of this series of legislative proposals, should that case arise again that young woman would be in exactly the same situation; her health would not be protected and the question of suicide is also effectively ruled out.  Let us face that.  This is putting us back where we were in the beginning, although for the first time it does at least recognise the existence of abortion.</P>
      <P>I think the health of women is important. It is frightening that the overwhelmingly male legislature of this country can afford to be so cavalier of women's health and can be so precise, so definitive and so unequivocal in the expression of our views.  We are told that the Government side are determined to keep abortion out at all costs, even though they are legalising it in certain circumstances, but only when the life of the mother is directly threatened.</P>
      <P>There is a very interesting article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of Monday, 19 October by Professor Turlough Fitzgerald, Professor of Anatomy in Galway and an author of textbooks on embryology and neuroanatomy.  I would like to take a couple of ideas from it.  I will not quote from it as I quoted from it yesterday.  It is very interesting.  First, he gives details about the pre-embryonic period and the way in which the complex organism of the foetus develops.  He says that because the aberrant conceptus is shed along with the next menstrual flow, the mother is usually unaware that anything has gone amiss.  Those readers who are not already familiar with this fact may be shocked to learn that nature is quite cavalier in dealing with malformed conceptuses.  In other words, nature will not be quite so delicate as the male Members of this House tend to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to pose a direct question to the Minister and I would welcome an answer.  In the question of the distinction between the health and life of a mother, is the Minister prepared to answer to <Col N="910" /> a woman who, because of the lack of availability of abortion in the circumstances of anencephalic pregnancy, is required to go to full term with an entity that has no sensible intelligent life nor the possibility of such?  I quote from Professor Fitzgerald again:</P>
    <P>Finally, given the primacy of the cerebral cortex for the establishment of the human personality, what should our opinion be of foetuses that are born without a cerebral cortex?  These foetuses are <i>anencephalic</i>&mdash; without a brain, because the head end of the neural tube fails to close during the fourth week.  It is easily detected by the 16th week.  The condition occurs once in every thousand births, and it is incompatible with survival.  [And this is the question.]  Will someone please explain why any mother should be obliged to carry an anencephalic foetus to full term?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister explain this to me?  Will Members on this side of the House explain to me what purpose is served by forcing with the full vigor of the criminal law, a woman to carry to full term an anencephalic foetus?  I do not wish to make light of this and I do not say this in a light manner but a colleague of mine said to me the other day that this sort of thing makes him think of a farmer who when the henhouse goes on fire, rushes to save the eggs and leaves the hens to be consigned to the flames.  It is as idiotic as that.  Perhaps that is one of the hard cases.</P>

He said the legislation is being put in place and I thank him for that.  We have the experts telling us what should and should not be done, using the word &ldquo;abortion&rdquo; and all the rest of it.  This debate is a complex one and as Senator Norris has said, up to now it has been calm.  Because there is confusion outside I do not think at this late stage this afternoon we should try to confuse the issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the debate that has taken <Col N="912" /> place and the replies given by the Minister here today.  What we are trying to do at all costs is to save the lives of the mothers of this nation from today on and to save the lives of the babies they are carrying.  As legislators, it is our responsibility to act calmly.  There is a necessity for more education and more advice for young people.</P>
    <P>We have under-estimated the feelings of women, particularly expectant mothers.  We have also under-estimated the doctors and the treatment they give. There are not queues of women wanting abortions.  It is quite clear from the Minister for Health that the code of ethics will require constant scrutiny in the light of the outcome of the vote on 3 December. I welcome the three ballot papers so that there will not be confusion.</P>
    <P>I have the reputation of challenging people and frightening them.  I will not live up to my name on this occasions but if people vote one way on the Thirteenth and Fourtheenth Amendments and vote the opposite way on the Twelfth Amendment, the consequences as I understand it from listening to experts, if there are such people around, from listening to Ministers and advisers, would be exactly what the pro-life people and all of us, as pro-life people, do not wish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to debate such a wide variety of amendments as we have here because we are going from one extreme point of view, and I respect the view of Senator Hanafin, to another extreme point of view and most of us are somewhere in the middle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not as large a difference between the two main parties in this House as might appear.  Senator Ó Cuív's honesty in relation to the wording used in referring to the present situation and what has been around since 1861 clarifies for me the Fianna Fáil thinking to some extent in relation to it.  Fine Gael are not <Col N="913" /> for abortion on demand, and I suspect most people are not.  Some are, most people are not.  Having said that, Fine Gael strongly believe that the health and the life of the woman are of paramount importance.  I am not talking about a woman who just feels it inconvenient to be pregnant for a race meeting in six months time because she will not fit into her outfit or a woman whose career might be jeopardised if she had a baby and who wants to have an abortion instead of using contraception.  We must remember, as my colleague pointed out earlier, that family planning services are still not available for most women in rural Ireland.  It is still a difficult area and that has spawned many other problems down the line. However, I will stick specifically to what we are talking about here today.</P>
    <P>Most of us cannot accept Senator Hanafin's point of view although we respect his sincerity.  It has been pointed out they are theological rather than political views and regardless of our own personal beliefs we must legislate for the greater good of the country if we are a pluralist society.  After all, we are supposed to be a republic and we should behave as Senators in a republic in that context.  We must look at what we are doing.</P>
    <P>As it seems to be fashionable to quote from newspapers here today, in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 24 October last there was a very interesting letter from 14 or 15 obstetricians and gynaecologists from Dublin, Letterkenny, Limerick, Tralee, Portlaoise, Wexford, Galway, Cork.  I am not just talking about some fashionable group of obstetricians and gynaecologists in Dublin but right through our general hospitals.  They contradict, respectfully, the views of Senator Hanafin.  They say:</P>
    <P>Although the situation seldom arises, we believe that sometimes the continuation of the pregnancy poses a real and substantial threat to the life of the mother.</P>
    <P>Reference to the most recent &ldquo;Report on Confidential Enquiries into Maternal Deaths in the United Kingdom for the Years 1985-1987&rdquo; reveal some maternal deaths where the <Col N="914" /> life of the mother might have been saved if the pregnancy had ended rather than been allowed continue.</P>
    <P>I will not read the rest of the letter because time is not on my side.  They are talking about the life of the mother.  I am asking the Minister to go one step further, particularly in view of the statement of the Minister for Justice on Second Stage that normal medical practice operates on the basis of probability and not certainty.  Because of that, I am asking the Minister to accept the Fine Gael amendment, and inded other similar amendments, to remove the words &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo;.  Although I would like it, I am not asking him to put in a positive affirmation that health can be a consideration because he feels, and I respect his views, that that would open the doors to abortion on demand. All I ask is do not specifically exclude health issues, as the women of Ireland generally would ask.</P>
    <P>The words of Article 40.3.3º, speaks of giving due regard to the equal right to life of the mother; &ldquo;life&rdquo; means more than just being alive.  It is the quality of life that a mother who may already have five or six children, deserves to have.  I urge the Minister to remove that phrase. I do not think there is a large difference between the two of us if that could be done.</P>
    <P>Rape and incest are very emotive subjects. I have no difficulty so long as they can be reported very quickly to the relevant authorities for immediate treatment, morning after treatment or whatever.  I hope this debate will at least alert people who are in those appalling positions to go immediately for help so they can be helped in the early weeks after their trauma.</P>
    <P>I have difficulty in the area of handicap as indicated by Senator Norris. Common sense tells me in the specific case he mentioned that there is no hope for that foetus ever having a viable life, but we are getting into the area of ethnic cleansing, and we could go very quickly from the chronic case that has no viable life to less than perfect human beings, and we <Col N="915" /> could get into the area of wanting a perfect beautiful race.  I am nervous of getting into that area.</P>
    <P>You have to look at real life cases to really appreciate the difficulties of the question.  In my own county, about five miles from where I live, there is a woman who is expecting her eighth child.  Three years ago she was diagnosed as having breast cancer, a mastectomy was performed and she had chemotherapy and radiotherapy and the cancer seemed to be in remission.  She appealed at that stage &mdash; she is a medical card holder &mdash; for female sterilisation because of the risk of an eighth pregnancy &mdash; she has seven children under 12 years of age.  She was refused because of the ethos of our health boards.  She is now pregnant again.  What we are talking about here today is directly relevant to this case.  That woman is dying and this legislation will be too late, even under the life threatening clause, to help her.  We have to be serious about this. They are real women, they are your mothers, your wives and your daughters we are talking about.  The X case concentrated our minds and stopped us all theorising about how in an ideal world, a beautiful sin free Ireland, as someone referred to it, we would like the country to be run.  It is not an ideal world and we must face up to realities, and that is what we are trying to do here today.  I ask the Minister to please accept our amendment and remove the words &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; and let the rest take its course.</P>

The term we are talking about and the term we want to amend is the &ldquo;life of the mother.&rdquo;  That expression, &ldquo;the life of the mother&rdquo; occurs in the original Article 40.3.3º which was passed in 1983.  A few months ago the Supreme Court had the opportunity to interpret what the term &ldquo;the life of the mother&rdquo; meant.  My interpretation of what the Supreme Court said was that when they referred to &ldquo;life&rdquo; they meant biological life.  Chief Justice Finlay <Col N="916" /> went so far as to distinguish the life from the health.  In Judge Hederman's judgment you will find an expression to the effect that we must allow termination when the consequence of not allowing it is the death of the mother.  There is a similar expression in Judge Flaherty's judgment.  What the Supreme Court was talking about in interpreting the phrase &ldquo;the life of the mother&rdquo; was the biological life, exclusive of health; will she die if you do not perform the termination? We are inserting that phrase &ldquo;the life of the mother&rdquo; in the addition to Article 40.3.3º.  All sides of the House will agree that the interpretation given to that phrase by the Supreme Court in the X case would be the same interpretation which the Supreme Court would give to what is added to Article 40.4.3º because what we are doing is expanding Article 40.3.3º.  We are using the phrase &ldquo;the life of the mother&rdquo; a second time and, therefore, it would not be logical if the expression &ldquo;the life of the mother&rdquo; where it was added was given a different interpretation from &ldquo;the life of the mother&rdquo; where it appeared earlier.</P>
      <P>This debate has been a rerun of the Dáil debate.  In the Dáil debate I have to say &mdash; I do not want to bring party politics into this but I regret I have to because it is a Fine Gael amendment &mdash; there was total confusion and division in the Fine Gael approach to this matter.  Deputy Bruton the Leader of Fine Gael, agreed with my interpretation of the Supreme Court decision.  He said he felt that the Supreme Court meant &ldquo;the life of the mother&rdquo; to be the biological life of the mother, but he wanted us to take out the phrase &ldquo;as distinct from health&rdquo; because he felt it gave a wrong political signal. Deputy Shatter, on the other hand, did not agree.  He said we cannot conclude&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Let us assume that Deputy Bruton's interpretation and my interpretation is correct.  That means that &ldquo;life&rdquo; means biological life; if you take out the phrase &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; you will change nothing.  The situation will still prevail.  The life of the mother is the criterion.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the interpretation of the Supreme Court at the moment.  If you take it out, the rule of <i>stare decisis</i> where courts follow earlier decisions of superior courts on the same point does not apply to the Supreme Court and a future Supreme Court can change their mind, they can change the law.  At the moment the situation is as I have explained it; that is the present law but a future Supreme Court can change that and we are inserting this phrase to stop the possibility of that being changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What do Fine Gael want to leave in the Constitution?  They want to leave a deliberate ambiguity.  At best they do not want it changed at all; they want to take out the wording but nothing will change and, at worst, they want to write in an ambiguity, the expression &ldquo;the life of the mother&rdquo;.  We do not know exactly what it means and we do not know what interpretation the Supreme Court will give it in future.  To me that is rank political hypocrisy.  If Fine Gael are worried about the health of women and if all this hyperbole <Col N="918" /> and emotionalism have any basis in real feeling, they should have put down an amendment to that effect.  We do not want to write a deliberate ambiguity into the Constitution, something on which we do not know what attitude the Supreme Court will take in six months or six years time.  Write in what you mean, say what you mean and mean what you say.  That is my attitude and it should be the Fine Gael attitude as well.</P>
    <P>There were a number of issues raised in relation to the amendments.  One proposed to use the word &ldquo;protect&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;save&rdquo;.  Looking through dictionaries both words may be seen as synonymous, or at least very close to each other but when using the words in conjunction with the words &ldquo;the life&rdquo;, &ldquo;protect&rdquo; might be given a more flexible meaning than &ldquo;save&rdquo;.  The purpose of the Government's proposals is to reflect the decision of the Supreme Court with the difference that the risk of self-destruction would be excluded and to allow any action necessary to save the life of the mother.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party in putting forward the word &ldquo;protect&rdquo; suggested the term &ldquo;save the life&rdquo; implies restrictiveness. They claim that, where the doctors are satisfied that at some stage because of the stress of pregnancy the mother's life might be at serious risk from a heart attack, using the word &ldquo;protect&rdquo; would mean that immediate or early termination would be an option and that if &ldquo;save her life&rdquo; is used that option might not be available.</P>
    <P>I have already pointed out on a number of occasions that the Supreme Court test does not require that the risk to the life must be immediate or imminent &mdash; in fact, it rejected such a contention &mdash; and neither does the Government proposal which is based on the Supreme Court test require that the risk be immediate. Cardiac disease is one of the life threatening conditions the Government had in mind when framing this proposal.  I am satisfied that the Labour Party's fears in regard to treatment for such conditions are without foundation.  The Government are satisfied that the phrase &ldquo;save the life&rdquo; is the correct one to achieve what <Col N="919" /> they propose, that is, that a pregnant woman should have available to her all medical intervention necessary to avoid a real and substantial risk to her life.</P>
    <P>On the amendment to remove the wording &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo;, Senators have referred to the innate offensiveness of that phrase.  While I can appreciate the strength of feeling on this matter, many of the comments suggesting that the inclusion of the phrase would have adverse and unintended effects are without foundation.  It has been suggested that a line cannot be unambiguously drawn between life and health and that this will give rise to difficulties, but the Supreme Court have already drawn that line and had no difficulty in doing so.</P>
    <P>The essence of the Supreme Court judgment is that such a line must be drawn on the proper interpretation of Article 40.3.3º because that Article in its true interpretation will allow the right to life of the unborn to be superseded only where that is necessary to save the life of the mother where otherwise she might die.</P>
    <P>The Twelfth Amendment would not <Col N="920" /> make any change to the Constitution test on this point as it has been interpreted by the Supreme Court up to now but would establish that interpretation as something which could not be changed at any time in the future without the consent of the people.  All five members of the Supreme Court spoke specifically in terms of the life of the mother and in no instance was health unrelated to a risk to life contemplated as a ground.  The distinction between life and health was included in the general test laid down by the Chief Justice and it is clear that that distinction was accepted by the other judges and was inherent in what they had to say.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>At all previous referenda the Oireachtas has seen fit to enact a brief technical Bill to provide the electorate with objective factual information designed to assist them in making a rational and informed decision on the proposals dealt with at the referenda. The present measure represents a continuation of that practice.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes to assist voters at the referenda on the Twelfth, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution by making available to them a statement relating to the proposals which are the subject of the referenda and by providing for headings on the ballot papers in order to help distinguish between them.</P>
      <P>Section 1 of the Bill provides that a special polling card, containing the statement set out in the Appendix to that section, will be sent to electors generally. A copy of the statement will also be sent to each postal and special voter.  The statement will be displayed on posters in and in the precincts of polling stations. Presiding officers will be authorised to assist blind and incapacitated voters and those unable to read and write by reading out this statement to them, where necessary, and marking the ballot papers in accordance with the instructions of the voter.</P>
      <P>The statement for the information of voters is contained in the Appendix to section 1.  The statement, which is prescribed in Irish and in English, set out as clearly and concisely as possible, the proposals which are the subject of the referenda.  Quite properly, the statement does not attempt to paraphrase, summarise or interpret the proposed constitutional amendments.  It simply quotes the words which the three Constitution Bills propose to insert in the Constitution with the minimum of associated wording.</P>
      <P>The task of spelling out for the electorate the purpose of the proposed amendments and the implications of voting one way or the other will be a matter for the political parties and groups who are advocating a particular result in relation to one or all of the proposals.</P>
      <P>The arrangements proposed in section 1 are the same as those made in relation to the referendum in June of this year and, indeed, at all previous referenda.</P>
      <P>A further step to aid voters at the forthcoming referenda is proposed at section 3 of the Bill.  This section provides that a heading will be printed on each ballot paper to indicate the proposal to which the paper relates with a view to assisting voters in distinguishing betwen the separate papers.</P>
      <P>Experience has shown that where two or more polls are taken on the same day, the proportion of spoilt ballot papers tends to increase substantially.  One of the likely reasons for this is that some electors may have difficulty in distinguishing between the separate proposals. In a single nationwide poll the proportion of rejected papers is normally somewhat less than 1 per cent.  Where two or more ballot papers are involved the proportion tends to increase to 2 or 3 per cent or, on occasion, even higher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a referendum the ballot paper is, and must be, a formal document and not a particularly informative one.  The question asked is &ldquo;Do you approve of the proposal to amend the Constitution <Col N="923" /> contained in the undermentioned Bill&rdquo; and the Short Title of the Bill is then given.  Thus, where there are two or more referenda there is nothing other than the Short Title of the relevant Constitution Bill together with the colour of the paper to distinguish one ballot paper from another.</P>
    <P>On this occasion there will be three separate ballot papers.  In order to reduce the risk of a high number of spoilt papers, it is clearly desirable that a further distinguishing feature should be included on the ballot papers.  The simplest and most effective way of doing this is to include a descriptive heading on each paper which will indicate clearly which of the three separate issues a particular ballot paper relates to.  This is proposed by section 3 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The arrangement is not new.  In 1979, when two proposals to amend the Constitution were put to the people on the same day, provision was made for the inclusion of distinguishing headings on the ballot papers.  In section 3 we are following this precedent.  The provision, with the measures I have already mentioned, will help electors distinguish between the three separate proposals and will help in ensuring that the number of spoilt ballot papers will be kept to the minimum.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the headings is to distingish between the ballot papers and to provide a signpost to the subject matter to which each relates.  The headings have no significance other than as an aid to electors in distinguishing between the three papers.  The headings are not part of the proposed amendments to the Constitution; they will not be written into the Constitution; the electors will not be asked to vote on the headings or to approve or disapprove of them.  The matters on which the electorate will vote are the proposals contained in the Constitution Bills as passed by both Houses. The ballot paper headings proposed seem to me to be suitable and sensible.  They are brief, clear and relevant and will leave the elector in no doubt as to which is dealt with in each paper.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="924" /> In relation to section 2 of the Bill, I would like to explain that a statement for the information of voters could be prescribed by resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas under section 2 of the Referendum (Amendment) Act, 1992. However, since a Bill was required in any event in order to provide for the descriptive headings on the ballot papers, it was considered appropriate to deal with both questions in a single instrument. Section 2, therefore, provides that the relevant section of the Referendum (Amendment) Act, 1992, shall not apply in relation to the present referenda.</P>
    <P>I believe that this Bill will fulfil a useful function in providing the electorate with objective, factual information to assist them in making an informed decision at the referenda.  The inclusion of clear, easily understood headings or labels on the ballot papers will provide practical assistance to voters in distinguishing between the different papers.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Seanad will agree that the Bill is a worthwhile and practical measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the section <Col N="925" /> which provides for the holding of a referendum on the amendments discussed in this House over the last three days. This Bill proposes to assist voters at the referendum on the Twelfth, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution by making available detailed proposals and outlining what is envisaged on each ballot paper the electorate will receive on polling day.  I find no difficulty with two of those proposals &mdash; the pink ballot paper on information and the green ballot paper on travel &mdash; but I have great difficulty with the white ballot paper on the right to life.</P>
      <P>I understand from what has been said in this House for the last three days that we are debating effectively, the right in certain circumstances to terminate a pregnancy.  Therefore, the white ballot paper is wrongly described and does not specify what this amendment is about.  It would be more honourable to spell out clearly to the electorate the implications of that amendment.  Describing it as &ldquo;the right to life&rdquo; is not an appropriate heading for the white ballot paper.</P>
      <P>In his address I note that the Minister did not indicate if the new Electoral (No. 2) Bill will be law for the holding of this referendum, that is, if it will go through the other House and be signed by the President before 3 December.  Will the changes in the regulations in the new Electoral (No. 2) Bill become law before the referenda and, if so, will a supplementary register be provided to allow the maximum number of the electorate cast their vote on these very important changes in our Constitution?</P>
      <P>I also regret that the Government did not take this opportunity to have a Sunday poll.  At this time of year many young people from rural Ireland are attending colleges all over the country and will not have the opportunity to cast their vote on polling day because it will be too difficult for them to commute from the cities to the rural areas where they are registered for voting.  The Government missed a great opportunity to hold these referenda on a Saturday or Sunday which would have enabled thousands of young people to vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="926" /> I feel strongly about the heading on the white ballot paper and Senator Neville and I have tabled an amendment to that effect which we hope to have an opportunity to deal with.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that we agreed to restrict our contributions to five minutes each. I note the comments made by Senator Murphy and I know Senator Jackman and a number of other Senators wish to speak.  It is unfortunate that the heading on the white paper should read &ldquo;the right to life&rdquo;; the whole purpose of this referendum is the right to terminate a pregnancy and that is what people are voting on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>In making arrangements for the holding of a poll &mdash; I am anticipating my Labour Party colleagues on this &mdash; it is relevant to consider the possibilities of undue interference with voters and so on.  I am convinced that the practice which some groups intend to continue of picketing the houses of legislators to object to their stances on this issue is reprehensible and cannot be construed as anything other than intimidatory. No words are strong enough to condemn these fascist tactics.</P>
      <P>Every legislator has a duty to make up his or her mind on this grave and complex issue and their position on the matter should be respected.  It is absolutely reprehensible that they should be intimidated in any way.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Naughten I am dissatisfied with the way in which it is proposed to distinguish the various ballot papers in these referenda.  The Minister rather disingenuously said that there would merely be a few words to indicate the proposal to which the paper relates; a descriptive heading, as if this were neutral.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that this is far from being the case.  We all know that Article 40.3.3º, as it exists, is the pro-life amendment. That is what it was in 1983.  Therefore, what is being put in now in the white ballot paper is a modification of that pro-life amendment.  Senator Naughten would wish that modification to be recognised by calling a spade a half spade <Col N="927" /> and saying &ldquo;termination of pregnancy&rdquo; should be the descriptive title.  I have no hesitation in calling for the use of a full spade and saying that the white ballot paper should be tiled &ldquo;abortion&rdquo; because that is what it is.  It proposes to introduce a measure of abortion into the Constitution and that is what should be told to the people instead of deliberately misleading them by pretending that they are voting for some additional dimension of right to life.</P>
    <P>I am against the con job of &ldquo;pro-life&rdquo; as a description and the euphemism of &ldquo;termination&rdquo; as a description.  Indeed, if we were honest we should probably call the green ballot paper on the issue of travel &ldquo;abortion abroad&rdquo; as a short description.  I find this a further exercise in revolting hypocrisy and if the time permits we shall certainly force a division on this one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Senator Murphy said about the absolutely appalling and disgraceful intimidation which Members of the other House were subjected to by way of pickets on their homes.  That is truly appalling.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Bill before us today, most of it is pretty harmless and straightforward with the exception of the term which is going to be used as a heading on the white ballot paper, namely, the right to life.  The pro-life amendment is a pejorative term which has subliminal connotations.  It is a term which is being used by way of political campaigns in this country.  I wonder whether it is constitutional to use such a term on a ballot paper.  Such influences should not be introduced.  It is particularly regrettable that we are unable to call what is being put before the people by is proper name, and that is making abortion available in this country on limited grounds.  That is what is happening and we might as well face up to what we are talking about and call it by its proper name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those pejorative terms which have subliminal implications are quite unfair and would be unacceptable if they were used in opinion polls.  I see no reason for <Col N="928" /> their introduction here except as a kind of sop or some type of subliminal gesture to the pro-life and SPUC elements in this country who exercised themselves fairly well politically in the 1983 referendum. We have to wait and see what will happen on this one.  As far as those people are concerned, that type of sop will not do a lot to appease them.  It is a pity and regrettable that type of terminology should be introduced in what should be a neutral heading on the white ballot paper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I find also it offensive to use that term.  I find extraordinary that in the amendment the word &ldquo;terminate&rdquo; occurs twice as in &ldquo;terminate the life of the unborn unless such termination is necessary&rdquo;.  Here you have two words that clearly state what this amendment is about but on the opposite page we have the &ldquo;right to life&rdquo;.  It reminds me &mdash; and Senator Upton put it correctly &mdash; of an unprofessional survey tactic where by putting that question you are more or less saying to the voter, &ldquo;if you vote &lsquo;no&rsquo; you are voting no to the right of life, therefore you are not pro-life&rdquo;.  I find it extremely distasteful and hypocritical.  We are back again to the notion of something by another name.  It is, as I said yesterday, a Fianna Fáil solution to an Irish problem. I would much prefer to see the words, &ldquo;termination of pregnancy&rdquo;, used.  Let it be specific and let us go to the electorate with a clear, specific white ballot paper with the words &ldquo;termination of pregnancy&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is totally incorrect to say that young people are running in their thousands to avail of abortion services abroad and are only waiting to have the opportunity to do so.  If it were a question of being sensitive to the needs of our young electorate, the date, December 3, means that most of our young people, the 40 per cent who are in third level institutions, will not be in a position to vote for something that will affect their lives in the future.  I find it extraordinary that the date of the referendum was not set to accommodate our young people whom we are protecting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="929" /> As I said, the &ldquo;right to life&rdquo; certainly is not in keeping with what I would want on that ballot paper on the day.  It should be, as the amendment states, &ldquo;termination of pregnancy&rdquo;.  Let us call a spade a spade, and I do not agree with Senator Murphy that it is a half spade.  &ldquo;Termination&rdquo; is the term that is used.

      <P>Prior to Senator Norris coming into the House there was general agreement that each speaker would speak for five minutes.  I cannot prevent you from speaking for ten mintues because that is what was agreed on the Order of Business but there was general agreement on five minutes.</P>

      <P>Very wise.  I will do my best to restrain myself.  I agree with Senator Jackman.  There seems to be an extraordinary notion in Government circles that abortion is an obscure form of pleasure and if women are not prevented from having an abortion they will do their best to queue up and have one.  I cannot understand that attitude.  Abortion is always a sad and tragic situation.</P>
      <P>It must be recognised, and I welcome the fact that Senator Ó Cuív put it unequivocally on the record of the House, that abortion has always existed in Ireland and that terminations have been performed.  With regard to the right to life amendment, this is obviously a deplorably dishonest sleight of hand.  It may also be a neat piece of political footwork but I wonder if honest Albert cast his eye over that.  His standards of integrity which we learned yesterday are so extraordinary high that it seems unlikely he could possibly have consented to that nasty form of deceit.</P>

      <P>I understand at the moment that the Taoiseach is Albert Reynolds but may not last for very much longer.  It is first of all a tag which has a <Col N="930" /> clear political association.  There is no question about that.  It is also an abuse of language and it certainly does not fit the facts in this case.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to the X case.  As I understand it, if Miss X were in the same situation after the passage of this Bill she would not be in a position to have an abortion.  Despite the fact that the Supreme Court determined that the risk of suicide was so sufficiently grave and substantive &mdash; to use one of the other buzz words &mdash; as to pose a real risk to her life and, therefore, she should be permitted to have an abortion, the impact of this legislation would be to ensure that she would actually have had to commit suicide in order to demonstrate that there was a right to a termination of her pregnancy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the question of the right to life, and I am demonstrating that this has nothing whatever to do with the right to life.  In fact, the proposals are inimical to the life of a citizen of this State who has had recourse to the Supreme Court.  I think we should be able to follow that.  I find it quite extraordinary that the Minister should feel comfortable with entitling something the &ldquo;right to life&rdquo; when it is a situation in which in some, admittedly statistically remote, circumstances the right to life of the mother is not being protected. Despite the Supreme Court decision that the threat of suicide was a real and potent one, it is not allowed as a grounds for termination of pregnancy.  That clearly relates to the question of the right to life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said the international literature concerning suicide in pregnancy is very complex and needs careful and objective analysis.  Then he sets himself up as God.  He is prepared to decide whether there is a threat to the life of a mother in terms of suicide despite the fact that various authorities &mdash; the Psychological Society of Ireland and the Supreme Court &mdash; determined there was <Col N="931" /> a risk to life.  He said on several occasions that it is the intention of the legislation to protect the woman from any risk to her life however remote, and if there were only to be one case in a million or ten or more million they would take account of it.  They are not doing that. The Government are clearly setting their face against it.</P>

      <P>As regards the three ballot papers with which there seems to be some trouble, and some of my colleagues seem to think there is some kind of Fianna Fáil waffling, I was in the <Col N="932" /> House for most of the contributions made in the last three days; I rarely left the House.  Senator Brendan Ryan is supporting two of these Bills but not the third, the one we are now dealing with.  He is recommending that the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments be carried but not the Twelfth Amendment.  That is an example of democracy at its best, which is not unusual in Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I think we should clear up any confusion.  We have had a calm debate in this House, which in fairness is usual for the Seanad &mdash; except when one Senator is not lecturing.</P>
      <P>I recommend that the people vote on the three amendments bearing in mind the alternative to voting against the Twelfth Amendment.  I have already said that I do not like the alternative.  I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>Senator Naughten referred to the supplementary register.  As he knows, electoral reform has not been dealt with by successive Governments since 1963.  I am happy to say that we have a Bill which will be going through Committee Stage in the Dáil next week which will bring about major reforms.  For the first time it will be possible within 12 days of an election to provide a supplementary register so that people who are not included through errors in the system will have the opportunity to vote.  In the past many of us were unable to explain why the name of somebody who had voted for 25 or 30 years was omitted from the register.  We have rectified that. However, within the time available it will not be possible to pass the Bill through the Dáil in time for the forthcoming referendum; most people accept that.  As the general election will probably take place towards the middle of 1994 &mdash; it will not be our fault if the Governemnt go earlier&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With regard to the argument and the disagreement about the heading on the ballot paper and the description &ldquo;the right to life&rdquo;, it is a pity Senators underestimate this description. We are not saying it is perfect; it is a way to enable the voter to distinguish between three ballot papers.  It takes on board the words that have been used since the early eighties.</P>
      <P>I do not want to play second fiddle to anybody, and I know most Members do not play second fiddle to anybody, in our desire to protect life.  In the context in which were are talking here, it is legitimate to use that heading because we are spelling out the circumstances where it is unlawful to terminate a pregnancy.</P>
      <P>The words &ldquo;right to life&rdquo; are used three times in Article 40.3.3º; &ldquo;life&rdquo; is used more than once in the amendment and the words suggested do not seem to fit the Bill as neatly as our proposal.  It is not a question of influencing voters; it is a question of helping people to distinguish between three ballot papers.  I hope Senators will accept that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(e) a person shall not interfere with or obstruct or impede an elector <Col N="934" /> going to or coming from or in the vicinity of or in a polling station;</P>
    <P>(f) during the period commencing 30 minutes before the time appointed for the taking of a poll at a referendum to which this section applies and ending 30 minutes after the close of the said poll, a person shall not, in or in the curtilage of a polling station or in any place within 50 metres of such station, for the purposes of promoting the interest of a political party or soliciting votes for a purpose relating to the Referendum, do any or all of the following things:</P>
    <P>(i)  loiter or congregate with other persons;</P>
    <P>(ii)  attempt to induce, by any means whatsoever, an elector to vote in a particular way or refrain from voting;</P>
    <P>(iii)  display or distribute any notice, sign or poster (other than a notice, sign or poster displayed by the returning officer) or card, circular or other document relating to the referendum; or</P>
    <P>(iv)  use or cause to be used any loud-speaker or other public address mechanism to broadcast matter relating to the referendum;</P>
    <P>(g) a person who contravenes paragraphs (e) or (f) shall be guilty of an offence;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Basically this is an amendment to stop anybody interfering, obstructing and impeding people on their way in and out of polling stations and in the vicinity of the polling station.  Effectively it is to stop people being intimidated on their way to and from polling stations.  It is a fairly straightforward, self-explanatory amendment to which I imagine the Minister should be able to agree.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment but I assure the House that I have the agreement of the Whips to complete all <Col N="935" /> Stages of the Electoral (No. 2) Bill by 12.30 p.m. next Thursday in the Dáil. It will enable me to bring into force a provision in that Bill which provides for the same type of situation as is proposed here.  The only difference is we still have not agreed or whether it will be 50 metres or more from the curtilage of the polling station.  I may have to come back to the Seanad with minor amendments but my response would be do not pursue it here, you will be accommodated in so far as one can be sure at this stage on the commitments I received in the Dáil that the provisions of the Electoral Bill, which deals with this aspect, will be in force by 3 December.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. The inclusion of &ldquo;right to life&rdquo; as a heading on the white ballot paper is misleading regarding the substantive issue of the Bill.  Our proposal that it be changed to &ldquo;termination of pregnancy&rdquo; reflects what is in the Bill.  The inclusion of the right to life is an attempt to influence voters in how they look at it.  The correct and honest way of putting it to the people is to head it &ldquo;termination of pregnancy&rdquo;. To do anything else is to try to use an unfair and deceptive title and is an effort to latch on to what has become a slogan in the whole debate over the past ten years.  It is a more honest, straightforward and fair description of what is contained in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I was not sure whether Senator Murphy had put his views on the matter.  I am very happy to second this.  I am rather intrigued by the three different amendments here because they seem to be on a sliding scale of reality.  Rather curiously, it looks as if the Labour Party is at the remote end of it in talking about the substantive issue.  There is a curious coyness about that.  There is more reality in &ldquo;termination of pregnancy&rdquo; but Senator Murphy and I are actually facing the issue and using the word &ldquo;abortion&rdquo;.

      <P>In the popular media the question is called the substantive issue. That is the basic reason we use that term. I do not have any problem with any of the other terms.  It is really a matter of emphasis.  I see very little difference between them but the reason we put forward the &ldquo;substantive issue&rdquo; as a term is simply because that is what it is called. That is how they are distinguished one from the other and that is how we perceive the public as being aware of what is involved.  I do not have any problem with any of the terms.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>If we take Article 40.3.3º, there is an equal right to life for the mother and the unborn and it seeks to vindicate that right as far as is practicable. We envisage circumstances where there is a conflict between these two &mdash; that goes back for centuries &mdash; which medical ethics consistently could deal with.  The circumstances are that where there is a substantial risk to the mother's life a superior right to life is prescribed for the mother.  I do not know why Senators have such difficulty with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not a question of who is absolutely right or who has all knowledge as to what is perfect.  This is a way for people to distinguish between three ballot papers. It is not a question of whether you agree with propaganda or how this matter has grown over the past ten years.  The assistance we are giving by way of the description on top of the white ballot paper on the Twelfth Amendment will be such that everybody casting their vote will know the issue.  I have emphasised time and again that when we have more than one ballot paper the incidence of spoilt papers <Col N="938" /> can increase between 1 per cent and 5 per cent and that is unquestionably a reason for concern.</P>
    <P>We are not making a choice for anybody. It is a free democratic country. We are just assisting voters.  For the vast majority of voters it would not make any difference if there were no description. Opposition Senators seem to be suggesting that there are many people who will not be able to make up their minds on how to vote.  We are trying to help those people who tend to have difficulty with a number of ballot papers.  It is no more and no less.</P>

    <P>May I say, quite seriously, that the use of the heading &ldquo;right to life&rdquo; is an attempt, in my opinion, to intimidate people.  I do not think you have to be a <Col N="939" /> trained psychologist to realise that there is a psychological disincentive for people to vote against something entitled the &ldquo;right to life&rdquo; because you are then suggesting that they are against life in so doing.  That is why we are so insistent, on this side, that there should be an honest, or at least a neutral title.  This title suggests that people who vote against it are anti-life.</P>

    <P>I am pleased to confirm that I recently gave approval for investment by CIE of £18 million in new railcars. <Col N="941" /> This investment will enable Iarnród Éireann to improve the range of its suburban commuter rail services in the Dublin and Cork areas and will also facilitate improvements in due course in the Bray-Greystones service.</P>
    <P>I want to know if that commitment is still valid, if the Government are committed to an improvement in the Bray and particularly the Greystones service and when the Minister foresees such an improvement?  That was a firm commitment given to a member of another party in the Dáil two years ago.  There have been no signs that that £18 million commitment has been followed through by the present Administration.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that we are discussing this matter on the Adjournment today, the day after the Dublin Transport Initiative reported.  I do not mind whether Greystones is provided with a shuttle or a DART service, but what it needs is a good, modern, up-to-date transport service.  What it also needs is speedy action now.  The Dublin Transport Initiative recommended quite specifically in the report which was issued yesterday that the DART should be extended to Greystones for good infrastructural reasons.  It recommended that this should be done by EC funds.  That is a recommendation which, presumably, the Government will take note of and I hope act upon.</P>
    <P>What worries me more than anything else is the speed of the action following this report.  Obviously, this report which is simply a preliminary recommendation has to go to a steering committee, which has to get Government approval and then the approval of the EC.  What we are, unfortunately, talking about is an arduous process which will take far longer than the delay we have already had to put up with in Greystones, where the people have really got a very raw deal on the transport issue.</P>
    <P>Greystones has been totally neglected with regard to transport.  I raised this <Col N="942" /> matter a year ago in this House and failed to get a commitment.  In Greystones there have been public meetings and public marches to Leinster House on the matter.  There have been meetings on the issue with the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, with spokespeople of all parties and with various other bodies, including Iarnród Éireann.</P>
    <P>The pressure is building up.  Greystones is a town with a population of 11,000, and a projected population of at least 20,000.  The county council is preparing an infrastructure which will facilitate at least 20,000 people, but there appear to be absolutely no transport plans to facilitate these 20,000 or even the 11,000 who are there now.  Plans must be made and commitments must be given because the service at the moment is inadequate.  The town is growing; it is a commuter town where the majority of the working population travel to and from Dublin every day.</P>
    <P>One of the great tragedies of which the Minister will undoubtedly be aware was that the shuttle service, which worked very well for many people in Greystones was withdrawn in November 1990 on what was described by the Minister as a temporary basis.  We know that the word &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; is very flexible in Government parlance, in terms of its partners, financial commitments and financial projections. A &ldquo;temporary basis&rdquo; appears to have extended over two years with no clarification of what that &ldquo;temporary basis&rdquo; is.  There is, as undoubtedly the Minister knows, a bus service to Greystones but it too is inadequate.  In the mornings, people have to wait 40 to 50 minutes for buses which regularly break down on the hill between Greystones and Bray; the buses are overcrowded and pass many would-be passengers on the road between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m.  That is the extent and the depth of the problem.</P>
    <P>The Arklow to Dublin train stops at Greystones at 7.50 a.m.  It is very overcrowded and extraordinarily uncomfortable <Col N="943" /> for the commuters &mdash; people leave their cars in Bray and catch the DART rather than travel on the existing transport which is extremely uncomfortable and unreliable.  That is the only train provided during the morning rush and there is only one train going to Greystones during the evening rush.</P>
    <P>Greystones is discriminated again in comparison with towns like Maynooth on the other side of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Let me give an example of how completely inadequate the service is and the farcical level to which the neglect of Greystones has sunk.  The train from Greystones to Dublin now takes 53 minutes, at that time of day.  In 1955, a train, on the same journey, took 35 minutes.  With modern technology and speed, with advances in transportation, the train from this town, which is close to Dublin, is taking 20 minutes longer.</P>
    <P>The service is totally in adequate, the cost of either restoring a shuttle, which is my personal preference, or introducing the DART, would be £5 million to £6 million.  However, I see no movement on behalf of the Government on this issue despite the fact that an independent body has recommended that it is absolutely essential.</P>
    <P>The result of the lobbying of the political parties by the people of Greystones resulted in an examination of this issue by the Transport spokesman of the Fine Gael Party at the time, Deputy Yates, who have given a firm and unequivocal commitment that Fine Gael in a future Administration will restore the shuttle to Greystones even if the funds are not there to introduce the DART.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister today to give me an assurance that he recognises the seriousness of this problem, and how Greystones is discriminated against; that he will fulfil the commitment given in the Dáil in 1990 and insist that Iarnród Éireann provide railcars with the £18 million, or he will give a solemn commitment <Col N="944" /> that the recommendations of the DTI in regard to Greystones, which involve introducing adequate transport facilities to solve the problem, will be acted upon immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>At present Iarnród Éireann provide outer suburban rail services through Greystones as part of the Greater Dublin rail network.  Greystones is also served via the mainline rail service between Rosslare Harbour and Connolly Station, which serves Greystones three times daily.  In addition, shuttle bus services, provided by Dublin Bus, operate between Bray and Greystones to link rail commuters into the DART network.</P>
      <P>In relation to the future development of rail commuter services, Iarnród Éireann has placed a contract for 17 new railcars to be operated on the commuter network.  The new equipment is expected to be delivered early in 1994 and brought into operational service shortly thereafter. The new railcars will allow the company to significantly upgrade the quality of rolling stock on the commuter rail network.  While the company has not yet made any decisions as to the particular routes on which this new rolling stock will be deployed, the chairman of CIE has assured me that representations on behalf of the Greystones residents will be fully taken into account when this matter is being considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, my colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, met a deputation from Greystones Rail Action Committee earlier this year to hear at first hand their views on the need for improved public transport services in the area.  During the meeting, the Minister indicated that a detailed submission which had been prepared by the group on the public transport problems of Greystones had been forwarded to the Dublin Transportation Initiative (DTI) for consideration by the consultants Steer Davies Gleave.  Phase 2 of the DTI is now <Col N="945" /> almost completed and I am pleased to say that in the draft interim report which has been circulated to the DTI Steering Committee, the local authority committee and the consultative panel for consideration, the extension of DART to Greystones is envisaged.</P>
    <P>The DTI report will, of course, form an integral part of the input into negotiations on EC Structural Funds for the period after 1993.  The draft report provides an integrated transportation strategy involving significant roads development, major public transport investments and the introduction of strengthened traffic management measures.  On the public transport side, the draft report contains radical proposals for enhanced commuter transport services, including bus and light rail options, extended DART and upgraded rail commuter services to resolve the traffic congestion problems of the greater Dublin area, including Greystones.</P>
    <P>However, I must again emphasise that having regard to the state of the public finances, the availability of EC funding will be crucially important to the early implementation of the main recommendations of the DTI.  In this context, the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications has already indicated, on several occasions, that she intends to vigorously pursue the possibilities of EC funding for this purpose and, of course, I will be co-ordinating with her in the months ahead to maximise the level of EC funding for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out that Exchequer support for public transport as a whole has been very significant over the years.  For example, since 1980, total direct Exchequer support for the provision of essential public transport services has amounted to over £1.2 billion. In the case of Bus Átha Cliath, the recently published CIE Annual Report for 1991 shows that the company made a surplus of £4.689 million after payment of a State grant of £14.215 million.  The allocation of the overall Exchequer subvention <Col N="946" /> between the operating subsidiaries of the group is a matter for the board of CIE.</P>
    <P>Bus Átha Cliath is very conscious of the need to improve the quality and range of its services.  At present, the company is engaged in a major review of its network with a view to further improving its services to its customers.  In addition, improved training for staff in customer relations and better enforcement of bus by-laws is helping to further improve the attractiveness of its services.</P>
    <P>In the case of Greystones, Bus Átha Cliath is satisfied that the range of its existing services operated by the company on routes 84, 84A and 85 are adequate to cater for the current levels of demand in the area.  The routing of services and the type of buses used on particular routes are, of course, matters arising within the day to day administration of the company.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications is at present reviewing proposals for new legislation to facilitate greter competition in the provision of bus services generally. One of the main objectives of the proposed legislation to liberalise the bus industry will be to improve the levels and quality of bus services available to the general public, including local services in areas such as Greystones, and to introduce competition into the bus industry on a sensible and orderly basis.  The issues involved are complex and liaison arrangements between her Department and the various interested parties have been put in place to elicit the widest range of views in relation to the future development of competition within the industry.  It is expected that this review will be completed shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply was very constructive and as far as he could go at the moment.  I would like to ask that the Greystones area be given as a high priority as possible when the funds are available for distribution for the <Col N="947" /> improvement of the greater Dublin transport system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already outlined the position.  Senator Ross can be assured that every effort will be made by the Minister to improve these services.  As he knows, the DTI is a new way of trying to link all of the interests together.  There is more emphasis on public transport, greater consultation with the public and some drastic changes in our own attitudes <Col N="948" /> to the way we use motor cars.  However, I take the point that there are problems. If the Fine Gael front bench are getting into the league of making promises at this early stage, from a number of the papers I have read by the Senator with regard to economics and public expenditure, I should not go down exactly the same road.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.35 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 4 November 1992.</P>
