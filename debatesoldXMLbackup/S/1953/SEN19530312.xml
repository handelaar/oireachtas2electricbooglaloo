    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want, at the outset, to make my position clear in this matter. I am not objecting to the Order in the full sense and I want it to be clearly understood that what I am objecting to is not what the Order contains but what the Order does not contain.  I would like the Minister and the members of this House to bear <Col N="640" /> with me for a few moments while I explain more fully my position.  They will realise that the members of the Dublin County Council and, for that matter, the people of County Dublin, have a distinct grievance because of certain matters that are not contained in this Order.</P>
      <P>Here is an idea of the position.  The Dublin Corporation have made a demand for 11,000 acres of land in County Dublin and, of course, the county council objected to that.  Following this the demand was modified to 6,000 odd acres, and as the county council did not want to stand in the way of the people needing housing accommodation and did not want to be the cause of holding up building, they decided that the best thing they could do was to come to an understanding with the corporation in connection with the whole scheme.  They did not object at the inquiry nor raise objections which they could have raised nor employ any legal aid and allowed the scheme to go through.</P>
      <P>Previous to that they had met both the members of the Dublin Corporation and its officials and had come to a very genuine understanding and a pretty reasonable understanding.  At that time the county council also made some six demands on the Dublin Corporation, the first being to secure a kind of assurance that this would be the last time that the corporation would encroach upon rural Dublin.  On that point, we secured no guarantee. I do not intend to raise that question now, but the county council got no guarantee or assurance that this would be the last time they would acquire land in County Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were other matters upon which the Dublin County Council felt that they were entitled to make claims and upon which we did receive certain guarantees from the corporation.  I am sorry that none of these guarantees is contained in the Order.  One of these is well thought of but not quite as clear as I would like in meaning. First and foremost, I want the Minister and Senators to realise that there is a great injustice being committed against ratepayers and, to explain that, I want to tell you that none of the portions of County Dublin now <Col N="641" /> being acquired by the Dublin Corporation&mdash;Coolock, Finglas, Baldoyle&mdash;has any water or sewerage facilities.</P>
    <P>For the last 20 years engineers in the water and road section of the Dublin County Council have given all their time to the development of these areas and to seeing that they possessed what the county council felt they ought to possess, proper facilities in regard to water and sewerage.  In doing that all the ratepayers of County Dublin have contributed to the initial cost. The farmers of Garristown and Oldtown have never got any benefit from water or sewerage schemes, though they made their contributions to the cost and, in addition, have paid the loan charges since that date.</P>
    <P>We in the Dublin County Council felt that to be unfair.  All these areas have been practically completely developed and in Coolock, for example, there are about 4,000 private houses, taking a conservative figure, while in Finglas there are 12 factories alone.  In other words, these developed areas which the county council spent so much time and money in bringing to their present stage have now become valuable assets to the community of County Dublin.</P>
    <P>The people who did contribute to the cost and who lived in the rural areas of the county had at least this much satisfaction, that because of the vastly increased valuation it would mean that their rates, which we in the Dublin County Council have always striven to keep at a reasonable level, lowered, but now after all this time, money and hard work has been expended and when the areas are thus developed the corporation comes calmly along and takes these portions of County Dublin from the people of the county.</P>
    <P>The county council considers that there were certain portions of virgin soil which, if the corporation wanted them for house building purposes, they could take over and on that understanding with the corporation the Dublin County Council made a demand that the corporation would pay to the council 20 times the cost, but the result is that the corporation are about to take 20 per cent. of the council's valuation away.  I would ask the House further to realise that the valuations <Col N="642" /> that the corporation are taking away are additional valuations, because all the works are new and there will be no outlay on them.  They are new roads, new sewers, new tanks, et cetera.  In other words the works were completed quite recently and are valuable assets.</P>
    <P>We felt that our demand of 20 times the added burden or loss was reasonable, but the corporation and the officials whom we met felt that all our demands were reasonable except 20 times the burden or loss which, they said, was too much.  They agreed that they would repay to the county council on a basis of 15 times, and that agreement was made very clear.  In other words, there would be 15 annual payments made to the county council for the loss of revenue and, speaking personally&mdash;and I am expressing the views of the members of the county council&mdash;we felt that while there is a very strong reference in the Order to these matters, it is not in the same manner as would guarantee the position for the future.</P>
    <P>The Order says that the corporation and the county council may from time to time and, if occasion requires, make by amicable agreement an equitable adjustment, and I hope that that time is now and I suggest that the agreement should be made now.  We have no guarantee that you will have the same officials in the corporation with an understanding of the position in the future or that you will have the same city manager or the same officials in the Department of Local Government who will understand the position at some future date.  That was my reason for objecting to taking this measure yesterday so that I could have it recorded in this House for the benefit of everybody concerned and ensure that they understood the position.</P>
    <P>If some corporation officials or some local government officials or, indeed, some other Minister was there at another time&mdash;someone who does not quite understand the position as it is &mdash;it is quite possible that an injustice could be done to the county council. Unfortunately, in the Order as it stands there is no guarantee as to the <Col N="643" /> future and what it would be when the Order becomes law.</P>
    <P>Another point to which I wish to direct attention is that we have arrangements in the county council whereby cottage tenants can purchase their cottages in the County Dublin whenever they feel like it.  We asked that that would be embodied in the Order and the corporation agreed to that course, but we now find that it is not in the Order.  That leaves the position that after 12 months of this Order the tenants of these cottages in County Dublin could be deprived of their rights to purchase their cottages unless we have some further legislation brought forward to protect their interests.</P>
    <P>Another point on which the county council came to an understanding was that in the County Dublin the housing position was nearly completed.  Within the last few years the housing position has advanced so much that the number of people still requiring to be housed in the County Dublin is very small.  In this added area the corporation have now secured a site which was in the possession of the county council for the last seven years and on which they had already erected 120 houses. Plans have been lodged for a further 40 houses on that site, which is the council's own property, and had these 40 houses been built that would have ended the housing problem in the county so far as North County Dublin was concerned.  That was at least as far as that part of the north county bordering on the framework of Dublin was concerned.  There may be a small number of people still waiting to be housed in isolated areas around the borders of Meath, but for the majority of the county's area the housing programme had been almost completed.</P>
    <P>Within the area now being taken over by the corporation an injustice could be done in so far as people who have lived all their lives in that area and had inspected the sites on which their homes were to be built will now find that because the area has been taken over into the city they will have to take their place in the queue for the allocation of houses by the corporation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="644" /> Under the present system whereby the corporation selects their tenants for houses it would mean that these people who were due to get houses shortly might have to take their place with 10,000 or 15,000 others on the waiting lists of the corporation, and in those circumstances they could see no hope in their lifetime of having a home of their own.  That was a matter which required urgent consideration.</P>
    <P>The county council put that point up to the corporation and they saw the point and were very sympathetic, but there is not one word of that in the Order, not even a mention that any preference in any shape or form will be given to applicants from County Dublin.  In other words, they have to take their place in that queue which, unfortunately, is very long in the county yet.  Dublin County Council thought there would at least be some arrangement made by the Order that when the corporation built houses on that particular land these people would, perhaps, be given first consideration. I feel that that is not a big demand or that it is not unreasonable. The council are only trying to look after the interests of their own constituents.</P>
    <P>There was another point on which the corporation came to an agreement with us, in connection with the development of Portmarnock-Malahide.  As everybody is aware, the Portmarnock-Malahide area is the outlet in summer time for the residents of this city.  It is not the County Dublin people who use it; it is the residents of the city. In the agreement reached with the corporation, they did agree also to make a contribution.  Consider Minute 5 of the agreement which was come to:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The council require that the corporation should contribute two-thirds of the capital cost of agreed development works at the seaside resorts of Portmarnock and Malahide.</P>
    <P>The county engineer has prepared an outlined development plan for Portmarnock.  The cost of the works contemplated is roughly estimated at £40,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This plan is now available.  This was <Col N="645" /> the joint decision of the county council and the corporation representatives:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Subject to joint law agent's advice, the corporation agrees on the need for and the principle of a contribution by the corporation to any agreed works.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is not a word of that in the Order.  There are other points of course, small points, on which agreement was not reached.  But the main point is not whether the corporation are going to give a grant towards Portmarnock-Malahide development or will go further into the county later on. What we in the council are concerned about at the present time at least is the agreement in connection with the &ldquo;15 times&rdquo; clause.  Of course, I would like to say that there was a letter from the Minister in connection with that, in which his outlook is apparently sympathetic and that is more or less a safeguard.  But here is the point in the agreement between the council and the corporation representatives:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The council require that the financial adjustment in respect of increase of burden should be 20 times the agreed annual increase. Adjustments under other heads to be on accepted principles.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an exact copy of an agreement signed, on the one hand, by James Dooge, Chairman of the Dublin County Council's Special Committee, and, on the other hand, by Robert Briscoe, Chairman of Dublin City Council Special Committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, yes.  Here was the decision of these representatives on that point:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Corporation Committee will recommend Council of Corporation not to oppose an application to Minister to extend annual payments of agreed or final amount to a maximum of 15 years.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is as clear as it could be, but the Order makes it so cursed complicated that a staff would have to work <Col N="646" /> the whole year round for the entire 15 years to make out what method of agreement could be reached under it at all.  As the arrangements stood, the thing was easily understood, and did not need this further arrangement at all.  Fifteen times just represented the loss as taken over.  It would be quite a different thing for Dublin County Council if there was a question that, with 17 to 20 per cent. of their assets taken away, their staffs were also taken away and that the farming community and the people still resident in County Dublin were going to gain.  But the county council would have to maintain the staff of the county medical officer of health and of the engineers and so on.  As a matter of fact, I can see no prospect&mdash;except road men are kept in the vicinity&mdash;that ratepayers will be relieved to any extent at all.  On the other hand, because of the very fact that for the last 15 years the principal officials of Dublin County Council have spent all or the greater portion of their time on the development of that portion of County Dublin now being acquired, I feel that some reasonable compensation should be made in return.  That is my point of view and the viewpoint of the Dublin County Council.</P>
    <P>The council has not decided to oppose it or to lodge a petition, but as a member of this House I feel that, even if I had nothing to do with the council at all, I should, in all honesty, raise the question on behalf of the remaining people of the county.  I make a very special appeal on this point to the Minister.  I understand there are some legal difficulties, but I appeal to him as a rural man to see that at least by his words there will be recorded in this House some future protection for those people.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, a lot of other minor things.  There are acres of land involved, and people in those areas are going to lose their agricultural and horticultural instructors, but the corporation would not even contribute a little towards that.  I appeal to the Minister in all earnestness, in view of all the circumstances relating to the position, that if the Order itself cannot be amended, he will at least amend it <Col N="647" /> by saying in so many words what he has in mind so that future officials in both the city and the county will understand in no uncertain manner where they stand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I confess that until Senator Tunney spoke, I had not realised some of the implications of this Bill.  I think there are two sections among us who must scrutinise a Bill of this kind with great care.  First, the ratepayers of County Dublin&mdash;I happen to be one myself.  The ratepayers may well ask if they are not losing a very great deal by this Bill. The second section is composed of those who view the rapid&mdash;I would almost say monstrous&mdash;extension of the city with grave misapprehension.  It is becoming very like the great wen, as London was described, I think in the 18th century.  Every step towards extending the boundaries of this city is an encouragement to make it grow beyond its powers, to make this, the ancient City of Dublin, become one of those amorphous megalocephalics we read about in the books of Louis Mumford.  These overgrown cities bring the most terrible problems of administration and justice in time.  I do not intend to elaborate on that theme, but I feel very strongly that Dublin City has reached a stage where it is going to lose its soul if it continues to grow at the present rate.</P>
      <P>I now speak on a more practical basis, as a ratepayer of County Dublin. I would like an assurance from the Minister, or from the proposer of this Bill, that the compensation is adequate, that those who have lost the right to buy their cottages will have something done for them; and, thirdly, that something will be done for those who will lose their place in the queue for getting houses.</P>
      <P>I was greatly impressed by what Senator Tunney said about the housing situation in County Dublin and in the city.  It does seem very hard that certain families may, by this Act of Parliament, lose for life the chance of getting a home, a chance which was virtually secure to them until this Bill was proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not intend to oppose the Bill, <Col N="648" /> since Senator Tunney has not given any lead in that direction, but I have been greatly impressed by the points he made, and would like to have a reassurance on them from some other member of the House or from the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not familiar with the procedure here for handling a Bill of this kind.  I had an explanatory Second Stage statement which I might have read if it had not been for the contribution from Senator Tunney, which takes us a step further.  As I see it, the procedure by which the corporation set about having its area extended is settled by the Local Government Act of 1930.  Following the move by the corporation to have its area extended, an inquiry was held. The corporation had sought to have its area increased by about 11,000 acres.  The two local authorities concerned, Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council, sat down to discuss the whole question.  As a result, they reached agreement on a number of points.  For example, they agreed on the advisability of the extension and they agreed that the area to be ceded to the Dublin Corporation would be in the neighbourhood of 6,000 acres. Following the inquiry, the matter came before me as Minister.  I approved and made on Order giving effect to the inclusion within the city boundary of the areas specified.  A Bill to confirm that Order is necessary and we are here now discussing the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The complaint made by Senator Tunney, who is a member of the county council, is that this Order of mine does not make reference to all the matters on which the two bodies concerned had arrived at agreement. When the Order was made, the county council&mdash;as a result of legal advice, I suppose&mdash;proceeded to question why the Order did not cover all the matters to which the Senator has referred.  We gave to the council, as I am giving now to the Seanad, an assurance that the Order included everything that such an Order could, or should, include and that any matters outside it on which agreement had been reached would be given effect to under the <Col N="649" /> Local Government Act of 1930.  That being the case, I do not think there is any justification at all for any of the fears which Senator Tunney has expressed. I do not know if he has cited all the eight points cited by the council as points on which agreement has been reached but which were not covered in the Order.  If he has not mentioned all the eight, all I can say is that we, in our reply to the council dealing with each of these eight points, made the position as clear as we could and gave every reasonable assurance.  In fact, while the council could not have been expected to be gushing in their enthusiasm of having got this, they replied to us in these terms:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The council while far from satisfied with the Order as made, agrees to refrain from petitioning against the proposed confirming Bill, on the assurance that the Minister will use Clause 7 in the manner described in his letter of the 7th March, 1953 and will, in the immediate future, provide for the other matters agreed to, by appropriate legislation.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that Clause 7 of the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Clause 7 or Article 7 in the Order.  In view of that passage in the letter from the council following our reply to the points raised by them, I think the Seanad can take it that everything is fairly safe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the point made by Senator Tunney in connection with cottage purchase, the matter is covered in the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1950. When I was told by my officials that it was so covered, I was somewhat surprised, because I wondered how the Minister then responsible anticipated a matter of this kind arising, but the explanation made the whole thing very simple.  My predecessor, Deputy Keyes, had the same sort of Order to make around that time in regard to the City of Limerick.  Being a Limerickman, he saw the problem, and the Housing Amendment Act, 1950, therefore contains a provision that where an area of Limerick, Dublin or any other county is included in a city area, the <Col N="650" /> tenants of labourers' cottages in such area will have the right to purchase these cottages from the council on the terms available to them before the area was so ceded for a period of 12 months and that, even after the 12 months have expired, a corporation can, if it so desires, at any later stage, sell the cottages to the tenants on the same conditions.</P>
    <P>So far as the advantages accruing to people who were in the queue as one Senator expressed it for new houses are concerned, while living in the functional area of the county council, the same facilities will be extended to them when the area is transferred to the Dublin Corporation or to any other corporation.  The same method of selection of tenants, the same preferences and so on will operate in the new area as operated in the old.  I do not think there is any need to be apprehensive about what will operate in the new area as operated in the old.  I do not think there is any need to be apprehensive about what will result for the ratepayers of the Dublin area or for the people living in the area about to be transferred to the Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>I was anxious to get this Bill yesterday. I suppose Ministers are always in a hurry and always seem to want to get things overnight, but it happens in this case that time is running fairly short.  I was anxious to get it yesterday, as I say, in the hope that everything would be in readiness to enable the Order made to take effect as from the date specified.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining stages to-day.</P>
    <P>Bill passed through Committee, reported without amendment, and received for final consideration.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to clear up a point of drafting.  The last phrase in sub-section (1) of Section 7 is: &ldquo;as a consequence of the extension of the boundary of the city by this Order.&rdquo;  What exactly does that qualify in the section?  The section is <Col N="651" /> most important because it deals with compensation.  Do these last words qualify &ldquo;burden&rdquo; or &ldquo;the cost incurred by the county council in the execution of any of their powers and duties&rdquo; as set out in sub-section (1)? It seems to me that it ought to qualify &ldquo;burden&rdquo;, but if it does, it is curiously phrased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am given one example here.  The area of the county council will be smaller in future and the county council will, for example, have to provide from the smaller area the same salary for its county engineer that it had to provide for him from the larger area.  There may be other similar examples.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this intended to meet the cost of putting in sewerage, developing roads and so on which the Dublin County Council has borne &mdash;the charges incurred before this becomes an Act&mdash;or is it intended to meet charges incurred after this becomes an Act, or both?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be after, because the area on which certain charges will be levied in future is a smaller area than the area on which they are now levied.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of the adjustment of loans of which Senator Tunney has been talking.  There are a number of agreements that have been reached by the county council and the corporation which will be implemented in the ordinary way but which are not provided for in this Order because we were advised that they should not and could not be covered by the Order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's explanation on all points except one. We had an experience before with <Col N="652" /> regard to Greater Dublin.  There were people then living in the suburbs in little old cottages who got a very raw deal and very poor consideration but I would be satisfied if the Minister, even apart from this Bill, would make a recommendation to the Dublin Corporation in regard to special consideration. In other words, that the people who had been practically allotted houses on land acquired by the county council would get a preference.  I can tell the House that the position is entirely changed now.  Somebody could come from Belfast, Cork or Mayo and, having spent five years in an old room in town, could go out on the site and get a house where the local person could not.  I would appeal to the Minister to approach the corporation in connection with the matter.  The corporation may say that they are governed by this law and that law.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>This Bill provides for increases in the service and disability pensions which are being paid under the Connaught Rangers (Pensions) Act of 1936 to the former members, now numbering about 30, of the first battalion of the Connaught Rangers who mutinied in India in 1920 and who, as a result, were sentenced by court-martial to penal servitude or imprisonment.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes that these pensions, all of which are below £100 per year, should be increased by 50 per cent. which, as Senators will recall, is the increase proposed for I.R.A. military service pensioners in the Military Service (Pensions) (Amendment) Bill, 1952, which the Seanad passed yesterday. The Connaught Rangers (Pensions) Act, 1936, provided for abatement in the light of other receipts from public or local authority funds.  The system is the same as that which applies at present under the Military Service (Pensions) Act about which Senator Michael Hayes spoke yesterday.</P>
      <P>By Section 3 of this Bill it is proposed to abolish abatement.  I have no doubt the Seanad will be glad to hear that, in addition to these concessions, it is proposed in the forthcoming Army Pensions Bill to make these Connaught Ranger pensioners eligible for the special allowances which we spoke about in the Seanad yesterday in the same way as the Old I.R.A. men.  It is a very simple Bill.  It just brings the Connaught Rangers into line with the I.R.A. pensioners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a little difficult to make a speech about this Bill, because the more one reads it the less one finds in it anything which would give one concrete proposals to debate.  It is called the Restrictive Trade Practices Bill, and there was some discussion about it yesterday which suggested that the Bill deals with shortages of supply.  That, of course, is not true.  The Bill is intended to be a Bill for normal times. It is not a Bill which deals with an emergency or an abnormal period. Neither is it a Bill which deals with specific abuses which have a known meaning, things such as rings and cartels.  It is difficult, therefore, to say precisely what the Bill intends to do.</P>
      <P>There are some points about it which are quite certain.  It does add considerably to the power of the State and to the power of the Minister, as representing the State.  It adds to the expenses of the State and to the burden on the taxpayers.  It adds to the expenses, because it provides for a fair trading commission.  If that commission is to be at all effective it must consist of very carefully chosen people with very remarkable qualifications which can only be bought in the open market for very high fees.  If the proper people are not procured for the commission, then the commission will not only be useless, but it will be worse than useless, for it may very well be harmful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission having been obtained at certain expense, it must have a staff, inspectors and administrators. The Civil Service, as everybody knows, always grows and never decreases.  I am not to be taken as in any way casting the slightest reflection on the Civil <Col N="655" /> Service, but I have never seen an example for the last 30 years where anybody said he had too much staff. No matter what you are doing staff tends to grow.  When this commission is established it will get a staff, but its staff in 1954 will be greater than that in 1953.  On that point, of course, the Minister is as clear as I am.</P>
    <P>The Bill contemplates Orders by the Minister.  That adds to the Minister's already great responsibility.  It is arguable that the Minister for Industry and Commerce in this State is running a Government on his own.  The burden imposed on the person who occupies the position of Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;it does not matter who that person may be&mdash;is one that is almost impossible for one individual to carry if he takes a proper view of his responsibility and does his best to carry it out.  The Bill contemplates an investigation made by the commission, then an Order by the Minister and then legislation by the Dáil and Seanad.  In other words, the Bill contemplates giving more work to an already overburdened Minister and throwing more work into a machine like the Dáil, already clogged up and not able to get through the work it has to do.</P>
    <P>These additions to the responsibility of the State, to the power of the State, are entirely in character as far as the present Minister is concerned; he is a go-getter and a believer in streamlined processes and in every case where he finds a problem to solve he solves it by adding to the powers of the State, and in nearly every case to the powers of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. He appears to be a sincere believer in that, for it is his normal remedy for any problem, whether it is a clearly stated problem or not.</P>
    <P>Each particular item of State control may be justified, but when we contemplate the steps taken here in the last 30 years, the sum total is terrifying, particularly when we remember that, theoretically, there is hardly any Party here that believes in State Socialism.</P>
    <P>One has to inquire what the object <Col N="656" /> of this Bill is.  Contrary to the speech made by Senator Colgan, this is not a Bill to lower prices, not a Bill to tax profits and not a Bill to reduce profits.  Its aim is not clearly defined at all anywhere.  You cannot refer to any section to find out what precisely the Bill aims at accomplishing, nor, indeed, in the discussion on the Bill have any striking examples been given as to what the Bill aims at abolishing.  The Minister and Senator Colgan mentioned the case of Guinness's Brewery.  Like Senator Colgan, I have never given any assistance to the brewery in its development which has been so great over the years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that a sound example?  Is this legislation to prevent the development of businesses like Guinness's Brewery or Jacob's factory, that is, legislation to protect the small man?  I think Senator Colgan said that there were 20 breweries in Dublin when Guinness commenced, and they are all gone now.  Is that an argument for this Bill?  I am personally in favour of the smaller projects against the big ones, but we are not told that this Bill is a Bill to help the small man against the big man.  I wonder is it?</P>
      <P>If this fair trading commission had been in operation over the last 100 years would it have impeded the progress of Guinness's Brewery?  I understand there are practices carried on by that brewery, for example, that if you bottle any other stout besides theirs you cannot use their label.  Is that an unjust, unfair and unreasonable practice?  By what standards would one judge?  Yet this is the kind of problem that will have to be faced by the fair trading commission. Similarly, I believe Guinness's Brewery, in common with certain other concerns, insist upon cash in advance. Some people give you credit and other people insist upon your paying in advance.  Is that an unfair practice? If it is, is it possible for the State to stop it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am all for fair trading and fair play, but having read the debates in <Col N="657" /> the Dáil and having heard what was said here I cannot find any example of precisely what is meant by unfair practices and what the remedy may be. I was given this example this morning. If I open a shop and if the person owning the shop beside me is being supplied by certain wholesalers, they may refuse to supply me with their goods.  Is that an unfair practice, one wonders?  If it is an unfair practice what will happen under the Bill, when it becomes an Act, to remedy that position?  Will the wholesaler be instructed to supply Hayes and Mayes?  Will he be compelled to give me credit?  If I must pay cash, will that be any help?  The wholesaler has 100 ways of thwarting me.  His traveller may fail to call upon me at the right time or, again, may delay delivery of goods.  What precise steps can be taken to ensure that relations between a wholesaler and a particular retailer will be satisfactory?</P>
    <P>There is no example given and no guidance in the Bill for the honest trader except his own experience.  If you are afraid that you are infringing the law at present you can secure advice about it by going to a lawyer. If you are in trouble with the income-tax authorities you can go to an accountant and if you have some doubt about principles of morality you can get advice from a theologian.  But who is going to advise you if you feel you are engaged in an unreasonable trade practice?  I do not think anybody can advise you.  There was a suggestion yesterday that members of this House who are drapers are in some way arguing for their own interests and making their money in a dishonest fashion.  That seems to me to be quite foolish.  This is not surely class legislation intended to check a particular class of people and hurt them. In spite of the provisions in Schedule II of the Bill which were inserted after the Bill was introduced in the Dáil, it seems to me that this fair trading commission when it is established will be a roving commission: they can go where they like, ask any questions they wish and come to what decisions they like.</P>
    <P>Remember that the Bill is drafted in a characteristic manner.  Civil servants <Col N="658" /> and Parliamentary draftsmen have learned how to do these things. The Minister says: &ldquo;I want to do something about unfair trade,&rdquo; and while this may be a small part of trading generally, the Bill is drafted so as to have an enormous scope.  The officers of the commission have power to go in and ask for books, documents, invoices and for all kinds of things, in addition to the power possessed already by the income-tax authorities.</P>
    <P>The Bill will lead to difficulty as far as the honest conscientious trader is concerned, and will lead to deception, evasion and skilled concealment by the dishonest people, who are hard to catch.  They will learn to evade whatever operations are carried on under the Act.  I know that anybody who criticises this Bill will be glibly charged with being in favour of the practices which the Bill aims at destroying. I cannot be so accused because I do not know what the practices are, and in the debate here nothing has been said to show what they are.  The Bill is very vague as to what the practices are, but there is nothing vague about the powers of the commission, which are very definite, clear and complete.  What kind of person can exercise these powers?  Senator Douglas, in an interesting speech yesterday, showed me at any rate as I was listening to him when he gave certain examples concerning manufacturers, advertisers and distributors that all these matters of trade, manufacturing and distribution are very varied and very complex.  I find, as far as I am concerned myself&mdash;and I do not regard myself as an entirely unintelligent person&mdash;that it would be very difficult to learn a great deal about any given trade.  What you think at first view may be completely wrong when something more is explained to you.</P>
    <P>For example, over and over again I have heard it stated that motor traders were responsible for keeping certain people from getting petrol pumps. Senator Summerfield, with whom I am infrequently in agreement, said that that was not so at all.  I accept his word because he is in a position to know.  Senator Summerfield added <Col N="659" /> that it was the oil companies who controlled the giving out of petrol pumps. The common view is the reverse, and shows how all these things are very difficult to deal with.</P>
    <P>What sort of people are going to be brought together on the commission to do the work?  Will legal training be of any value?  I very much doubt it. Civil servants cannot do the work and this most emphatically is not the job they have to do.  Nobody is more foolish than a businessman who says that the Civil Service should be run on business lines because the Civil Service is not a business.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service is not a business in the true sense of the word.  The Minister is far from being the head of a business concern.  The Minister has to make statements on the working of his Department and he has to go to the Dáil and answer questions, but the head of a business does not have to do any of these things.  He does not have to keep files nor does he have to speak from platforms on matters of policy.  The Civil Service approach is something quite different from the approach of a business establishment.</P>
    <P>It would be good if we could get people with business experience to do this particular job.  It seems to me that anybody who has experience of business and particularly experience of accountancy would be the best for these purposes.  In the case of such people their earning capacity in the market would be so great that the Minister would find difficulty in getting them for this purpose.</P>
    <P>In Section 7 an amendment will be put down that when an investigation or inquiry is started or requested it should be held by two or more members rather than by one member of the commission as provided for in the Bill.  No one member of the commission should be entrusted with this particular job and with exercising the powers in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 9, sub-section (3), suggests that the commission will make a report to the Minister, who will make an Order based on the report, and sub-section (3) goes on to say that an Order <Col N="660" /> under this section shall not take effect unless confirmed by an Act of Oireachtas, and if so confirmed it shall have the force of law.  What kind of procedure is contemplated?  Does the Minister intend to follow the rules with regard to Provisional Orders, such as the one we had to-day about the boundaries of the City of Dublin?  I think that would not be a bad idea. The Minister would make an Order and then bring into the Dáil a short Bill consisting of a couple of sections confirming the Order and then refer the Bill to a joint committee of both Houses.  Outsiders who are always criticising politicians do not believe me when I say that one of the most efficient things here is the use of committees, and particularly joint committees. Orders affecting businesses are much better discussed at a joint committee than in committee of the whole Dáil.</P>
    <P>The Bill in this and many other respects seems to be characteristic of the Minister's policy by which he provides elaborate machinery and takes wide powers to do something which remains vague in itself.  I do not think that the Bill will accomplish much but I am quite certain that it will add to the powers of the State. It will add to the cost of administration and it will also add to the costs of manufacture and distribution by compelling producers, retailers and manufacturers to make provision for expenses which might arise in connection with inquiries under the Act.</P>
    <P>One might sav cynically that the Bill does not do any harm and therefore it should be left alone.  But in some ways it may do harm.  We had the Minister for Finance yesterday recommending economy.  A short time ago I said here that one thing which would save the country money would be a year's holiday from legislation, other than the necessary Bills about national finance.  Every piece of legislation which is introduced increases the Civil Service, swells the parliamentary programme and burdens the taxpayer. This Bill, too, increases the powers of the State and as far as I can see does not accomplish the purposes for which it is stated to be intended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>My approach to this Bill is partly philosophical and I hope in the course of my remarks to deal with Plato and Aristotle in the ancient world and Berkeley in the modern world.  The Bill is a Restrictive Trade Practices Bill and one might well ask restrictive of what?  I think the underlying idea seems to be restrictive of competition.  Competition is one of the things which increases supply and lowers the price to the eventual consumer and consequently increases consumption of the people.  Therefore, I think that the real objection is not so much restriction of competition as restriction of consumption, because there are some circumstances in which an economy operating under the disability of restrictive consumption tends to frustrate production and impoverish the community.  What the Bill really seeks to do, or what it attempts to carry out, is to take out of the economy the anti-social use of economic power and discourage the use of the kind of pressure in the supply and distribution of goods which by raising prices unnecessarily, would diminish the flow of goods to the final consumer and therefore inevitably diminish production itself in its earlier stages.</P>
      <P>We all agree that it is desirable that the anti-social element should be removed, but it might be worth while to inquire into the origin of that anti-social tendency.  I am afraid that anti-social behaviour is as old as human nature and opportunities for it to behave in the kind of way that we find objectionable are as old as the exchange economy which goes back certainly to the time of Plato and further.  Plato had a prejudice against the class of individuals whom he called retail traders, for reasons which are not entirely irrelevant.  I am quoting now from Plato's laws in a book, published by a man called Laistner, on Greek economics.  He inquires why men regard retail trade as an ignoble and disreputable occupation and the answer he gives is:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It is a small class of men, rare by nature and brought up by a first-rate training, that can show patience and moderation when involved in <Col N="662" /> wants and desires, and, when the power to acquire much wealth presents itself, is yet temperate and prefers moderation to excess.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, it is a temptation to which human nature, placed in certain economic conditions, all too readily succumbs.</P>
    <P>Plato recommends that the class of shopkeepers should be as small as possible.  For reasons of my own, I am inclined to sympathise with this view, but it might interest the Minister to hear the way in which Plato recommends that the power of the State should be brought in to make traders behave:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In order that such an one may be as good or as little bad a denizen of the city as possible, it shall be the duty of the law guardians to reflect that they are guardians not only of those whom it is easy to watch and prevent from becoming lawless and vicious, men in fact whose descent and education are alike of the best; but they must watch more closely those of a different disposition who are engaged in occupations which strongly weight the scale in the direction of evil ways.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It must be the duty of the guardians of the law to come together with those who are experienced in each class of retail trade and, when they have forgathered, to see what takings, coupled with necessary expenditure, ensure a moderate profit for the trader.  The recurrent expenditure and takings are to be written down and fixed and the market superintendents, the city magistrates and the country magistrates are to keep a close watch thereon.  It may be that in this way retail trade will benefit everyone and at the same time will do very little harm to those who engage in it in the city.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now this Bill seems to me to be somewhat platonic in spirit and the Minister seeks, perhaps rightly, to bring the heavy hand of the State to bear on human character so as to make everyone concerned with business <Col N="663" /> behave with a sense of social obligation.</P>
    <P>Aristotle was concerned with much the same problem but he regarded the abuses incidental to trade as being properly the indirect result of the invention of money.  Perhaps I could save the time of the House by quoting from a contribution I made myself 15 years ago in &ldquo;Hermathena&rdquo; in describing as briefly as may be the general analysis by Aristotle of how this objectionable feature arises. Briefly, the science of supply has two aspects.  One concerns the provision of the things necessary for life and is good and natural, but the other is the perversion of the science of supply which arises from the abuse of the possibilities of the monetary economy. The monetary is a developed form of the exchange economy and the object of the exchange economy is to facilitate consumption by the exchange of superfluities.  Once money had been invented as a result of necessary exchange, a second kind of science of supply arose, namely, <i>Kapelike</i>, which in actual fact appears to be what we call profiteering.  Hence the science of supply came to be concerned mainly with money and men came to regard its primary object as the acquisition of a maximum amount of money.  So that people, instead of concentrating their attention on increasing their own wealth by increasing the supply of goods and services to their neighbours, tended to strive for the maximum amount of money irrespective of the anti-social consequences of their behaviour.</P>
    <P>Production under modern conditions is a long-drawn-out process with many stages.  The goods pass from primary producer through many stages and different ownerships to the ultimate seller and it often happens, especially in time of glut, that production at the primary end is frustrated because the price policy pursued by various interests, especially at the end of the system nearest the consumer, is such as to restrict the consumer demand for the products and cause goods to pile up at the primary stages of production, bringing about loss and frustration <Col N="664" /> to the primary producer and those engaged in the intermediate stages of production.</P>
    <P>High prices at the consumer end of the scale&mdash;that is, unecessarily high prices&mdash;restrict consumption, and therefore indirectly restrict production. One might take an analogy from the phenomenon of the Barrow drainage which, I think, happened at a certain stage.  When the Barrow was first drained, the upper reaches of the Barrow were drained but the lower reaches remained obstructed and the only result of draining the Barrow at that time was to increase flooding because of the obstruction at the outlet. Similarly, the anti-social behaviour of the people who control the outlet of consumption can at times negative the efforts of the producers at an earlier stage and bring about a restriction of production because consumption is restricted. That maximum consumption is necessary to maximum production is an idea of Bishop Berkeley which he seems to have borrowed from the great French thinker, Boisguilbert.  I would like to quote more from a paper I contributed about 15 years ago.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;All the most exquisite products are only dung from the moment they are not consumed.&rsquo;&lsquo;If ability to consume constitutes wealth, so does wealth spring from this very consumption. It is necessary to consume the goods produced if consumption is to continue, hence arises the need for mass consumption, for the consumption of the few will not keep fully occupied the hands of the many.&rsquo; (Boisguilbert.)</P>
    <P>Berkeley is eloquent also on the futility of a money that does not circulate freely, and he shares Boisguilbert's notion that consumption is in a true sense the cause as well as the object of wealth production.  He queries &lsquo;whether comfortable living does not produce wants, and wants industry, and industry wealth&rsquo;.</P>
    <P>Like Boisguilbert, he perceives that the disinheritance of the masses in its effect on consumption is destructive of industry, and both men advocate in fact a more equalitarian <Col N="665" /> society.  Boisguilbert maintains that this could be accomplished without injury to the rich&mdash;in fact, to their ultimate advantage.  &lsquo;If the rich understood their interests they would wholly relieve the poor of their taxes, which would immediately create more well-to-do persons....&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, both thinkers regard the desire to consume as the dynamic of production.  It is because these are anti-social practices which diminish consumption and therefore production that I am in sympathy with the main object of this Bill.  The self-interest of the tradesman is consistent with the public good when he seeks his profit by maximising production.  There are two main ways in which a person may aim to achieve maximum profit&mdash;one is by making scarce things plentiful and the other is by making plentiful things scarce.  In so far as this Bill is to prevent the second method of achieving maximum profit, the Bill is thoroughly desirable.</P>
      <P>Adam Smith held that the self-interest of individual producers and tradesmen was enough to ensure the common good of the whole community. He held that, in seeking his own profit, the tradesman and producer are guided by an invisible hand to achieve the good of the community, but the same Adam Smith also pointed out that tradesmen in the same line of business could not get together without conspiring to rob the public&mdash; so he had occasional glimpses of a different outlook on life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We come now to resale price maintenance. This can arise in various ways.  It can arise not because the entry into a given occupation is restricted, but because, in the case of certain occupations, the entry into them is not restricted enough.  There are occupations, especially in small-scale shop-keeping, in which, owing to the excessive numbers engaged trying to make a living in that way, <Col N="666" /> margins of gross profit must be high and retail prices must be maintained at a higher level than would be necessary, even in the interest of the traders concerned, if fewer persons were engaged in that occupation.</P>
    <P>May I remind the House of some of the facts in regard to the distribution of goods which were made public by the Census of Distribution of 1933?  The figures and prices are now very much out of date, but I feel the facts contained in that report are still very much the facts in regard to our economy.  In fact, the central problem of our economy is that too many people are trying to make a living by buying, selling, handling, distributing and transporting things and not enough people are actively engaged in producing the things we all want to eat, and wear and live with.  That Census of Production of 1933 showed there were 38,000 retail establishments in our country.  It showed that 51.2 per cent. of the sales were made by less than 7 per cent. of the total number of the shops, that that 7 per cent. of the total number of the shops employed only 26.5 per cent. of the total personnel engaged, which amounted to about 120,000.  Of the total of 38,000 shops, 18,000 sold less than £500 worth of goods in the year.</P>
    <P>It is quite evident from these figures that if the larger and presumably more efficient shops had been able to double their trade and double their personnel &mdash;the persons occupied in selling in those shops&mdash;they could have done all the retail trade that was done in the country at that time and at the same time would have needed only about half the personnel actively engaged in doing that trade.  In other words, 60,000 persons were actively engaged in the retail trade and were rendering services really superfluous from the point of view of economy, because they could have been done without.  And because they were &ldquo;on the strength,&rdquo; so to speak, the level of prices and gross profit had to be higher and therefore consumption reduced for the rest of the community, more so than would have been the case if there had been fewer establishments and keener competition between them and a lower <Col N="667" /> margin of retail profit.  I do not know whether the present Bill can deal with that particular problem, but at all events it can investigate certain aspects of it and I hope its powers will be used to do so.</P>
    <P>I had an example of resale price maintenance in the book trade.  I published about two years ago a book called <i>Irish Agriculture in Transition</i>, through a Dublin bookseller.  The whole of the printing bill was paid on my behalf outside the finance of the publisher altogether.  The book was priced at 15/.  Before the last war, the same book could have been published easily at about half that price. I discovered to my horror that for every copy that was being sold for 15/- the publisher was crediting the printing bill for which I was responsible with only 7/6 and collecting another 7/6 for himself in respect of the ones he sold over his own counter, and collecting 2/6 for himself in respect of every one which he sold as a wholesale distributor to other retail bookshops. However he agreed to raise the contribution to the printer's bill to 9/- for each copy sold.</P>
    <P>I had some discussion at the time as to whether it would be possible for me to sell the book in the ordinary channels of retail trade at 15/-, but to have a lower price to favoured classes of possible purchasers, especially the young farmers' clubs and so on, of say 12/6 or less; and I was told I could sell it at any price I liked to those other classes, but the retail trade in books would have nothing whatever to do with it, good or bad, if I went outside the channels of ordinary retail trade distribution.  I had to have a fixed price, the 15/- price, and I could not quote a lower price in order to favour any other class of would-be readers.  I thought that was a bit steep.</P>
    <P>There are larger aspects of this problem for it concerns what I regard as the Achilles heel of the whole free capitalist economy.  Fundamentally, the capitalist economy is co-operative, in the sense that we all need each other's services and cannot exist apart <Col N="668" /> from one another, but psychologically the organisation of the capitalist economy emphasises rather the conflict of interest between different sections of the economy than the fundamental community of interest that binds us all together, if we look at it in a deeper analysis.  Consequently, sections of the economy are tempted to increase their individual shares of the total national income by a process which amounts, in fact, to attempting to beggar their neighbours instead of concentrating their attention on increasing their contributions to the common pool of goods and services and hoping to get an equitable share of that increased contribution for themselves.</P>
    <P>This Bill emphasises the social obligation of all those who occupy key positions in our economic life, and, if only for its educational effect, for its effect on public opinion and the advantage we would gain by investigation of anti-social practices, the Bill, I think, is thoroughly desirable, even if nobody ever becomes amenable at law as a victim of any of the penalties mentioned in it.  I welcome the Bill, but I would welcome still more a progressive modification of our free economy in a more consciously co-operative direction.  I will not take up the time of the House in going into that in detail now, but, if anyone is sufficiently interested, he will find my suggestions for that modification in my book and if he buys it, he will help me to pay the printer's bill.</P>

      <P>I was rather glad to hear Senator Johnston start off to deal with the Bill in the realms of Greek philosophy and I hoped that at some time he would have looked at it from the point of view of Greek mythology as well.  It is quite apposite that a Bill dealing with restrictive practices should in some way be associated with the Golden Fleece.  I was hoping that the idea would run through his mind and that he would give us a description of the anti-social effects of Jasonism in the old days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most extraordinary phenomena witnessed in this House for a long time has been the number of Pharisees who have made their appearance <Col N="669" /> in the Chamber as a result of the Bill.  People have held up their hands in horror and have said: &ldquo;Thank God, I am not as other men.&rdquo;  People have cried: &ldquo;Is it not nearly time somebody thought of these restrictive practices which are confined solely, by the grace of God, to manufacturers and retail traders?&rdquo; Is it not a terrible thing that, in a so-called Christian country, where the majority of us are Catholics, we should have such an anti-social outlook as that which has been expressed by many speakers during this discussion&mdash;a completely anti-social outlook in so far as they are quite prepared to condemn any other section of the community but their own for the sins which this Bill says are being committed against the public?  They went even further than the Minister.  The Minister was extremely careful to say that restrictive practices were only &ldquo;alleged&rdquo; and he repeated time and again the word &ldquo;allegation.&rdquo;  Not once did he say they were there, but it was said for him by other people who spoke of manufacturers and traders as if they were the sole sinners in our community.</P>
    <P>I oppose this Bill for no other reason than that it is an unfair Bill, a discriminatory Bill.  If there are restrictive practices, they are not confined to any class of the community.  I heard the Taoiseach recently, when speaking about the milk strike, say that he was not going to allow the public to be held up to ransom because of any class distinction or for the benefit of any section.  But here we have a Bill which is obviously directed and stated to be directed against manufacturers and those engaged in trade.  I go so far as to say that, in the professions, there are restrictive practices, unfair practices. The labour element is protected by law and why that should be sufficient in itself to remove them from the operation of the Bill, I do not know. Even banking practice has its restrictions, but none of these have been singled out for penalties or for odium. Nobody is held up to the public gaze as the great sinner of the new Ireland, but the manufacturer and the retailer. This Bill is unfair in that it discriminates against people who, it is alleged, have engaged in unfair and restrictive practices.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="670" /> The Federation of Irish Manufacturers at a general meeting held in the Gresham Hotel passed a resolution on this matter.  The federation called to that meeting all the trade organisations of prominence in the country and the meeting passed a resolution which reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That while opposed to restrictive trade practices no matter by whom carried out this meeting, being of the opinion that the terms of the Restrictive Trades Practices Bill, 1952, give wide, dangerous and dictatorial powers which could be used to the disadvantage of the public and would and could lead to the introduction in effect of a socialist form of State; that we call on the Government to defer consideration of the Bill and to meet representatives of the various trades associations with a view to discussing the practices which the Minister has in mind so that a satisfactory and agreed Bill would be introduced.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Despite that resolution passed by that representative body and despite the fact that various members of the federation in various places had spoken against the discriminatory nature of the Bill, no move was made by the Minister to discuss with any of these people their objections to the Bill.</P>
    <P>It has been stated here that this is another form of inquisition, a new method of inroad upon the private lives of people in trade.  I wonder how far Governments are justified in that line of conduct.  I quoted already in this House Oliver Puff and I always think of him when I hear Ministers talking about private enterprise and about Government policy generally in relation to private enterprise, and then see them implementing, in their laws, restrictions upon the developments of private enterprise.  The Minister may say that these are anti-social restrictions, as Senator Johnston has dubbed them, but I would say, as Senator Colgan said yesterday, that he has plenty other means of suppressing these anti-social activities, if they are anti-social, apart from the implementation of such a Bill as this. <Col N="671" /> This Bill is an extremely dangerous Bill, even for the people who now applaud and welcome it.  It is dangerous for Senators Colgan and McMullen, who spoke yesterday and some day they will learn that for themselves.  The Minister has even suggested that the legal protection which they now enjoy and which removed them from the operation of the Bill may be taken away and we then may have the Pharisaical position of my having to get up here to defend trade unionism as being a good thing in itself.  This Bill, in its implications, is one of the most dangerous Bills that has been introduced since the Oireachtas was set up.  It seeks to give, through the Minister, powers to a commission which I do not believe should be given and which may be argued to be derogatory to the Constitution itself.</P>
    <P>The Minister agreed that restrictive practices in themselves are not necessarily a bad thing.  We have them all around us.  The art of living is a restrictive practice in itself.  Restrictive practices even go so far as to involve the Press, finance and every phase of one's life.  Even in our domestic lives, restrictive practices exist.  These may or may not be in themselves a bad thing.  It is assumed that because certain people are not mentioned in this Bill and cannot be affected by it that all the other people affected by it must, of necessity, be bold, bad men out to rob and prosper at any cost to the other members of the community.  On behalf of Irish manufacturers, I object to that, but that is the inference that will be taken from the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister never said that himself. As far as I can recall, he said that they may apply only to a very few.  The trouble about it is that it is not what he said but what others have said which has created a state of mind in the country which will be ruinous to industry.  The manufacturer and the trader is held up to abuse and calumny. That is the new outlook in Catholic Ireland.  That is the sort of idea which is being fostered because of this Bill. <Col N="672" /> The Bill singles out people as being new Publicans, so to speak.</P>
    <P>The Bill, apart from the motives implied in it, gives the Minister extraordinary powers to create a new fair trading commission composed of ordinary human beings who are to be definitors, but they have not got any theological basis upon which to define what is or what is not a restrictive practice.  Restrictive practices are not even defined in law.  The section, if it has any effect at all, should be completely removed, with the exception of paragraph (k).  The word &ldquo;other&rdquo; might also be removed.</P>
    <P>I have a great deal of sympathy with the point raised by Senator Johnston when he stated that there are far too many distributors and too few producers. If we do not want that state of society, we should go out and change it.  We should either be a socialistic State or a private enterprise State. You had the extraordinary case of some Americans coming across to tell us that we were neither, but you cannot have a foot in both camps.  Both sections of the people are held up to ridicule as a result of the implications in this Bill.  Manufacturers and traders are held up as being dangerous and as the boys they are after.  It is a peculiar comment to make that the bold, bad men are only business people and manufacturers.  They are the types who are not politically banded together and have not voting strength, but maybe, as a result of the continued pressure on the economic life of the country and of the outcry by some of the Pharisees, something will arise out of it and the State will not legislate purely on a class basis.</P>
    <P>This Bill contains extraordinary disciplinary powers and powers of penalty. The ordinary power of appeal which is enjoyed by the humblest person in the land will be refused to anybody found committing or infringing this Bill when it becomes an Act.  There is nothing in the Bill to give me the right of appeal to the courts in the event of the commission having wrongly instructed the Minister.  The sole arbiter is the Minister.  I am not referring to the Minister or any other Minister in any personal sense.  It is a very serious <Col N="673" /> matter to give any Minister, no matter who he is, the right to decide, on the advice of a group of definitors whom we know nothing about, that I or anybody else is committing an anti-social act, but that is what this Bill is tantamount to.</P>
    <P>The manufacturers and the traders are the bold, bad boys.  I feel quite indignant about this.  I know that this Bill was prompted by the idea that somebody was getting away with murder.  The Federation of Irish Manufacturers has time and again stressed the fact that they do not stand for anybody amassing wealth under unfair conditions at the expense of other members of the community, nor does the federation oppose the Minister's statement that restrictive practices are in being, but they do oppose the Bill and they do so purely because it is a class matter.</P>
    <P>If the Bill has to go through&mdash;and listening to the speeches from the Labour members and others it seems that it will go through&mdash;I would suggest to the Minister that there are many changes which he should consider before making the Bill law.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that it would have been wise for the Minister to consult the organisations that passed a resolution in the Shelbourne Hotel, Dublin.  He should have given them the benefit of a hearing.  No matter what the Minister may think, all wisdom does not reside in the ministerial body.  We go out and talk about democracy but, nevertheless, the people mainly affected by this Bill were not consulted.  The people mainly affected by the Bill ought to have received a hearing in order to find out what they thought of the Bill or whether they agree or disagree with it.  They were never even heard.  In order to become popular to-day all one has to say is that the manufacturers and the traders are the people who are getting away with it, but God help the farmers and labour.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that the Bill needs an immense amount of revision and I would suggest that, before he proceeds, even with the great majority he will have in this House, <Col N="674" /> he may consider its wider application before it is too late.  If there are restrictive practices and you allege that they are not confined to people in trade, and if you are going to pass a Bill which itself is indiscriminate to a confined class of people, and you say that that class only are carrying on restrictive practices, then you are misleading and anti-social.  If you have to have a restrictive practices Bill, why not have a Bill which would apply to all sections of the community.  It is not my job to argue that there are restrictive practices in all classes of the community, but it is alleged that there are, just as it is alleged there are restrictive trade practices.</P>
    <P>As I remarked before, under the present economic system we go around and create monopolies.  It is an arguable thing, but it may be a good thing if we had only one source of distribution for one type of goods and so escape any restrictive practice employed, because you could only get, for example, motor cars from Senator Summerfield and shirts from myself. It may possibly be quite a good thing for the community.  So long as you have the present economic build-up and are prepared to continue to live with thousands of distributors, then you are bound to meet with ordinary human frailty, and it is not fair that these human frailties should be ascribed to one section of the community.</P>
    <P>This Bill confines itself to restrictive practices in trade, and I am protesting as strongly as I can against its unfairness and discrimination, and protesting against many of its clauses. There is sub-section (5) of Section 9, for example, which gives the Minister immense power, and I doubt if any Minister in any country has been given any greater powers, even in madly socialistic countries like Russia and elsewhere.  In Section 9, the Minister may, having considered the report of the commission under Sections 6 or 7, if he thinks fit, by Order, prohibit specified arrangements and agreements concerning the supply and distribution of goods and may make such provision as he thinks necessary to ensure equitable treatment <Col N="675" /> of all persons in regard to the rendering of any such services and the avoidance of unfair practices.</P>
    <P>Now, that is all right, so long as we have the present Minister in office, or the Ministers we have had in office, but a day may come when a Minister may interpret that Bill in such a fashion that all sorts of repercussions which were never envisaged before might occur.  I would say that a lot of the people who have welcomed this Bill have taken up a burning torch that may have an extraordinary effect upon themselves.  It is all right now, because they are not affected and because they say, as I remarked before: &ldquo;We are not as other men.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is a dangerous and anti-social Bill in the implications behind it: it is a bad Bill, because it is a class Bill, and I appeal to this House, because of its sense of justice, to reject the Bill fully and completely.  It could have very serious repercussions on our industrial development, not because it did not set out to do a good thing and was not given consideration, but because of its bad moulding and the possibilities of misinterpretation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest to the Minister's speech, but I must confess that it did not convey the same impression to me as did reading the Bill.  In reading the Bill one would imagine that the country was ridden by rings and monopolies, and that there is need for stringent and far-reaching legislation to deal with that evil.  The fines envisaged under the Bill are, in my experience, the highest I have ever seen put down in a piece of legislation and, while these fines may not affect considerably very large businesses with large turnovers of many millions a year, they may be more than adequate for driving out of business the smaller firms, who for some reason or other may come under the vigilant eye of this chamber of justice.  These smaller firms may not be able to protect themselves as adequately and employ the same skill in protecting themselves as the larger firms, and, in that respect, I feel there is a danger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="676" /> In my opinion, the powers given in the Bill ought not be given to any body of mortals because they are too far-reaching.  I do not want to say that I disapprove of this Bill <i>in toto</i> as I believe that some type of legislation of this sort may be necessary, particularly in a small country where many items are made by a small number of protected firms.  In many cases, items are distributed by single agents for a certain specialised type of article sold and distributed in this country and that lends itself to a form of restrictive trade and distribution.</P>
    <P>I do not want to burden the House by repeating much of what was stated by other speakers, but there is a type of restriction to which no other speaker has as yet referred, and that is in the sale of capital goods.  I believe there is a considerable amount of regulation and restriction with regard to the way in which these goods may be used. Some of them are rented and may be used only within a certain area, within so many miles of where the same type of machinery or equipment is operated. That lends itself to the worst form of restriction, and applies in industries like the cinema and boot factories. Washing, cleaning, packaging, laundry and other type of machinery which is offered for sale as well as some forms of hire-purchase are some of the things which the Minister might consider in the Second Schedule, which has been made wide enough to deal with any other matter which is restrictive in its import.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister when he is concluding the debate to tell us some of the things which he definitely considers are not restrictive, because there are so many things liable to be restrictive and the powers given are so wide that it would be well if the Minister would indicate what he considered was not restrictive.  Price fixing of itself ought not be considered as an offence, particularly when it can be shown that the price margins taken were fair and reasonable.  Those engaged in industry and commerce sometimes have to fix a price margin in order to plan production and to give them an opportunity for developing their business.  Without knowing what they were likely to charge, they <Col N="677" /> would not be able to plan the future progress of either their industry or their commerce.</P>
    <P>With some other speakers I would like to know why this Bill is being applied to some sections of manufacturers while the rest of the community go free.  It certainly leaves a bad taste in the mouths of one section of the community who are engaged in free competitive enterprises to find that they are open to investigation, while other sections of the community are not interfered with.  The experts who recently examined the economy of this country stated in no uncertain manner that the amount of profit being made by those engaged in industry in the country is on the low side and does not allow sufficiently for capital development and that sufficient profit is not being made to allow for the development of those businesses.</P>
    <P>I also think it is true to say that industry in this country has increased its efficiency and its output per unit employed more than any of the other groups in the country.  The industrial group is the one group that has shown efficiency during the last 20 years more than any other section in the country.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I say that there are far too few who want to enter into and take part in the burden and risk of industry and commerce?  Everybody nowadays is looking for protected positions carrying pensions and emoluments, etc.  We should beware of creating a climate whereby people will be discouraged from engaging in industry and commerce.  If we create such a condition we will do a great deal of damage, because it must be remembered that trade and industry in this country are what the people in the professions get their livelihood from.  The more thriving the industry and commerce of the country the better will be the livelihood of the other sections of the community.  We must be very careful not to put more obstacles in the way of enterprise and in the way of the ambitions of people in the form of legislation directed against one section of the community only.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not been specific in the types of restrictive practices which it is intended <Col N="678" /> to rectify by this Bill.  We may take for granted, however, that it would not have been introduced if certain objectionable practices were not there that should be rectified.  We had restrictive practices in this country as far back as 50 years ago when certain wholesale organisations had endeavoured to get millers to stop supplies of provisions to small traders in the villages and small towns.  Mind you, it did not take legislation to cure that evil; a healthy public opinion cured it in a very short time because there were certain millers who would not submit to such dictation.  Those millers continued to supply the small traders and this put an end to certain efforts by wholesalers to become monopolists in their districts.  We have rings good or bad.  Traders have to protect their interests, and as long as the restrictive practices which necessarily follow do not limit production, discourage competition or manufacturers from selling their wares to all traders who desire to handle them they should not be interfered with.  In such circumstances I do not think that it is necessary to have legislation to cure those practices.  They will in time correct themselves if resisted by those they affect.</P>
      <P>I would think it would have been possible to have written into this Bill the types of restrictive practices which it was intended to deal with since the Minister must have had in his mind what they were when the Bill was being drafted.  If that had been done, it would have been of great assistance to all interested who could examine whether they were carrying on such practices, and if they found they were they would realise in time whether they were right or wrong and correct their methods before they were lawfully corrected as a result of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been alleged that many of these abuses were in new industries protected by licences and quotas issued by the Minister's Department. If that is so, I feel that, without any Bill of this kind, the Department which has power to issue licences could easily cure such a position by withdrawing these licences from the people engaging in practices of that sort. <Col N="679" /> One or two examples of that kind would be sufficient to do away with further contraventions that are a grave injustice to the consumer.</P>
    <P>So far as the setting up of the commission is concerned, as Senator Hayes pointed out that it will be a difficult matter to get the proper people for this type of commission. I certainly agree with Senator O'Brien that the chairman should be a man with a judicial training.  I think that on a commission such as this, where the chairman is called upon to enforce rules or to conduct inquiries of this nature, it would be better to have a judge who would be removed from any fears of victimisation as long as he carried out the law according to the statutes.</P>
    <P>I am of the opinion that this Bill, when it comes into operation, will make a valuable contribution towards the lowering of the cost of living, and if it does, that it will certainly be justified.  If the Minister feels that this Bill is necessary in the interests of the country and the community he is the person in a position to know, and so administer its provisions that they may have the desired effect.  I hope it brings about the remedies desired and corrects the abuses that it is intended to correct.</P>

      <P>Senator Hayes, in opening the debate to-day, said that he did not know what practices this Bill is aimed at, and Senator O'Reilly last night asked for more definite proof that restrictive practices are widespread and of such character as to require legislation to deal with them. I do not suppose that all university professors and solicitors live in an atmosphere so completely divorced from the realities of life as that in which Senators Hayes and O'Reilly appear to move.  The fact that restrictive practices in trade are widespread is well-known to everybody.  It is somewhat amusing to listen to Senator O'Donnell expressing his indignation <Col N="680" /> that anybody should suggest that to be so.  Not merely has the prevalence of these practices been frequently the subject of comment in the Dáil and the Seanad but the files of the Department of Industry and Commerce are filled with letters of complaint from individual victims of those practices.  If I hesitated to give details of practices which prevail it is because, although complaints regarding them were received, no detailed investigation followed.  It did not follow simply because the power of investigation was not there.</P>
      <P>Personally, I have little doubt that the practices to which the complaints referred were anti-social in their effect. I must emphasise, however, that neither the prevalence of the practices nor their social effects have ever been subjected to investigation.  They will, I hope, be investigated after this Bill is passed, but, if illustration is required, I can give it.  I told the Seanad when introducing the Bill that the complaints on the Department's records refer to about thirty commodities.  No Senator will expect me to refer to all these different complaints or illustrate them by reference to all the commodities to which they related.  It is alleged, however, that, in the case of certain commodities, agreements exist between distributors and manufacturers under which trade in these commodities is confined to members of particular associations and that sometimes these agreements extend outside this country to people supplying foreign goods to wholesalers in our country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of wrapping paper and paper bags, such investigations as I have carried out suggested that the arrangements in that trade are fairly water-tight.  Not merely would a manufacturer not dare to attempt to give supplies to any person who was not in the trade association, but if he did so, he would immediately lose the trade of all other persons who were members of that association.  It is also true that no new persons can secure admission to that association except by fulfilling impossible terms.  In the case of most building supplies it is clear that their distribution is controlled by means of agreements between manufacturers and <Col N="681" /> the Irish Builders' Providers Association and that association appears to be able to exercise influence upon foreign manufacturers in regard to the supply to wholesalers here.  That obtains also in respect of sheet glass.  The sale by wholesalers of sheet glass is controlled by a trade association which is not merely able to confine sales of that commodity to its members but appears also to have similar powers of influence over suppliers in other countries.</P>
    <P>In the case of radios, it is impossible to get a radio for retail sale except one is approved of by the appropriate retail trade association and agrees to maintain the retail selling price fixed by the manufacturers.  I could go through this list here and give numerous illustrations of restrictive practices which everybody knows prevail.  It is impossible to get a supply of coal for retail sale unless you are a member of the Eire Coal Importers' Association and it is quite clear that foreign colliery agents limit the sale of coal to this country to persons who are members of that association.  There are a variety of different allegations relating to a variety of practices all of which appear to be objectionable on the face of them. Some may be justified on the ground that they are necessary to eliminate graver abuses but my view is that all practices of that kind should be approached with suspicion.</P>
    <P>Where traders combine among themselves to confine trade in particular goods to themselves and make rules designed to eliminate competition between themselves, then it is probable that the public interest is being sacrificed to their special interests and there should be power to investigate those practices and to prevent them if they are held to be anti-social in effect.</P>
    <P>Senator Douglas said that the name of the Bill is somewhat misleading and that it should not be called the Restrictive Trade Practices Bill but the Unfair Trade Practices Bill, because it would be directed towards eliminating only those restrictive trade practices which are unfair.  While I agree that that is the purpose of the Bill, may I say that I do not mind what name is given to it&mdash;whether Restrictive Trade Practices or Unfair Trade Practices or <Col N="682" /> the Confirmation of Plato Bill or any other name Senators may suggest&mdash;so long as the effect is the same.  But I do not agree with Senator O'Donnell's approach that legislation should be confined to the types of practices which we are agreed are unfair.  We must assume that all combinations among traders to regulate trade are suspect and must only be allowed to operate when, after examination, they are deemed to be beneficial to the community. May I say in that regard that I was completely taken aback by Senator O'Donnell's statement that some associations which have a particular interest in the Bill were not given an opportunity of expressing their objections to it.  I know of no such organisation. Any trade organisation or association that wished to make representations or suggest amendments was given ample opportunity of doing so.</P>
    <P>There was no attempt on my part to rush the Bill through the Legislature. It was introduced last summer and circulated while the Dáil was in recess and was under public discussion for many weeks before the Second Reading was taken in the Dáil.  During those weeks a very large number of trade associations sent delegations to the Department of Industry and Commerce to express their views on the Bill.  Some I met personally, some I was not able to meet personally; but no trade organisation was denied that right.</P>
    <P>When Senator Douglas urges that this Bill should be confined to designated practices which are admittedly wrong and anti-social, my answer is that the fair trade commission should be asked to regard every arrangement between traders which is restrictive of competition with suspicion, to regard it as something which should not be allowed unless a very strong case can be made by those who devised it that it serves some useful public purpose.  I do not deny that many restrictive practices in trade can be justified or can be shown not to be anti-social in their effect, to be designed to eliminate possible abuses or improve the standard of service given to the public or to minimise distribution costs.  The onus of proof is, however, on those who make that <Col N="683" /> claim.  If they have practices which  their total effect restrict competition in any case, then they have got to show some impartial body that they are justifiable on one or other of these grounds.  If they are so justifiable, however, I think they should be allowed to operate, and I cannot conceive circumstances under which the Dáil would legislate to eliminate any established practice in any trade unless it could be clearly shown, following investigation, to be detrimental to the public interest.</P>
    <P>When Senator McGuire said that the individual manufacturer should be allowed to decide for himself whether he will sell his goods to wholesalers only or to retailers only or direct to consumers, I am in complete agreement with him.  When he argues that a producer or a wholesaler should not be required to sell goods to some retailer who is not creditworthy, I am also in agreement with him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Or someone he believed not to be creditworthy.  Does any Senator seriously believe that it is possible that a Minister would make an Order relating to these matters and prohibiting a manufacturer deciding his trading policy in a matter of that kind or requiring him to supply goods to people who could not pay for them, and bring that Order to the Houses of the Oireachtas and get it confirmed here?  It just could not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the arguments of that kind advanced during the course of this debate appear to be based on a misreading of the terms of the Bill and certainly to be a misunderstanding of them.  One of the matters to which Senator McGuire referred and in which I am personally very interested is the practice of some traders in selling goods at less than they cost them in order to attract trade to their establishments or to discourage other people selling the same goods.  That &ldquo;loss leader&rdquo; practice which Senator McGuire had in mind is, from many <Col N="684" /> points of view, a restrictive practice. Under the laws of the United States of America it is in fact banned as restrictive. A trader under American laws may not sell goods at less than they cost him, for the purpose of confining trade in those goods to himself or restricting competition in them.  I do not think there is any provision in this Bill which will operate to encourage the development of practices of that kind, which could themselves be as restrictive of competition as the more direct activities of trade associations.</P>
    <P>Senator Douglas asked for an example of fair trading rules, the type of rules that might be made by the commission under Sections 4 and 5.  I am somewhat hesitant about the desirability of giving an example, but in the course of the debate in the Dáil I mentioned many types of complaints of restrictive practices on which I personally had considerable doubts.  I told the Senate that petrol was the commodity in respect of which most complaints had been received, complaints that oil companies were refusing to supply petrol for retail sale to people who wanted to enter into that business, and refusing it unreasonably.</P>
    <P>I think that it is necessary to have rules relating to the retail distribution of petrol; I think there are strong arguments against allowing petrol to be sold by public-houses or hotels or any establishment which is not <i>bona fide</i> engaged in the business of servicing motor cars, any establishment which is unable to provide for motorists other facilities in addition to a supply of petrol.  At least, I think that it should be possible for those who are engaged in that business to put up strong arguments in favour of confining retail sales of petrol to persons who are engaged in the business of operating motor garages and for refusing supplies for retail sale to persons engaged in the business of running public-houses.  If I mention that by way of illustration, I again want to make it clear that I am not prejudging any decision that the fair trade commission may take on any proposition that comes before them.</P>
    <P>One could multiply the number of examples of trade practices which, <Col N="685" /> though restrictive in their effect, may have another consequence.  The best known retail price maintenance agreement applies to cigarettes and tobacco.  It has been operating for many years.  The tobacco manufacturers give supplies of cigarettes to retailers on agreements that they will retail them at the prices fixed by the manufacturers.  Before the war, when some establishments were selling cigarettes at less than the prices fixed by manufacturers, there was, so far as my recollection goes, public antagonism to these price-cutters because of the effect which the development of the practice might have on the standard of living of other retailers and the standard of remuneration of their staffs.  Whether it is desirable that we should make illegal these retail price maintenance agreements of tobacco manufacturers or not is a subject on which I would be slow to make up my mind, until I received the report of this commission following a very full investigation of the subject.</P>
    <P>Many Senators said that this Bill is increasing the area of State control. I would like the House to be clear as to my attitude to that issue.  Since I resumed office as Minister for Industry and Commerce, I have been busily engaged in demolishing the structure of controls which was built up during the war and which I found more or less intact when I resumed office in 1951, and, if anything, somewhat more complicated.  The business of getting rid of control is not, however, quite so easy as some Senators appear to think, and if anyone has any doubt on that subject I will merely mention the subject of price control, on which I have come long ago to the opinion that it would be generally desirable, certainly in its long-run effect, if the whole apparatus of emergency price control were now dispensed with.</P>
    <P>There is no point in getting rid of Government controls, and particularly Government price controls, if combinations of traders are immediately going to get together to impose their own controls, and a necessary preliminary to the demolishing of State regulation arrangements in any trade, and particularly <Col N="686" /> these special powers of price control conferred on the Government by emergency legislation, is the enactment of legislation of this kind which will give a means of ensuring that State control is not replaced by the control of private traders concerned only with their own interests.</P>
    <P>When, just before Christmas, I met the Federated Milk Suppliers of the Republic, as the organisation is called, to discuss the price of milk and the price of butter, I suggested to the organisation that one thing the Government might do was to decontrol milk and butter and get completely out of the picture of trading in these commodities. Immediately, the whole conference began to discuss, not the consequences of free unrestricted competition in the trade, but what arrangements the Federated Milk Suppliers' organisation might make in order to replace Government control by a control of their own. In many trades, these Government controls are being maintained because they are necessary in order to prevent a much more objectionable type of control by the people engaged in these trades.</P>
    <P>This is not an issue between socialism and private enterprise.  Socialism is essentially monopolistic and one cannot conceive a situation in which the State might engage in any type of business without eventually having to eliminate all competitors in that business. The history of the E.S.B. is a case in point.  The purpose of this Bill is to induce or to compel those who are always talking about the advantage of private enterprise to let it work, because it is they, by their private arrangements, their cartels, combinations, trade associations and restrictive practices who are depriving the people of the benefits which, I believe, private enterprise could confer on them.  Instead of this Bill being an extension of State socialism, it is the very reverse.  It is a Bill designed to ensure that private enterprise will be allowed to function properly.</P>
    <P>Many Senators appear, however, to be under a complete misapprehension as to the powers given either to the Minister or the fair trade commission <Col N="687" /> by the Bill.  These powers have been described as drastic, unprecedented and liable to cause a complete disorganisation of trade.  The only power the commission has under the Bill is the power to hold an inquiry and make a report following on the inquiry.  It has no other power whatever.  It cannot interfere in any trade; it cannot arraign any trader as a criminal before it, as Senator McGuire suggested; and it cannot condemn any trader without being heard, as he alleged.  It can hold an inquiry into the operation of restrictive practices and report on the nature and consequences of these practices.</P>
    <P>That report, when it is received by the Minister, is published to the Oireachtas and no action can follow from the inquiry until the report has been published, and then, if the Minister decides it to be necessary, he makes an Order, an Order based upon the report of the commission relating to the matter which the commission investigated, an Order directed towards ensuring the elimination of practices which the commission decided were anti-social or undesirable.  Even that Order has no effect unless the Houses of the Oireachtas decide to confirm it by a Bill and the Houses of the Oireachtas are sovereign in this regard. If they decide that the public interest requires that an Order of that kind should be made the law of the land, it settles the question of public interest. There is no longer any question of a conflict of opinion in that regard.  The opinion of the people of the country in that matter is settled by a majority vote in the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donnell is completely wrong when he talks about the extraordinary powers given to the Minister &mdash;this power to write into an Order any provision he thinks fit.  The Minister could spend the rest of his life thinking of provisions; he could lie awake at night trying to devise new provisions; and he could slip secretly off to the Kremlin and get their advice as to the provisions he might insert in an Order in order to destroy private enterprise&mdash;and the effect would be nil. <Col N="688" /> Nothing would happen as a result of the making of that Order, until the Parliament of the country decided that an Order of that kind was necessary and should be confirmed and declared it to be the law.</P>

      <P>It is often much harder to convince my own Party of the desirability of a particular course than to convince the Houses of the Oireachtas subsequently.  If their examination of the proposal is to be the safeguard, it will be a very effective safeguard. Everybody knows that Governments in this matter do not try to move in advance of public opinion.  They have to feel that they can convince the ordinary man and woman of the country that the course they are taking is reasonably designed to serve the general national interest, and, if they do not succeed in doing that, they are soon replaced by another Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not true, as Senator Douglas suggested, that the commission is only required to give an opinion.  It has to do something more than give an opinion&mdash;it has to ascertain the facts relating to a particular restrictive practice in any trade, but, having ascertained the facts, it has to give its opinion whether these restrictive practices have operated, are operating or might conceivably operate to the public detriment.  That opinion, no doubt, will be influenced by the views expressed to them by those who have been supporting the practices or those who have been the victims of the practices, or any members of the public who may have come in contact with them.  Neither the Minister nor the Oireachtas is bound to accept the views of the commission.  If they think that the commission was misled or recommended courses of action which <Col N="689" /> were impracticable or not regarded as necessary, then the Minister, subject to his feeling confident that he can justify that course to the Dáil or Seanad, can refuse to make an Order and, if he does make an Order, the Oireachtas can still refuse to confirm it.</P>
    <P>Objection has been taken to the proposal that the commission should be empowered to hold an inquiry through the medium of one member only.  The Bill does not provide, as Senator Hayes suggested, that an inquiry will be held by one member only.  The commission may decide, however, and is empowered to decide, to hold an inquiry by one or more of its members, and the only purpose of putting that provision in the Bill was to offer an opportunity of more expeditious action in relation to minor investigations.</P>
    <P>I am quite certain that any intelligent commission will decide that an inquiry into some matter of general interest such as the distribution of petrol or other practices in trades which can have widespread repercussions must be held by all the members of the commission, but it is desirable to frame the legislation so as to make it possible for the commission to have two or three inquiries proceeding simultaneously when they are not of a complicated character or are not widespread in their effects.  The report which will be made to the Minister and published to the Oireachtas will be the report of the whole commission. The function of the member holding the inquiry will be merely to ascertain the facts.  The report and recommendations of the commission will be based on the outcome of the inquiry but it will be made by the whole commission.</P>

      <P>The power of adding a temporary member was to permit of <Col N="690" /> the possibility of a person with specialised technical knowledge being added to the commission for the purpose of a particular inquiry.  It is inconceivable that that power would be used for any other purpose.  There was unlimited power to add temporary members as the Bill was introduced in the Dáil. The rather fantastic suggestion that the Government might want to pack the commission by putting on a very large number of temporary members caused me to accept an amendment to confine it to one member at one particular time.  The idea was to give something in the nature of a technical assessor to deal with matters in relation to a trade in respect of which knowledge and experience would be an advantage.</P>
      <P>Senator McGuire also said something else which indicated a misunderstanding of what was intended.  He said that traders would be arraigned before the tribunal and he urged that they should be allowed their costs if, in fact, the tribunal acquitted them of anti-social practices.  No individual or no organisation would have the right to arraign a trader or group of traders before the commission.  The commission decides whether an inquiry is necessary.  An individual or a group or a public body may urge on the commission that an inquiry is necessary but whether the inquiry is to be held or not is a decision of the commission and presumably the commission will not decide to hold an inquiry unless there is <i>prima facie</i> evidence that it is required and that there are undesirable restrictive practices in operation. Therefore, it seems to me that Senator McGuire's criticism of the Bill in that regard was the result of a misunderstanding of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides that, when the Minister has made an Order, a confirming Act has to be submitted to the Dáil and Seanad.  That Act, I contemplate, will be similar to those passed from time to time imposing customs duties under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act.  It is not intended to nor did I contemplate that the Orders themselves should be subject to amendment in the Dáil or Seanad.  The Dáil or Seanad would <Col N="691" /> have the right to revoke the Order if they thought it was undesirable, but the general aim was to ensure that the debate in each House would be confined to the Second Reading of the Bill, that each Bill would be a one Stage Bill designed to maintain the power of the Dáil to confirm or annul but not to give the power to amend.</P>
    <P>The Bill could have been framed as other Bills were framed to give the Minister power to make Orders following on the receipt of the report of the inquiry which might be annulled by a resolution in either House, but I came to the conclusion that these matters were of such considerable importance they might affect in a definite way so many things in the community and that there should be a positive act of confirmation.  I think it would be foolish to provide for a detailed reexamination of the Orders by the Houses of the Oireachtas much less to provide, as Senator Hayes suggested, for joint committees to examine them.</P>
    <P>No Order will be made until there has been a public inquiry, until the report of that inquiry has been formally published in a report to the Oireachtas and until the Minister concerned, having studied that report, has decided to make an Order.  It would be an unnecessary complication of procedure at that stage to have a further examination of the whole position.</P>

I want to quote an old Irish proverb: &ldquo;There is no sense in keeping a dog and barking yourself.&rdquo;  What is the purpose of setting up a special body with special powers which will conduct an inquiry and publish a report if there is to be another inquiry here later?  It is on the basis of that inquiry we should act rather than to go over the whole ground again.</P>

      <P>The Senator's indignation at this Bill might have been conceivably more allayed if he had read it with greater care.  There is no question of an appeal.  Nobody has committed an offence until an Act is passed.  There is no question about the right of appeal.  If somebody is charged with the offence of doing something which is prohibited by an Act and is convicted in a court, then he has all the rights of appeal under the law which he has in respect of any other class of offence.  At that stage the court has to decide whether a specific provision of a specific law of the Oireachtas has been contravened. If, on that question of fact, the court finds him guilty he is entitled to appeal and to keep on appealing so long as he has money enough to enjoy the process.  Senator O'Donnell's observation seems to be based on the same misunderstanding as Senator McGuire's criticism, a misunderstanding as to the procedure prescribed by the Bill.  A trader or an association of traders commit no offence until a Bill has been passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas declaring some practice of theirs to be an offence.</P>

That would be making a sort of super-parliament out of the courts.  Once we have declared what the law is, and the trader is charged with breaking that law, he has the right to appeal from any decision of any court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>He is only guilty if the court decides he is guilty.  Senator <Col N="693" /> O'Brien said that, outside this Bill, there are a number of trade restrictions, protective measures, public monopolies, trade union regulations and in the services of banking, insurance and the various professions.  That is all true, I think.  Where we imposed protective duties and restricted competition in trades thereby we did so because, in our wisdom, we thought it was in the general public interest to do so.  There may be, and frequently, there is a question as to whether the protective measures should be maintained or modified, but any decision to be taken in that respect has got to be taken in the Houses of the Oireachtas, where the original decision was made.  We do not want a commission to tell us what the public interest is in matters of that kind.</P>
      <P>Similarly, we have to be allowed to decide whether it is in the public interest to establish a monopoly and to give some monopolist organisation like C.I.E. the powers necessary for the conduct of particular services; then we have done so because we decided that the public interest was being served.  It would be foolish to have investigation of the justification for that monopoly by an outside commission, and, if that monopoly is to be withdrawn or to be weakened in any way, it has to be done by amending legislation, and that is our job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to trade unions, it is quite true that they impose restrictions in many trades, but again the law of the land says that trade unions shall be allowed to operate and shall enjoy certain privileges, and trade unions are defined in that law as bodies established for the purpose of imposing restrictions on the employment of workers and in their relations with their employers.  So far as the law of the country is concerned, we sanction the operation of these trade unions for the express purpose of imposing restrictions in various trades.  It may be that some of the restrictions are undesirable in our opinion.  There are many restrictions of that kind which operate in particular trades which, while they protect the interest of trade union members, may be detrimental to the <Col N="694" /> interest of the community as a whole, or even of other trade unions.  As far as trade unions are concerned, it is quite clear that they are in a special position.  These trade associations with which this Bill is concerned are not sanctioned by law to operate restrictions, while trade unions are.  If there is to be withdrawal of or limitation of trade unions' powers, it has to be done by amendment of the Trades Unions Act.  In my view, that is not a suitable matter for consideration by the type of organisation that we are proposing to establish under this Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to banking, insurance and other services, I decided not to extend this Bill to cover services primarily because I had received no complaint of the operation of restrictive trade practices in them.  There may have been other reasons as well&mdash;certain legal difficulties which would have arisen if we attempted to extend this Bill to cover them.  The only case where I have received a definite complaint of the operation of restrictive practices in relation to services concerned the provision of hire-purchase facilities, and the Bill has been extended to cover services ancillary to the distribution of goods.  I have often received complaints from individuals that the banks would not increase their overdrafts or refused them overdraft accommodation, but whether these were restrictive practices or not is another question.  In any event, the laws which we have already passed relating to banking and insurance give us adequate safeguards against the development of undesirable practices in these businesses, and if these laws require amendment it is open to us to do it.</P>
    <P>In the case of professions, we have enacted laws to confine the profession of medicine to those qualified in a particular way.  The law also confines the practice of dentistry to those who are qualified in accordance with certain regulations.  Wherever public interest is involved, we have never hesitated to pass legislation to restrict practice in these professions to the people who are qualified to do so.</P>
    <P>There is one matter I should particularly like to deal with, because it is <Col N="695" /> one of general interest.  Senator O'Brien asked why we are legislating to exclude members of the Dáil and Seanad from membership of statutory boards and companies.  That is something upon which the practice of this State has changed over the course of years.  In earlier enactments no such prohibition appeared, and from time to time members of the Dáil and Seanad have acted as Government-appointed directors upon statutory boards and various statutory bodies.  The experience over the years has, however, suggested that it was in the public interest that the practice should be changed and I understand that the changed practice has met with the general approval of almost all Party leaders in the State.  Members of the Dáil and Seanad are politicians&mdash;I am not using the term in any offensive sense&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and people with political affiliations of one kind or another.  The essential characteristic of a politician is that he is approachable, and a politician who is not approachable will soon cease to be an active one.  It is not desirable that members of the fair trading commission should be regarded by the public as being approachable in the sense that a member of the Dáil or Seanad is approachable.  No politician, no matter how tenuous his connection with his Party may be, is completely unconscious of the possible Party political effect of any course of action he may take.  It is quite likely that some of the reports from this fair trading commission will have political effects in a Party sense and may be regarded as good reports, designed and framed with a very clear appreciation of the public interest, or else may be regarded in the contrary sense by groups of citizens, often influential groups, whose particular interest would be adversely affected by their appearance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a number of reasons it is undesirable that we should have politicians or persons regarded as politicians on bodies of this kind.  Even if we could <Col N="696" /> pick from the Dáil or Seanad people who would be completely fearless in the discharge of the duties attached to the office, and completely objective in their approach to these duties, they would still be suspect in the public minds as being capable of being influenced by their political associations or by the possible political consequences of what they recommend.  Furthermore, members of the Houses of the Oireachtas should not be put into the position in which they would be and could be required to defend in the Dáil or Seanad the actions of the body of which they are members.  It is inevitable that, if there was a member of the Seanad attached to the fair trading commission, or any other public body of a similar kind, he would find himself required to defend the action of that body or, possibly, to indicate that he was not in agreement with some action upon which the majority of his colleagues decided.  He would be open to be questioned in the Dáil or Seanad concerning the motives for taking a particular course of action.  He would frequently be regarded as being more authoritative on that subject than the Minister concerned, which would hurt the Minister's prestige.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, it protects the Government in office from the pressure that might be put upon it to appoint particular members because of the advantages that course would confer on them in the Party sense.  I have only to point to the present situation in the Dáil to enable Senators to see how giving the Government power to reward political support in either House by appointment to a well-remunerated position on a statutory body might work.  May I say, too, that it is very great protection for a Minister to be able to say to any Senator or Deputy who approaches him for an appointment: &ldquo;Well, the law says I cannot ...&rdquo; Even though it deprives the State of the services on these bodies of men who are highly qualified by character and experience to occupy these posts, nevertheless, the weight of evidence and my experience supports the retention of this bar in Bills of this kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Government (Mr. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is intended to supplement the measures taken by this Government and previous Governments to deal with the exceptional circumstances prevailing in the western areas.  The necessity for such <Col N="698" /> measures has been the subject of full debate in this House and in the Dáil during the consideration of previous legislation designed to eliminate, or at least to ameliorate the difficulties inevitably associated with the failure of industrial development in the western counties, to keep pace with such development elsewhere throughout the country.  While I am sure that Senators do not need statistics to convince them that the western counties require our special attention, and that it is not necessary to relate again the full background against which the Bill is being considered, it is perhaps appropriate to refer to a number of the salient features of this background.</P>
      <P>Remoteness from the main centres of consumption and the lack of indigenous raw material have combined to make industrial development in the western areas a matter of peculiar difficulty, and the fact is that in these areas the proportion of the population engaged in industrial employment is less than one-half of the proportion for the country as a whole.  With the level of industrial employment thus significantly lower than elsewhere and with non-industrial employment insufficient to absorb the available labour force, emigration came to be traditionally regarded as the only solution of the problem.</P>
      <P>It is clearly a matter of the most urgent importance that all possible steps should be taken to provide an ultimate solution.  It is only by the provision of suitable employment at home that emigration can be checked. In particular, no opportunity must be neglected of promoting in the areas a wider variety of employment, with emphasis on the provision of industrial employment.  To the extent to which it does not spontaneously present itself the opportunities of creating the means of employment must be sought out and developed.  Positive steps to this end have already been taken by the Government.  An example was the provision under the Undeveloped Areas Act, 1952, of substantial financial assistance to encourage the establishment of industries in the undeveloped areas in the West.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Industrial activity, based on agricultural <Col N="699" /> products, appears to afford the greatest prospect of successful development in the western counties, and it is on this assumption that the scheme covered by the present Bill has been put forward.  The natural wealth of these areas consists almost entirely of extensive peat bogs, and considerable progress has been made in the development of these bogs for the production of fuel for many years to come.  If left unworked, these bogs will merely continue to grow peat-producing vegetation which will add only slightly to the potential fuel supply.  The value of these bogs, and their contribution to the economic development of the western areas in particular, and of the country generally, would be immeasurably enhanced if it could be shown that, by drainage and cultivation, they could be utilised for the production of agricultural crops suitable for subsequent drying or other industrial processing.</P>
    <P>Grass crops have already been grown experimentally on drained bogland. The primary purpose of the present measure is to enable further, full-scale experimental work to be undertaken to demonstrate the possibilities for the economic utilisation of drained bogland on a commercial basis.  For this purpose it is proposed to set up a limited company, Min-Fhéir Teóranta, to acquire, drain and cultivate bogland in the Bangor-Erris area of County Mayo, and to process grass and other plants for sale.  If and when required, Min-Fhéir Teóranta will have the benefit of the technical advice and assistance of Bord na Móna, as well as of Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann Teóranta, who have already undertaken experiments in the cultivation of drained bogland in other areas.</P>
    <P>Whilst the Bill was being debated in the Dáil, some Deputies suggested that the company should devote its attention to the growing of crops other than grass.  It is my intention that grass will be used as the pioneer crop during the years which must elapse before a cultivated bog soil deep enough to grow other crops is produced.  The Bill is sufficiently wide in its scope to <Col N="700" /> permit the company to engage in the production of such crops as it may itself decide in the light of its experience.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned in the Dáil, the company might also undertake the growing of medicinal herbs, which are in short supply, and some of which can possibly be grown more successfully on drained bogland than elsewhere.  I am reliably informed that, even at the present time, there is growing on bogland and on other types of poor land in the West of Ireland very valuable plants capable of being distilled or otherwise processed to produce valuable commercial products used for medicinal and aromatic purposes generally.</P>
    <P>The scheme is in the nature of an experiment, and it is not possible, therefore, nor is it desirable, to attempt to anticipate the method of working which may be adopted by the new company.  It is obvious, however, that two or three years may elapse before grass is available in sufficient quantities to justify the economic operations of a full-scale drying plant, and other methods of disposing of the crop may have to be adopted during this initial period.  It would be idle also to suggest that even the most successful outcome of the experiment would automatically solve the problem of industrial employment in remote western areas.  As has already been indicated, the purpose of the experiment is to demonstrate the commercial possibilities for the successful cultivation of drained bogland, and it is the intention that expenditure by Min-Fhéir Teóranta during the experimental period should be limited to the amount necessary for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Several considerations influenced the choice of the Bangor-Erris area for this experiment.  Firstly, it is in the heart of one of the most extensive peat areas in the country, and Bord na Móna are in process of acquiring a substantial area of bog there (about 20,000 acres), out of which the much smaller area of 2,000 acres required for the grass meal experiment could readily be made available without in any way interfering with the plans for turf production. In fact, I have been informed that at <Col N="701" /> least 2,000 acres would not be suitable for Bord na Móna purposes.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the larger area of choice would permit the selection of a location suitable for the use of the mechanical equipment proposed to be used.  Finally, as the ultimate objective in the bog development at Bangor-Erris was the erection by the E.S.B. of a peat-fired electricity generating station, the availability of any electric power required for the industrial processes would be ensured.</P>
    <P>Grass meal is used here mainly as a constituent in the manufacture of compound feeding stuffs, for which purpose there is a demand both at home and for export.  Grass meal may also be used as a source of chlorophyll, a substance now used extensively in pharmaceutical preparations, and it may be possible to develop a new export market for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the plant for the extraction of chlorophyll would necessitate a capital outlay to set up an economic industrial organisation of something in the neighbourhood of £500,000.  I have no method of assessing whether that is an accurate estimate, but my source of information is reliable and I have no reason to believe that chlorophyll could be produced economically in sufficient quantity at less than £500,000 even though some people in the country maintain that it could be produced economically at less than that.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that, approximately, 4,000 tons of grass meal will be produced annually and that, on the basis of present costs and prices, the company, when in full production, will operate at a profit.  Adopting the least favourable figures, the grass meal is estimated to cost £22 7s. per ton at plant against the current delivered sale price of £31 to £34 per ton, according to quality.</P>
    <P>Some comment was made in the Dáil about the discrepancy of cost per ton between grass meal produced by the proposed company and the grass meal as at present produced, but Senators will observe that I have referred to the sum of £22 7s. as cost per ton at plant.  There would also have to be taken into consideration the cost of bagging and other costs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="702" /> On the question of a market for the grass meal, it was suggested in the Dáil that the domestic requirement of this commodity cannot be expected to absorb more than 7,000 tons annually, and that other producers are in a position to produce 5,000 tons.  In this connection, I wish to point out that, in 1948, which, as far as I am aware, was the first year in which grass meal was produced commercially in this country as a constituent for feeding stuffs, production was of the order of 650 tons.  Last year the total production was about 4,000 tons.  That increase in that comparatively short period was achieved without any wide publicity campaign on behalf of the producers.</P>
    <P>I believe, therefore, that there is still ample scope for the production of grass meal as a constituent in compound feeding stuffs.  I would like at this stage to assure Senators, however, that it is not intended that the Bangor-Erris project should be used to prejudice existing producers of grass meal.</P>
    <P>Capital expenditure on the grass meal project is estimated to amount to approximately £165,000, and provision is made in the Bill for the making of grants up to this amount out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  Senators will be aware that the Minister for External Affairs informed the Dáil on the 10th June, 1952, that proposals for the utilisation of moneys in the Grant Counterpart Special Account were sent on the 4th June, 1952, to the American Ambassador for transmission to the United States authorities.  These proposals included the grass meal project, for which it was proposed that £150,000 be provided from the Grant Counterpart Special Account to meet capital expenditure.  Irrespective of the outcome of this proposal for the use of counterpart funds, it is intended that capital expenditure on the project should be met in the first instance out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the Bill, the activities of the new company are restricted to the processing of grass and other plants, but there is provision under which licences may be granted to the company permitting it to manufacture other products suitable <Col N="703" /> for use as animal feeding stuffs or fertilisers.  The licensing provision in this Bill might be described as merely precautionary.</P>
    <P>In introducing the Bill in the Dáil, I mentioned that one of the products that might be produced under this licensing provision was seaweed meal but no decision has been taken with regard to its production.  That will be a matter for the new company, having regard to their experience and having regard to the chances of producing seaweed meal on a commercial basis.  One of the major obstacles to the development of the production of seaweed meal up to now has been the absence of a suitable organisation within a reasonable distance from the source of supply of the seaweed, adapted to undertake the actual drying and grinding processes.  The occasion of the introduction of legislation to provide for the production of grass meal has been availed of to provide that the proposed new organisation might undertake, under licence, the production of seaweed meal.  That, however, is not its primary function and if a decision were taken to introduce a comprehensive scheme of seaweed meal production, separate provision would have to be made for the financing of such a scheme.  There is no financial provision for it in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House because I think it shows an earnest of our desire to deal seriously with the problem of creating work and maintaining the people on the land in the West of Ireland.  Furthermore if, as a result of this experiment we can illustrate that the utilisation of the extensive tracts of bogland in the West is economically feasible, we will have achieved something really worthwhile.</P>
    <P>No doubt, Senators familiar with conditions in the West, and particularly where congestion is concerned, having regard to the immense tracts of bogland that are available, particularly in this Bangor-Erris area, are aware that it can be readily accepted that, if we can show that bogland can be used successfully to grow crops, it will in some measure&mdash;and I suggest in some significant measure&mdash;tend towards the solution of what appears to be now an <Col N="704" /> almost insurmountable problem of relieving congestion.  Therefore, from every point of view I recommend the Bill to the House and I hope that it will meet with the approval of Senators.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a small and simple looking measure.  I welcome it and venture to prophesy that, simple as it appears, it may after some time be written down as one of the most important proposals that has come before the Oireachtas sinces this State was established.  I believe that it may rank with the introduction of the original Shannon Scheme Bill by Deputy McGilligan away back in 1925. The Parliamentary Secretary and his colleagues on the other side of the House may be rather surprised at such a statement coming from me.  Perhaps even the Parliamentary Secretary himself would be hesitant to make such a claim for the Bill.  I suppose I was brought up closer to the bog than he was.  I probably know something more about it and I venture to say that the effort which he is making now in a new way to develop the peat bogs of Ireland will leave a mark on the country that just at the moment we can hardly foresee.</P>
      <P>I heard about this proposal first&mdash;I am going to make a confession&mdash;during the by-election in North Mayo.  I think someone spoke about it down there.  I had made the long trek from Cavan to North Mayo, probably 140 or 150 miles, across what seemed to me a very neglected country.  My first reaction, when I heard of the proposal to grow grass in the bogs in Mayo was: &ldquo;Why do the people who are talking like that not teach the farmers how to grow grass over all the area I passed to-day?&rdquo; That was a natural reaction, as that is the truth of the situation as we see it in the country to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was somewhat surprised when I discovered it was the Minister for Industry and Commerce who was fathering these proposals and not the Minister for Agriculture.  I thought it would be essentially and fundamentally the job of the Minister for Agriculture to start with the experimentation of growing grass in the bog, but lo and behold, the responsibility is passed over to the Minister for Industry and <Col N="705" /> Commerce.  Anyone looking at the countryside and its neglected appearance could not but react as I did.  We have not been taught how to grow grass on the mineral soils of the country and the signs of it are to be seen on the face of the country to-day&mdash;it is just as grave as the face of the dead Stalin.</P>
    <P>I have changed my mind inside the last week.  I made a journey down to the bogs in the Roscommon-Galway area, where Comhlucht Siúicre Eireann have taken over 2,000 acres and are experimenting in the growing of grass. It was a revelation to me.  I would suggest to Senators to take the first opportunity to make an excursion to those bogs and see for themselves.  I would like them to do that soon, as in a very short time the land of the country will begin to change its appearance. It would be better for them to make the journey before the land has changed its coat.  From where I left my fields until I got to Ballyforan, a distance of 80 miles, I did not see a green patch; and away in the distance I could see what the Sugar Company have achieved.  They have taken over approximately 2,000 acres, a vast territory in a part of the country that, in its way, is almost as remote from the point of view of the rest of Ireland as Siberia is from Georgia, the birthplace of Stalin.  I saw an area in this bog where there was a lake only a short time after these people entered in upon it.  Now they are growing grass on virgin bog that was sown down only in September last.  With a colleague, I ploughed across the area and as we went along, we had almost to hold each other up.  In places, the water was coming up to the laceholes of our boots and yet that beautiful grass was growing with a vigour and a vitality that was truly astonishing.</P>
    <P>A scientific approach has been made by the men in charge of this work down there.  We met one of these young men and I have to comment very favourably on the interest they have displayed in what has been done and the very considerable capacity and appreciation of the possibilities which they have shown.  The Parliamentary Secretary has that before him.  In a way it looks <Col N="706" /> almost like a miracle, but it has been and is being done.  These people have their grass-drying plant set up in a building there which a little while ago could be reached only by the birds.  It was the first time I was in the heart of the bog of Allen.  In my part of the country, we judge the coming of winter by the flight of the wild geese crossing over to the bog and somewhere in that locality they establish their abode, a region where all this work has been accomplished with the marvellous machines which the Sugar Company had been able to construct and reconstruct.</P>
    <P>From what I saw and from what I know of producing young grass, what the Parliamentary Secretary is proposing is not a probability or a possibility but something which has been definitely established already and I congratulate the pioneers who have done this work. It is true that in other countries a great deal more is known about the development and cultivation of peat bogs than we know.  On the other hand, we know what was achieved here in generations past in the reclamation of bogland.  The total areas reclaimed, however, were comparatively small in relation to what we have available.</P>
    <P>So impressed was I by what I saw and so impressed was I by the possibilities that I feel that when giving our blessing to this Bill, what the nation has to consider, if it is satisfied that this is possible of achievement, is the immediate question of the future utilisation of our peat bogs.  We are thinking of peat now as a source of power.  We can produce electricity from it and it can be burned in all sorts of ways.  Under the Parliamentary Secretary's Department the Electricity Supply Board and Bord na Móna are functioning.  In the bad days of the landlords, the small farmers had to burn the top soil to produce crops, and I suggest that, before we extend the activities of Bord na Móna very much further in burning the bogs to produce power, we give consideration to whether these bogs are not capable, under this new type of development, of producing much greater power and away into the generations to come. Before we waste it burning it up, we should study that aspect.  I am satisfied <Col N="707" /> that we have possibilities there for adding 1,500,000 to 2,000,000 acres to the land of this country.</P>
    <P>There were new proposals recently to extend the activities of Bord na Móna into Donegal and West Clare.  In both these regions, there is very considerable congestion.  I understand that the proposals of Comhlucht Siúicre Eireann are to develop the bogs by the production, first, of a grass crop.  It is a technical problem&mdash;the cultivation of the top surface of the bog, its deepening by further cultivation and the encouragement of plant growth which will go down and down and eventually produce a condition in which they will have fertility and humus capable of growing crops of beet or anything else. I believe it is possible, but if that be possible over great areas of the country, in a country like this, where we have spent so much money breaking up the national cake and redividing it by taking congests from the West and breaking up farms in Meath and Westmeath and elsewhere in order to provide new homes, and in the conditions of our agricultural economy to-day, it would be much more fruitful for us to restudy this whole problem in relation to the development of these peat bogs and their conversion into good soil where the foundations of future homes could be laid.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any miracle or any great difficulty about that. There is a problem of capital investment and the employment of labour which is in the country, and that is the sort of thing we ought to face.  Before the Ministry of Industry and Commerce decide to extend the activities of Bord na Móna into the development of electricity in certain new areas, that problem of how we can utilise most profitably the land surface of the country should be adequately studied, and I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he set up some authority, some commission or group of people competent to assess in relation to our whole future the respective values of two types of activity.  We have had difficulties in the past in getting the means to produce power and, in the not-far-distant future, we <Col N="708" /> may be able to import something which one could put into one's pocket, but which will produce atomic energy in quantities more than ample for all our needs.  Before we act foolishly and burn more of the top soil, I suggest that we see it would not produce much more power for animal and man by its utilisation in this form.</P>
    <P>I am not pretending that this is a simple operation but I believe that it is possible of achievement.  That fact, I think, has already been established and there is plenty data in relation to what has been accomplished in other countries to draw upon.  While it is true that the Parliamentary Secretary is able to draw on whatever facilities Bord na Móna and Comhlucht Siúicre Eireann are able to place at his disposal, I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should try to build up the kind of organisation which he would visualise as being the nucleus of something much bigger for the development of these areas in the future.  After all, Mussolini drained the Pontine marshes and settled many families thereon.  That was not a small undertaking.  It added immensely to the happiness of the people in that area and to the productivity of the Italian people in relation to their crops.</P>
    <P>There are a number of efforts which must be made if this plan is to be as successful as it ought to be from the beginning.  There are men here, such as Senator O'Callaghan and others, who understand the difficulties of producing good grasses.  They know what the difficulties are in regard to getting grasses that are suitable to the differrent types of soil.  In this connection our knowledge is rather scant.  In the main, we import grasses from New Zealand and elsewhere.  It is a very strange and remarkable fact that the heaviest yields in grasses to-day are got by farmers who utilise grasses imported from New Zealand.  Some come from Aberystwyth.  These strains of grasses have to be brought here and have to accustom themselves to their new habitat.</P>
    <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary wants to make this enterprise a success, one of the first things he will have to do will be to look out for the most distinguished <Col N="709" /> geneticists he can find in America or in the Australasian countries and bring them here and not be afraid to pay them.  That is the first thing that will have to be done.  While these grasses give quite good returns, it astonishes me how it is possible to bring grasses from so far away as the North Island of New Zealand, plant them in a bog in Bangor-Erris and expect the returns from them which they give in their native environment. I have heard this problem discussed on a number of occasions.</P>
    <P>We have no organisation in this State to-day which is able to do anything in regard to that sort of development.  If you want to go into what our agricultural scientists are doing from the point of view of plant breeding the fact it that we have only one such institution at Glasnevin.  That is all we have got from the point of view of the breeding and cultivation of grasses. We have done nothing whatever about that and we are not preparing to do anything about it.  If the Parliamentary Secretary wants to get the yields from these areas that are necessary for economic production, that is one of the first things he has got to do.  You can produce grass with a relatively high protein content and it may very well be that if you get a scientist of considerable competence he will be able to cross seeds under conditions that will give, perhaps, a 50 per cent. higher protein content from breeding beyond anything available to us at the moment. The whole economics of the undertaking can be altered by that fact.</P>
    <P>I know there was criticism in the other House in regard to the possibilities of doing that.  The question of the total consumption of grass meal in the country was discussed and whether there was a market for it.  One thing is true, that the grass meal produced in the country at the moment is of a rather low protein content.  The Parliamentary Secretary gave us figures. He told us that it was anticipated that grass meal could be produced at the factory at £22 7s. per ton on the bog and that its sale would bring in £30 to £34.  I do not know whether he is talking of £30 per ton in regard to a protein content of 13, 14 or 15 per cent. It is not fair to challenge the Parliamentary <Col N="710" /> Secretary on these matters, but the grass meal that contains anything less than a 15 per cent. protein content would be a rather poor product.</P>
    <P>If you can aim at the production of grass meal in this country of a higher protein content the market for that is assured.  Pig and poultry production requires protein.  In the past, very considerable quantities were imported from the American Continent in one form or another.  All crops on the American Continent are increasing in value and labour costs there are very high.  I cannot see why it is not possible for us under these conditions to produce a protein for animal food as cheaply as it can be produced anywhere on earth.</P>
    <P>I think the harnessing of the different types of scientific information that can be made available to this new organisation will make that possible. The production of grass meal outside Dublin and in two or three other places is from land which, I presume, is rather highly rented.  It is being produced from power that is expensive to-day. On the bog there is power available with which you can produce.  That would be part of the scheme.  I have no idea what the Parliamentary Secretary has in mind in regard to the capital costs of the development per acre, but I imagine that the capital costs in this new region are not going to be anything as expensive as they were for Comhlucht Siúicre Eireann outside Ballyforan.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the Bill was drafted from the angle that this matter was to be approached as an industrial undertaking.  I doubt very much whether it is going to be possible for this new enterprise successfully to cultivate grass without the aid of live stock.  I do not know whether, under this Bill, it is possible for the organisation to go into the market and purchase live stock and so on.  It does not seem to me that there is power to do that.  It does not appear on the face of the Bill so far.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely essential for the better propagation of the grasses, their strengthening and the building up of them to bear that in mind right from <Col N="711" /> the beginning.  We may have to engage in a type of animal husbandry that will help.  Probably the best thing for the full development of these grasses would be to turn live stock on the grass crop early.  I think you will have a much better possibility of full development of the grasses by building up the root system and ensure heavier yields later on.  I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary can do that, but I think he must bear that in mind.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary, however, that he ought not to be diverted from his course in the development of the bogs by talking or thinking about making meal from seaweed.  You are going into what may be a very big enterprise full of significance for the country's future, because there are 4,000,000 acres of bog in the country. I do not know how much of that is capable of development.  There are some thousands of acres of it in my own county, and I know it is true that it is at an altitude that may not be quite suitable for the growing of grass.  As I saw it at Ballyforan, it is a problem of investigation and experimentation. We have hardly a county in the country where we could not add thousands of acres to the existing land.  Perhaps a good many of the farmers who see the grey faces of their own fields might, on seeing green acres of grass growing on the bogs around them, be given an inspiration to do something of the same sort with their own land.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by saying that, if the policy of the Department of Agriculture had been more successful in educating farmers to grow better grass, and if they allowed more research, study and education, the task which is now confronting the Parliamentary Secretary would be comparatively simple.  In the main, most of us are very ignorant of the difficulties he is facing.  Yet, they are capable of solution, because they have been solved by the people of other countries.  I am satisfied that he has a good deal of the information gathered in these countries to draw upon, but I would <Col N="712" /> urge upon him to push ahead on this project with vigour, although there may be many &ldquo;doubting Thomases&rdquo; in his own and in other ranks.  I have no doubt that if it is possible in this generation to start a policy to enable us in a bloodless conquest to add another million acres to this country, it is a battle in which we will be proud to take part.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel considerable satisfaction in the fact that Senator Baxter is in favour of this Bill and the only thing I am sorry for is that he rather took the edge off his enthusiasm by a couple of the remarks which he passed.  It would be rather hard to find anybody who could make a reasonable speech against the Bill, because it was quite evident from the speech made by the Parliamentary Secretary when introducing the measure that it is a Bill largely to relieve unemployment and to remedy the problem of emigration in the western parts of the country.  Senator Baxter, while he was inclined to be complimentary to the Parliamentary Secretary, and while he was inclined to favour the measure, took a peculiar line, I thought.  In saying that, I mean that, after he had spoken very favourably in connection with the measure, he then took the line that there was a danger that developing the bogs for producing electrical current might be detrimental to the development of the bog for grass meal production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking his own figure of 4,000,000 acres of bog yet to be developed, it is surely a long way off, and, in fact, I think it is doubtful if we would ever reach the stage when we would have to decide on curtailing the development of bogs for electricity production because it constituted a danger to the continuing production of grass meal. I would go further and say that these two propositions should work hand in hand, and in any further development that we may have or propose to have for the utilisation of bogland in grass meal production or for any other purposes, we must at the same time develop bogs for electricity production. In any development we are likely to have in the future, one of the principal <Col N="713" /> problems will be the supply of adequate electrical current.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter also suggested that it might be advisable in connection with a scheme of this kind that at the outset we should operate this scheme with a plan to produce live stock.  At the same time, Senator Baxter says that he has seen first-class grass produced by the Irish Sugar Company. I take it that this grass plan has not been produced with the production of live stock in view at all.  I do not say that live-stock production from such grass would be a bad thing eventually, but, as the Parliamentary Secretary has explained, this is an experiment and if a good class grass can be produced in one part of the country in bogland without the introduction of the live-stock element, then it could be produced in another area.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that the Bill ought to have the whole-hearted support of every member of the Oireachtas. It has been criticised in the Dáil and it is only natural that it would be criticised here, but it will serve a useful purpose.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter spent some time on the bog area developed by the Irish Sugar Company.  I have not been there but I have read about it and I think that there is every reason to be proud of it.  I believe the people in charge of the Irish Sugar Company, and particularly the managing director, General Costello, deserve to be congratulated on their efforts in connection with the development of bogland, land previously regarded as being useless. As a result of his efforts and the efforts of his board, the lands are now producing crops which are really a matter of amazement to people and it just goes to show what can be done with land.</P>
    <P>I am in agreement with Senator Baxter when he says that there is a lot of land apart from bogland which could be made productive.  The bog he speaks of is on the borders of Roscommon and Galway and he saw land which had been considerably improved by the proper application of agricultural methods.</P>
    <P>In so far as the production of grass is concerned, I am in 100 per cent. agreement with him.  I was amazed <Col N="714" /> when, in the last six months I visited a farm in County Meath, not too far distant from Dublin.  We have all heard arguments that some of these ancient pasture lands could never be brought back to the state when they could produce grass.  I am prepared to say, and would be delighted to show anyone, this farm where the most extraordinary grass is growing as a result of ploughing up some of the old pasturage in County Meath.  The farmer who owns the land is pretty well known to most members and he told me that after he had planted the proper type of seeds and got this splendid grass crop, his only difficulty was to try to finance the buying of cattle to place on it.  Senator Baxter knows who the farmer is and has seen his farm.  It is a great thing that we can agree on something of that kind, that is, that if some of the old pasture land were properly tilled and reseeded we could certainly increase production here by 100 per cent.  That is a fact; there is no doubt about it and that is the case for wheat, oats and every kind of crop.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter said that the only place where experimentation work is carried out is at Glasnevin.  I agree that a lot more experimental work could be done, but I do not think it is right to say, as Senator Baxter did, that the only place where plant experiments are carried out in the country is in Glasnevin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I was in Johnstown, County Waterford, and saw valuable experiments being carried out there in the production of grass and various other crops under the supervision of the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with the future of the peat bogs of the country, I have taken considerable interest in that particular subject for a great many years, and I am very glad to see this particular development in the production of actual crops such as grass, and I can understand seed beet on the actual bog areas once they were properly drained.  I was very much <Col N="715" /> interested at one time in the growing of crops on cutaway bogs.  There is no reason why these two things could not go on hand in hand.  We have a large and considerable area of cutaway bogs in the western areas, and I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary should take particular notice of what could be done with these cutaway bogs.  If we are to have people who are expert in the production of grass and other crops on ordinary bog areas, the same people might be utilised to find out what could be done in a cutaway bog.  I believe that something could be done, probably by the application of ground limestone, which is in plentiful supply in this country at this time, in these cutaway bog areas.</P>
    <P>Before the schemes for electricity have been completely developed, I think notice should be taken of what lands are available.  I hope that during the period of office of the present Parliamentary Secretary we will reach the stage where we would be running short of boglands for the development of electricity.  I hope, and I feel sure, that the present Parliamentary Secretary will be a long time in his present office, but even so, I do not think that he will be there long enough to reach that particular stage of development.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to find Senator Baxter and myself in agreement on this particular measure.  I feel that as a result of this proposal more power will be made available for man and beast in this country.  I believe that every effort of this type which is being made to develop the western areas and the bogland areas deserves the unlimited support of the people of the country and the members of the Oireachtas.  I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on what he has done in this direction and what he is doing under this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on his courage and foresight in introducing a measure of this nature which could, perhaps, be the subject of adverse comment from a great number <Col N="716" /> of people.  Nevertheless, I believe, like Senator Baxter, that there is more in this measure than would be apparent at the moment.  This is an experiment &mdash;a courageous experiment, I might say &mdash;in the development of our boglands and I am confident that the Parliamentary Secretary, with the advice which is now available to him and judging by what has already been done and in the light of the progress already made by Comhlucht Siúicre Eireann in these matters, will have considerable success.  The Comhlucht Siúicre Eireann experiment was a similar venture in East Galway and South Roscommon and the fact that that experiment was successful will lend encouragement to the Parliamentary Secretary to proceed full steam ahead with this scheme. I hope also, and indeed I am confident, that the scheme will not be confined merely to the production of grass meal; that it is merely the beginning and that, when this area is made to produce grass, in the course of four or five years it will be made capable of the production of many other useful crops for live-stock feeding.</P>
      <P>The amount of money involved, while fairly considerable, is yet comparatively small from the point of view of a national expenditure in something which will produce results and will be one of the finest investments ever made.</P>
      <P>I was very pleased to listen to Senator Baxter's contribution to the debate, which was honest, and he admitted that when he first heard of the scheme he was very sceptical but, having educated himself by a visit to the project of Comhlucht Siúicre Eireann in Galway, he was convinced of its success, and he admitted that he was convinced of the prospects of the scheme.  His contribution from the other side of the House will indeed be very helpful, and all Parties will join in wishing the Parliamentary Secretary every success with the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of how best to produce grass, we have had various opinions which have been contrary to each other as to whether or not live stock should be introduced into these lands.  In my opinion, that would be necessary in order to promote the consolidation <Col N="717" /> of the ground where grass seed is to be grown, and it will help to enhance the prospects of the production of other crops.  Without the introduction of cattle and sheep you will not get as good results.  The results would not be as good if you just start cutting the grass immediately for the production of grass meal. Anybody who understands agriculture will agree with that.</P>
    <P>I would like in the course of time to see similar experiments carried out in other parts of the country, especially in those areas where the turf has been cut away and there is a lot of waste land.  There are a couple of thousand acres of such land in the South and West of Ireland, and I hope that as quickly as possible we will get to the stage where these lands can be put back into production and so extend the area of arable land available for the production of crops in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to say a few words with regard to the mechanics of the Bill.  I cannot follow Senator Baxter or Senator Quirke in making forecasts with regard to the future.  However, I do not propose to follow them in that.  I think Senator Baxter's approach to the Bill probably summarises the views of a great number of people.  There was a certain amount of prejudice against the Bill at the start, and possibly there is not the same prejudice now.  I do not know enough about that end of it to talk with anything approaching authority on it, but I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary some questions, first of all, about Section 8 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask him if he will consider inserting an amendment with regard to the directors of the company, to provide that no member of the Dáil or Seanad shall be appointed as a director.  The Tánaiste in this House this afternoon spent some time explaining why a similar provision to the one I am suggesting appeared with regard to the proposed fair trade commission in the Restrictive Trade Practices Bill. I think the Tánaiste was perfectly accurate in the arguments he used.  It <Col N="718" /> has now become accepted by the leaders of all political parties that it is undesirable that members of the Dáil or Seanad should be appointed to positions in any of the State or semi-State companies.  Certainly there is ample precedent for the Parliamentary Secretary to insert the provision in the Bill to preclude members of the Dáil or Seanad, so long as they remain members of either House, from taking positions in companies such as this.  I would strongly urge the Parliamentary Secretary to conform to the precedent established and include a similar provision in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Secondly, with regard to the same section, I want to suggest that Section 8 could be improved somewhat with regard to the appointment and removal of directors of the company. It is provided in Section 8 that directors may be appointed and removed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce after consultation with the Minister for Finance.  I have in the past protested against similar provisions in other Bills and I want to protest against that provision in this Bill.  I have no objection at all&mdash;in fact, I think it is quite right&mdash;that the Minister primarily concerned with the functions of the company should have a say.  Indeed, I would be the first to agree that he should have the appointment of directors, but I think it is unfair and dangerous to leave to one man, or one man in consultation with a political colleague of his, the power of removal of a director from office and I would suggest, for the consideration of the Parliamentary Secretary, that there should be some safeguard inserted in the Bill for directors who might quite conscientiously decide that the policy which they want to see the company pursuing would be different from that which the Minister might recommend.</P>
    <P>Because of a difference of opinion about matters such as that, the Minister should not be put in the position that he can remove a director from office.  That is the position at the moment.  I think the Minister should not have that power of removal unless a majority of the directors of the company recommend that course.  In any <Col N="719" /> event, some safeguard such as that should be inserted in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The only other matter I want to deal with is the one which the Parliamentary Secretary has referred to.  It concerns Section 11, the section which provides that the Minister may, if he considers it desirable, grant a licence to the company to produce matters other than those dealt with in the memorandum and articles of association. Section 11 starts:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This section applies to products suitable for use, whether alone or in conjunction with other products, as animal feeding stuffs or fertilisers, not being products which the company is authorised by its memorandum of association to manufacture.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It goes on to provide that in certain circumstances, if the Minister believes that such a product can be produced in substantial quantities and is not being produced in substantial quantities by private enterprise, the Minister may give a licence to the company to produce it.  It does contain that safeguard, that the Minister shall be obliged to give public notice of his intention to grant a licence and that, if objections are raised, he must give consideration to those objections.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that it might be possible, without departing from the principle of Section 11, to amend the Bill.  In the cases where these products are being produced by private enterprise and where the only complaint against a private firm engaged in their production is that they are not able to produce the articles in quantities sufficient to satisfy what the Minister considers are the requirements, it would be wiser to take authority under this Bill to assist that private firm to engage in greater production by expanding its capital, machinery, or whatever production methods are necessary, rather than to issue a licence under Section 11, which would certainly in those circumstances have the effect of wiping out the private firm.</P>
    <P>Apart from those remarks, I want to join with the Senators who have expressed approval of the effort being <Col N="720" /> made in this Bill, but I earnestly ask the Parliamentary Secretary to give consideration to the matters I have mentioned.  I do not think there are any of them which would in any way take away from the effectiveness of the Bill if he inserted them as amendments. I think&mdash;quite the contrary&mdash; the point I made with regard to the dismissal or removal of directors and the point regarding the elimination of the members of the Houses of the Oireachtas as candidates for the positions of directors, would immensely improve the Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It is certainly a great thing and is wanted in Erris.  It is an area that has been much neglected up to the present.  I think that the beginning which has been made there this year in sowing the grasses as an experiment gives grounds for hoping that the project will be a success.  I welcome the Bill and thank the Parliamentary Secretary for introducing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on having brought in a Bill on which Senator Baxter and Senator Quirke are able to agree.  Having got agreement between these two, he need have no fear whatever about the Bill or about the project which he is undertaking.</P>
      <P>This matter of growing grass in bogs originated in Kerry many years ago, where it was carried on in a small way. Five or six years ago it was taken up by the Sugar Company, and they did it in a larger way.  It has been considered down there to be a huge success, and I learn from what Senator Baxter has said that the experiment in Roscommon is an equally great success.  In a small way I have done something of that nature myself, and if the Parliamentary Secretary is ever in my district I will have much pleasure in showing him poor land converted into land which is at present grazing twice as many cattle as any land in the Golden Vale or in the Midlands. Not only could the bogs be reseeded and improved, but a big portion of the country could be done also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said that £22 7s. is the cost of manufacture <Col N="721" /> of grass meal that he has converted. I have had some acres converted into meal at a cost of £17 but that does not include the cost of producing the grass and I take it that the Parliamentary Secretary includes that figure in the £22 7s.  I have had it processed at the Cappoquin drying station and a most beautiful feed it is.</P>
    <P>It is well known to all the people who manage live stock that grass is the best food than can be given to live stock of any kind.  Here we have the opportunity of feeding grass to our animals in mid-winter, for the dried grass is just as good as the green grass which is fed off by animals in the months of May and June.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter suggested that we should get someone from abroad with a knowledge of plant breeding and that we had only one plant breeding expert in this country.  I do not think that that is quite right.  I know of a second plant breeding expert in this country and he is a man of international repute. He is attached to the beet factory.  He has travelled a good bit in European countries and has picked up whatever knowledge is available there.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary might consider developing our own people rather than bringing in foreigners. Send our own people to where they can learn and bring them back then.  They will understand the native conditions and the native people better than foreigners would.  I think foreigners have not been a huge success in this country and what I suggest might be considered by the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of growing grass seed.  I think Senator Baxter referred to that.  I am not finding fault in any way with what Senator Baxter said, as I agree with every word he said and I was very pleased to hear him speak as he did.  We did grow Cocksfoot here and one of the greatest experts in grass seed, George Stapleton, has said that the Cocksfoot grown here is better than that grown anywhere else.  I think it should be developed more than it is being developed at the present time, and other grasses should be developed also.</P>
    <P>Someone said that it would not be <Col N="722" /> wise to undertake the development of boglands without the possibility of getting farmyard manure.  I do not agree with that.  There is plenty of humus in the bogs for many years to come and no farmyard manure will be required.  Liming and artificial manures will produce crops in these bogs for many years to come.  Without doubt this project will be a success.</P>
    <P>When these lands have been converted and when it is proved that crops can be grown there I would like to see the lands handed back to congests in the West&mdash;in small parcels, of course&mdash;to keep the people in the native districts.  I congratulate the Minister again and say that he can go full steam ahead with the full knowledge that his project is going to be a success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be rather foolish for a County Mayo man at this stage to oppose this Bill or to say anything against it.  For my own part, I welcome the measure.  Although I come from the South of Mayo and would be as strange in the Bangor-Erris area as I would be if I came from Roscommon or Longford, I welcome the expenditure of £100,000 in any part of County Mayo, whether the spending is put into a project that is good or bad.  I look upon the spending of £100,000 as something that will give an enormous amount of employment and will do a certain amount of good.  The idea behind the production of grass in bogs is certainly a good one.  It is nothing new to the farmers in the West of Ireland.  It was unfortunate for ourselves that we had to reclaim many acres of bogland to add to the small holdings, otherwise we would have been very much tightened up.  I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary that when bogland is fairly well drained and reasonably well manured, it can produce a very good and high-class grass. As Senator Baxter has said it would be well if the good arable land could look at the face of the bogland now and again, to see the green in one beside the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this debate the feeling of most Senators seems to be that the development of grass is almost entirely for the creation of more land, to add to the <Col N="723" /> arable land pool we have in the country.  In reality, the main idea behind the Bill is to cultivate a certain amount of bogland to produce grass and other crops for conversion into grass meal as the case may be.  The very title of the Bill gives that meaning, as I understand it.  In fairness, however, it leaves room also to expand this idea into the production of any other class of crop for which this land is suitable.</P>
    <P>I know the Bangor-Erris area reasonably well, and there are three things that can be done in that locality.  The first is to plant it; the second is to use the peat there for electric power, which is being done; and the third is to make an effort to convert it and bring it back into grass land.  These are the only things we can do with the bogland in that area. Whether or not the planting of that area is feasible, we do not know.  Some experts maintain that it is too near the Atlantic coast and that the salt spray would never allow good timber to grow there.  Others maintain that that is all humbug and that with good shelter belts along the shore good forest timber could be grown.  Which of these we are to believe, I do not know, but one thing is certain: if the production of grass in this area is a success, it will give a far quicker return for the amount of money spent than forestry of any description.  As the area being embarked upon now, about 2,000 acres, is not very big, it is right that this Bill should get every possible encouragement and, as I say, it would be foolish for anybody from the County Mayo to do otherwise.</P>
    <P>I have a fear, however, with regard to a factory being established there with an overdose of enthusiasm.  I remember when, in 1934, the industrial alcohol factory was established in the county, with a certain amount of expenditure and the best intentions in the world, for the processing of potatoes for the production of industrial alcohol.  That was known as the white elephant of North Mayo, because, as was proved afterwards, if we had spilled the alcohol on to the <Col N="724" /> ground, paid the employees their wages and sent them home, there would still be a saving to the national purse.  That is the fear I have of giving this project an overdose of enthusiastic support.  I should like to see it fight its own battle the hard way, with just the necessary amount of encouragement.</P>
    <P>If we embark on this project solely for the production of grass meal as a feeding stuff, we are not going to make a success of it.  A price of £30 to £34 per ton for animal feeding stuff is too high and unless it is of first-class quality, it will attract very few buyers at that price.  If I had to pay over 30/- per cwt. for any type of feeding stuff, I would feel that I would be better off merely sitting down than feeding any animal.  That is the type of economy our small farmers in the West have been brought up on and what goes for the small farmer, I presume, goes also for the large farmer.  I saw this product at the show at Ballsbridge last year and it looked reasonably good.  To my inexperienced eye, its protein content was not as high as we would wish.  It struck me as something somewhat better, or maybe a good deal better, than sugar beet pulp, but it was not something which would attract the average live-stock feeder or dairyman.</P>
    <P>The production of medicinal products was referred to by the Parliamentary Secretary, though with some caution, because he admitted that it would take a much bigger project to develop the production of such products to any extent.  I feel that we must follow the line suggested here by Senators on all sides, and recultivate the boglands for the production of grass, almost entirely with a view to adding to the available grassland. That is a very good idea and if we can add 2,000 acres of grass to the Bangor-Erris area, something very good will have been achieved.  I have no doubt whatever that we will be able to do that.  I have seen cultivated bogland of first-class quality and, with Government machines and Government capital on a large scale behind it, it could very well be done.  I would remind those who think that if we strip all the peat <Col N="725" /> off our bogs, they will be useless for conversion into grassland, that I would much prefer to go into cut-away bog at any time than into virgin bog and try to convert it into grass.  That is my practical experience and I will not give way to any experts on that point because I have had experience of it over 20 odd years.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary met a certain amount of criticism and an atmosphere of uncertainty as to whether this was going to be a success or not, during the passage of this Bill through the Dáil.  The atmosphere here is entirely different.  My idea in speaking on the measure is to welcome it into the county, in the hope that we can add so much more grassland to this area and still leave plenty of bog for Bord na Móna and the E.S.B. to develop.  With regard to Bord na Móna, we all know that there are many thousands of tons of turf which have been produced and which are now being sold at a loss, and we know also that a Supplementary Estimate will have to be introduced shortly to provide for these losses.  There are thousands of tons of turf stacked on the side of the roads in Mayo, turf produced by Bord na Móna, which cannot be sold to anybody.  I also know that in the days of the hand-won turf it was with reluctance that the Mayo County Council accepted turf from Bangor-Erris because of the heavy cost of transport.</P>
    <P>It strikes me that the debate has been conducted rather as a debate on agriculture, and we have had arguments as to whether or not live stock should be grazed on bogland which has been reseeded down.  My own experience and opinion is that you cannot graze heavy cattle or cattle for many years on such land, because they tear it up.  We have been told by our agricultural instructors that the reason we have so much rushes growing on our land is the fact that the heavy cattle leave tracks of their hooves, and where there is such a track, there is an inclination for bunches of rushes to grow. To graze it with sheep, however, is entirely different.  Whether it is wise or unwise to graze sheep over bogland is something about which we all <Col N="726" /> wonder, but I would say: keep sheep away from bogs, or, if you put them on bogland, make sure they go to the butcher after a year, because they will not come off that land very free from fluke or any of the diseases which even a slightly wet land is bound to give them.  The grazing over of this land would be useful and would help to add a certain amount of manure to it, which is very valuable to any land.</P>
    <P>We know that the reason why half the grass of our country is so brown and bleak looking is because it is let run into seed.  A person might be described as being mad if he were seen in the middle of July cutting his pasture down to within two or three inches of the ground with a mowing machine.  We know now that this is the best system for good pasture.  The farmer who prevents the grass going into seed is the man who will have good grass and pasture.  These matters may seem far-fetched having regard to the Bill which is still in its infancy but the ideas are good.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary cannot say that we have not given the measure an enthusiastic reception.  Where criticism was necessary it was given. As far as I am concerned, I welcome this measure and I hope it will be successful.  If the 2,000 acres is brought to green grass in the Bangor-Erris area, I hope that the system will be extended throughout all the boglands. As I said before, we have thousands upon thousands of cut-away bog and cut-away bog is easier reclaimed than virgin bog.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. S. O'Donovan Mr. S. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate Senator Baxter for what I consider was a magnificent speech. I expected to hear him criticising this measure.  I thought that would be his approach.  I heard to-day that he was going to speak favourably and I congratulate him on the approach he made to the measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I look on this measure as being one primarily to provide beneficial employment in the congested, undeveloped areas.  Such employment would ultimately result in improvement of the boglands which would be reclaimed. Having heard this enthusiastic speech and the recommendations of other <Col N="727" /> Senators.  I became quite keen to get more information on the matter.  I would certainly like to get an opportunity of viewing the places in Roscommon and Galway which the Senator described.  I did not know much about boglands until we got an invitation from Bord na Móna.  Senators were conveyed to bog development works in the Midlands and it was an education for all of us.  I would be delighted to get an opportunity of seeing this development for the purpose of educating myself in regard to what it means and what benefits will ultimately accrue to the country.</P>
    <P>In introducing the measure to-day, the Parliamentary Secretary said the scheme was an experimental one but, according to Senator Baxter, the matter is already an accomplished fact in another district.  Having regard to that, we ought not to be inclined to consider it as an experiment at all since the experiments have already been carried out and it is merely a question of implementing that work in other areas such as Bangor-Erris.</P>
    <P>While Senator Baxter was speaking, I asked myself whether it was necessary to have this grassland developed on bogs which were not cut-away bogs. I presume that the surface has to be drained efficiently first.  It then has to be cultivated.  The rough herbage, the moss and the heath have to be cleared away.  It must then be manured to some extent.  If grass can grow on these boglands so perfectly with treatment I wonder why it did not grow naturally there?  I would like to know what is the system of manuring, because naturally the bogland was not treated with farmyard manure.  The treatment with artificial manures and the amount of such manures used would be of great interest to me.</P>
    <P>The last speaker mentioned that the cut-away bog would do just as well. There need be no interference with Bord na Móna or the E.S.B. if the same success is met on cut-away bog as on the virgin bog.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>No drainage at all may be possible out of cut-away bog.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. S. O'Donovan Mr. S. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the note <Col N="728" /> I made.  You have a depth of ten or 12 feet of peat and you have practically the same slope on a cut-away bog when you come down to the hard surface as you would have on the surface of the undeveloped bog.  You may have some pot-holes and heights and hollows on the cut-away bog but these could be got over by cutting the hills and filling the hollows.  The last speaker mentioned that cut-away bog is as good as the virgin bog so that the scope and the interest of this measure was widened for me.</P>
      <P>If the cut-away bogs are not developed pretty quickly there will be a lot of erosion.  There is a lot of cut-away bog in Connemara West.  The land there was eroded by the action of the sun and wind, and there is nothing there but rocks, whereas if the land had been treated earlier on, there would have been some surface and some humus.  If the surface of the bogs was quickly treated, you would have a covering of peat soil that could be developed in practically the same manner as is suggested in this Bill.</P>
      <P>The scheme opens up a great vista for the future.  We sincerely hope that it will be a success.  Most people viewed this measure at the start from the point of view that it would provide beneficial and productive employment for the residents in the congested districts. The question of medicinal herbs was mentioned.  The very mention of them would make one hunger for more information as to what chance there is of developing them on a commercial basis.  Let us hope that if such an industry is started it will succeed, and it will naturally be of enormous benefit to the country as a whole.  Possibly medicinal and other such products could be provided for export.</P>
      <P>In introducing the Bill, I think the Parliamentary Secretary said that it was for the purpose of manufacturing compound feeding stuffs.  That suggests to me that these are not sold as dried grass meal as it is marketed at present but that they could be made into concentrated feeding stuffs and sold as cake, nuts or some similar product.  At present, grass meal on the market is mostly dried grass meal and is sold as powder in bags.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="729" /> The question of the commercial manufacture of chlorophyll is of very great interest also, and I think that the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned the figure of £500,000 which will be required to establish such a factory.  That seems to me a very big figure for such a product, whatever its future may be.  From advertisements we see how chlorophyll is being used as an addition to toothpastes: four or five years ago, however, nothing at all was heard about chlorophyll.  A chlorophyll factory may be a project which would be possible of development, but one would feel wary about it considering that it would cost £500,000 to build such a factory.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Callaghan mentioned that the dried grass meal feeding compounds would be comparable to feeding grass in the winter time, but there is the possibility of the dried product not containing the same vitamins as the green grass eaten fresh by the animal.  I do not believe that the dried grass would be of equal feeding value as far as vitamin content is concerned compared with the grown grass eaten by the beast, because there is bound to be a certain amount of vitamins lost in the processes of drying and powdering which are entailed in manufacture.</P>
    <P>Another point on which I am anxious to seek information is the type of grasses being sold.  Senator O'Callaghan referred to Cocksfoot grass as being the strongest and deepest rooted.  I do not know what grasses are suitable and are at present being utilised on these magnificent green fields that Senator Baxter saw when he travelled down to the demonstration bogland of the Irish Sugar Company. There must be, I presume, grasses that will produce sufficient root to bring out humus on the surface of the bog, because there is actually no clay and you have a superabundance of dry, dead vegetable matter. The best grasses to grow will be ones which through their root system will produce nutritious compost for their growing.</P>

      <P>So it is only on the artificial that the grass is growing. It has to produce a surplus which will be utilised for the growing of other crops, such as beet and the other root crops mentioned.  That shows that grass must be produced for some years in order to give the requisite surface. I was seeking, Senator Baxter, when you were out, to know what are the most suitable grasses being used at present so that we might have better knowledge and greater hope of the success of this experiment.  As I see it, most people regard the measure as providing suitable and beneficial employment for the people of the undeveloped and congested areas.</P>
      <P>When we succeed in turning these 2,000 acres of bog into good, arable land, I think that what we intend to do then scarcely arises, but, yet, it is one of the questions which occurs to the person considering this Bill.  I think that some Senators referred already to whether it would be best to graze animals upon this grass or use it in some other way than simply cutting the grass and drying it.</P>
      <P>The other problem is this, that when we have 2,000 acres of new land added to the country, are we just to set it out in parcels of 20, 30 or 40 acres, as the case may be, to new residents?  I do not think that we can picture utilising it in that way because you, possibly, would have to pile-drive into the bog in order to get suitable foundations for houses and outhouses.  Therefore, the picture I see is something of a communal village with strip grazing of pastures.  In a communal or co-operative system working something like 500, 1,000, or bigger areas of these boglands, I suggest you cannot picture placing individual tenants on holdings, because you cannot build a cottage on 12 or 14 feet of bogland no matter how long you leave it to settle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am trying to illustrate the particular interest of the whole subject and congratulate Senator Baxter for taking the line of approach <Col N="731" /> which I did not anticipate from him, because there is so much demand for development and spending money on farming in other areas, and in this measure it is simply being spent on making bogland productive.</P>
      <P>It is natural that the measure should be dealt with by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government because I think the Minister for Agriculture would be wary of taking over a project like this when he could be asked why he was not spending this money satisfying the demands of other sections of the farming community.</P>

      <P>It might be of interest to Senator O'Donovan to know that at the foot of the Knockmealdown mountains in County Tipperary the preparation of dried herbs has been going on for some years past.  The people in that area have been very fortunate inasmuch as in their spare time they go out collecting herbs all over the mountainside and for them it realises a very nice amount of pocket money because the smallest children can do the work as well as the adults. It enables these families to amass a considerable amount of money.</P>
      <P>If I do not misunderstand the Parliamentary Secretary, he has stated that the cost of working the dried grass plant would be about £150,000.</P>

      <P>There is a dried grass factory not very far from where I live in Dungarvan and the machinery is quite simple.  The grass is cut, dried and ground into meal in a two or three hours' operation.  The operation is very, very simple and the machinery is not in any way complicated, and the rest of the work is done with ordinary grass cutters.  The grass is then taken immediately it is cut and brought to the driers and it is then ground into meal right away.  There should be no great difficulty in establishing further stations in various parts of the West.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.F. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, principally for the reason that it is an effort to assist the people of the Bangor-Erris district, people whom we should make a real endeavour to help. I cannot, perhaps because I have not sufficient knowledge of the scheme, express the hopes or the views of Senator Baxter as to what the ultimate success of this scheme will be. However, I am quite prepared to support the Bill in the hope that it will be a wonderful success, and I believe that it should have normal success.  I believe it is in the nature of a scheme which could be run profitably and which could provide a great deal of employment for the people in Bangor-Erris and improve the land there considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are one or two matters on which I would like some assistance from the Parliamentary Secretary.  The Title of the Bill provides, in the main, that the scheme is designed for the drainage and cultivation of the boglands in the Bangor-Erris area.  In regard to clause 7 of the Bill, in my view it deals only with the carrying on <Col N="733" /> of this work in the Bangor-Erris area, but nowhere else in the State.  If I understand the Bill aright, the intention is to deal solely with the Bangor-Erris area, and if that is the case, I think that clause 7 might be amended to provide specifically that the object of the Act would be to carry out this cultivation work in Bangor-Erris, but there is a sub-clause which provides that the memorandum of association of the company shall be in such form consistent with this Act.</P>
    <P>I was troubled to see it implied in the clause that the object of the company would be to develop the work in Bangor-Erris area, and I would like the Minister to indicate if it was intended that the work would be confined solely to that area.  Clause 9 provides that the memorandum of association might not be altered in any way whatever without the approval of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, after consultation with the Minister for Finance.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that we in the Oireachtas should have some say in the alteration of the memorandum and articles of association.  After all, it is we here who are giving permission for the formation of this company.  We are giving permission for the formation of the company for a particular reason.</P>
    <P>If the memorandum and articles of association of the proposed company may be altered without reference to us, we shall have the position that the company's objects and memorandum can be altered without our consent, and in that way it might be enabled to carry out a completely different work from that for which we are giving permission.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that the memorandum and articles of association of the company should not be altered without the consent of the Oireachtas. I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to give consideration to that point.</P>
    <P>Clause 11 provides, in effect, that the Minister may take steps to enter into competition with a concern engaged in similar operations by way of private enterprise.  There is some proviso here that the Minister will do that only after <Col N="734" /> very careful consideration.  Here again we have the State considering that it will engage in competition with all the resources of the State behind it against an individual.  I think that that right if given to the State by this Bill should be carefully watched and carefully exercised by the Minister.  That section provides that before a licence will be given to the company to compete against private enterprise, that that fact will first be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i></P>
    <P>With all due respect, I must say that people engaging in private enterprise seldom see <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and I presume that that publication is provided for in order that those so engaged might make representations to the Minister. To provide for publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> you might as well in my view say that the advertisement should be published in <i>Pravda</i> or <i>Isvestia</i>, if it still exists, as to put it in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> which is just a series of typescript pages tied together and which are sent to the editors of newspapers and to administrative offices.  Legal practitioners sometimes must buy it to vouch for advertisements which appear in it every Tuesday and Friday, but to suggest that publication of such a notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> will bring it before the public is sheer nonsense.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary should consider amending the Bill to provide that such a notice as published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> which, I say, is not read by more than 50 people, should be published in the Dublin newspapers which circulated throughout the country.  If he does so, he will then ensure that any intention of the Minister to give an extended licence to the company will receive due notice from those engaged in private enterprise.  I suggest that it is useless to have the provision in the Bill that this notice must be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> if it is not to be published in the daily newspapers.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to give serious consideration to that matter.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and, as I have stated, I do not know sufficient about the project to envisage the future of which Senator Baxter has spoken.  I was impressed by what Senator Commons said as to what should be <Col N="735" /> our approach to this concern.  It may be a very great success or it may disappoint us all, but I feel that if only it will do something in any small way to improve the position of the people in the Bangor-Erris district and their properties, any money the State will spend on it will be very well spent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the introduction of this measure brought a degree of harmony between members on both sides of the House where, I am told, it did not formerly exist.  I am sure, however, that despite what Senator O'Callaghan has said, it is not the first measure to produce this degree or harmony.  There were, during the passage of the Bill in the Dáil, a few discordant notes, but I would say that even in its short life in the Dáil, support for the Bill was growing and there was quite a degree&mdash;although not perhaps a full degree&mdash;of support for it when it left Dáil Eireann.</P>
      <P>I want to assure Senator Commons that I do not want any undue enthusiasm about this measure.  Senator Baxter has been enthusiastic about it beyond my expectations.  But if there is that necessary modicum of cooperation and goodwill, it will satisfy me that at least we are approaching the work that this company is being set up to do from the proper point of view.</P>
      <P>I want to correct an impression right away that might have been created by the contributions of some Senators.  This is not primarily an employment-creating measure.  I have stated here and also in the Dáil that the primary object of the Bill is to experiment with the drainage and the cultivation of bogland, to make it more productive and to make more land available for production purposes in the country.  There will be quite a degree of employment given, but nevertheless it must be stressed, in fairness to any people who might be expecting a big volume of employment, that that is not envisaged.  But there will be a considerable degree of employment available, as naturally there must be when drainage of an area of the magnitude of 2,000 acres is involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="736" /> I am glad, however, that Senator Baxter spoke with such warm approval not so much of the Bill perhaps as of the idea behind it, that is, the bringing into production of land hitherto practically valueless.  It is commendable that he took the trouble to visit the area.  Ballyforan, I think he mentioned, but I know it as Gowla Bog, on which Comhlucht Siúicre Eireann, Teoranta, are at the present time conducting experiments.  The object of the experiments is to provide land on which beet may ultimately be grown for the production of sugar.  In carrying out these experiments it was found that grass could be grown in sufficient quantities to justify the establishment in the location of a grass dryer for the production of grass meal. I am informed that the protein content of grass produced there is very high and compares more than favourably with grass produced elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter suggested that other members of the House might, with profit, undertake a visit to the area as he has done.  During the debate in the Dáil, I suggested to Deputies that there was in existence a film showing the progress made in the area during the last 12 months.  I saw the film and was frankly amazed that what was virtually a swamp was converted into good land within one year&mdash;land in which I saw in the picture heavy cattle grazing, and sheep which increased their weight while grazing in the bog at the rate of 2 lb. per week, which I believe is a very high rate of increase.  That film can be shown at short notice, and if any Senators would like to see it, I am sure that a phone call to the headquarters of Comhlucht Siúicre Eireann in Clare Street would be sufficient to have a showing arranged.  It will save many Senators, who might like to visit the bog but have not the time, the necessity of undertaking the journey to it.  I can assure you that seeing that film will be worth while and will be a good indication of what can be done.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter also suggested that consideration should now be given to the utilisation of bogland in the future, and suggested that at some time&mdash; maybe in five or ten years&mdash;we might <Col N="737" /> consider that the cutting of turf from our bogs is a wasteful process and that a more useful method might be employed for bringing the soil into good heart for the production of grass and for the grazing of cattle.  It often occurred to me that, with the development of science, perhaps other uses might be found for our peat resources, and I am sure that, with the experiments being carried out by Bord na Móna, if there are other uses to which peat can be put they will readily be discovered.</P>
    <P>He suggested also the setting up of an organisation that might undertake that examination, but I suggest to him and to the House that the setting up of the organisation envisaged by the Bill would be a sufficient start to make in that direction.  The employment of foreign experts to give us the advantage of their experience on the production of grass seed was suggested also by him but was not supported by Senator O'Callaghan, who suggested that we should develop our own brains.</P>
    <P>While both Senators were talking, I got thinking on a subject that has often occurred to me.  I think too much time and public money and private individual's money is wasted on the type of higher education in this country that is of little advantage to the individual who acquires it or to the country as a whole.  I have often thought that if our universities could provide a kind of utility higher education, more education in the different forms of science, it would be of far more advantage not only to agriculture but to our industrial progress as well.  However, I have no set opinions as to the difference between importing brains and producing them at home.  I think a little of both is necessary.  There are experts abroad whom we can use with advantage in this country and we can also send our own products abroad in order that they might become more expert in whatever fields they choose.</P>
    <P>With regard to the suggestion by Senator Baxter in relation to the putting of live stock on these drained boglands as part of the process of producing grass, I am not sure that the terms of the Long Title of the Bill <Col N="738" /> would preclude this.  In any case, I mentioned in my opening statement that it might take two or three years before the bogs would be properly drained.  In the preliminary stages, other methods of disposing of the crops might be considered necessary and I am sure one of the methods which the company will take into consideration is the feeding of live stock on drained bogland as the grass is being grown.</P>
    <P>Senator Quirke suggested that more consideration should be given to the utilisation of cutaway bog.  I think it is readily realised already that cutaway bog can and does grow good grass and in many cases grows timber; but the question is whether, as Senator Baxter rightly observed, that cutaway bog could be properly drained.  In deep bog there can be uniformity of draining that would not be possible at all in cutaway bog.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Higgins and Senator O'Reilly referred more to the technical aspects of the Bill.  I mention them together because Senator O'Higgins's notes are the next on my list.  He suggested that no member of the Dáil or Seanad should be a member of the board.  It is the intention that no member of the Dáil or Seanad should, in fact, be a member of the board, but there is no provision in the Bill precluding that.  He asks me to give consideration to that point before the next stage is reached and I promise to do so.  I do not suppose he will take my assurance that it is the intention not to appoint members of the Oireachtas on the board and that that will not be done.  However, that is a matter for himself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFOReilly" hpid="Mr. P.F. O'Reilly Mr. P.F. O'Reilly">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>He also suggests that the Minister should not have the complete power of removal of a member of the board, as he virtually has in this Bill. The Bill provides that he can do so only after consultation with the Minister for Finance.  He basis that suggestion on the assumption that, if a member of the Board suggests a line of policy which does not coincide with the Minister's, that might be good and sufficient reason for his removal by <Col N="739" /> some future Minister who might not examine these matters from proper motives.  However, it is not the Minister's intention&mdash;and I think the terms of the Bill adequately provide for it&mdash;to interfere in the ordinary policy of the board.  Therefore, it is not likely that the Minister will have any knowledge of a particular member's ideas with regard to the carrying out of the policy of the board.  I do not think the Senator need have any fears on that score.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter that can be looked into.  I have not any preconceived ideas about it, but I know there is the intention at present not to interfere with the policy of the board, that it is unlikely that the Minister would have any particular knowledge of what has happened or would at least have made up his mind that the policy the board intends to pursue is not his policy and therefore some member or members of the board should be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Higgins and Senator O'Reilly referred to Section 11, the licensing section.  Senator O'Higgins said that, if the existing company were unable to produce to a sufficient extent, consideration should be given to providing that company with whatever assistance would be necessary to get the equipment or means of expansion that seemed fit.  I do not think it would be wise in this Bill to introduce <Col N="740" /> such a provision, since the area of operation of this company is in the undeveloped areas, that is, in the West of Ireland.  It is likely that any new line of development envisaged would be one where the location would be in the West of Ireland and not anywhere else.</P>
    <P>I would remind Senators of the facilities available under the Undeveloped Areas Act.  If a company is in existence in the undeveloped area, there is provision in that Act to procure assistance, provided that there are certain competitive disadvantages, if that assistance is likely to expand production and give more employment.  If there is not such a company in existence, the benefits of the Act are still available for the setting up of a public company.  From that point of view, I do not think it would be wise to introduce a similar provision in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Reilly referred to the licensing provision as giving a licence to the Minister&mdash;I presume he meant the company&mdash;to compete with private enterprise.  The very spirit and wording indicates that it is not to compete with private enterprise that the provision is there.  It clearly says: &ldquo;Wherever the Minister is of opinion that (a) a product to which this section applies is not being manufactured in the State by means of private enterprise, or is not being so manufactured to a substantial extent, and (b) it is desirable that such product should be manufactured in the State to a substantial extent,&rdquo; the granting of a licence may be considered by the Minister.  It is clear from that that there is no suggestion whatever of competing with private enterprise.  The provision is there simply to enable the company to embark on production of some commodity which it is obvious should be produced to some extent or to a more considerable extent in the country.  Therefore, there is no <i>ipso facto</i> element of competition in it at all.  The intention is to provide production in a line which is either insufficiently provided for or is not provided for at all.</P>
    <P>Before I depart from these technical points, I would like to deal with one other point which Senator O'Reilly <Col N="741" /> raised, that the memorandum or articles of association should not be altered without the consent of the Oireachtas.  This Bill is drafted on the lines of similar Bills setting up State-sponsored companies.  I do not know whether there are provisions in those Acts for the Oireachtas to be informed or to be given the opportunity to comment or to legislate for changes in the articles or memorandum of association, but that is a matter which I can look into.</P>
    <P>With regard to publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> of the Minister's intention to grant a licence under Section 11, I think that publication must be considered reasonable and sufficient.  It was a point raised by Deputy Sweetman in the Dáil during the course of the Second Reading.  I promised the Deputy then I would consult the Minister and get his point of view on it.  I subsequently consulted the Minister and his point of view coincided with mine, that publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> was sufficient.  It is an official document and I feel that, practically speaking, anybody who is engaged in the production of a commodity, or interested in any way in its production, will very soon come to know of any intention by this proposed company of engaging in the production of a similar commodity.</P>

      <P>The practice is to write to the individual firms known to have any activities in that particular development. I think that, in practice, there are several safeguards.</P>
      <P>Senator Goulding made reference to the picking of herbs and their commercial utilisation, and, during the course of the debate in the Dáil, I referred to that aspect.  I drew the Long Title to the notice of the Dáil, in which it is stated that the company may grow other plants on the bog, and I instanced medicinal and aromatic herbs as examples of the type of plant I had in mind.  I have been reliably informed that spearmint and peppermint, which are extensively used in medicinal preparations, are very successfully grown on bogland.</P>
      <P>I referred also to a plant which I told the Dáil I had been informed could be sold at £1 per lb. weight. There was some public comment on it afterwards.  I was slightly wrong in the price I gave as the value of the lb. weight of that plant.  I believe that, after some little degree of processing, the plant is worth £1 per lb. weight, but that the value of it in its raw state is not very far short of £1 sterling for a lb. weight.  I have been asked by some people to disclose the name of that plant since.  I was given it by a person who is associated with the company engaged in the processing of those plants.  It was given to me in confidence, and at this stage I naturally would not wish to betray his confidence without his consent.  The <i>Sunday Independent</i> last Sunday referred to it with some levity, and, much as I enjoy a little levity now and again, I am not going to say whether or not the plant described in that article is the plant to which I refer.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Donovan raised a number of points and in particular he wondered whether the grass meal, as produced by the company, would be sold in that state as grass meal.  At present, I believe the bulk of grass meal is sold to animal feeding stuff compounders. There is a little sold in its own state, for itself, and I believe it is fed to poultry, because its protein content is higher than that of the compound feeding stuff itself.  I believe it is very valuable for the feeding of poultry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="743" /> Senator P.F. O'Reilly made a point about the location and said that, since Bangor-Erris is provided for as the <i>locus operandi</i>, he wondered whether the work could be done anywhere else. I do not know if he knows the area concerned, but, if he does, he will agree with me that there is a vast area of bog there, an area of bog such as I believed could not exist before I saw it.  The Bangor-Erris area embraces a barony and there is a sufficiently wide range of territory there to enable the company to move around, if new development is necessary.</P>

Even in the Back Benches I am not so bad.</P>
