      <P>As far as I can understand, we will take first the motion, No. 6, which was adjourned on the last day.  Then we will take No. 1.  So far as can be judged, the Dáil will adjourn to-night and we will get the Workmen's Compensation (Amendment) Bill to-morrow and also the Comptroller and Auditor-General Bill.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That on the passing of the Health Bill by Dáil Éireann, the stated period in respect of that Bill shall, in pursuance of Article 23 1 2º of the Constitution, be 120 days;</P>

      <P>There has been some discussion already on this and perhaps the Minister would give us his views and we would not spend very much more time on it.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of what has been said by Senators on this, but when I read this motion on the Order Paper I did not see the necessity for it, I must say, <Col N="588" /> because the three-months' period would not expire until the 28th October and I expected that the Seanad would have disposed of the Health Bill before then.  As far as I am concerned, anyway, I would be very glad to attend the Seanad at any time that they are willing to take the Bill within the next few months.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not fair to ask the Minister what he thought of the motion, as he had not even seen the previous discussion.  The case for the motion is, briefly, this, that the Dáil is expected to adjourn until towards the end of October.  It would not be very satisfactory to discuss amendments and possibly to find ourselves in the position that amendments carried here or agreed here are invalid because of the fact that the time allowed to this House in the Constitution has expired. This rarely happens, but it did happen in the case of the Adoption Bill.  On that occasion the Bill, which was accepted by all sides, had to be delayed because of a perfectly genuine difficulty on the part of the Minister in finding a satisfactory amendment. Everyone was agreed that the Bill should be amended, but when an agreed amendment was passed our attention was drawn to the fact that the 90 days had elapsed.</P>
      <P>I feel that this Bill is one which is mainly a Committee Bill.  There are a great many details which will require discussion, consideration and, possibly, amendment.  Precedent would certainly suggest that even if there was not a single amendment from this side of the House the Minister would, in the next couple of months, discover amendments he would want to put in, and the proposal for 120 days is purely for the purpose of facilitating the House and the Government and for the purpose of preventing a situation arising such as arose in the case of the Adoption Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not something on which we wish to make a fight.  It is not raised for such a purpose and we are not going to make any fuss about it.  As far as this side of the House is concerned, we do not know exactly what the position would be with regard to amendments, but we are assuming that the function of this House is revisory <Col N="589" /> and it would be astonishing if we went through the Bill to the Report Stage without amendments which were agreed and accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>Assuming that amendments are passed by the Seanad, a very short time would elapse between the meeting of the Dáil and the expiration of the 90 days.  Is it not possible in that period for a motion similar to this to be passed by the Dáil then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>It has to be passed by both Houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Seanad, which would meet before that, could pass such a motion in the very unlikely event of the circumstances mentioned by Senator Douglas arising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the position, constitutionally, is that you are required to have a resolution of both Houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>The passing of a resolution by us would have no effect until the House met in October and the Dáil, if it then considered it was wise, accepted it.  We put it forward as a reasonable suggestion.  We know it may not be accepted by the Dáil, but we think that the time might, conceivably, not be sufficient.  There is no obstruction about this.  It is to prevent a situation arising such as arose at the time of the Adoption Bill, which we felt should not be allowed to occur in future.  I am sure that if we thought that major Bills would arise in the last days before the summer recess, we would not have been in a hurry to pass the 90 days' clause.  However, I am not pressing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister has not had an opportunity of reading what was said on this <Col N="590" /> matter because we had a certain debate on it last Thursday.  Unfortunately, owing to the fact that Monday was a bank holiday, the debate has not yet been printed.  Normally, it would be in print by now, and the Minister would have had an opportunity of reading it.  However, without going into the whole argument again, the position is that the Constitution allows this House 90 days for the consideration of a Bill.  That is something with which we cannot argue.  But when the Dáil, as it did this year in the case of the Health Bill, passed a very important measure on the 30th day of July, then, in fact, the Seanad does not really get 90 days to consider it because 60 of those days fall in the months of August and September.  It is not because we do not want to work in the months of August and September, or because anybody wants to take any particular advantage, but it happens that, from the point of view of Ministers, of members of the Dáil, of members of the Seanad and of the officials, that these two months are regarded as non-parliamentary months.  Because of that, it was suggested that, in order to give effect to the Constitution, the Seanad would really require a longer period than 90 days, and that that could be given by resolution of both Houses prolonging the period.</P>
      <P>The suggestion was that the period should be prolonged for 30 days: that would bring the whole matter up to the 26th or 27th November.  At that time also, it was thought that the Dáil might adjourn until the 28th October. If it did, then our amendments would reach the Dáil too late.  I know that the Dáil can, by a particular process, consider them.  If the Dáil meets on the 21st, it is unlikely that amendments carried in the Seanad will be available for it then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister had a considerable amount of difficulty when this Bill was going through the Dáil and he and his officials have been kept hard at work on it until now.  That being so, they will bring fresh minds to bear on it at the end of September and in October.  I have no doubt at all that they will have certain amendments to the Bill as it stands, for which they <Col N="591" /> will get the agreement of this House. It is necessary that these amendments should be in time for the Dáil.  If any difficulty arises as between the 21st and the 28th October, the Minister will take the necessary steps in the Dáil and we will take them here.</P>

    <Title>Health Bill, 1952&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it plain at the outset, so that no member of the Seanad will think that it is news to me, that the Bill does not provide health services for all and that, therefore, there are several means tests in it.  I say that because it is a form of attack on me by many people, as if it were news to me.  If there were no means test then we should have free medical services for everybody.  As we have not provided for that, then we must have a means test.  As a matter of fact, for convenience in discussing this Bill, we should divide the population into three groups.  They have been referred to as (1), the lower income group; (2), the middle income group and (3), the higher income group.  The lower income group is limited by a means test. That is really the group of people who are now entitled to free medical services, whether dispensary services, hospital services or whatever they may require.  They will continue to get a free medical service under this Bill and there will be some improvement as far as their position is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is expected that medical services will be considerably extended and improved as time goes on, and the lower income group will have the benefit of such improvements, whatever they may be.  There is also a very big change in respect of maternity so far as women in the lower income group are concerned. The woman in the lower income group will have a choice of doctor. <Col N="592" /> I must say that when I was first drawing up this health scheme for submission to the Government I considered that that was one of the most important reforms in the whole scheme &mdash;namely, to give a choice of doctor to the woman in the lower income group. It is extraordinary that it has not been referred to more frequently by those who were discussing this Bill, particularly by those who have been advocating a choice for the patient and especially, perhaps, by those who talk about the doctor-patient relationship and matters of that kind.  Women of that class have, for almost 100 years now, been compelled to go to the dispensary doctor.  Almost to a man, I should say that dispensary doctors are very good people.  They do their work very well and I am quite sure that they would give as good service to these women as anybody else could give them.  However, we must remember that it is not only a question of good service.  Women in that condition are very sensitive about their condition and are very particular about what doctor they will consult.  I think that not so much from the point of view of giving a better service but from the point of view of giving these women a right that they had not before, this particular reform is very important.</P>
    <P>There is also a provision that every woman in the lower income group will get a bounty of £4&mdash;that is, whether the woman is insured or not.  When the Social Welfare Bill was going through the Oireachtas it was noticed by many Deputies and Senators that we had not improved our social welfare code in relation to maternity benefits. At the time, I explained that I intended to have that dealt with in the Health Bill rather than in the Social Welfare Bill.  The reason was that I felt that the uninsured woman is just as much in need of this particular benefit as the insured woman.  That being so, it could only be dealt with&mdash;at any rate administratively&mdash;with any great ease in a Health Bill rather than in a Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should refer here and which has given rise to some discussion is the question of the red ticket.  I have been accused by <Col N="593" /> certain people of proposing to do away with the red ticket and to substitute therefor a white card.  To a certain extent that is true but it is not done for the purpose of doing away with what was regarded as the slur that attaches to a red ticket.  It is being done as a matter of convenience for the person in the lower income group. It is obvious that if a person in the lower income group must conform to a certain means test, he or she cannot get the treatment unless somebody applies a test and, naturally, whoever applies the test will give the person a note of introduction to the doctor who is supposed to treat the patient.  Up to this, that has been the red ticket. The trouble is that if a man wants the doctor to call to his house to examine, say, his child, he must get a red ticket before going to the doctor.  If it should happen that a second child in the same house should get ill in the middle of the following night, the father must again go for a red ticket.</P>
    <P>It was to obviate the trouble of that system that I suggested that a card should be issued.  I refer to it as a white card in order to distinguish it from a red ticket, but I do not mind very much if it is red, like the other. The card would be issued to the head of the family and would be valid for, say, 12 months and any time he might require a doctor to come to his house, he would present the card and the doctor would attend himself, his wife or his family.  It was merely put in as a matter of convenience and not in any way to camouflage the fact that the person must produce a ticket or a card in order to get the dispensary doctor to attend.  The lower income group therefore are entitled to free service of every kind which they may require.</P>
    <P>We come then to the middle income group, which is made up of three classes: the insured people&mdash;some insured people may be in the lower income group, but all insured people not in the lower income group will come into the middle income group&mdash;land-holders, farmers under £50 valuation and&mdash;apart from these two very big classes&mdash;those whose family income is less than £600 per year.  These people, <Col N="594" /> with their wives and families, are entitled to whatever benefits are made available for the middle income group and these benefits are principally free hospital and specialist services, subject to certain conditions.  The hospital is not always free.  If the local authority believes that a person can afford a certain amount for maintenance in the hospital, the local authority may, if it thinks fit, charge that person up to a maximum of 6/- per day for maintenance, but, beyond that, no charge can be made.  Services beyond maintenance are free, as are also specialist services.</P>
    <P>In that group also, there is a free maternity service with choice of doctor, as in the case of the lower income group, and in the case of dental, ophthalmic and aural services, they will be made available to the middle income group, subject to certain charges in certain cases.  When I speak of certain cases, I mean that it is not so much a matter of a means test as of the certain types of treatment.  In the case of dentures, there would be a certain charge; there would also be a charge for glasses and a certain charge for appliances for the hard of hearing. These charges, however, have to be settled by regulation, and these regulations will come up for consideration later by the appropriate bodies, to which I hope to refer.</P>
    <P>We have, then, the higher income group who are still left in the country above the middle income group.  They, by contributing a certain amount, can get maternity services.  As the Bill stands&mdash;it was amended in Committee &mdash;a married woman who contributes £1 per year for the first three years will be entitled to this maternity service, as in the case of the middle income group.  After three years, there will be an investigation into the costs of the scheme and the annual contribution may then be raised, not for those already within the scheme but for new entrants, but in no case will it exceed £2 per year.</P>
    <P>In addition a person in the higher income group who claims that he will suffer hardship by having to pay for hospital or specialist treatment may be admitted by the local authority to <Col N="595" /> these services, either free or on payment of a certain charge.  I should mention that where I say that hospital treatment and hospital maintenance is given to any of these groups, it includes mental hospitals and indeed, I should think that, in the case of a person in the higher income group who may claim that it would be a great hardship on the head of the family to maintain a child or wife over a prolonged period and who would get a certain help, it would probably apply more in the case of mental hospitals than any other.  As Senators are aware, a stay in one of these institutions is unfortunately very long and would, therefore, bear very heavily on the head of the family.</P>
    <P>In all cases, whether lower, middle or higher income groups there will be infant clinics to which everybody will be free to go for advice.  There will be school medical examination for all in the primary schools and those attending national schools will be entitled to treatment for defects discovered in these examinations.  The word &ldquo;defects&rdquo; has a certain fairly recognised meaning.  The principal defects would be dental defects, ophthalmic defects, defects of the ear, deformities or defects requiring orthopædic surgery and tonsils.  If the school medical examination takes place in a national school, the treatment for these defects will be free, no matter what group the parents belong to.  If a child is attending a school other than a national school free treatment will depend upon the group to which the parents belong.  In the case of infectious diseases, diagnosis, treatment, advice and so on are all free for all classes.</P>
    <P>That gives, in rough outline, the services to which people are entitled under the Bill, but we must look at this matter from another angle, because, in discussing the Bill, there has been discussion not so much of the services as of other aspects.  For instance, the choice of doctor is a matter which is very often referred to and those who have opposed the Bill give the impression that the doctors will be tied State servants, when the Bill goes <Col N="596" /> through.  So far as the general practitioner is concerned, whether a dispensary doctor or a doctor in private practice, a family doctor, there is no change.  If he is a dispensary doctor, he carries on as he carried on in the past, except that, if any woman in his district is about to have a baby, she may engage him or any other doctor to look after her and if she engages him he will be paid a fee for attending her. To that extent, the dispensary doctor will be better off&mdash;he will have less work or more money.  I suppose some doctors would prefer one and other doctors the other, but in any case they will have some advantages from it.</P>
    <P>The middle income group will go as usual to their family doctor and will pay him.  There is no change, so far as that is concerned.  The position with regard to any advice or treatment given in the person's home or in the doctor's surgery will remain as it was &mdash;that person will be expected to pay the doctor.  The only change in that respect is that, if he recommends his patient for either specialist or hospital treatment and if the patient tells him he believes he is entitled to free treatment in the hospital or to free specialist treatment and if the doctor gives this person a note to the local authority recommending that he get this hospital or specialist treatment, provided the person is right in believing that, according to his means, he is entitled to help, he will get it.</P>
    <P>The position of the doctor who attends him is in no way different from what it was, except that he will be able to get free treatment for his patients in certain cases where he was not able to get it before.  I do not see that his position is in any way changed.</P>
    <P>Senators must remember that it is only the family doctor who will recommend hospital treatment or specialist treatment.  Nobody else can recommend it.  The family doctor is, therefore, in complete charge of his patient and will look after the patient as always and will, if he thinks fit, recommend this person to go to a specialist or a hospital as the case may be.  The position of the great majority of doctors in this country, therefore, those who are dispensary <Col N="597" /> doctors, those in general practice and family doctors, is not in any way changed as far as this Bill is concerned except they undertake to engage in maternity on behalf of the local authority.  In other words, if the doctor puts his name on the list and if a patient chooses him in regard to maternity, he will be paid by the local authority instead of by the patient.  In that way I should say he would be more sure of getting paid which should be of advantage to any doctor.</P>
    <P>A doctor is free to put his name on the local authority panel.  If he likes he need not do so.  All he is asked to do is say to the local authority that he is prepared to take on maternity on behalf of the local authority if any person should accept his treatment for that purpose.  The woman concerned can just name the doctor she likes who is on this panel.</P>
    <P>The next point is that of the choice of hospital.  If a person in the lower income group is at the moment recommended by his doctor to have hospital treatment he is dealt with by the local authority.  He is sent to the county hospital or if the county hospital authorities think that he should go further to some other hospital, then he goes further.  I should like to tell Senators, because there seems to be some confusion on this point, that the person who decides whether the patient should go to a county hospital or to, let us say, a voluntary hospital in Dublin is the medical man in the county hospital.  If a dispensary patient at the moment is recommended by the dispensary doctor to have treatment in hospital and if he is a surgical case, he is sent to the county surgeon. If he is a medical case, he is sent to the county physician.  The county surgeon will make up his own mind whether he will keep that man in the county hospital and look after him or whether he is more properly a case for some specialised hospital.  If the latter, he decides to have this man sent to a more specialised hospital.  I want to assure Senators that from the time the person thinks there is something wrong with him at the moment he is guided entirely by medical opinion and by nobody else.</P>
    <P>As far as the lay staff of the county <Col N="598" /> local authority are concerned their only job is to make arrangements for the person's admission to hospital and pay the bill when treatment is over. Every decision that is taken about where the person should go or how he should be treated is entirely in the hands of the medical staffs.  The same will apply to the middle income group who may claim hospital or specialised service as a result of this Bill.  Therefore, there is no danger of any kind that there will be any change in the situation.  Therefore, there is no danger that any layman will decide whether a person will go to a hospital or not or what hospital he will go to.</P>
    <P>There is this, if you like, that the local authority makes contracts with certain hospitals, and to that extent, if the county surgeon or physician decides that a person must be sent, let us say, to a Dublin hospital, the choice is limited to one or two voluntary hospitals, but I think it would be unreasonable to expect that the local authority should make a contract with every voluntary hospital in the country so as to give a complete choice to the county surgeon or physician when sending a patient on from the county hospital for further treatment.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that the local authority may charge a person in the middle income group a certain amount for maintenance. In no case can it be more than 6/- a day or two guineas a week. The local authority hospitals are at the moment paying the voluntary hospitals in Dublin £5 12s. per week for any patients they send them.  The two guineas is only a portion of that.  The local authority pays the remainder.  If a person in the middle income group, or, indeed, in the lower income group, says that he would prefer to choose his own hospital he has power to do so, but he will not do so well financially if he makes that choice.</P>
    <P>If he says he wants to choose his own hospital he can go to any hospital he likes that is a recognised hospital. We had, and have, a method under the social welfare legislation where the National Health Insurance Society have a list of recognised hospitals.  It covers every hospital on that list who applied to get on the list and who kept <Col N="599" /> at least one ward of four beds.  That was not a very stringent test, but that was the test, and there will be some such test in regard to this scheme, too. In any event, if the person says he wants to choose his own hospital he can consult with his own family doctor in regard to what hospital he will go to, and he can go to any hospital and the local authority will pay a subvention. That is the usual fee which they pay.  It is £5 12s. less two guineas. That would be £3 10s. at the moment.</P>
    <P>If this Bill were in operation just now and a person wanted to choose his own hospital, he would go along to his own local authority and it would pay £3 10s. for his maintenance.  He would be responsible for anything over and above the £3 10s. a week that hospital would charge and he would also be responsible for any fees otherwise that might have to be paid either to medical staffs or anybody else.  It is just that the subvention of £3 10s. per week is paid.  I should say that nursing homes will also rank as eligible for the reception of such cases..</P>
    <P>Another matter dealt with in this Bill is the rehabilitation of those who are deformed or disabled or who are recovering from very serious illness such as T.B. or some other long drawn out diseases.  Where a person is not in a position to go back to his old occupation or perhaps is a person who never had any occupation having been ill since his youth, the local authorities will provide this rehabilitation service and will try to train people in certain occupations according to their physical capacity.  In addition to that, the local authorities will pay maintenance allowance to incapacitated adults over 16 years of age who have no means and whose families are not in a position to look after them.  These are new services as far as we are concerned here and it will take some little time to work out the necessary details of administration. These will be covered by regulations which will be submitted in due course.</P>
    <P>All services under the Bill will, of course, be provided by the health authority.  The health authority is the <Col N="600" /> county council or the county borough council, as the case may be.  All costs of this service, as in the case of other health services which are now in operation, will be recouped to the extent of 50 per cent. by the Department of Health.  The powers at present exercised by public assistance authorities will, as a result of this Bill, be exercised by health authorities, and public assistance authorities will disappear.</P>
    <P>In the county council area there is no change&mdash;it is the one authority in any case&mdash;except that it will no longer be necessary to call the county council the public assistance authority when they are dealing with, let us say, dispensary doctors, and call it the health authority when they are dealing with T.B.  They will deal with all health matters as the health authority.</P>
    <P>There will be some complications about Dublin, Cork and Waterford, because in these three places we still have public assistance authorities left which are not the same body as the health authority.  It will be necessary to bring in, as soon as we can, a Bill to regularise these three areas and we have had a good deal of negotiation with these various bodies in connection with this Bill we have in mind.  As soon as we get the agreement of the various bodies concerned, we will be able to produce the Bill.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should have mentioned at the outset the necessity for this Bill, although I do not think it makes very much difference where the point is made.  The principal reason for this is that health services are costing a great deal more than they did.  The cost of hospitals has gone up enormously in the last four or five years and the cost of the maintenance of a patient in a hospital has increased almost threefold.  In 1947, when I was previously Minister for Health, I think local authorities were paying two guineas and later £2 10s. a week for their patients.  There have been several increases since then and now it is £5 12s.  That gives an idea of the enormous cost of hospitalisation of the private individual; in fact, so costly have hospitals become that those who are described here as being in the middle income group find it difficult to <Col N="601" /> meet not only the cost of prolonged sickness but even the cost of a rather short illness.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, I think people are becoming very much more health-minded. People are inclined to go to hospital more than they did.  Some 30 or 40 years ago it was difficult to get a person to go to hospital even though he badly needed hospital treatment. There is no great difficulty now in getting a person to go to hospital provided he can pay or can get somebody else to pay for him.  It would be a great pity, indeed, if people who were in need of hospital treatment and who were anxious to accept treatment were debarred from getting it through lack of means.  That is a principle to which, I think, every Party has subscribed; that is, that no person should be denied the best possible medical treatment through lack of means.  That is the principle upon which this Health Bill was largely based.</P>
    <P>Maternity is also a problem for a great many people in the middle income group, in particular for people living in the cities and towns.  Very often when a young pair get married in the city or town they have the expense of furnishing a flat or house; many of them cannot secure a flat and have to buy a house and, of course, they borrow the money to buy it. They have to pay the cost of purchasing the house over their first 15 or 20 years of married life.  The young man who is trying to do this is not at the top of the salary scale of whatever occupation he may be in.  He finds it hard enough to pay for his house, perhaps pay instalments on the furniture and, if he is in a certain type of occupation, he may have to pay for a car on the instalment system, too.  When babies appear rather regularly in a case like that it becomes almost impossible for this young couple to meet the cost, and it is necessary that something should be done at that time of married life.</P>
    <P>I had an experience some five or six years ago which made me very keen on providing facilities for the middle income group.  I met two farmers, both of whom told me the same story.  When I asked them how <Col N="602" /> they were, they said that they were not too well.  They had been told to undergo an operation, and when I inquired why they had not done so, they said that they could not afford it.  That did apply to many people in the middle income group.  They could not afford either the time or the cost of an operation, and if they could at all postpone it they did so.  I need hardly tell the Seanad that there was great danger in postponing a matter of that kind.</P>
    <P>From every point of view there is a necessity for such legislation. Whether we can all agree upon the particular measure or not is another matter.  I know the Irish Medical Association felt the necessity for a measure of this kind.</P>
    <P>They had proposed an insurance scheme to cover people in this group. There was no reason why they should propose such a scheme, unless they felt those people needed some help to cover the expenses of medical treatment.</P>
    <P>The insurance scheme which they put up may be referred to and I would like to give my objections to it.  I am not against the scheme in principle at all, but it does not cover just what we are up against at the moment in this country. First of all, an insurance scheme must be either voluntary or compulsory. If it is voluntary, at least quite a number of people will not adopt it. It is just likely that the improvident person will not adopt it and will not have money to pay for his operation when up against a crisis.  Someone must look after him, as we cannot let him die.  Therefore, even if the insurance scheme were put into operation by the Irish Medical Association, there would be a residual problem there with which I or someone else would have to deal.  In that case, if I have to set up this elaborate machinery to deal with people of that kind, it would be just as well to deal with the lot.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would be feasible for the State to bring in an insurance scheme as well as this scheme.  I have no objection whatever to the Irish Medical Association bringing in an insurance scheme if they so wish.  Not only do I not object, but I have even <Col N="603" /> said to the Irish Medical Association that I would help them in every way possible to implement such a scheme if legislation is necessary.</P>
    <P>Someone may say that the insurance scheme should not be voluntary but should be compulsory.  When drawing up the Social Welfare Bill more than a year ago, we naturally gave a great deal of consideration to the point whether we should make everyone insure, that is, self-employed as well as employee, as has been done in England. We came to the conclusion that it would be impossible in this country. In England 80 per cent. of those gainfully employed work for another person and only 20 per cent. for themselves. In this country, as you know from the census, 50 per cent. are self-employed and 50 per cent. are employed by another person.  It is very difficult to work an insurance scheme by going to every individual: it is comparatively easy to work it if you collect contributions through the employer, as we do on the social welfare side.</P>
    <P>The self-employed cannot be dealt with in that way.  It would be a matter of going to every individual and collecting the premium from him.  That would be extremely costly and probably would not be successful.  On the social welfare side we had to drop the idea of bringing the self-employed in; and I think that on the health side we will have to do the same.  That is why I think compulsory insurance would be impossible.  As I have said already, voluntary insurance probably would not cover the whole problem.  Therefore, I had to reject insurance as a complete remedy for the present situation; but I repeat that if the Irish Medical Association wish to go on with an insurance scheme as well, they will get every help from me.</P>
    <P>Since 1945, the effort to implement a health scheme of this kind has been pressed by the Minister for Health, whoever he may be, and opposed by certain other interests.  Since the White Paper on this scheme was issued 12 months ago, giving an outline of what the Government had in mind, it has met with fairly vigorous criticism <Col N="604" /> from some quarters, particularly the Irish Medical Association, and opposition generally from various interests. The Irish Medical Association gave certain points which I might as well anticipate, as it is almost certain they will be raised in this debate.  One thing they have talked about in particular is what they call the &ldquo;doctor-patient relationship&rdquo;.  I have never been able to get a complete picture of what that relationship is, but evidently it is a type of relationship where doctor and patient get to understand each other and trust each other.  Undoubtedly, it would be a great pity to upset that relationship in any way.  I could never see, however, how this scheme would interfere with that relationship.</P>
    <P>Everyone in this country will still go to the same doctor as they went to before.  They can trust one another as they did before.  If the doctor trusted his patient before to pay the bill, he can trust him still, as he will have to pay the bill.  There is no change as far as that is concerned.  When that doctor sends the patient on for further treatment to hospital or for specialist treatment, it is said there is some change in this doctor-patient relationship. I do not see what it is.  If the patient is in the lower income group, there is no change.  If he is in the higher income group and chooses his own hospital, there is no change.  If he does not choose his own hospital, he will go to the county hospital or, if the medical authorities at the county hospital say the patient would be better in another hospital, he will go there.</P>
    <P>A lot of people have to go to hospitals of that kind for treatment and it depends on what bed they are put in as to what doctor attends to them. There is no great complaint about the doctor-patient relationship in a voluntary hospital.  I wonder what the change in relationship is there.  I remember, some 40 years ago, being a resident student in a hospital under a very famous surgeon.  He would come to the door in the morning, saying: &ldquo;When did that fellow over there come in?&rdquo;  I would say: &ldquo;Last night.&rdquo;  He would ask: &ldquo;What is wrong with him?&rdquo;  When he would have been told, he would say: &ldquo;I will operate on him in <Col N="605" /> the morning; bring him down to the table in the morning.&rdquo;  Is that the doctor-patient relationship that we are going to destroy?  I think the county surgeon will establish just as good relationship with these patients brought in, as would the doctors in any other hospital.  I cannot see what the change is in the relationship there.</P>
    <P>I was accused several times of Fabianism.  I believe there was a famous general in Rome called Fabius Cunctator.  He was noted for his powers of defence, in defensive warfare against Hannibal.  I do not know why I should be accused of adopting Fabianism: I suppose I am entitled to carry on defensive warfare if I so think fit. It appears that this man achieved success in particular by delay; he always took his time and eventually got Hannibal where he wanted him and finished him.  I am not delaying: I want to get on with this Bill as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The point has also been put that we are drifting towards State medicine.  I want to make this reply, though some Senators may think it is not an important point.  It is the local authorities that carry out all these schemes, providing the treatment for these various people who will benefit.  They are elected representatives of the people. My own experience of local authorities is that if any State Department tries to interfere with them, they just do not take it, but go on in their own way. They will not take dictation from anyone, so I do not think there is any great case to be made that we are introducing State medicine.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that I am very particular to preserve any voluntary effort we have in this country, and I have said over and over again myself to any body of people that came along to me and that wanted help in any way, that I have tried to help them in every way possible.  I have always done that because I think that voluntary effort is very important and I do not know why our local authorities should be attacked as being imbued with set ideas, because they are voluntary bodies, too.  They are not paid for their services, and they render very <Col N="606" /> good services indeed in looking after their hospitals and their various institutions, and I think we ought not to be too hard on them but rather we should be grateful for the things they have done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The local authorities give their services free and I would say that a lot of the members of local authorities take a great interest in those institutions, whether they are county hospitals, mental hospitals or whatever they may be.  They give a great deal of their time to see that things are well done in those institutions.  After all, the ratepayers elect them to look after those hospitals and do other things, just the same as the subscribers to a voluntary hospital may elect a committee.  So I cannot see that there is any great difference between them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was another attack made, that the records dealing with certain people might be open to the scrutiny of local officials.  Certain doctors said that they objected to telling what was wrong with their patients to the local authority officials.  Well, again, I want Senators to realise that for 100 years or so the people in the lower income group, that is the dispensary group, have been treated much the same as they are going to be treated in the future.  If the doctor attending a dispensary patient thought that this patient required hospital treatment I suppose that that record was written down in the books some way or other and there was no great objection to it. I have never heard any great objection to it in the past.  I have never heard the Irish Medical Association complaining about it that a dispensary doctor when he sent a patient into the hospital said that this man was suffering from so and so, whatever it might <Col N="607" /> be, and I know that since 1911, 42 years ago, the great majority of the doctors in this country have been signing National Health Insurance certificates, where they write down for everybody to see what is wrong with the person, and they never complained.  The disease that person is suffering from is written on the national health certificate, and the certificates certainly went up to Arus Brugha where there were 250 officials.  Every one of those 250 officials, I suppose, if they liked to, could look at those certificates and find out what So-and-so had signed there, and that on the word of the doctor who certified it, but there was no great protest from the doctors about that.</P>
    <P>It makes me puzzled why there should be a difference now and an objection now to things that were done in the past with people in the lower income group.  I tried to suggest, and the Irish Medical Association objected to my explanation, that the higher a person moved up in the stratum of society the greater the crime it was. What was wrong with me for saying this?  At any rate, I am making a case that there was no objection in the past when we were dealing with the lower income group.</P>
    <P>Another objection which has been made is that we are bringing in this scheme when we have not got the hospital accommodation for all those people.  First of all, whenever that objection is made to me and when I am defending that, when well-meaning people say it, my answer is: &ldquo;Why should more people come into the hospitals than in the past?  Is the case that you are making that more people would be there if the local authorities are going to pay for them? If that is the case, that there are people in the country who might be in hospital if they could be paid for, therefore the Bill is necessary.&rdquo;  I cannot see any other conclusion than that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>If there were hospitals for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If people say to me: &ldquo;We have not got hospital accommodation <Col N="608" /> and therefore you should not bring in this Bill,&rdquo; they must mean that there would be more people looking for hospital treatment than there are now if only they could get into hospital. There is something wrong with that. The argument is that there are people there with something wrong with them but they cannot get in because they cannot pay.  That means that the Bill is necessary then.  It means that the Bill is necessary because there are people who cannot afford to pay for themselves who ought to be in hospital. This was, in my opinion, a good argument for the Bill.</P>
      <P>Let us take the alternative.  It is argued that all the women will go into hospital under this Bill.  Why will all of them go into hospital under this Bill?  Take a woman at the moment whose husband is a farmer with £40 valuation.  At the moment she can either have her baby at home or she can go into hospital.  The doctor can attend her at home or in the hospital. If we say to this woman: &ldquo;We will pay for you now,&rdquo; why should she change her mind about having it at home or going to hospital?  Why should that change come over people? If we say that we will pay for the doctor, for the midwife, the medicine and everything else at home, why should she not remain at home?  Why should there be more women going into the hospitals than in the past? In any case we are providing for the tendency&mdash;and there is a tendency apart from this Bill&mdash;for women to go into hospital.  The position, when our present programme with regard to maternity is through, is that we will be able to provide for 65 per cent. of all maternity cases in the general hospitals, and the private homes which are there at the moment will be able to take 24 per cent.  That is 89 per cent., and when this programme is through, nine out of every ten women will be accommodated with institutional treatment and only one out of every ten need stay at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend as far as possible to make it attractive, if you like, for women to have their babies at home, and I intend specially to make it attractive for doctors who are attending those <Col N="609" /> women and looking after them to attend them in their own homes rather than send them to hospital.  I do not think that there will be a big change as far as that is concerned, but if there is we will be able to deal with that.  Anyway, no matter how you look at it, we would have institutions provided for a matter of this kind though you would never have the thing perfect.</P>
    <P>You will remember that we started, I think in 1945, to bring in a Bill to build those big sanatoria and the building commenced in 1948.  There is only one half of one of the big sanatoria open now.  The rest will be open by the end of this year, or this time next year perhaps.  While we were waiting for all those big sanatoria to be opened T.B. was being tackled. Now last month, July, 1953, was the first month that we could truthfully say that we had reached a stage where we could say to people suffering from T.B.: &ldquo;Well, there is practically no waiting period now&mdash;it is only a matter of a few weeks until arrangements can be made,&rdquo; and this is the situation before we have completed the sanatoria.</P>
    <P>It might have been argued&mdash;maybe back in 1947&mdash;that it would be better to wait until we had the sanatoria before we tackled the T.B. problem. If we had done that, we would now be six or seven years behind in tackling the problem.  We have probably saved many lives in this country by going on with the scheme as it was gone on with six or seven years ago.</P>
    <P>I think I have dealt with any matter I have noted in this Bill and I ask the Seanad to give the Second Reading a favourable and expeditious consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to save time, perhaps the Minister might answer a question.  The regulations made under the Principal Act have to be laid on the Table of the Dáil and of the Seanad.  Does that apply to regulations made under this particular Bill?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made this appear a matter of great simplicity. Listening to him, one would imagine that some of the very important people who have found flaws in this health measure were misguided people, particularly the doctors.  From the Minister's pleasant approach to the Second Reading of this Bill to-day one would imagine that the doctors who opposed this Bill, and other very important people, are just, as he has described them in the Dáil, &ldquo;nervous people&rdquo; who have groundless fears, that he has brought in an odd amendment to allay their fears but that he is absolutely right, that he has had experience and that the experience of other people, no matter who they may be or what their attainments, is not to be set against his experience.</P>
      <P>One gathered that the Minister was not quite serious in regard to some of the things which he said.  I have known a number of medical students and I know a number of surgeons.  The Minister said that, in his own student days, an eminent surgeon would walk into a ward with his hands in his pockets, glance at the figure of a man in a bed, and ask: &ldquo;When did he come in?&rdquo;.  On being told that the patient was admitted the previous night, the surgeon would take a look at him and say: &ldquo;Bring him down in the morning&rdquo;. I suggest that that is a very inaccurate and, perhaps, rather a frivolous and disagreeable account of what a great surgeon in a great Dublin voluntary hospital said when the Minister was a student.  I do not think the Minister gained his experience like that, but it was in keeping with his general line that these matters are quite simple and that the doctor-patient relationship, as he terms it, means no more than a surgeon, with his hands in his pockets, saying, in reference to a patient: &ldquo;Bring him down in the morning&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain matters on which we are all agreed.  There is complete <Col N="611" /> agreement that health services should be improved.  There is complete agreement also, I take it, that health services should be improved in a manner suitable to our conditions and suitable to our particular social and moral outlook.  For example, the conditions here are different from the conditions in the Six Counties and they are different from the conditions in Great Britain.  The Minister gave an example with regard to people who are self-employed and the same difference applies between industrial and rural areas.</P>
    <P>We would be in agreement, also, that poverty should not be a bar to a man or woman getting the service which he or she requires whether it is ordinary service or specialist service. Surely we should also be in agreement that all our resources of doctors, nurses, specialists, buildings and money should be used to advantage to improve our health services and that they can only be used to advantage when they are prepared to co-operate with one another and when the proper approach to them all has been made. There will be differences of opinion as to the best way of achieving these ends but, to me, this Bill seems to be a thoroughly bad Bill both from the point of view of the principles upon which it is based and from the point of view of the machinery which it provides.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the Bill under headings of principle rather than detail, because the details can be left over until the Committee Stage. There are three matters which strike one as matters of principle.  In the first place, in spite of the Minister's endeavour to prove that local bodies are voluntary bodies for certain purposes, this Bill marks an enormous extension of State control&mdash;an extension designed and desired by the Minister&mdash;and it is all over the Bill.  There is an immense extension of State control, to be exercised through the Minister himself or through his officials or through the county managers who are, themselves, for these particular purposes, the subordinates of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I should like to submit <Col N="612" /> that this Bill is not the best way of achieving the purposes of which the Minister has spoken.  It is a huge, unwieldy scheme which sets up very creaking machinery and aims at getting control of patients, doctors and hospitals.  It does not do the things which are feasible and which, if they were done, would at once make a very considerable improvement in our medical services.  Thirdly the cost of putting the Bill into operation is a completely unknown quantity.  Money spent intelligently on health services would certainly be money well spent and would yield a fruitful return.  Nobody would begrudge it.  What the Minister asks for in this Bill is a blank cheque. He has not made nor does he seem to be able to make, nor can anybody make, any form of assessment of the cost of this Bill which must be borne half by the ratepayer and half by the taxpayer, which, after all, means much the same thing.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of control and the extension of State influence.  The Minister himself has made his own position quite clear. There is a fundamental difference between his approach to these matters and ours.  When the Minister came into office, to use his own words, he cleared the doctors out of the Custom House.  The doctors were in the Custom House not as raiders, as one might imagine, but on the invitation of Deputy J.A. Costello, when he was acting Minister for Health, and they had been sitting down with the officials of the Minister for Health to discuss a health scheme.  Surely that was a reasonable idea, and was the best possible approach to a health scheme which must, in the end, fall to be worked by doctors.  But the Minister cleared them out.  His fundamental attitude in the matter is that civil servants&mdash;who are very estimable people in their own way and in their own place&mdash;must frame this kind of a Bill and that then, when that has been done and the Second Stage has been passed by the Dáil, the doctors must be asked for their opinion in a strictly advisory capacity.</P>
    <P>I think that that attitude is fundamentally wrong.  I think it is wrong <Col N="613" /> in itself and that it gets the worst possible results.  Later on, speaking at the National Health Council, the Minister explained that, in our democratic conditions, the last word must necessarily rest with him.  I suggest that the Minister is misguided and that that is not so.</P>
    <P>Consonant with democracy, one could leave considerable powers to other people besides Ministers.  One could get this kind of thing done in an entirely different way without the county manager, the officials, or the Minister.  The Minister's attitude is rigid autocracy.  He is very firm on his own imagined rights and he is very suspicious and even&mdash;though, perhaps, I should not say so&mdash;insulting to other people.  He talked to-day, for example, about the interests that opposed this Bill.  That is a curious word to use about some of the people who have opposed this Bill and, when applied to the doctors, it indicates that they are considering nothing but their own personal affairs.  The Minister's definition of democracy is quite bad.</P>
    <P>I am sure democracy does not mean State control and, with regard to health, that it does not mean the socialisation of medicine.  The Minister's declaration undoubtedly means a complete rejection of any form of vocationalism, although he is a member of a Government who set up a commission which made a very important report on vocational organisation.  His view also completely excludes the notion that what the State can do should not always be done by the State but by smaller or subsidiary bodies.  I should like to remind the Minister that there are several bodies in the State which are still allowed autonomy, for example, the universities. The Minister for Education might take the Minister's view and might seek to improve the teaching of economics in the universities by clearing out all the professors, bringing in some civil servants, making up a scheme, and then bringing back the professors and saying to them: &ldquo;What do you think of this?&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>And &ldquo;Work that&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Work that,&rdquo; as <Col N="614" /> Senator Baxter says.  I suggest to the Minister that there are other things besides his rights, the rights of the Minister, whoever he may be.  There is the natural law; there are the rights and duties of parents; and there is also not only the possibility but the necessity of not setting up enormous creaking State machinery to do a job which can be done just as well through a body smaller than the State, leaving to the State in that case the rôle of co-ordination and assistance.</P>
      <P>In spite of what the Minister says about local bodies, there can be no doubt that this Bill does set up a centralised bureaucratic system in a matter of the most intimate concern to the individual, his health.  The local authority for the purposes of health is not composed of the persons who are elected and who do so much good work freely, as the Minister has said.  For the purpose of health, the local authority is, I think, the county manager and the county manager is ultimately responsible to the Minister. Administration of the County Management Acts has brought about that result and there can be no doubt at all about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the Bill also&mdash;I do not intend to deal with it at length&mdash;sets out to suppress the voluntary hospitals, to make their position worse than it has been for some time, and I think the reason is&mdash;to go back to my original point&mdash;that the Minister and his advisers do not like the existence of professional people who have opinions of their own and who stand on them.  It is notorious in the modern development of what they call the managerial State that professional people of any kind are not well treated, that their rights are not very well recognised and that their pay is not good.  This is the era of the administrator, of the person who writes on a file, who has no special knowledge of anything in particular but who writes notes, gives advice and makes memoranda, who may be, and is, a very clever and very important part of the State machinery but who always resents anybody else's interference with his functions which gradually have become all-embracing <Col N="615" /> and have made him almost omnipotent.</P>
    <P>I remember the Minister as a medical student and I have been in contact during all my working life&mdash;indeed, from the time I was a student&mdash;with medical students, with doctors and with specialists.  I have heard them discuss over and over again, even before this Health Bill came into being at all, the peculiarities of the regulations made for county surgeons and other people.  There is a mania for the making of regulations by managers. Even when one teaches in a vocational school, one gets that kind of thing. The teacher must mark attendances in diagonal lines and must write certain particulars at the end of the roll book, but some of the very best teachers do not mark a roll at all and some of the very best surgeons cannot fill up a file as required.  Some of the regulations made to control these people are quite foolish and I feel that the real power resides, not as the Minister has said in the doctor, but in the official.</P>
    <P>Very little Sweepstake money has been used for voluntary hospitals.  A great deal has been used in Dublin for hospitals which are, in effect, State hospitals like St. Laurence's and St. Kevin's, and the day is approaching&mdash; the Minister rather rejoices in it&mdash; when the free specialist, the specialist who is not employed by a local body or by the State, will find it very difficult to make a living.  In my experience of them, and I have known a great many of them&mdash;I had the honour of being in class a long time ago with those of them who came to the top in Dublin in medical and surgical practice&mdash;that would be a great loss to poor people and they will not be sufficiently recompensed by the treatment provided by the Minister.  The plan in England is a different plan.  The Minister is not the last word in England. There are regional committees with a majority of medical people on them which administer the Health Acts.</P>
    <P>I am very interested also in the sections of the Bill which deal with teaching and research.  The Minister <Col N="616" /> has taken the power to give, under Section 63, courses in medicine.  I do not think it matters what they are called&mdash;they will, in effect, be post-graduate courses, and I put it to the Minister that these post-graduate courses should not be given by any authority, except the university colleges or the teaching bodies.  The power to direct patients of local authorities to other hospitals may be used against the voluntary teaching hospitals, but there are people here who understand that matter from their own experience extremely well indeed and I leave it to them.  I cannot, however, understand why the Minister wants to take the power to give courses in medicine.</P>
    <P>A curious feature&mdash;again to illustrate his point of view and his outlook&mdash;is that, when it was put to the Minister that the universities or the teaching bodies, those people in charge of medical education, should be put in charge of these courses, his answer was that these people might have a bias about a particular surgeon; that is to say, he thinks that other people, medical professors in universities, might have a bias, but he never thinks that the Minister for Health or his officials might have a bias or that the county manager might have a bias. They are, like the Russian Government, completely perfect.  About them, everything is right, but other people might have a bias.</P>
    <P>This Bill needs not only the unwilling work but the active co-operation of the medical profession, and it seems to me that it would have been possible to get that.  I am never able to understand why this enormous scheme has been devised, while, after nearly 20 years in office, the Minister and his Government have done so little of the things that are to their hand and which, if done, would make an immense improvement. For instance, many of our present dispensaries would not pass under the regulations in respect of the Dairies and Cow-sheds Acts.  They have no heating, no toilet arrangements and no running water and they are very often without a nurse.  Very little improvement indeed has been made in them.  Surely, if each dispensary <Col N="617" /> in the country were substantially improved, if it had lighting, heating, running water, and a nurse in attendance, it would make for an immense improvement in the treatment of the poor and of other patients as well.</P>
    <P>Dispensary doctors, of whom the Minister has spoken, are really whole-time officers on part-time pay.  If they had more facilities, they would be able to do a great deal more work for the poor and do it much more effectively than they will be able to do it under the Bill.  Likewise, from the point of view of working the Bill, we will need a great number of nurses.  So far as I have ever had conversations with doctors, they have always stressed that, from the point of view of maternity and general medical treatment, the nurses are all-important, but in this country they are badly paid and badly treated for the work they do. What is there in this Bill that is going to give us a better nursing service, going to attract more people to nursing than have been attracted up to the present and going to stop the drain from here to England?</P>
    <P>Nobody could praise too highly the work which nurses have done and do, and anybody familiar with conditions under which they work will realise that one of the first essentials for an improvement of medical services is better conditions for nurses.  In local areas, we will have to decide that they must have something other than a bicycle in the year 1953 to get around with.  I suggest that the Minister might do first things first.  If he did, he would be doing better than he is doing in the elaborate machinery of this Bill.  Although the Minister made a certain attempt to rebutt it, the tendency of the Bill is hospitalisation for everything and that dreadful one word hospitalisation includes midwifery.  I was glad to see the Minister agreed that the best place for a woman to have a baby was at home.  There is an Irish phrase which I remember hearing. I cannot remember where.  It is: &ldquo;Tá galar ort, a bhean, galar is fearr ná an tsláinte mhaith.&rdquo;  You have a disease, woman, which is better than good health.  The folk outlook upon midwifery is the correct outlook from <Col N="618" /> the point of view of modern scientific medicine.</P>
    <P>The third point is a question of cost. The Bill contains nothing at all about that.  I think the Minister at one time said that 2/6 on the rates would do. Is there any firm estimate at all as to what this particular scheme will cost, a scheme which has pushed aside doctors and other people as merely nervous children with groundless fears?  It will certainly involve a great deal of expense in administration as distinct altogether from the medical services anybody will get.  It will involve an immense expense in regard to files, forms, documents and clerks and the doctor, perhaps, may become the least important unit.</P>
    <P>In this cumbersome scheme the Minister is asking for a blank cheque. We might consider who is going to pay for all this.  Undoubtedly any money well spent on health would be a good thing but the cost of this scheme which is not yet determined, will fall not upon the rich but upon the ordinary ratepayers and taxpayers.  Some ratepayers may find that they will be paying a great deal more than they would under an insurance scheme.  The Minister pooh-poohed the idea of an insurance scheme.  If we can have compulsory income-tax at certain levels why not compulsory insurance at certain levels also?  That question occurred to me when the Minister was speaking.</P>
    <P>The people who will pay for this are the ordinary taxpayers and ratepayers. The bulk of taxation comes not from the rich&mdash;there are very few rich people now&mdash;but from the people with comparatively small incomes who pay either indirectly through cigarettes, tobacco and beer or in direct taxation.  That is another aspect of the Bill.  This Bill is but a beginning to deal with several income groups now but it will certainly extend itself to other spheres.  What I feel is worst about the Bill is the Minister's attitude of mind.  He criticises the attitude taken up by the doctors. He rejects their schemes.  He clears them out of the Custom House as if they were raiders.  Everybody is wrong.  One wonders, when one considers that these doctors are people <Col N="619" /> of experience in their profession, people of great academic achievements, in some cases, and people with experience outside Ireland, where the Minister gets the advice which enables him to take up his present attitude.</P>
    <P>This Bill is an example of centralised State control of the worst form.  It will not accomplish its purpose and its cost will be so great as not to justify the benefits in so far as there are benefits.  It has a Health Council in it.  I think it has got one additional power over those given by the 1947 Act, namely, the power to publish an annual report.  The local advisory council has also merely advisory powers.  If these bodies had any executive functions, then one could see something in it.  As the Bill stands at present, it is an example of centralisation and of the increase in the power of the State.</P>
    <P>The Minister is more reasonable than some people who occupied his office before and who seemed to have a curious hatred of the medical profession. I wonder whether between this and October, when we must take the Committee Stage of the Bill, the Minister could not again come to grips with the difficulties and devise a scheme which would meet general approval and which would be workable and would certainly be less costly to the State and more beneficial to the patient than this one?  If the Minister, instead of taking up the curious attitude he took up to-day, would take thought he would do a great day's work for himself and for the country.</P>
    <P>I think he should do that because, as it is, the Bill is one which shows every sign of leading to conflict instead of to better health for the public.  He should take further steps to see whether he could find any <i>modus vivendi</i> or any method out of the impasse reached between himself, the doctors and other people.  If he did that, he would reflect a great deal of credit on himself.  As far as we are concerned, the Bill is certainly one to which we are opposed but I do not propose to divide on the Second Reading.  The function of the Seanad, as Senator Douglas has said, is to consider <Col N="620" /> Bills to see whether they could be amended or improved.  We could improve the Bill.  I think the Minister himself in the interval, when everybody is feeling cooler, should do everything to improve the Bill by consulting with the people who will have to work it.</P>

      <P>The Minister has gone to a great deal of trouble to try to elucidate this Bill for those whom I might term the ignorant members of the House, the non-technical members. I know that already he has become almost a psychopath on the subject as he has listened to reams and reams of discussion on the same points.</P>
      <P>We who are deeply interested in this subject know all that already, but the Minister has to go over it again. I just want to refer to the motion put down by Senator Hayes.  I know the motion is not under discussion at the moment, but the end of a summer session is not the time to rush a very important Bill.  I would go further and say that it is not the time to rush on the Seanad a revolutionary Bill.  I do not say we are impressed.  We know what is in the Bill.  We know its weaknesses and we know what might possibly be done about it.  Now is not the time to go into particular questions raised by the Minister himself and by Senator Hayes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Party politics it is manifestly the job of the Opposition to pick holes in any scheme put up by the Government in power at any particular moment. That is a good thing but, perhaps, it is a pity that there are not more to provide the tar, the caulk and the oakum to close the rifts that are showing up.  It is the natural thing that one should pick holes.  If I attempt briefly to give my reaction to this document which we have before us&mdash;of course, a few members in the House will forgive the intrusion in the first person singular on account of who I am and whom I represent&mdash;I will immediately be labelled as a saboteur, perhaps a war monger or even worse than that&mdash;as Senator Hayes said, a man of vested interest.  I think that is the worst term of all when one considers the way that term has been used <Col N="621" /> recently, as a term of vituperation particularly as applying to my profession. I have a vested interest, so have all members here a vested interest.  I have a vested interest in myself, in my family and in my profession.  I represent a hospital and university that have an interest in things that are fundamental in this Bill.  I will not use the word &ldquo;vested&rdquo;.  I will ask you to take the word &ldquo;interest&rdquo; naked as it is.</P>
    <P>In my approach to the Bill the first thing I think of is the question as to whether a Health Bill is essential.  The medical profession 50 or 60 years ago did their best to wipe out the defects, the evils, of the poor law system.  The hospitals of the voluntary type carried on by scraping and scrounging as best they could.  Then we had descending from Heaven manna in the shape of bank notes provided from the financial sky by a very shrewd, business-like fairy godmother.  Naturally, that led rapidly to the belief that some legislation, some enactment, was necessary to try to bring to the public, all and sundry, I might say the staggering, near-perfect discoveries of medical science to-day.  Everybody agreed to that.  In 1945 it was agreed by every Party here.  The difficulty arises for those who know the essentials and who know the requirements in endeavouring to put that information in tabloid form for the digestion of people who are not aware of many facts.</P>
    <P>I would like to tell the Minister even if this Bill were rushed or allegedly rushed or, if we had the time to prepare our case as it were&mdash;I do not say against the Bill&mdash;there are many angles from which this matter must be discussed before we make out of it a good enactment.  I think I will secure unanimity in the House in asserting that the Minister for Health is not a knave or a fool.  I will also achieve unanimity in saying he is an honourable man.  He is doing his job.  However, reading through the clauses of this Bill and re-reading them, I fear I must see the distressing fact that the Minister suffers from the handicap that he is a servant, not of two masters but of three.  As Minister in a democratic <Col N="622" /> Cabinet he has to serve the people.  That is his duty.  As a member of a political Party he has to toe the line, and I mean that in the best sense. He has also to keep his ear cocked to the warning sounds behind the doors of his colleagues, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>I do not know anything about finance and I know less about the laws and orders of local government, but I could read in the papers that one Minister during the last 12 months travelled through the country, interviewed local authorities and tried to tell them the implications of the White Paper.  The question was naturally asked: &ldquo;What is it going to cost us?&rdquo;  He told every one of them: &ldquo;You pay 50 per cent.; we pay the rest.&rdquo;&ldquo;How much will the 50 per cent. be?&rdquo;  The only answer I could read in the Press&mdash;the only place I saw it&mdash;to use the unparliamentary expression, was: &ldquo;I am darned if I know.&rdquo;  That is the position with regard to the Minister's colleagues in other Departments.</P>
    <P>In many clauses and lines of this Bill, I see the permanent official.  The permanent official is a necessity.  The permanent staff is essential just as it is in our own domestic affairs.  However, I am afraid I have grounds for believing and being convinced that in this particular instance the Minister has found in the staff of the Health Department a body of people indoctrinated with ideas with regard to health service, to refer to it in a mild way, like a half-baked cake cooked by an untrained and inexperienced cook, likely to be unpleasant to the wholesaler and refused by the retailer if not by the would-be customer over the counter.  Remember this is a voluntary Bill.  Nobody is obliged to join the health service.  If the Minister does not provide the services, in other words, good value for the money, it will not succeed.  The public have their mouths agape since 1949 waiting for something for nothing.  I tell my friends here in the House to-day that instead of something for nothing, as the Bill stands, they will get nothing for a lot.</P>
    <P>There is a legendary figure named <Col N="623" /> Jack who had a revolutionary idea about architecture.  He decided to build a cottage and built a beautiful roof, but when he went to put it up the ordinary laws of gravitation refused to allow the roof to remain in mid-air.  He was utterly astonished, but even when he was told that what he was doing was wrong he persisted in his endeavour. At a later stage of the discussions on the Bill, I think it will be proved to the Minister that the Bill now is like the house that Jack built, it is the roof built first, while the ground work is the dispensary doctor and the general practitioner.</P>

      <P>As Senator Barniville has effectively said, there are many angles to this Bill.  I should like to deal with four of them, which I think are troublesome ones.  The usual type of Health Bill is a triangle, involving the State, the doctor and the patient; the Bill we are now considering is really a square, involving the central authority, the recipient of the treatment, the doctor or medical service and the local authority.  Unless those four corners are kept together and in proper relationship, the structure is going to be unstable.  I think it is our duty to see that we put the Bill in as square and stable a form as possible.  Senator Barniville has dealt with the medical angle.  I revert to the point to which the Minister originally referred when he suggested the lines on which we might discuss this Bill.  Our country is divided into four groups&mdash;the lower income group, the privileged middle income group, the non-privileged middle income group and an upper income group that does not immediately concern us and certainly does not concern me.</P>
      <P>The lower income group represents roughly 1,000,000 people, or one-third of the population.  The number in the privileged middle income group has never been clearly defined; the figure mentioned in the lower House is approximately 500,000 persons or one-sixth of the population.  The actual content of the non-privileged middle income group has never been worked out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="624" /> The distinction between those groups is made by way of the means test. Having been accustomed to regard the means test as a normal part of the income-tax legislation, I have always had a certain amount of difficulty in understanding the horror that many people have in regard to the application of a means test, especially in connection with public health.  In the lower House it was referred to as degrading and humiliating.  Why should it be degrading and humiliating? After all, sickness is undoubtedly the best medicine for snobbery, and it is very hard to be snobbish if you are sick, and desire whatever treatment you can get.  The assertion that it is degrading may be in some cases due to the administrative conditions. It may be that the fault lies with those who administer services subject to a means test.  When the Minister gets this Bill working, he may have a great opportunity to make the local service so attractive that people will want to come whether they are rich or poor and will not be repelled by thoughts of the condition of the means test.</P>
    <P>If there were no means test in this Bill, I would be far more alarmed, as I would be afraid that the means of the nation would not prove equal to the demands.  We know that a very great experiment is being carried out on the other side of the Channel, the British National Health Act.  The appointed day was the 5th July, 1948. The Act came into operation and was received with the greatest enthusiasm. It was said that not since the day when the fountains of London ran with wine at the coronation of Richard II was there such rejoicing. The Act was so popular that the annual Estimates rose to the figure of £460,000,000.  And, no doubt, the cost would have risen to the stars but for the fact that the Treasury put a ceiling of £400,000,000.  Working on the ratio of the populations and on the reasonable presumption that Irishmen are not worse in health than Englishmen, a free-for-all comprehensive Act for this country would cost something of the order of £26,000,000 a year.  Good health may be worth £26,000,000 but I should like time to think it out first.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="625" /> The means test is simple common sense and prudence applied to meet a particular situation.  It has the advantage that you can alter the means test, you can expand or contract in accordance with requirements whereas if you have no means test, to impose one is a different thing.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the effect of applying the means test to the screening of the community, the test operates as indicated in Section 15 on these four representative types of people.  It is only the people concerned in paragraph (c) that I am concerned with.  These are specified as adult persons whose yearly means are in the opinion of the health authority less than £600.  Why £600?  I do not quarrel with the level as I presume that has been reached as a result of statistical analysis but I do not feel entirely satisfied about the consequences of ensuring a level of £600.  In order to qualify, by virtue of having an income on a means of less than £600, I presume that the applicant will have to make a declaration. That declaration will be subject to penal threats about false statements; it will have to be verified and cross checked.  This application of the means test seems to me to involve a completely unnecessary and possibly complicated amount of correspondence.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister if it would not be possible to operate this means test simply through the ordinary income-tax legislation.  A declaration has been made to the income-tax authorities.  Suppose we defined the qualifying adult as a person whose taxable income is less than £600 a year.  Then he will have made his income-tax declaration&mdash;and he can be punished otherwise if he makes a false statement.  Let him be classed for health service according to the statement he makes in his income-tax return so that he will not have to make another declaration every time he wants to avail himself of the services of this Bill.  Furthermore, he will have the advantage of whatever allowance he is getting on his income-tax assessment and that will help him a little bit in qualifying for the advantages of the health services.  That refers to the section of the community which by <Col N="626" /> virtue of the £600 come into this privileged class.</P>
    <P>There is another sub-group in the middle income class, the unprivileged section, or, as I would venture to call them, the penalised section, and it is right that I should say something on their behalf in the discussion of this Bill.  These are the people whose incomes are above £600&mdash;£800 or £1,000 &mdash;and these are people whose expenditure will be increased by this Act when it comes into operation, because they will be paying for their fortunate next door neighbour who is getting advantages, while they are getting nothing, or very little, in return, apart from maternity benefits, which, of course, are quite considerable.  Those people, who include a very large number of friends of mine, represent a most worthy section of the community. They are hard working, honest, industrious people.  Perhaps if they were not so honest they would be in the upper income group.  They are endeavouring to maintain a certain status in the world.  They are perhaps rising up in the social scale or very often struggling against the stream, and I think they deserve every consideration. I believe that if the Minister could make some concession to those middle income under-privileged people in his Act he will be doing a service for which his name will be cherished for years to come, and he will be setting an example of what a Minister can do.</P>
    <P>What I suggest he should do is to give them some concession in taxation, allow them for sums spent for medical and surgical treatment and in the preservation of their own health.  There is no novelty about that suggestion. I have raised it several times before. The first time I raised it the Government of the day listened to it.  The second time I raised it the then Opposition listened to it.</P>
    <P>The third time nobody listened to it; and the fourth time an objection was raised to it.  The objection was that if we were to make this allowance for medical service the doctor or the surgeon might put up the charges, <Col N="627" /> because he would know that the patient would get an income-tax relief, so that an appendicitis operation might cost 100 guineas.  Well, the answer to that is very obvious.  The patient returns his surgical expenditure at 100 guineas and it merely goes off his income-tax and reappears on the gross income of the practitioner or surgeon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>The surgeon would resent that very much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamFearon" hpid="Professor Fearon Professor Fearon">
      <NameTxt>Professor Fearon</NameTxt>
      <P>We might come to discuss it on Committee.  I believe that the question of a personal allowance for health, medical health and bodily repair is a perfectly fair claim. Such expenditure is necessarily incurred in the case of almost anybody unless he is disembodied.  One must keep one's body in repair, and just as one gets an allowance for a typewriter or such things if they are necessary for one's trade, an allowance should be given for the repair of the physical frame.  I do appeal to the Minister to consider this as a possible concession to those members of the middle income group who are going to suffer from the operation of this very charitable Act.</P>
      <P>The next angle is the very troublesome one of ways and means&mdash;costs and such like.  We have had very little information about this.  It has been said that we deserve the very best possible treatment available.  Well we know that nothing is good enough for an Irishman, but sometimes things are a bit too expensive for him.  There is really no limit to the amount of money that one could spend on modern medical treatment, especially when it comes to diagnosis and treatment by modern methods.  These matters may be dealt with, I imagine, in great detail by some subsequent speakers.  Modern methods of diagnosis and modern drugs can be extremely expensive.  In some cases, it is a question of a man's life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other cases, it is an experiment, and in other cases it is merely striving to cure a disease in a week or two. If you get a cold in your head you can reasonably cure that by the old <Col N="628" /> remedy of redcurrant jam, hot water and bed for two or three days.  But it may also be cured by some of the new antibiotics in two or three hours, but this is going to cost you money.</P>
    <P>The question of costs is complicated by the fact that we are uncertain as to what will be the pressure of the demand for services.  A demand will arise for certain things that we can more or less picture and calculate. We know maternity requirements&mdash;we know from the birth rate what they will be.  The only other possible requirements can be divided, after that, more or less into acute diseases, chronic diseases and accidents.  Let us pass for a moment to accidents.  A tremendous number of accidents to-day are traffic accidents.  It may be quite right to assure us that with the modern motor-car with its excellent road holding, high speed and the like, there are not so many hospital cases for treatment.  Well, that is true in a way because one is likely to be killed dead, and the hospital is thereby relieved of the strain and expense of repairing the injury.  When we read of the roads taking such a fearful toll I should think that a Bill dealing with health services should be interlocked with road safety measures.</P>
    <P>Another part of the demand for services will come from the thirst for free medicine.  This is partly human nature and it is also partly due to the decline in the use of home remedies. It is part of the twilight that is falling over the domestic hearth.  The family in the old days had its own collection of remedies, and if it had not there was a neighbour who had them.  If you had conjunctivitis you used ordinary boric lotion and recovered in a couple of days.  You washed your eye with boric lotion.  Now you employ a very much more powerful proprietary antibiotic applied to it, but the treatment is a little bit more expensive than boric lotion.  There has been a very sad decline in that old tradition of the home remedies, and people now look to something that comes out of a bottle or out of a capsule or preferably from an ampoule via a syringe.  The public will have to be educated in some way into realising <Col N="629" /> that a lot of these remedies are really luxurious substitutes for commonsense and common health treatment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Fearon</NameTxt>
      <P>The fluttering, I think, will be from some patent medicine manufacturers who are getting the most encouraging profits without incurring a single tax.</P>
      <P>Lastly, in this connection there is the fourth angle, called the dangerous corner, the relationship between the health authority and the central authority, the doctor and the patient. As Senator Hayes indicated, this is one of the new features of the Bill.  When this Act comes into operation it will break down the historic balance that has so long existed between central government and local government, and in this connection I should be very grateful if you would allow me to quote a paragraph from the <i>Irish Monthly</i> of March, 1953, which very clearly sets forth the position.  I commend the article to your attention:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The historic functions of local government bodies derive from their duties under the poor law for public assistance, from their responsibilities for roads, bridges, etc., and from their environmental public health duties in the way of sanitation&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>and so forth.  The article continues:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;They also exercise certain ancient jurisdictions which might be traced back to the sphere of the former justices of the peace.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The article says that housing is a separate jurisdiction but closely associated with public health, and it continues:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It does not constitute a compulsory service like the new health service.  The whole complex of these functions falls clearly within the sphere of local as distinct from central responsibility.  It was to meet the cost of these and similar <Col N="630" /> services that the rating system was established.  It was never intended that rates should be levied to relieve the central Government of the cost in whole or part of central services nor to supplement the central revenues in any way.  The rates are already overburdened, indeed almost overwhelmed, by the cost of local services.  Any substantial addition to the burden might well lead to the collapse of the entire rating system.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that the Minister is perhaps being a bit conservative in the figures which he has given in the lower House. I think it would be safer to say that if the system is going to be good it will be expensive and that if it is going to give value it has got to be expensive.  The Minister has divided the charge between the ratepayer and the central Government on a 50-50 basis.  That means that he is taking on the local authority, as a compulsory partner in the administration of this scheme.  I see all sorts of trouble arising here. The Minister said this afternoon that the local manager will not yield to dictation.  Lots of people say they will not yield to dictation&mdash;like the mouse that objected to the steamroller. Eventually, dictation will win because to survive it has to win.</P>
    <P>I feel that there will be an intermediate stage of controversy of this type.  The local authority is paying the piper, or most of him, and the Minister is calling the tune.  What happens when the piper plays the wrong note?  What redress has the citizen?  He may go to his representative in the local council, who will tell him that the scheme is directed from the central authority, and that is the end of that.  He may go to his representative in the Dáil who will tell him that the Oireachtas does not have regard for the day-to-day working of the health scheme.  I think that the Minister will have to envisage some type of public relations mechanism for dealing with what must be a frequent source of friction and annoyance, especially in the early stages of the working of the Act.</P>
    <P>These are the outlines, the four angles of the Bill&mdash;the last angle being <Col N="631" /> the Minister himself.  In the text of the Bill, I see no indication that the Minister is invoking the aid of any superior committee or council.  I think that such a central body would be advisable.  Of course, the Minister has at his disposal the brains of the country on the various committees, and so forth, but I feel that some type of council that would meet, say, every month, would be desirable.  I think that something like that would be an enormous help to the Minister's staff and to his Department.</P>
    <P>The number of questions that will arise as to whether this or that type of treatment will be employed will often be beyond the powers of the physician or the doctor to decide.  Like the doctor-patient relationship that the Minister referred to, it is bound to change, I think, but it is bound to exist.  It will change because the doctor will have so many more patients and because so many things that the doctor did in the past will in the future be done for him in the laboratory by technicians from whom he will get reports.  That will mean a difference, and it will produce a different type of doctor-patient relationship.  The old doctor-patient relationship will have to go.  I am sorry for that but the modern man will not have time for it under the pressure of his responsibility.</P>
    <P>Senator Barniville referred to the house that Jack built.  I do not propose to develop that theme because, in the building of his house, Jack used mortar and various accessories.  However, recurring to my mind is a statement from the writings of the most famous doctor in the world&mdash;from the writings of St. Luke&mdash;in which he refers to the advisability of sitting down to consider the cost of the tower before you start to build it.  These health services are going to go on: there is no going back.  The present Minister is the pioneer of this Bill. He is also the first in a lineage of Ministers who will be administering the Bill down through the years.  He is not asking for a blank cheque: he is really asking for a blank cheque-book, because the people who follow <Col N="632" /> him will be drawing cheques in their turn.</P>
    <P>We are faced with very important and very serious responsibilities in considering this matter.  For that reason, I have tried, as best I can, to be as constructive as possible and not to bring up again material which has been debated with considerable heat and fervour in the other House.  I leave it like that on this the Second Reading of the Bill in the hope that, on the Committee Stage, the points which I have raised will be dealt with systematically.</P>

      <P>The only body capable of influencing the county manager in any way is the council of which he is the servant, and not the Minister.  Senator Hayes also said that the Bill aims at getting more control of the patient and the doctor and that, altogether, this Bill contains a distinct extension of State control. In my view, such statements cannot be substantiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hayes also referred to a statement made by the Minister in the other House about finding a committee of the medical profession sitting in the Custom House who were supposed to be occupied in drawing-up a health <Col N="633" /> scheme.  It is quite true that such a body was brought into the Custom House by the then Taoiseach and acting Minister for Health, Deputy J. A. Costello.  However, I think that it is accepted by people throughout the country who know the history of that particular period that that was more camouflage and delayed action tactics than anything else&mdash;that the purpose of bringing those people together was not so much to prepare a Health Bill as to achieve that delayed action.</P>
    <P>Senator Barniville does not often grace this House with his presence.  He took it upon himself this afternoon to apologise for rising to speak and he explained that his speech was for the benefit of the more ignorant members of the House.  I listened very attentively to what he had to say but I am sure that most members of the House must admit, as I must admit, that we are still in ignorance.  I noticed that he did not give us very much enlightenment on one particular matter, but he said very emphatically that a Health Bill was essential.</P>
    <P>Some years ago, the Dáil and Seanad agreed that it was in the best interests of the Irish people that a separate Department of Health should be set up, and surely the setting up of that Department and the appointment of a special Minister must give some grounds for belief that the purpose of doing so was to ensure that some active steps would be taken to improve our health services.  Otherwise, there would have been no necessity for it and the Dáil and Seanad should not have passed the necessary legislation.</P>
    <P>When a change of Government came about in 1948, the incoming Government took this matter of health so seriously, we must assume, that it came to the conclusion that it would be impossible for one person to carry on the duties of Minister for Social Welfare and Minister for Health and they appointed the most energetic and enthusiastic member of the Cabinet to the important post of Minister for Health.  They gave him permission to prepare a Health Bill and we know from the records of the Dáil that that Bill was prepared.  If this Bill is not <Col N="634" /> necessary and if the arguments advanced against it by the Opposition are sound, why did they set up a separate Ministry and why did they allow the then Minister to give so much of his time and energy to the preparation of that Bill?  We must assume that it was because they felt it was in the best interests of the people that it should be prepared.  Various Parties at the General Election of 1948&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The fact is that all Parties have admitted on public platforms and in their literature canvassing votes the need for an extension and improvement of health services. Many of them criticised very severely the then existing services.  They were not satisfied with our hospitalisation facilities, the treatment of mental diseases, the care of aged persons in county homes and the existing dispensaries. In view of that, it is very difficult to understand why some of these people now find they cannot support this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition say&mdash;Senator Hayes gave expression to this viewpoint to-day&mdash;they oppose the Bill on three grounds.  The first is the ground of principle, but it is very strange that, when the Bill was introduced into the <Col N="635" /> Dáil and came up for Second Reading, no matter of principle seemed to be involved.  The Opposition allowed the Bill to get a Second Reading without any comment and without pointing out to the Minister where this great matter of principle arose.  It arose some time later, somewhere and somehow.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the Opposition say&mdash; Senator Hayes put forward this argument, as did Senator Barniville when he referred to the house that Jack built&mdash;that, if the Bill is put into operation, the rush for treatment will be so great that it will overtax our present hospital facilities.  As the Minister said, is that not one of the greatest arguments in favour of the Bill?  People do not seek medical treatment or hospital treatment without some cause.  It is something you cannot get, unless you are certified as being in need of it by a medical officer. There in lies the greatest argument for the Bill&mdash;that there must be a number of people at present who need these services but who are deprived of them because they are not in a financial position to take advantage of them and because they dread getting into a position in which heavy cost would fall on them, if they did so.  The third point of opposition is that the country cannot afford it.  My reply to that would be that the country cannot afford to go on as it is, with so many people who should have these services deprived of them.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to repeal certain sections of three Acts&mdash;the Public Assistance Act, 1945; the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, and the Health Act, 1947.  Is there any member of the House who objects to the passing of this Bill, who does not appreciate the great advances made in the services provided by these three Acts?  We were told when these Acts were going through that the country could not afford them, but we can see the great progress made in relation to the provision of sanatoria.  The Minister has told us that we are now within sight of having a waiting list no longer.  There was at that time criticism about the Department entering <Col N="636" /> into this matter of the provision of sanatoria.</P>
    <P>There was criticism also of the Mental Treatment Act, but that Act did much to remove from the minds of our people the stigma which originally attached to undergoing treatment in a mental hospital and in that way that Act has done a great deal of good. The Health Act of 1947, by the section which makes provision for financial assistance to people undergoing treatment for T.B., has removed from the breadwinner or person responsible for looking after a business the financial worry which so often delayed recovery. I mention these three Acts because we all admit that great advances have been made.</P>
    <P>On the expenditure side, we find that expenditure on health services has almost doubled in the period from 1947 to 1953, but not one penny of that expenditure has fallen on the local rates.  It has all been provided out of central funds and surely if the implementation of these Acts has achieved the results which everybody can see, one must acknowledge that whatever little necessary expenditure may fall on the rates later on as result of the implementation of this legislation will be money well spent.  It will be three or four years before any cost will fall on the rates.  In view of the trend we can see in regard to increased production there will be a much lighter burden on the rates.  In two or three years' time there will be a number of us in this House and in the other House urging the Minister for Health &mdash;I hope it will be the present Minister&mdash;to bring forward a more advanced and more comprehensive Bill than that which is before us to-day.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of cost, there is an old saying in our part of the country that health is wealth. What applies to the individual applies also to the nation in my opinion.  Our slogan should be that health is wealth and that nothing but the very best that medical science can supply is good enough for our people.  That is the aim and object of the Minister.  This Bill does not provide all we would like it to provide but it is a step in the right direction.  Can we afford it? <Col N="637" /> Before dealing with that aspect of the matter, I should like to ask a few questions.</P>
    <P>Are we satisfied with our existing services?  Are we satisfied that the present state of affairs should continue? We are all aware that persons defer from day to day and from week to week consulting the doctor or undergoing a particular operation.  Why? It is not because they would not like to do it.  It is not because it is necessary to do it, but because they feel that the financial burden entailed by so doing is too great.  As a result, very serious consequences have resulted, not only for the patient himself, but for his family for years after.</P>
    <P>There is the other aspect of the matter where a person makes up his mind to attend the doctor and has to struggle very hard in order to meet the necessary expense.  Who are the sufferers?  In most cases it is the young families who suffer, the people on whom the money ought to be spent for nourishment and building them up. And it may happen that the disease which affected the patient might also extend itself to the other members of the family.</P>
    <P>There is another very important angle&mdash;one which has not so far been brought to the notice of the people.  I have not got the figures readily available&mdash;I am sure the Minister could make them available&mdash;in regard to the amount of money that is spent by the people of this country each year upon the education of medical students to export them to foreign countries to build up the health of the people of other nations while our own people at home are deprived of their services. If the only reason advanced in favour of this Bill was to end that state of affairs it would be sufficient to get my support.</P>
    <P>When we are making up our minds as to whether we should support the Bill we have to ask ourselves whether we are satisfied that the present red ticket system should continue.  When it is a question of a sudden illness or illness of any kind the doctor is not the first person that has to be called. No matter what time of the day or <Col N="638" /> night a person becomes ill the first person to be called is the person who issues the red ticket.  That ticket has to be brought to the doctor.  Perhaps, there may be a long distance between the residence of the person responsible for issuing the red ticket and the doctor who has to attend the patient. In many cases, by the time this procedure has been gone through the sick person has probably passed away.</P>
    <P>Are we satisfied&mdash;and reference has already been made to this&mdash;with our present dispensary system?  I am sure that one of the first matters to be attended to by the various committees set up in each local authority will be to bring our dispensaries up to date. Most important of all, are we satisfied with our school medical system? Neither the Minister, the schools medical inspectors nor anybody else can say that they are.  The work imposed on the person appointed to carry out this job is too great.  The lapse between carrying out an inspection in one school and the time of the next inspection is too great.  The result is that the children will probably have left school entirely without having got the attention they should.</P>
    <P>In that connection, there is provision for a review of existing dispensary districts.  Many years ago, when Dr. Ward brought a Bill before this House in conection with National Health Insurance or something relating thereto, I suggested&mdash;I still offer the suggestion&mdash;that the time had come for a review of our existing dispensary districts.  They were drawn up at a time when the mode of transport and lines of communication were not as they are to-day.  I think if we could bring about a rearrangement and relieve many of our existing dispensary doctors of the routine dispensary work and allocate them this important work of school inspection and ensure that the school medical inspection is followed up with the treatment found necessary for children we would be building up a young and healthy State.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should like to draw the attention of the Minister and all concerned when this Bill is passed and that is provision <Col N="639" /> for our old and infirm people.  Great progress has been made but there is a lot to be desired in that connection. We should certainly take very active steps to give those people in the last years of their lives that which they deserve from the State.  There should be a greater segregation in regard to the types of people who are now committed to institutions for such people. It is only proper that there should not be sent to such places people who would be more of a disturbance than a help to people who are already there.</P>
    <P>Let us see what is in the Bill.  There is, as I think Senator Barniville pointed out, no compulsion on any person to avail of any service under the Bill.  Neither is there any compulsion on any member of the medical profession to provide service under the Bill.  I do not propose to delay the House, but I should like to refer to one or two sections which I consider to be very important.  There is no obligation on any person to submit to an examination of any kind.  Section 14 provides medical services for people who are unable to provide such services by their own industry or other lawful means.  That is already provided for, I think, to a great extent.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides institutional and specialist services for an insured worker, for persons with a yearly income of less than £600 and for farmers under £50 valuation.  There is a group of people suggesting that this is free or that it is the first step to State medical service.  When you take into consideration that in computing that £600, the total family income will be considered and not the income of the head of the house, it is not such an extravagant sum nowadays.  I would be more inclined to support Senator Fearon in his suggestion than to criticise the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>As regards the limit of £50 valuation for farmers, I am sure many members of this House who are members of local authorities and county councils, and those of us who are not, have almost every day of the week farmers coming to us who have themselves or their wives or families undergone treatment in the county <Col N="640" /> hospital or elsewhere.  They are presented with a bill from the local authority and they are appealing to you to use your influence to have this bill reduced, pointing out that if you cannot succeed in that it will have serious consequences for themselves and their families.  This is a welcome provision from that point of view, because it will at least assist those people under £50 valuation.  There will, of course, still be people over the £50 valuation limit who will have a grievance because their conditions sometimes may not be very much better than those of people below the £50 level.</P>
    <P>The Minister has already dealt with the very important point of expectant mothers having a choice of doctor. There has been a suggestion that the Minister steamrolled this Bill through the Dáil.  The steamroller moved very, very slowly if it was steamrolled through that House.  If we examine how effect is to be given to the Bill we will find that there is provision for a consultative council; locally there will be the health committee and not less than four members of this committee will be members of the local county council.  The remaining members will be medical men and other people interested in the administration of the medical services and I think that is a very fair representation.  You have first a council composed of those people interested in medical matters and who can give advice on matters of public health to the Minister; every Order and regulation the Minister makes is submitted to them.  Then you have the county council as the public health authority.  They have authority to set up this health committee and there is none of this bureaucracy that we hear so much about in relation to this Bill.</P>
    <P>We all recognise, I think, the great services that have been rendered to the nation by the medical profession.  We all know of doctors throughout the country who have acted very charitably and helpfully in every way.  I think it is in very rare cases that they have put the benefits that might accrue from their attendance first.  Everybody will agree that the medical profession <Col N="641" /> has rendered very good and useful service.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that at this present stage when there is an attempt being made to extend these public health services there should be anything but co-operation between those people. The various groups concerned should bear in mind that, while consultations and suggestions will always be very welcome, no matter what Minister or Government is in power, the responsibility of formulating and passing legislation through the Dáil and Seanad and giving effect to it rests on those people elected by the Irish people to govern on their behalf.  At no time should a Government delegate or allow this function to be taken out of their hands by any group of people, section or society, no matter how powerful or influential they might be.</P>
    <P>It is very necessary that everyone in the country, both young and old, should co-operate and see in this Bill an opportunity for giving greater and better services to the community.  We all hope they will give of their best when the Bill is enacted and when all this controversy passes over.  Political Parties must make up their minds that they are not going to try to cash in on the grievances of the publican or of any other member or section of the community.  They must be prepared to realise that whatever little advantage might accrue from this measure, there is a bigger issue at stake, particularly when we are discussing such an important matter as public health.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRuane" hpid="Mr. S.T. Ruane Mr. S.T. Ruane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I want to say that I do not approve of this Bill.  However, I do not intend to detain the House or occupy much of its valuable time by giving reasons that have already been fully aired in the other House and have also been referred to by Senator Hayes in opening this debate to-day.  I would like to approach this matter from the viewpoint of a local representative who from time to time has to meet his constituents and discuss matters of local expenditure with them and also to meet these people at certain periods when either themselves or their relatives undergo hospital care or the <Col N="642" /> attention of a specialist to be provided by the local authority.</P>
      <P>From the remarks of some people since this Bill was first introduced in Dáil Eireann one would imagine that the health of the people had been sadly neglected by the local administrative bodies throughout the country. I would like to give a few figures of what the health services in County Mayo cost ratepayers this year.  This year the health services in County Mayo will cost £590,000.  I know that quite an appreciable amount of that sum will be recovered, but after recoupment takes place a net expenditure of £328,339 will have to be borne by the rates of the county.  The assessable valuation of County Mayo is £378,823.  Therefore, on health services alone the ratepayers of County Mayo will meet a demand within £50,000 of the assessable valuation of the county, and this does not indicate neglect of the health of the people.</P>
      <P>Since this Bill was introduced in Dáil Éireann interviews have taken place in the various counties and between servants of the Department of Health and members of the local bodies.  Though in many cases&mdash; perhaps in all cases&mdash;these representatives expressed themselves in favour of an improved health service they were very much concerned as to what the extra cost of this health service would be on the rates and how far the counties could go to meet the cost. To the question as to what it would cost the answer given was that it might cost 2/- or 2/6 in the £.</P>
      <P>Coming back again to County Mayo, I would point out that a rate levy of 1d. in the £ raises £1,500.  Therefore, if you have to strike an extra rate or levy of 2/- in the £ as a result of this Bill, it will mean something in the neighbourhood of £36,000 added on to the burden which the people already have to meet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been a member of a local authority for over 25 years and during all that time I never experienced anything in the nature of indifference or callousness amongst my colleagues in providing treatment for the sick poor and the indigent.  We had always the active co-operation of every dispensary <Col N="643" /> doctor and other doctors and of those in charge of the different hospitals.</P>
    <P>From time to time we sent patients to voluntary hospitals.  In cases where the urgency necessitated the immediate dispatch of a patient to a voluntary hospital and not through the local body, that patient subsequently received a bill from the administrators of the voluntary hospital, very often a substantial bill, but I never knew of a case where there was not a substantial reduction or even full remission, on representation of the circumstances of the patient to the governors or administrative bodies of those voluntary hospitals.  I never knew of a case where there was anything but the greatest anxiety on the part of those people to co-operate with the local bodies in the treatment of cases. That goes for voluntary hospitals of every denomination.</P>
    <P>The present system of health services is not as perfect as we would like but perfection can be obtained only in easy stages and progress must be a matter of hastening slowly.  Perfection will never be maintained without the co-operation of the medical profession, who must be responsible for the success of any health scheme. The vast majority of the medical profession, or the association that speaks for the majority, is not taking kindly to the present Bill.  It is not for me to give the various objections they have raised, but I would refer to one that is of concern to quite a number of us, that is, that certain sections of this Bill are in conflict with principles of Catholic social philosophy.</P>

      <P>In speaking on a measure like this I feel that as a doctor I have certain advantages and also certain <Col N="644" /> disadvantages.  Amongst the disadvantages, in the first place, as mentioned by Senator Barniville, it may be said that the question of vested interest comes in.  On the other hand one's membership of the Irish Medical Association is also likely to be interpreted as meaning that one is acting as the mouthpiece of the association, that one's views are of necessity conforming to the views of the association. At the beginning I would like the House to know my position in both these respects.  I am not in medical practice and although I am interested in health I have not got that interest which might be regarded as objectionable. In the second place, I am a member of the Irish Medical Association but I am not a member of or associated with any group or committee of the association which has been discussing this Bill.  I get the journal of the association and read it and I read also the articles on medical matters in the daily Press.  I discuss those matters from time to time with my colleagues when I meet them and I know a certain amount about their views.  It may easily happen that some of the things I have to say will be similar to views expressed by members of the association or by the association officially.  If that is so I would like the House to know it is not because I am acting as the mouthpiece of the association.  I have not been at any time approached to do so.  It is because I feel that these views can be accepted by me as my own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every doctor will agree, I am sure, that it is desirable to provide the best possible health services for the community. Unfortunately the cost of these services has been rising very steeply during the last ten or 15 years. We have these new powerful drugs that are very expensive.  The investigation of illness involves laboratory work that is costly and there are numerous X-rays and various other types of investigation which all cost a good deal of money.  As a result, only in a comparatively small number of cases can the cost of a serious illness be met by a person privately.  Poor people are reasonably well provided for even at present in our general <Col N="645" /> hospitals.  They get there the attention of eminent medical specialists and they get full facilities for investigation. The burden falls with the greatest weight on the shoulders of those to whom the Minister has referred as belonging to the middle income group. The burden is very largely a question of the cost of the medical investigation rather than the doctors' fees. That is a point that needs to be stressed.</P>
    <P>The fees charged by a doctor for advising a patient have changed very little during the last 30 years.  I know many senior members of the medical profession in Dublin who charge exactly the same fee now for a consultation as they did when they qualified 25 years ago.</P>
    <P>The crushing blow to the person in the middle income group is not the bill he personally has to pay to his doctor. In nine cases out of ten it is the cost of the investigations that have to be carried out and of X-rays in hospitals, and so on.  I know no doctor who will refuse to see a patient and give him the benefit of his advice, even when that patient cannot afford to pay him anything.  And when he sees him for nothing at all or at a reduced fee, I do not know any doctor who leaves that patient, or wants to leave him, under any sense of obligation or under any feeling that the doctor has been charitable to him.  Furthermore, when the doctor sees the patient and advises him he does so, in all cases, to the best of his ability.  There is no question of grading his advice according to the fee the patient is prepared to pay. If the patient is prepared to pay half fee he gets the same grade of advice from the doctor as the patient who the doctor knows can afford to pay full fee.</P>

      <P>As I was saying when the House adjourned, the cost of medical treatment has risen very substantially during the last ten or 15 years, and it is now very high, but the principal items in that increase are those that relate to the expenses of investigation, <Col N="646" /> like laboratory services, X-ray investigation and so on.  The actual increase in the fees of the medical men who look after the patients have been very slight, and every doctor is prepared to see a patient for no fee at all or for such a fee as he can afford.  As I said, I do not know of any doctor who ever refused to see a patient because he could not pay a certain fee or, when he had seen him, left him with any sense of obligation or under an impression that the doctor regarded this as a charity.  The increase in fees really came as an incidental feature on the necessity for hospital investigation.</P>
      <P>It is only in institutional treatment that you have this system of grading patients according to the amount of money they can pay, whether they are private patients, semi-private or public patients.  I think it ought to be made quite clear that the doctors concerned have no responsibility for this whatsoever.  In many cases it is a matter for the hospital board or for the public authority, but the doctor has no function in the matter.  He may happen to be a member of the board, but generally the medical men on a hospital board are in a small minority.</P>
      <P>The cost of these increasing medical expenses can be met in a variety of ways, and the present Bill is one approach to the solution of this problem. I have read this Bill very carefully a number of times, and I have looked through all the amendments, and I feel that if we are convinced that this is the best way of dealing with the difficulty, then this Bill, as a Bill, is reasonably satisfactory.  I do not think, in fact, that the Minister claims any more than that.  I think he said in the other House that he believes it would be impossible to produce a perfect Health Bill.  We will all agree with that, but the present one is a very fair attempt to meet this difficulty&mdash;that is to say, if we are agreed that this is the best way to attempt to meet it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of points of detail which might arise, but those can be discussed when the Committee Stage is reached.  I feel, for instance, <Col N="647" /> that the question of nutrition has been neglected.  Health service is not any longer merely a question of treating diseases.  It is very often a question of preventing diseases.  That is frequently a question of maintaining a satisfactory level of nutrition.  However, these matters can be gone into when we come to the Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is much more pertinent here to discuss the general advantages or disadvantages of this approach to the solution of the problem.  As a matter of fact, we have an object lesson in the operation of the national health service in England.  It is there for us to take and to profit by.  If we do not do that, I think we are being very foolish.  It is quite true that that national health service in England has gone very much further than we propose to go in this Bill, but the differences are differences of kind; they are not differences of degree.</P>
    <P>If we look at the national health service in England and try to analyse the faults which it has revealed, the principal one which we see&mdash;right at the beginning&mdash;is that when it came into operation it did not provide adequate medical attention for the number of people who rushed to seek such attention.  That matter was referred to by the Minister, particularly with reference to hospital beds.  It was also referred to by Senator Hawkins.  They put forward the argument that if there are many more people seeking hospital treatment when this Bill of ours comes into operation, it means that there have been people who were denied hospital treatment before although they were really in need of it.</P>
    <P>I do not think that that is a valid argument.  The experience in England has shown it to be otherwise.  The rush by people in England to avail themselves of hospital services, both out-patient and in-patient services, was not on the part of those who were really ill or had been ill.  It was on the part of all kinds of people in respect of minor ailments which would ordinarily have been dealt with by their family doctor in their own homes.  About a year ago, <Col N="648" /> in Birmingham, it was quite impossible to get an ambulance because anybody whose child had a cut shin or a bruised knee and who wanted to take the child to hospital simply rang up and demanded that the ambulance be sent out.  That is going on even yet.</P>
    <P>Many people who are getting this attention are, of course, people who need it, but it is also true that a large number of people are coming forward demanding such attention because it is free&mdash;people who would never have thought of consulting a doctor or, if they did, would have been quite content with the ordinary local medical services.</P>
    <P>People who can stay in hospitals without any charge to themselves do not usually see any reason why they should go home until they feel themselves that they are fit to go home&mdash;and that is very often a week or two longer than the doctor in charge of them would ordinarily be prepared to keep them in hospital.  The doctor may say to a patient: &ldquo;You must go home to-morrow because you are fit,&rdquo; but the patient may say: &ldquo;I do not want to go home to-morrow.  I propose to go home to-morrow week.&rdquo;  That is a very difficult position and sometimes it may mean that people who are seriously and acutely ill are unable to get a bed. That obtained in its worst form at the beginning of the service in England, but it still obtains there to-day.</P>
    <P>Only a short time ago, a neighbour of mine rang me up and said that she had a relative from England staying in her house.  Nominally, he was over here on a holiday but she thought that he was ill and she asked me if I would advise her as to what she should do. I am not in clinical practice, but if anybody consults me about a problem such as that, I feel that I should give some sort of advice.  I saw the patient who was just a few doors away.  I found a man in bed who was obviously suffering from a severe degree of over-activity of his thyroid gland.  This is a serious condition which should be treated pretty well immediately, but doctors treating this condition nowadays usually require a certain amount of investigation before they prescribe the exact amount of treatment <Col N="649" /> required.  This patient had consulted his doctor in England and the doctor had told him that he was suffering from this condition, but could not get him the necessary investigation for several months.  There was such an amount of work waiting in the hospital in which the investigation would have to be carried out that there was no hope of his obtaining admission for several months.  In the interval, he suggested that he should come to Ireland, adding that perhaps the holiday and the rest would do him good.  It was not doing him any good when I saw him and I was able to arrange to have his investigation done in Ireland within a matter of 48 hours.  He got temporary treatment and was very much improved before he returned to England.  That was a case that came to my personal knowledge and I know that kind of case arises over and over again.</P>
    <P>I was on holidays in Wales a fortnight ago and in the place I was staying there were a man and his wife from a town in central England.  We discussed this national health service &mdash;I like to try to get first-hand opinions regarding it whenever I am amongst people who are concerned or have to deal with it.  They told me: &ldquo;We think the national health service is a good thing.  We go to the doctor who is registered under the national health scheme for all our minor complaints, for our glasses, to have our eyes tested and for coughs and colds&rdquo;.  The man then said: &ldquo;It is only fair to tell you that we have another doctor who is not in the national health scheme. We employ him privately whenever we feel that one of the family is seriously ill.  He can get us a bed in hospital almost immediately, whereas the doctor under the national health scheme cannot secure one until a waiting period of two to three months has passed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are things that happen in a service like this in England.  We know about them and every doctor knows some instance of that kind.  I have heard it rumoured that people living close to Liverpool sometimes come to Dublin by the morning boat and go back by the boat that evening in order <Col N="650" /> to get immediate medical attention in Dublin.  I have not come across a case like that&mdash;I am speaking only of cases I know of my own personal knowledge.</P>
    <P>It is a lot easier in districts where people are better off, because these people are rather better educated and less driven to take advantage of something just because it is offered for nothing.  In such places you find that the younger people, the people who have just been married and are trying to bring up a family, find that the national health service is very good. They can make arrangements some months before for a wife who is going to have a baby to be given free attention, and this is, of course, a great advantage.  We should profit by the lessons afforded by the operation of the scheme in England.  We should not necessarily discard the good points of such a scheme as the Minister has introduced but should try to foresee and forestall any disadvantages that may arise.</P>
    <P>I think it was Senator Hayes who pointed out that, in the operation of a national health service or a service like that which we are discussing which is meant to cover large sections of the community, there are inevitably a large number of forms to be filled up.  That complaint is constantly put forward in England&mdash;every general practitioner will tell you that he is filling up forms from morning to night.  Everything must be filled up and a return made of every patient.  Then there is the dreadful word &ldquo;triplicate&rdquo;.  Everything, apparently, must be done in triplicate.  On the other hand, the doctors in England do not express great dissatisfaction with the service. The criticisms do not come because they are personally dissatisfied.  That kind of service offers to the doctor a good deal which the ordinary hurly-burly of practice does not offer and can never offer.  It offers fixed hours, A doctor can have two or three people in partnership and the finances of no one of them will suffer because he has this arrangement.  They take it in definite rotation so that any individual doctor knows exactly when he will be on call and when he can go out and enjoy himself.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="651" /> It also offers definite holidays&mdash;with pay, of ocurse, while the doctor is on holidays.  This, of course, would not arise in the service we are discussing here because it is not at the moment a national health service in the broad sense.  In England, locums are paid for you&mdash;all advantages which a doctor appreciates.  Furthermore, for the young doctor setting up practice, there are a number of advantages.  He has a certain secure income from the very beginning if he is registered under the scheme, because he gets patients right from the time he sets up.  He does not have to put up his plate and wait until somebody comes to him.</P>
    <P>In England, however, although the doctors realise that they have these advantages, they are very far from being satisfied with their position. Financially, they are all right, too, because there have been recent awards which bring the financial benefits for medical practice up to a very high level, but still they complain that there is such a rush of patients that they have no time to examine them.  It is only a question of finding out is a patient ill or not.  If he is not, they give him a bottle and send him home; if he is, they send him to hospital. They get none of the satisfaction out of medical practice which, in their student days and in their early days as qualified practitioners, they did get. That they regard with some real dissatisfaction and I do not think that many of them regard the security I have referred to as adequate compensation.</P>
    <P>These experiences have been reported from England.  It is just five years to-morrow since the English scheme came into operation and, to a certain extent, they are still having the same experiences.  Can we hope to do any better in this country under a scheme such as the Bill will bring into operation?  I cannot see how we can.  Both the Minister and Senator Hawkins have mentioned that, if the people rush to hospital, it is surely a proof that they need to go there, but I do not think that is so.  I have seen queues of women in a hospital not <Col N="652" /> 1,000 miles from where I am speaking, sitting in the out-patient department which they use as a kind of club.  They go there in the morning and have a chat.  It is nice and warm there, and they get a bottle, and I have seen them pour it down the drain.</P>
    <P>The general public will come to hospitals to get something for nothing. That is something we have to expect, and the more we advertise what we are giving for nothing, the more they will come.  I should hate to feel that anybody seriously ill was being deprived of proper treatment because of inability to pay for it, but in the situation we may set up when the Bill comes into force, it may be that he will be deprived of treatment because all kinds of people who do not really need treatment are there first, and it cannot be given to him.</P>
    <P>I notice, for instance, that, in Section 16, there is a new sub-section introduced by the Minister on the Report Stage of the Bill in the Dáil. It deals with maternity benefits and offers to women who are having babies in their own homes &ldquo;obstetrical requisites&rdquo; free of charge.  The Minister referred to this, and pointed out that it is designed to make women more amenable to having their babies at home.  That is an excellent suggestion which would do away with a lot of the problems that arise in maternity hospitals; but the Minister in his comments on this section in the Dáil concluded by saying: &ldquo;In this way, we hope to try to prevent the hospitals being overcrowded.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At column 1057 of the Official Dáil Debates of 30th July, 1952, the Minister stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;in that way we hope to try to prevent the hospitals being overcrowded.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that shows that the Minister at that time was alive to the fact that some degree of overcrowding in hospital accommodation would very likely follow in the wake of the introduction of this service.  I think there should be some attempt made to find out whether or not the hospital accommodation, both in-patient and out-patient, <Col N="653" /> which we have available will be able to cope with the work that is likely to come when this service is introduced.  The out-patient department should not be forgotten.  At the moment there is overcrowding.  Senior colleagues of mine work from 9.30 a.m. to 1.30 p.m. in the out-patient department dealing with the complaints of out-patients.  The people do not want to go to the dispensaries as they do not like doing so.</P>
    <P>We should also like to know something about the cost of the service. This matter was mentioned by a number of speakers during the course of the debate.  It is quite obvious that the cost is going to be very considerable. At the moment I do not think anybody appreciates the amount of work the average doctor does for nothing.  If he is a family doctor there will be many visits that will not be charged for.  I know that as a matter of experience and I do not think that times have changed very much in that regard during the last 40 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>I made it quite clear that I was expressing views which I felt were sincere and not because I was a member of the profession, or the Medical Association, or because I had any other allegiance whatsoever.  I am speaking now from my personal experience and anything I say must be judged from that point of view. If a family doctor is a member of a service like this, I think there is no reason why he should not charge the State.  He will get paid for his services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same applies to consultants. Every morning in this town a large number of consultants attend hospitals for several hours and see patients for nothing.  There has been a number of references to the vested interests of consultants.  I do not propose to deal with that at all or to comment on it. The doctors have worked for the people of Ireland and Dublin for centuries. What they have done is not enshrined in any document or historical record but in the minds of the people who will <Col N="654" /> judge whether the services they got have been generously or adequately given.</P>
    <P>Every morning in voluntary hospitals in Dublin senior members of the profession give hours to treating patients for nothing.  They will not do that in future when there is a health service under which they will be paid.  It is quite right that they should be paid. All that will increase the cost of such a service.  There will have to be somebody to keep records, arrange for the collection of the funds from which these costs are to be met, arrange for giving grants and paying the doctors, etc.  It has been said by a number of speakers that health is a priceless possession. That is quite true but under this scheme it is certainly going to be quite costly.  That however is just a consideration.  It is not the main consideration.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister and with Senator Hawkins when they say that we cannot afford an unhealthy community. Health may be costly but no matter how much the cost is, it should be met if we are able to pay for it. Can we meet the cost?  In considering that question we are within our rights in looking over the medical services we have and in looking at some of their effects and asking why these effects exist.  The question of effects in relation to the dispensaries has already been mentioned and I do not propose to go any further into it.  I have no knowledge of dispensaries.  I have not been in one for the past nine or ten years.  I know nothing about them first hand, but I do know that the dispensary doctors are frequently not pleased with the amount of accommodation they have and with the services they get and are able to render.  There are things I know of from my own first-hand knowledge.</P>
    <P>Take, for instance, the question of nutrition which I mentioned earlier. Dublin is still one of the few centres in these islands, Great Britain and Ireland, where you can regularly see a case of rickets.  A medically qualified friend of mine in England decided to take out a Diploma in Child Health. She attended the out-patient department of a large children's hospital in <Col N="655" /> London for two years without encountering one case of rickets.  In one month she would see a half-dozen cases of rickets in a Dublin hospital.  Up to very recently the position was worse. Rickets can quite easily be cured.  It can be prevented&mdash;and it is much better to prevent it than to cure it&mdash; by simple dietary methods.  It only needs the expenditure of a certain amount of money to provide them.  The expenditure of a little money and energy in popularising these measures would ensure that the mothers of the children will use them.  When we ask why that cannot be done we are told that the cost is too much.</P>
    <P>This Bill mentions dental treatment. There is a school of dental service and some centres have got a schools dental officer.  I know from first-hand knowledge that there is a very considerable amount of dental caries amongst school children in this country, all sections of the community and all parts of the country at the present time.  I have seen the records of dentists who had inspected the mouths of children showing large numbers of cavities and not a single one filled even in the permanent teeth. The expenditure of a little money would greatly improve children's teeth. The reason why it cannot be improved is the cost.</P>
    <P>The only other thing of which I have first-hand knowledge is the mental services. Perhaps it is wrong to say that I have first-hand knowledge, because since I was a student I do not think I have been inside a mental hospital. I have, however, attended boards where we have to discuss matters with prospective candidates for employment in these institutions.  I have had discussions with inspectors in these institutions and with senior officers from such institutions.  In such institutions the meagre medical staff has to look after the farm.  A candidate for a senior position in such an institution has to know how many tons of potatoes he can get out of an acre of ground.  I have seen candidates from England, most eminent in the treatment and investigation of mental diseases, looking absolutely shocked <Col N="656" /> when they were asked such a question. These men had spent their lives studying mental diseases, and they did not know how many tons of potatoes could be got out of an acre of ground or whether Arran Banners were better than Kerr's Pinks.  In Ireland you have to know such details.  You have to know how to look after the day-to-day domestic work of the institution as there is not enough money to employ farm stewards or house superintendents. These are things which should not come within the province of the medical superintendent at all.</P>
    <P>These are three matters which I think anybody will admit could be greatly improved by the expenditure of some money.  We are told that the reason why they are not improved is that the money is not there.  Will the money be there to meet the expenses of this new service?  That is the question which demands an answer.  I am not bringing up these points because I want to criticise the Department of Health.  I have met many of these officials and I have found them always extremely courteous and extremely anxious to do the best they could.  I am merely pointing out that there is a case for wondering whether we can, with the means available to us, meet the expenses of the services which are now proposed.</P>
    <P>If you criticise suggestions such as those before us now, you are expected to put up an alternative and, of course, the Irish Medical Association has considered this matter and has considered a scheme of State-aided insurance.  The Minister has given his views on that. I do not know whether the case he made against compulsory insurance of that kind is really convincing.  The State seems to be able to collect all kinds of dues from all kinds of people, including farmers and self-employed people.  When the local authority can collect rates and the State can collect income-tax and other taxes I do not see why premiums for such an insurance scheme could not be added to the items already being collected.</P>
    <P>In this regard I can point out that in England, since the national health service was introduced, there has been, <Col N="657" /> particularly during the last two years, a very considerable increase in the amount of voluntary private health insurance.  We are told that the people are so dissatisfied with the attention they get from the national health service that they have insured themselves and they use that insurance to deal with practitioners who are not in the service.  That is to say, they are paying twice; they are paying the ordinary rate for the national health scheme and they are paying such extra premiums as will give them the insurance cover which they feel they require.</P>
    <P>The Minister has, of course, said that the scheme put by the Irish Medical Association for voluntary insurance would be supported by him if the association should desire to proceed with it in addition to the proposal in this Bill.  I think he will find that if this service which is now proposed comes into being he will be asked, whether by the Medical Association or by some other body, to promote legislation or take such other steps that will make voluntary private insurance a reasonable proposition.</P>
    <P>The only other point that occurred to me was one arising out of what I said regarding the expenses of medical investigation and the actual attendance of the doctor.  It occurred to me when reading the discussions between the representatives of the Irish Medical Association and the people who are promoting this Bill, that a great deal of the dissatisfactions were personal, that is to say, the doctor had some sort of personal distrust of delivering himself into the hands of a service of any kind.  The Minister could quite easily get over that by taking such measures as would relieve the average member of the middle income group of the incidental expenses of his medical treatment.  The cost of X-ray, the cost of laboratory service, the cost of actually living in hospital, and all such expenses could quite easily and properly be met by a State service and let the patient concerned make his own arrangements, if necessary privately, with the doctor who is looking after him.  I can quite firmly say that in making such an arrangement the <Col N="658" /> patient would receive such generous treatment as he has always been used to receiving.</P>
    <P>I have said I do not want to go into details on this Bill&mdash;that is a matter for another stage&mdash;but there are two points I would like to raise.  The Bill proposes to make this service available to farmers provided their valuation is under £50; in certain cases where the local authority agrees that hardship may be caused, it will even make available the service to people who are over this valuation.  I do not want to say anything that would in any way harm farmers or put them at a disadvantage. I think a great number of people say, when times are good, that the farmers are doing very well and they should be made to pay increased taxes, and so on, but when times are poor and difficult there are very few people who will come to the aid of the farmer. And I know that if the farmer has a few lean years the effect on his buildings and machinery may be such that it will take a number of good years to repair.</P>
    <P>I think we should do our best to make the operation of this Bill as fair as possible.  When we were dealing with the national nutritional survey some seven or eight years ago we were trying to equate the incomes of certain sections of the population whose incomes we could find out with the living standards of certain sections of the population who would not confess to having any income at all, such as farmers, whose incomes we could not find out.  We had to go on the poor law valuation of the farmers' farms.  We discussed this with experts from the Office of Statistics and we came to the conclusion that a fair idea of the farmer's income, of the earning capacity of his farm, shall we say, would be got from the poor law valuation of his land excluding buildings.  This Bill lays it down that the farmers' valuation shall include buildings.  Everybody knows of farms in which there are buildings, perhaps built by a previous owner when he had a good year or a windfall from a relative in America, which are not being used but are nevertheless included in the valuation of the farm for taxation purposes. <Col N="659" /> I think it would be very much fairer if the farmers' valuation excluded buildings from the valuation for the purposes of this particular section.</P>
    <P>There is one other point with regard to the Bill I would like to mention, that is, with regard to the control of the services if and when they are inaugurated. The Bill lays it down that the services are to be produced and controlled by the health authority.  If we look at the 1947 Act we find that the health authority is the county council or the corporation of a county borough.  That would seem to give a very fair and broad basis for its control.  However, I am told that the County Management Act has provided that nearly all the responsibilities which the county council or the local authority are likely to have in this regard will be carried out by the county manager.  If that is not so, I hope the Minister or somebody on his behalf will state the position clearly, because I have had the most confusing accounts about that.  I have been told specifically by one particular county manager that, so far as he is concerned, that is correct, that in matters of administration he is independent. I would like an assurance on that point.</P>
    <P>Supposing we take it that it is a matter which may reasonably work out like that, then the point is that practising medical people in any county are being delivered by this Bill into the hands of one man.  I have nothing to say against county managers. I know very few of them, but from my experience of those I do know I have no reason to suspect that they would be unfair or would not do their best to operate this Bill properly. Nevertheless, I think the House will agree that there is something rather distasteful or wrong in delivering a whole section of professional people into the hands of one person no matter who that person may be.  Actually, in this particular section of the Bill&mdash; Section 48&mdash;it is laid down that there shall be a consultative committee and that it will advise the county manager. It does mention the county manager <Col N="660" /> specifically, though up to that section the Bill refers constantly to the health authority.  Here it refers to the county manager, and this section says: &ldquo;...a consultative health committee to advise the county manager on general matters....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It excludes matters concerning the employment of officers and the payment of grants and the details of the individual services.  In other words, it only gives this consultative health committee a very limited range of powers.  This committee is to have ten members, eight of whom are specified. There will be not less than four members of the county council, the county medical officer of health, the county surgeon or a senior medical officer of a health institution, and two persons representative of the medical practitioners in the country.  I would like to suggest that powers be given to the county council if it wishes to appoint not less than two.  The number of people I have mentioned adds up to eight.  The council is to be made up of ten but according to the scheme laid down in the Bill two of the ten and no more can be representatives of the practitioners.  I think it should be &ldquo;not less than two&rdquo;, that is to say, they must appoint two and may appoint two more if they feel like it. I would suggest that to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The efficiency of any health service undoubtedly depends on the doctors operating it, on their goodwill and on their harmonious co-operation with those who administer it.  The average person inclines to the view that the doctor is a difficult person, nearly as difficult to please as the farmer.  It is hard for the average person to judge the mentality of the doctor, who spends the whole of his time in an absolutely personal relationship with the people he is treating.  There is no stage of an ordinary medical man's work at which questions of a general interest are involved: it is a specific personal relationship between doctor and patient.  A doctor having spent 20 or 30 years in this way tends to feel at a disadvantage in dealing with general matters and a little suspicious of people who are good at organising and putting forward general points of view.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="661" /> If greater co-operation could be secured between the medical profession and the administrative side of a scheme such as this it could bring untold benefit to this country.  Senators should make allowance for the doctor's point of view, the fact that quite frequently he is not a businessman or a good organiser but one whose life has been spent in individual personal relationships and therefore he may find it difficult to deal with general questions. If one could make allowances for that and arrange to have him brought into a scheme such as this at the formative stage and not left to operate it like a mere technician when it is finished, that would be of great benefit.  Even at this late stage if this Bill were looked over again from that point of view I think there would be considerable interest in it even now from the members of the Irish Medical Association.</P>
    <P>Other members have referred to a statement by the Minister in the Dáil as to the position he found when he came back as Minister for Health in 1951&mdash;when he said that he found that the Irish Medical Association people were in the Custom House and he told them to get out.  I do not want to harp on that but would agree with Senator Hayes that those people were there by invitation of the Minister's immediate predecessor in office.  Unfortunately the Minister's words have been taken up by the Press and although he did say in the Dáil&mdash;and it is recorded in the account of the debates&mdash;that he told them to get out, politely, and thanked them for their services, the words used by the daily Press in any accounts I have seen are just &ldquo;Get out&rdquo;.  That rather conveys a wrong impression, suggesting that they were there because they wanted to usurp the authority of the Minister. I do not think any doctor wants to be there.  Doctors are not naturally good politicians.  One has only to think over the number of doctors in this House and in the Dáil to know they are not really interested in politics.</P>

      <P>If he is he is only one amongst 60 of us.  There are very few other walks of life with such a degree of public responsibility so poorly represented here.  I think I am right in saying that the average doctor is very little interested in political matters. If members of the Irish Medical Association were invited to act on a committee and accepted that invitation, that was so because they felt they should put their knowledge and experience at the disposal of whoever was trying to draft such a measure as this.</P>
      <P>On a previous occasion, discussing this or a similar measure it was stated that all the Irish Medical Association did was to be obstructive, to offer destructive criticism.  Now when they try to get together to work out a scheme it is suggested that they are trying to usurp the powers and responsibility of the Minister.  It is true that the Oireachtas has no power to delegate to any body of people the responsibility for making legislation but there is a responsibility here and in any Government Department to obtain the closest co-operation with members of the particular profession concerned in any legislation.  You cannot get that co-operation if you put them outside until the legislation is finished.  I have the greatest possible respect for the present Minister for Health and I was extremely sorry and extremely surprised when I heard him say these words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was also surprised at the opening of this debate this afternoon when I heard him mention the doctor patient relationship in the terms in which he did.  &ldquo;When I was a young boy my father told me that when he was a young boy they hanged a man for <Col N="663" /> stealing a sheep&rdquo;&mdash;that is something on the same level as the Minister's statement about his recollection of the time when he was a medical student and he saw a doctor in a ward in a hospital behave in such and such a way.  I see colleagues of mine every day in their dealings with patients&mdash; I happen to be in a position where it is my business to see this because I have to arrange for certain investigation to be carried out.</P>
    <P>When a doctor wishes a patient to have a certain investigation done immediately he can give me details of his family history and his family responsibilities. It is obviously a matter of personal interest that such a patient should receive urgent investigation and urgent treatment.  I see that every day not in one hospital or two, but in half a dozen, and the only reason why I mention half a dozen is because I happen to know about them.</P>
    <P>The doctor-patient relationship is not something that you can bargain about or something that should be treated lightly.  If I as a patient have to consult a doctor in order that he may understand the nature of my ailment he may have to question me on the most intimate personal details of my life, and I must have some confidence in him to co-operate.  That confidence can only be established as a result of a certain relationship which anybody who has been in practice will understand.  I have only done a few short-term locums, a matter of a few weeks at a time, and that a long time ago, but I know that when a doctor goes into a patient's house it is obvious that a special relationship exists between the patient and the doctor.  I hope that nothing in this Bill will interfere with that.  I accept the Minister's assurance that it probably will not, but I would not like to allow the statements made in this regard to go without some comment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. S. O'Donovan Mr. S. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been listening to this debate for a very short time only, and I am not going to pursue the line that has been taken by other Senators and the long discussion <Col N="664" /> that has taken place <i>ad nauseam</i> in the Dáil in connection with this Bill.  I am going to deal with a section which I think has escaped attention generally in the other House and so far has escaped discussion here, yet it is a matter of considerable importance to the community.</P>
      <P>Section 38 of this Bill amends the old Section 55 of the Principal Act of 1947. Now Section 55 of the Principal Act of 1947 was a small paragraph of about six or seven lines.  I have it before me now and it is a very small section. In this Section 38 you have that extended to the extent of practically two pages of this Bill.  I speak on this as having considerable experience of the implementation of these food hygiene regulations and the implementation of the 1947 Act as applied to food hygiene.</P>
      <P>I think it may perhaps be of advantage to the House and at any rate I am glad to be here to tell the Minister and the Senators what has actually happened up to the present and that the considerable extension incorporated in this Section 38 is to my mind undesirable.  If you turn to Section 38 you will see that regulations under Part V of the Principal Act may provide for all or any of the following matters&mdash;the licensing or registration of persons engaged in the manufacture, preparation, importation, storage, distribution or sale of food for human consumption.  That was operated under Section 55 of the Principal Act.  But sub-head 2 of this Bill refers to:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Premises, vehicles or stalls in or at which food is manufactured, prepared, stored, distributed or exposed for sale for human consumption.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now, that is an innovation, and it brings in the licensing or registration of vehicles and of stalls.  That was not under the old Section 55, and I bring that to the notice of the Minister, that probably his advisers have told him that vehicles and stalls should be brought in for the purpose of licensing and registration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is just impossible to think that you would apply registration to vehicles transporting food for human <Col N="665" /> consumption or that you would apply registration to stalls in any city or town selling food for human consumption. It may be a desirable thing, but it just would not work, because you are still dealing with the premises that have to be registered at present and there would be only a very small section of premises, shops selling food for human consumption, but if we are to register every motor van, every lorry, you might say every railway vehicle that is transporting food, that would just be impossible.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister may say: &ldquo;These are only powers, and the Minister will not do it&rdquo;.  He may do it, and the fact that it was introduced into this section and was not in the previous section indicates, I am sure, that he has been advised that that is necessary.  It further applies to the description of premises, vehicles or stalls so licensed or registered, so you would have to give the index number and the index letters of your vehicle, the type of van it is, the capacity of the van, and so forth.</P>
    <P>Sub-head C is new also.  It provides for:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The prohibition of the manufacture, preparation, importation, storage, distribution, exposure for sale or sale of food otherwise than by licensed or registered persons or in or at licensed or registered premises, vehicles or stalls (as the case may be).&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to bring to the attention of the House, as a person who has experience, the difficulties of registration in connection with the premises that require registration already under the Food Hygiene Regulations of 1950.  The Food Hygiene Regulations are formulated from the old Act of 1947, and through the country the premises requiring registration are fish and poultry premises, butchers, including pork butchers, hotels and restaurants, and manufacturing premises and premises conducting wholesale food business. They are required to register and be passed by the local authorities, and the amount of work, the amount of paper used on investigations for that small <Col N="666" /> section of the community, is tremendous. You will clutter up municipal offices and county council offices by those registration forms&mdash;by the application for registration in the first instance, by the reports on the investigation and then by providing provisional registration for a period of six months from the date on which the provisional registration is made, and subsequently an unprovisional registration. It involves a tremendous amount of work, of filling in of papers, and it will, if extended, involve more officials and more professional men, perhaps.  More veterinary surgeons will have to be employed, and doctors and health inspectors.</P>
    <P>I have a duty here to point out that at present the Food Hygiene Regulations of 1950 apply to every food business in the country and that application is universal, but the registration of these premises is confined to the premises I have mentioned&mdash;the fish and poultry shops, butcher shops, hotels and restaurants, and manufacturing and wholesale premises.  Now, the regulations as published since 1950 cover every food premises and if these sections could be applied and made effective to every food premises we would have a very modern system of shops for selling food products.  In that Section 25 dealing with food premises there are 24 sub-headings and these include the provision of hot water for the cleansing of utensils, and cold water with a wash basin for the use of attendants and food workers, and a terrific amount of details dealing with premises generally.</P>
    <P>I will not read them out but they are very fine conditions if they could be applied to every premises in the country.  You must remember that the food regulations apply from one end of the country to the other and that they apply to premises in which sweets, confectionery, and so forth are sold.  They apply to the little bakery and to any premises in which a food substance is sold.  The conditions are very fine if they could be applied to them all.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made in respect of food stalls and food vehicles.  These conditions are not as stringent as those <Col N="667" /> applied to food premises and business premises but they are pretty stringent and, again, if they could be applied to the food stalls and the food vehicles that are in operation at the moment it would be a tremendous improvement. Very little has been done in that line up to the present.  To my mind, the making of provision now for the registration of food vehicles and food stalls is going too far and will create difficulties which a local authority simply cannot overcome.  Therefore, I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this matter and, if we cannot amend it on the Committee Stage on my recommendation that the thing is going too far, I hope that, if the Bill goes through as it is, these provisions will not be implemented except for some specific purpose at, for instance, a time when there would be danger of an epidemic breaking out or something like that. The fact of the matter is that the provision is incorporated in the Bill now and I think it is far too wide in its scope.  It would just clutter up the offices of local authorities with forms if you tried to apply any further extension of these registrations.</P>
    <P>The curious thing is that the regulations apply for the registration of individuals as well as of premises. Nothing has been done so far to register an individual working in the premises as a food worker.  The only registration would be that of the owner who occupies the premises and that would be necessary, but there is no registration or checking of the individual workers in food premises although that is just as important as trying to register every one of the food stalls that would be, say, in Moore Street and in the poorer sections of the city.</P>
    <P>Do not take me as meaning that these places must not be much improved and supervised, but I challenge any member or anybody who thinks that it would be possible to register unlicensed street stallholders in Dublin City and keep any check of them for a month, not to talk of six months or six years.  I think it would be an impossible task.  For these reasons, I think that that section is <Col N="668" /> going too far&mdash;and I make that statement as one who has had experience of the difficulties of registering these premises that I have already detailed and that already have to be compulsorily registered under the food hygiene regulations that operate at the moment.</P>
    <P>The remainder of Section 38 deals with important points that probably have cropped up in the interval&mdash;the keeping of the register and of its introduction as proof in court.  Subsection (3) of Section 38 deals with the powers of district justices to make orders for the destruction or disposal of diseased or contaminated food. That is in operation at the present and, therefore, I do not know why sub-section (3) has to be tabulated into four paragraphs such as (a), (b), (c) and (d).</P>

      <P>I am quite satisfied to do that.  The only point is that in all the discussion and hullabaloo that took place about this Bill throughout the country, in the Dáil and so far in this House, nobody has referred to these things.  Therefore, I take this opportunity, as a member of the Seanad, to draw the attention of the Minister to these matters.  I agree with your ruling, a Chathaoirleach, that we can mention them in more detail on the Committee Stage. If necessary, I can put down an amendment to alter this section.</P>
      <P>I said at the outset that I did not intend to discuss the clauses of this Bill because they have been discussed and re-discussed through the length and breadth of this country, in the Dáil and so far in this House but, at this stage, I want to give my personal opinion that I am surprised that there has been such a spate of oratory about this Bill.  It does not seem to do a whole lot that is not being done at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 14 deals with general medical services for the lower paid section of the community.  All these services that are indicated are available at <Col N="669" /> present.  The institutional and specialist services provided under Section 15 apply only to people with an income of less than £600 a year.  That is not a very big income nowadays.  As a matter of fact, it is only a tradesman's income at present.</P>
    <P>I wish to stress that this Health Bill is not anything like what it has been described by Senator Jessop.  It is not comparable to the English health services.  It is just a small step forward. It contains, really, only two points&mdash;(1), the institutional and specialist services to be provided for people with an income of less than £600 a year and (2), the maternity services.  They are the only two additions to the existing position.  In my view, the tremendous discussion and opposition and rehashing which took place on this Bill should not have occurred at all.</P>

      <P>No one will deny the desire of the Minister and the wish of all of us to improve our health services and we must all admit that that is an objective we should all attempt to reach.  It must be admitted on all sides that it is desirable to improve not only our health services but our homes, our farms, our businesses and the way of life of our people.  In taking the action the Minister is taking, I wonder is he starting at the right end of things.  I have said that it is a very desirable thing to improve our homes and I wonder what that has to do with the improving of the standards of health of our people.  In my opinion, it has a great deal indeed to do with it.  We attempt in this measure, the instrument which the Minister is creating, to provide institutional treatment for a considerable number of our citizens. <Col N="671" /> Suppose the Minister attempted an educational campaign in regard to the keeping of our homes and the management of those homes, the better training of the people who keep these homes, by how much would we cut down the expenses of our health services as they are to-day?  I submit we could cut them down a very great deal indeed.</P>
      <P>This is a problem of education, and to be building up new institutions, new ways of treating sicknesses which need never be there if the people were trained and educated and treated before they got ill, is nothing but folly.  What I dislike about this measure is that, in the first instance, there is, so far as I know, no desire on the part of the people to have it implemented at all.  It certainly is not the judgment of the people of the country and I should be glad to hear from the Minister what his experience has been in relation to those with whom he has been in consultation about the bones of this measure before it was put into the form of a Bill.  The matter was discussed at my county council and I was present as a member of a delegation from a number of county councils to the Minister in his office in the Custom House.  I think I can say with truth that I did not hear from one representative of any local authority who went to interview the Minister on that occasion that he regarded this instrument as desirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking as a member of my own local authority, I can say that, when this matter was raised and discussed at a meeting of our county council, where the majority are supporters of the Minister, there was just one member who indicated that he was prepared to stand up in defence of it. There was nobody else, and the local authority was not prepared to give approval to the Minister's proposals when they came up before it for discussion.</P>
      <P>As I see this Bill, it is a Bill under which the Minister is taking authority by regulation to determine practically everything about our health services&mdash; what they are to be and how they are to be run.  It is true that the regulations he will make will be laid on the Table of the House and that we can move to have them annulled, but what hope is there, what are the possibilities of annulling any regulation the Minister makes and lays on the Table of the House?  We know that just will not happen.  Look through the Bill where you will, what have the people who are to be treated to say?  How is their view to be got and at what point is it possible to get from them what is their desire?  Nowhere in the Bill will you find that the people who have to pay for these services&mdash;I speak of the people who pay their rates to the local authorities&mdash;have anything whatever to say with regard to these services.  That I think is a contradiction of everything which we believe to be democratic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a vital issue.  In my judgment it is far more important for the Minister for Health in whatever measure he implements first to build up the character of our people.  I believe that the building up of the character of a man or woman is as essential to his good health as any quackery in connection with a chemist's bottle or any other treatment he will get.  As the House heard from <Col N="673" /> Senator Jessop, when many people, even under present conditions, get what they are told is medicine they spill it out when they go out of the clinic.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the lines along which we are proceeding in this measure and the concept of a number of people here with regard to our health services are such that you cannot develop that spirit of independence, self-reliance and preparedness to make sacrifices so that the head of the house will make provision for his family either in sickness or in health in the manner that all of us, as heads of our homes, are expected to do.</P>
    <P>The wider you cast your net and the more provision you make to enable people to get something out of the State who did not get it before, the greater will be the ambition of others to join the crowd.  What have we got in the end?  If you have got 1,000,000 or 1,500,000 out of a population of 3,000,000 getting so much out of the State, whether they are ill or well, that they can lean on the State in nearly all circumstances, what do you expect them to provide or produce?</P>
    <P>I think that approach to our health services is fundamental to our whole future existence.  In a section in the Bill provision is made for certain classes who are new classes to receive institutional treatment.  These are people with an income of £600 per annum and farmers with a valuation of £50.  As far as the farming community is concerned&mdash;Senator Jessop referred to this&mdash;there is still pride left in them.  A farmer of £50 valuation in my county would be prepared to pay an institution when he went there to have treatment either for himself or the members of his family if he were able to pay.  Furthermore, I do not think they want to be classified as paupers.  I do not believe that a farmer with a £50 valuation in any county to-day is a pauper.  He is able to make a contribution if illness comes to his home.  And to what home has illness not come including my own and others?  When that comes to these people I believe it will be their ardent desire to make a contribution towards <Col N="674" /> the recovery of any member of their family by paying for the medical treatment what they are able to pay.</P>
    <P>A farmer of £50 valuation can get these services while a man with £50 10s. cannot.  We all know that there can be no comparison between the income of one man and the other. They might be as far apart as the man with £50 valuation and the man with £100 valuation.  Everyone from the country knows what I am saying is true.</P>
    <P>Take two people with incomes of £600 per annum.  One man has, perhaps, a wife who keeps his home and who does in the home what a good wife and mother ought to do.  She helps to dress her children and is an example to them.  The husband of the woman who is in receipt of £600 is better off than the man who has £800 or £900 per annum whose wife may not be anything like as competent in the home or who, perhaps, prefers to go to the pictures or some other place or smoke 20 or 40 cigarettes in the day.  Perhaps the other woman will not smoke at all.  She believes in training her children and giving good example to them.</P>
    <P>Yet, regardless of what standards of life they may enjoy, everybody with an income of £600 is to have this institutional treatment.  The Minister may say that I am making the case that the improvident should get what the provident head of the house is denied. Instead of providing services like these which everybody can have, regardless of the attitude of mind, industry, spirit or readiness to provide for himself, what we ought to do is that which they are doing in Britain, have an insurance policy and let everybody put his contribution into the pool from which the State or these institutions could draw to defray the cost of medical services when a member of a family requires them.</P>

      <P>I have made some inquiries about the matter, too.  The Minister has already told us that the position with us is rather different from what it is in England.  He said that 50 per cent. of our people are self-employed and that the other 50 per cent. work for others.  In Britain, 20 per cent. are self-employed and 80 per cent. are employed by others.  Accordingly, that makes it easier to collect the contributions.  I do not know that that is a good reason for not facing up to the harder, better and more spirited way.  I think it is a cardinal error of judgment on our part to think that the State can afford what we are attempting to do now.  The Minister told us, I think, that this scheme is going to cost in the initial stages £1,000,000 on the ratepayers and £1,000,000 on the taxpayers.  That is only a start.</P>
      <P>In Limerick recently it was said that it was going to amount to 3/- in the £. That is for a start.  Does anybody suggest, when you give institutional treatment to a man of £50 valuation to-day, having regard to present standards in agriculture, that you are going to be able to keep it from the man of £50, £51, £52, £53 or £55 valuation?  Is it not conceivable that a man with £50 valuation to-day has a higher income from his farm than that which the man with a valuation of £75 may have in 18 months' time?  The Minister can look back to the time when the farmer with a valuation of £200 had not the income that the man with £50 has to-day.</P>
      <P>Where are we going?  Somebody has got in the thin edge of the wedge and we will all have cause to regret the road on which we have decided to travel.  Nobody is very concerned about the interruptions made by Senator Hartnett.  I am not, for one. I have given my point of view about this.  We know what his is.  He may be&mdash;and I should not be surprised&mdash; more Machiavellian than some of the people who sit around him would credit him with being.</P>

      <P>I have indicated that I believe it is morally and socially unsound to produce a service for people which they are able to provide for themselves.  There are many here including myself who are the head of a house.  If we are tempted by the State to look to the State for a service which we should be able to provide for ourselves, we will be much more improvident than we are.  I will do things that I have not been accustomed to doing.  I will go to race meetings or to a gambling house.  I do not do these things.  I very rarely go to the pictures.  In fact, I am more of a puritan than many of my colleagues who sit on my right.  I see this kind of thing all round me, that if you give a service to people without asking them to make any contribution towards <Col N="677" /> the cost of that service, in the first place I do not think they value it or value it very highly.  They would put a higher value on it if there was some of their money in it.</P>

      <P>If we give a service to people who can pay for the service themselves, it is wrong to make other people pay for that service for them. It is morally unjustifiable, and it may very well be that you are giving a service to people with a certain level of income at the expense of people who may appear to have more means but in reality have not.  The net result is that you are making the poor pay for people who are actually better off.  All this is bad for the person who gets the service and also for the person who pays when they are probably paying for people with more means than they have themselves.</P>
      <P>How can we expect people to struggle, to labour and to build up resources if the outcome of all that is that it will be shared out in this way as a result of the demand on these people consequent on the Minister's legislation?  The Minister spoke earlier about some of the arguments that were being made as to the way in which hospitals would be filled and as to the way in which the people would crowd into the hospitals when this legislation would be passed.  I believe that if the Minister or some of his colleagues would do something about the people who are travelling the roads in motor-cars at a pace far beyond their competence to control the machine they are in, you would add immensely to the space in all our hospitals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated that it was argued repeatedly that when this legislation was passed there would be a rush on our hospitals.  As I suggested already there are numbers of people going into all our hospitals throughout the year every year who need never be there.  I am convinced that one of the first things that should be attempted is an educational plan in regard to the keeping of our homes in <Col N="679" /> this country, in thousands and thousands of homes where there is a necessity for education.  This is being done in other countries by different means and if it were done here the Minister would have a different problem with regard to hospitals.  We have reached the stage when you would need a separate hospital for all the people injured in motor-cars every day here.  There is not a day when eight or ten people are not brought into hospitals.</P>
      <P>There is an aspect of this question which the Minister must take account before this measure passes at all. There are hospitals attempting to give services which are not anything like adequate to the needs of the areas. What does the Minister do?  I can speak with knowledge as a member of a local authority.  There is a hospital in my county town.  Our public representatives were far-seeing and independent-spirited 30 years ago, just after the State was set up, and they spent thousands of pounds on reconstruction and on the building of a new wing to our county hospital.  We did that, although we are a poor people in a poor county and though many of our wealthy neighbours did not bother about hospitals at all.  If we had done nothing, perhaps we would have had a large contribution to-day from the Hospitals' Trust for the erection of a new hospital.  Because our own people, out of their meagre resources, built up what they have, we now find we have no space adequate to our means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a county council meeting some months ago, we decided to ask the Minister to receive a deputation to hear our point of view and see if something could be done.  We had a letter from the Minister, a courteous letter, in reply, and the Minister wound up by saying that he regretted that in the circumstances he could not contemplate extending the current building schemes by the inclusion therein of a new county hospital.  He indicated, too, that he did not think there was any point in the council sending a deputation to discuss the matter with him, but if we insisted he would receive us. At present, if an accident or an urgent case comes into that hospital there is <Col N="680" /> not a bed vacant or a chance of one. The conditions are just awful.  At the present moment there may be a waiting list of 130 or 140.  This matter was raised at the last meeting of the county council, when someone said there were 70 people on the waiting list two days previously; but someone who had come out of the hospital that morning said there were 120 waiting.  Meanwhile, the Minister is talking about all this.</P>
    <P>I am sure that position is not peculiar to our county but obtains up and down the country.  What is the use in making a pretence of improving health services and providing institutional treatment when we have not the institutions?  I want the Minister to tell me about that, as I cannot see any sense in this, nor does anyone in my county.  It is no better in many of the neighbouring counties.  Senator O'Reilly knows that many people come from his end of County Leitrim for treatment in Cavan Hospital and there is not enough room for them.  Therefore, what is it but humbug, fraud and hypocrisy to be talking about improved health services?  In Cavan we find that we are put at the end of a waiting list that is going to be looked over in seven years.  That is as much as we can get from the Minister.</P>
    <P>In the administration of these new services, anyone who can make any contribution to hospital treatment for themselves should be expected to make it; and that ought to be taken account of in accordance with their means. This idea of a free-for-all scheme, giving service to people who can pay, cannot be justified.  It will sap and undermine the character of our people.  That is inevitable.  While we may go out to-day in a robust manner and proclaim the value of this scheme, I think some of the people here will live to see the error we have committed.  That is the first objection to the scheme.</P>
    <P>I also dislike a plan for health services where the Minister practically administers the whole of them by regulations which are to be made by him or by his civil servants.  The regulations are to be transmitted to the local health authority&mdash;and who is that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">

      <P>After being disapproved of by the Oireachtas.  What are those opposite going to do if the Minister brings in a regulation and puts it on the Table?  They are going to vote for it, whatever they think about it.  Some of those over there know what I am saying is true.  Some of them have experience of local administration and know what the consequences of this Bill will be.  The regulations and decisions will be passed to the local health authority. Who is that but the county manager? Senator Hearne shakes his head, but he is not without experience, any more than myself, of the administration of local affairs.  I do not know how intimate his experience is now, but I assure him that I rarely miss a meeting of my own county council.</P>
      <P>Section 48 of the Bill says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The council of a county (other than Dublin, Cork or Waterford) shall by resolution appoint a consultative health committee to advise the county manager on general matters (other than conditions of employment of officers and servants, the amount or payment of grants or allowances or the making of any service available to an individual) relating to the exercise of the functions of the council in relation to the operation of the Principal Act or this Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There are crossword puzzles which would be more easily solved than that, but the net result is that there is to be a health authority, that can be consulted, to advise the county manager. Has anyone had any experience of trying to advise county managers? I have.  They listen and listen.  Someone behind me suggests that they never learn.  Are they going to carry out recommendations?  They may, in some places.</P>

      <P>As a member of a local authority, I know that the position in the local authority to-day is&mdash;I know we are to have an amendment of this &mdash;that you have executive officers, the county engineer, the county medical officer of health and the county surgeon; but you never saw the medical officer at a meeting of the county council or had any discussion with him on health services.  Generally, as far as the administration of the public health services in the county is concerned, I do not know if other members have had experience, but I am speaking of my own experience, and I am just an ordinary member of a council.  I suggest that members of the council of Cavan are just as intelligent as members of the councils in Leitrim, Longford, Monaghan or any of the neighbouring counties.  We can just ask a question, and it is an awkward question, but I am only telling you what has happened and what is the situation to-day.  Here we are now going to be taxed, as far as we can learn, to the tune of an extra £1,000,000 for the implementation of a new service, and what part have the local representatives to play in the operation of that service?  I do not know, and I am against that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I rate my intelligence and the intelligence of my colleagues on the county council as high as the intelligence of any county manager we have got to-day, and some of them have much longer experience.  There are men in my county council, I should imagine, for 35 years, anyway.  Senator Fitzsimons, my neighbour and a native of the county, knows some of these people very well and I would not put their judgment, their experience or their wisdom and common sense below any county manager in any county in the country to-day, and some of them do not belong to my political Party. Those people are not going to have anything to say to the new health service other than to advise the county manager on certain matters; and he is going to have everything to say about the conditions of employment of officers and servants, and mind you, the person who has that authority is <Col N="683" /> the man who has most to say about how they behave and how they are going to act.  He will decide on the giving of services and the payment of grants and allowances and the making of any service available to any individual. We will not have anything to say to that at all.  I cannot understand how any member of a local authority would be prepared to accept the indignity of a situation like that and assent to it in this measure.  I think it is fundamentally unsound.</P>

That is my opinion honestly and sincerely, and it does not matter what Minister is there, that does not make any difference, because so long as you have one person in that all-powerful position where he can disregard what anybody says I am convinced that you cannot get a good service for the people of the country which they ought to get. We are getting a terribly expensive service, but it is not more efficient, and that is the position to-day.  A communication came before our county council following a sworn inquiry down there and in that document it was laid down by the Minister for Local Government that the manager was supreme to the county medical officer of health and the county engineer and that they were obliged to take his direction.  It did not separate that, that he was supreme only on non-technical matters. As far as I could judge, hearing it read, it would apply if my wife was to be ordered into hospital for some sort of operation.  I could not ask the county medical officer of health as to what ought to be done.  That was the reading of it, and similarly in regard to the county engineer even on a technical problem the manager could direct him.  That is the way that local affairs are being administered to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="684" /> As far as I am concerned, I dislike this measure.  I think that much better could have been done.

The Minister has spoken about the attitude of the Irish Medical Association and he has spoken about other interests.  I do not know what the other interests were.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I think about it on the moral plane.  As far as we are concerned with the practical implementation and the operation of the measure I have given reasons why, <Col N="685" /> as a member of a local authority and as a ratepayer, I dislike being put into the position, as a local councillor, of being responsible for imposing on the ratepayers of my county thousands and thousands of pounds for the implementation of these services while I find myself, as their elected representative, not able to have anything to say in regard to the administration of that service. I dislike that.  I think it is a reflection on every member of every local authority in the country.  It is very bad for the country if we are going to have a spirit of independence in the backwoods of the land.  That independent spirit cannot stand up very long while we are breaking up the backbone of character in our people and creating a situation where they are just passive, not resisting any longer. The more you go on with that the more you destroy the foundation of this State.  I think that it is immoral and highly unsound and anti-national, and I do not see anything whatever to commend it.</P>
      <P>There is another major consideration. I do not think that the country can pay for these services.  What are you going to do?  What, I ask the Minister, is the position you are going to put me into if I have a valuation of £50 10s.? I will have to pay for my own health service and to pay for my neighbour in my rates.  I do not think that that is right, and in fact I do not think that anybody could stand over that and justify it.</P>

      <P>I put that to the House. I do not think any of us can stand over that.  It may be that our resistance is so low that we are ready to swallow anything.  I believe myself that we <Col N="686" /> could have got something much better than this measure.  We should have tried to get it.  Even now we should try to get it.  I do not know what you could do with regard to this measure. The Minister may make regulations with regard to everything in connection with our health service, and it does not satisfy me that they are to be laid on the Table of the House for annulment.  That is not good enough at all.</P>
      <P>I followed with great interest the very careful analysis of the Bill by Senator Jessop.  I do not think anybody could quarrel with any comment which he made in that analysis.  Some supporters of the Bill, of the measure of the ideal or of the concept may regard some of the criticism as unfair. We have heard what some members of the Irish Medical Association have had to say in regard to this Bill.  There were days when, if it could be charged against them, it would be said that they were unpatriotic or when somebody would say that they were of the old ascendency, that they were out for distortion of facts, or something like that.  However, not one of these charges can be made against them.  I should like to make it clear that I have had no contact with them and that none of them have spoken to me on this matter.</P>
      <P>The medical profession of this country are as fine a body of professional people as is to be found in any country in the world.  They are not rich men &mdash;nothing of the kind.  A very limited proportion of them may be wealthy but that cannot be said of the vast majority of them.  Many of us know dispensary doctors up and down the country.  We know them for what they are and for what they have been in the past 35 years.  Many of them have made a notable contribution to the establishment of this State&mdash;quite a number of them in my own county.  I cannot understand why anybody should allege that when these people speak they are not concerned for the health of all our citizens.  I am convinced that they have spoken out of their ripe judgment and experience.  I believe it would be much better for all of us if they had been listened to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="687" /> I must say that I agree with the other Senator who said that the comment by the Minister in regard to what he did when he went to the Custom House was rather unlike him.  We in this House have had experience of the Minister over a number of years.  We may have differed vigorously and violently but nevertheless that comment was unlike him.  Suppose, for example, that he went back into the Department of Agriculture after Deputy Dillon went out of office and that he found the beet growers or the grain growers or some group of farmers in the offices of the Department consulting and debating about some plan or scheme in regard to agriculture. I wonder if the Minister would say that he ejected them.  I do not think he would and I do not think he would do it either.  I must confess that I did not understand him when he made that remark.  I regret that that is the atmosphere in and the attitude towards this matter.  I think it is bad for the future of our health services. I believe that that atmosphere has given us a document which is entirely different from what we would have got if the spirit had been different and until we get a new and a better spirit we will not get a Health Bill containing the kind of services that the country requires.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hartnett</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to congratulate the Minister on having introduced this Bill and bringing it as far as it has been brought despite the steadfast opposition with which the measure has been faced.  In the course of his generally reasonable contribution, Senator Jessop stated&mdash;I am putting a gloss on what he said, of course &mdash;in trying to explain away the uneasiness and the touchiness of the medical profession, that the doctors are bad politicians.  I do not think the doctors are bad politicians at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1945, the Fianna Fáil Government made the first attempt at improving our health services.  The medical profession defeated them.  You all remember the Health Bill of 1947 and the opposition which it met.  When the present Minister's predecessor proceeded to implement a section of the <Col N="688" /> 1947 Health Act with regard to mothers and children you all saw how successful he was in his attempt to do so. How, then, can it be said that doctors are bad politicians?  Not at all; they are very good, indeed.  What other body in the country, what other section in the country, would have been able to hold up legislation in the way in which the medical profession has succeeded in doing so?</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Minister must sometimes feel that he is in wonderland. For six weeks, he listened in the Dáil to a lot of filibustering claptrap from the leaders of the Fine Gael Party.  In their opposition to the Bill in the Dáil, the Fine Gael Party was alone.  The Labour Party and the two members of the Clann na Poblachta Party supported the Bill, together with a majority of the Independents.</P>
    <P>The Minister must have read, as I did, a letter which appeared in the <i>Irish Times</i> of Monday, August 3rd, 1953, signed by J.F. Falvey, Hon. Secretary, The Irish Medical Association, 10 Fitzwilliam Place, Dublin. The letter itself is dated 31st July, 1953.  The last paragraph of that letter reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No amount of vituperation or misrepresentation of the medical profession on the part of the Minister will help in the present dispute.  The Minister is well aware, and the public should know, that the Irish Medical Association's objections to the Health Bill are based on the principles of Catholic social philosophy, which are unshakable and unbreakable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That, no doubt, was written with the authority of the body of which Dr. Falvey is the honorary secretary.</P>
    <P>The Minister came into the House to-day for the Second Reading of this Bill.  He heard a very pleasant after-dinner speech by Senator Barniville, who lightly criticised the Bill in a jocular way without ever touching on a specific point and stating that, at a later stage, he would have some criticisms to make.  He said very little about the Bill in principle.  I should have thought that if Dr. Falvey were correct, Senator Barniville would <Col N="689" /> have told us specifically the unbreakable and unshakable principles which the Minister's Bill contravenes.  I was disappointed.  Of course, I did not feel that Senators Fearon and Jessop would speak with the same authority on that subject as I expected Senator Barniville to speak but, nevertheless, they are distinguished members of the Irish Medical Association.  Both of them made what I can truthfully describe as reasonable criticisms, for the most part.  One could not help feeling that, at times, they felt themselves under an obligation to voice the views of the Irish Medical Association but that there was very little conviction behind the voice.</P>
    <P>Senator Fearon told us about the doctor-patient relationship.  He gave us the very interesting viewpoint that, because of the complexity of modern medical techniques, so much of the work has to be done in the laboratory that the old relationship between the doctor and patient could no longer exist.</P>
    <P>Senator Jessop dealt very carefully and very specifically with many aspects of the Bill.  In the course of his remarks, he said that this Bill is a reasonably satisfactory one.  He put it side by side with the British health service.  I think that is a useful thing to do.  I am sure that the Minister and his Department will profit from the experience of the medical profession in Britain in running the health scheme there.  I want to make this clear beyond nay or yea, that when Senator Baxter states that the British health scheme is an insurance scheme, he is talking through his hat.</P>

If Senator Baxter spent some of the time he spends here in regaling the House in reading Hansard in the Library, he would discover that when the British public health service was being introduced, it was made crystal clear that it was a free- non-contributory scheme.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelHartnett" hpid="Mr. Hartnett Mr. Hartnett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hartnett</NameTxt>
      <P>I, in turn, claim the protection of the Chair.  The British health service, as I think I have stated, is unquestionably a free service. I have no doubt that, as Senator Jessop has said, there are abuses of that service, but he told us that the doctors are not dissatisfied with it, although they miss the opportunity of giving the same kind of personal treatment as they formerly gave.  I think I may link that up with what Senator Fearon said.  Would I, as a layman, be correct in suggesting that nowadays the business of the general practitioner is to segregate the serious diseases from the trivial and that, if he suspects that a man is suffering from a serious disease, he sends him forward for diagnosis to a general specialist and that the patient then goes forward further to the specialist dealing with that particular kind of disease, if it has been so diagnosed? It is understandable that general practitioners <Col N="692" /> may feel a little baulked in not having an opportunity to try their own skill to the same extent as they did before medicine became as complex as it is to-day.</P>
      <P>He also told us&mdash;I trust I am not misquoting him&mdash;that the people, generally speaking, were satisfied with the British health service, but there is one thing which may be taken as a guide as to whether the people are or are not satisfied&mdash;the enthusiasm of all the British politicians for the British health service.  During the last election, the struggle which occurred between the British Labour Party and the British Tory Party in claiming the authorship of the particular health scheme was positively unseemly.  Nobody could have been more enthusiastic about the British health scheme than the British Prime Minister, Sir Winston Churchill. It is unlike politicians, as Senator Baxter well knows, to claim the credit for a measure which is unpopular with the people.  I do not think that will be gainsaid.</P>
      <P>Then again Senator Jessop referred to a case within his own experience of an English person over here who succeeded in getting treatment which would have been considerably deferred if he had been in Britain.  I am sure that is one case, but may I, as a lay member of this House, say that I know of my own experience of at least 15 cases of persons who have gone across to Britain to receive treatment, free treatment&mdash;immoral though it may be &mdash;under the British health service?  I am sure the Senator can recall a number of doctors who went across to have their own ailments treated in Great Britain&mdash;for what reason I have not got the faintest idea, but Senator Jessop may have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Jessop also told us that his experience of the family doctor was that he did not press for money.  I am not suggesting for a moment that the doctor should not press for money.  The general practitioner works very hard &mdash;probably harder than any other section of the community and it is only proper that he should be paid, and adequately paid, and, if possible, promptly paid, for his services.  The <Col N="693" /> point is: can people in the middle income group continue to pay him? Are they able to do it, or will they hesitate about calling him in and say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If it is going to cost me 10/6 or a guinea, I will take a chance.  The child may be all right in the morning&rdquo;? Then, of course, it may not.  It would be a more convincing tribute to what happens in the out-patients' department of our hospitals if the tribute were given by somebody from the Dublin slums rather than by a distinguished medical professor.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that any of us in this House would receive excellent treatment.  That is the very way of human nature, but very often where you have two-tiered medicine, treating patients who pay and patients who cannot pay, there will inevitably be a distinction between the treatment meted out to those who pay and that meted out to those who cannot pay. As I say, I have no doubt that we in the hospitals, as Senators, would be exceedingly well treated, but I would wish&mdash;if I may repeat myself&mdash;to have that tribute paid by Biddy Mulligan or by some very poor fellow from the slums of Dublin.  It well may be that it could be paid&mdash;I am not saying it could not&mdash;but it would carry more conviction with me coming from that quarter.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see Senator Jessop is the only person in the House who made anything like a reasonable speech.  From Senator Hayes you had the usual vapid platitudinising which comes out of his mouth like ribbon out of a tape machine but Senator Jessop dealt with the matter otherwise.  He says you will have people demanding attention because it is free.  He says that happens in Britain.  If it happens in Britain who is at fault but the doctor? He told us the story of the woman in hospital whom the doctor pronounced to be fully recovered and who says: &ldquo;No, doctor, I am not.  I am going to stay on for another week.&rdquo; Surely, if the doctor is a man he will go down to the office and say &ldquo;Mrs. So-and-so is leaving to-day.  I have decided that we have done everything for her that we can do&rdquo;.  It is unfair to paint the doctors as if they were <Col N="694" /> imbeciles.  They are quite capable of handling a situation of that kind.</P>
    <P>I think a lot of these things are variations of the Irish Medical Association arguments.  I have here a document issued by the Irish Medical Association.  It is entitled: &ldquo;The White Paper on Health Services.&rdquo;  It has a sub-title: &ldquo;State Medicine is Bad Medicine.&rdquo;  These are the arguments of the Irish Medical Association, which none of their members put in this House to-day.  Apart altogether from the overriding, unshakeable and unbreakable principles of philosophy, there are these quotations: &ldquo;What does the White Paper offer?  Treatment only in public wards of hospitals.&rdquo; What an affrighting thought for people like Senator Baxter.  What is wrong with treatment in public wards of hospitals, and if there is anything wrong whose responsibility is it?  If there is anything degrading or anything which it not up to standard with regard to treatment in public wards of hospitals the responsibility rests on the medical profession and nobody else.</P>
    <P>The next extract is: &ldquo;Birth of your children in public maternity wards.&rdquo; Think of the number of people whose children are being born in public maternity wards.  Is there anything wrong with it and, if so, why was the protest not made long ago?  Ought they not have clamoured with the Customs House to put an end to this iniquitous situation in which the poor are obliged to have their children in public maternity wards?  I go on: &ldquo;Private treatment?  Yes!  If you pay for it yourself.&rdquo;  That seems reasonable. If you want private treatment it does not seem unreasonable to be required to pay for it.  &ldquo;Your health and sickness recorded by the local authority in its files.&rdquo;  That is another extract and it is the kind of thing that gets a person's back up.  As the Minister pointed out in his opening speech there has not been much protest about the people who received their medical treatment hitherto under the dispensary system.  I never heard any protest against what the poor had to suffer under the dispensary system.  Furthermore, records are kept in all hospitals and if there are nosey parkers who are curious about other people's ailments <Col N="695" /> they can stick their noses in the files in any hospital.  There are even charts over the beds.  &ldquo;Your doctor ordered around by lay officials.&rdquo;  This is where the hypocrisy and, if I may say so, the humbug of the Irish Medical Association comes in.</P>
    <P>Senator Jessop made a very interesting point to-day.  He told us that he had experience of serving on local appointments commission committees for the purpose of selecting applicants for posts in the mental hospital service.  He told us that questions were put to them as to what they knew about the farm and that some applicants from England were horrified that a medical man should be required to have any responsibility for the hospital farm.  It is quite wrong and unconscionable that a medical man should be required to be an administrator.  The doctor is there to exercise his professional skill.  He may be a first-class doctor, a brilliant surgeon or a superb psychiatrist and at the same time a very rotten administrator.  There is no reason why the two things should go together.  They cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>I think it has always been the policy of the Department of Health that work of that kind should be done by lay officials and that the doctor should stick to his medicine.  That has been resisted by the Irish Medical Association on the grounds that they were being pushed around by the officials and that they were not going to be pushed around any more.  Certainly it is an interesting example of having it both ways.  I continue to quote, Sir: &ldquo;The red ticket goes&mdash;and the &lsquo;coloured card&rsquo; comes in its place&rdquo;. Of all the hypocrisy and humbug in the world that takes the biscuit.  Did they protest against the red ticket or the poor law system under which the poor got their medical treatment? Never until 1945.  They write it down here as if they always had been the champions of the rights of the poor.</P>
    <P>I want Senators to take in the next quotation very carefully.  I think it is really good.  It is: &ldquo;And, inevitably&mdash; wire-pulling and political influence in access to &lsquo;benefits&rsquo;.&rdquo;  It just suggests <Col N="696" /> wire-pulling and political influence &ldquo;in access to &lsquo;benefits&rsquo;&rdquo;.  I do not know what that means.  I have not got the White Paper.  I cannot refer to the paragraph which they must have had in mind in some strange sort of way for the purpose of distorting it, but people in glass-houses should be very careful not to throw stones.  It would be interesting if one were to inquire as to how the appointments in certain hospitals and medical services not made by the Local Appointments Commission are made and who makes them, and whether there is any wirepulling or any influence.  Of course, there is influence exercised in these matters.  There was at least one speech made here to-day which I could have forecast to the last syllable practically, because it conforms with the analysis of the Health Bill which was issued by the Knights of St. Columbanus to its members.</P>

      <P>The marginal notes to this Bill are interesting, showing the deep interest that is being taken. First we have criticisms of Bills.  Then it says:&mdash;</P>

            <entry rowsep="1">Is the Bill, then, unobjectionable from the stand-point of Christian social principles?  To answer this we must consider some of these principles for a moment.&rdquo;</entry>
          </row>
        </tbody>
      </tgroup>
    </table>
    <P>It then goes on to deal with the fact that the end of man is supernatural, that such an end implies the perfection and happiness of man.  Then it tells us: &ldquo;Man cannot by his nature attain perfection in isolation,&rdquo; and then&mdash;I am skipping because it is very wordy:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The State exists for the sake of the persons who comprise it.  Its end is the common good.  Its function is to furnish the environment that men need to secure their needs on earth and to develop their faculties and personality to the full.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not want to bore the House, it has been bored enough already this evening, but it quotes other countries:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Other Christian countries have solved the health problem without such a service.  In France and Belgium, medical welfare is provided through the State-assisted co-operation of employer and employee.  In Ireland we have many outstanding examples of such co-operation without State encouragement.  About 50 per cent. of Irish firms have some type of medical welfare for their workers.  Many provide benefits also for the workers' dependents, as well as pension and social schemes.  Far from being encouraged by the State, these are being discouraged&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senators will note that&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;first by the State compulsory social welfare insurance&mdash;and now by the present scheme, which these firms and their employees will have to pay for in increased rates and taxes, although they do not need its services.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then there is a boost for Portugal and Spain.  It says that their health services are operated by the vocational groups.  It does not give any further details.  &ldquo;Holland's by voluntary organisations, one Catholic, one Protestant and the third non-sectarian.&rdquo; We have not got the non-sectarian group in this country.  The document continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Impoverished Italy is organising insurance schemes to which employers and workers contribute. When these are fully organised it is proposed to hand their administration over to vocational groups.... Even socialist England&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and then the old error appears&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;retains the principle of insurance. In order to find a precedent for a State medical service on the lines now proposed we have to pass beyond the Iron Curtain.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is that not really contemptible&mdash;not a single medical objection, not a single reasonable social objection but claptrap for the purpose of misguiding some of the innocent members of that organisation, if such there be, and that to have emanated from the Parliamentary Draftsman's Office.</P>

      <P>Beginning with Senator Hayes, Senators right down the line have emphasised the cost involved.  The medical men with a great deal more reason have emphasised the cost of the scheme.  Of course, the scheme may prove costly, but if anybody in this House had a child who was ill unto death and he had £200, £300, £800 or £1,000 in the bank, would he not spend it to save that child's life?  Can the State do less for the children of the nation, whom we promised&mdash;or those who died for us in 1916 promised&mdash;to cherish equally?  I do not see why the cost should be brought in, particularly by some of the Senators opposite.  When the White Paper was published last year, I came in here and&mdash;a trifle irrelevantly, I confess&mdash;in the discussion on the Appropriation Bill I congratulated the Minister for Finance on having made the money available for the services outlined in that White Paper.  I remember Senator P.F. O'Reilly standing up and saying: &ldquo;Yes, I have the White Paper here and these are certainly excellent proposals, but the fact is that the Minister will never put them into operation&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelHartnett" hpid="Mr. Hartnett Mr. Hartnett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hartnett</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator has finished, may I continue?  People want an improvement in the health services. In the Dáil, the Fine Gael Party said: &ldquo;We do not worry about the cost, we do not care how much it costs.&rdquo;  This was on the Committee Stage, after they had heard talk about a certain letter.  They did not care how many millions it cost, the health of the nation was worth it, but they said this was a thoroughly bad scheme in its conception and they were going to oppose it root and branch, section by section, word by word.  Now they stand up and talk about the cost.  Senator Baxter drearily goes on and on&mdash;the cost, it will cost the people of Cavan so much.  Even if somebody does profit under the scheme, someone who has been improvident and who has spent his or her money improvidently, should <Col N="704" /> their children suffer because of that? Are the sins of the fathers to be visited on the children?  Is that the social outlook of persons like Senator Baxter?  I trust not.</P>
      <P>With regard to the nurses, Senator Hayes, who was always a good politician, held forth on the treatment which was being accorded to the nurses.  He said there was nothing in the Bill for the nurses.  He must know that the nurses in local authority hospitals have better conditions in every way than those in other hospitals.  No one will deny that.  I join with Senator Hayes in paying tribute to the nursing profession.  I would like to see them get better and better conditions and I am sure the Minister will try to ensure that.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that Senator Barniville, in what I have already described as his pleasing, after-lunch discourse, should have attacked the permanent officials.  I was glad to see that was rectified by Senator Jessop, who paid the highest possible tribute to their courtesy and efficiency.  Of the two viewpoints, I prefer to accept that of Senator Jessop.</P>
      <P>With regard to dispensaries, the physical condition of the dispensaries in many cases is undoubtedly very bad; but that is the responsibility of the local authorities.  It is the business of the local authorities to see that they are improved and to bring pressure to get whatever grants they can to see that they are improved, instead of trying to make capital out of their bad condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Jessop dealt with what the Minister said in the Dáil regarding his treatment of the doctors to whom the Custom House had been handed over by the then Taoiseach and Minister for Health, Deputy John A. Costello. Senator Jessop fairly stated that though the newspapers reported the Minister as saying merely: &ldquo;Get out&rdquo;, the records show that the Minister had said: &ldquo;I did not say that to them impolitely and I thanked them for their services; I told them it was my job to produce the scheme and not theirs.&rdquo; The Irish Medical Association, in the letter a paragraph of which I have <Col N="705" /> already quoted, again selects one sentence of the Minister, &ldquo;Get out&rdquo;, and leaves all the rest out&mdash;though they must have known what was on the record, as Senator Jessop knew.  I think they must have decided to make a selection with regard to that matter.</P>
    <P>Surely any democrat in this House must support the attitude of the Minister. Remember what was said at that time, remember what was said in the Dáil, by the then Taoiseach and Minister for Health, that he said to the Irish Medical Association: &ldquo;Go and produce your own scheme and come back to me in a stated period of time with it.&rdquo;  What would happen if every section in the country could get treatment of that kind?  What would happen if the industrialists, whom I hear talking here about the heavy incidence of income-tax on their business, could be put in by the Minister for Finance to the office of the Revenue Commissioners and told: &ldquo;Settle it up for yourselves, boys.&rdquo; Suppose the farm labourers were brought in to the appropriate Government Department and told: &ldquo;Now, fix up what you want in the way of working conditions and pay, I will put it before the Dáil and have it approved.&rdquo;  Would you not say that <Col N="706" /> the Minister who acted in that way was, at the least, a very bad democrat? There is no reason why one section of the community should be preferred to another in matters of that kind.  It was preposterous, it was outrageous, that that should happen when a controversy was going on between the Government and people outside.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>At 3 p.m., the Minister for Finance will be available for the Comptroller and Auditor-General (Amendment) Bill.  After that, it is the one Minister who will be taking both the Health Bill and Workmen's Compensation (Amendment) Bill, so the better plan would be to finish the Health Bill first and then take the Workmen's Compensation (Amendment) Bill.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Thursday, 6th August, 1953.</P>
