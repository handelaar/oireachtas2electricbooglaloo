      <P>I should like to add that there was a Joint Committee working on this Bill in 1950.  The dissolution then took place and the present Committee was set up.  It is the desire of that Committee to express their appreciation of the valuable work that was done by the Joint Committee in 1950.  Their work greatly simplified the task of the present Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of a second Central Fund Bill this year is due to the fact that Dáil Éireann has not disposed within the usual time of all the Estimates for the Supply Services for the current financial year.  The Central Fund Bill, enacted last March, authorised the issue of approximately £34,000,000 for the current financial year to enable the public services to be carried on until about the end of this month, by which time, in ordinary circumstances and according to precedent, all the Estimates for the year would have been passed and the Appropriation Bill enacted.</P>
      <P>As Senators are aware, Dáil Éireann has now granted a second Vote on Account, amounting to £30,241,300, to enable the Supply Services to be continued for a further period of four months, by which time the Estimates still remaining to be discussed should be passed and the Appropriation Bill enacted.</P>
      <P>Senators will have seen from the White Paper how the Vote on Account is made up.  It covers the various Estimates which have not already been reported and agreed to by Dáil Éireann.  The only Estimates in relation to which this does not apply are the Estimates for Increases in Remuneration and the Health group.  For these Estimates, as they have been reported and agreed, it only remains to secure statutory authority for the issue from the Central Fund of the amount left over from the first Vote on Account and the first Central Fund Act.</P>
      <P>The purposes of the present Bill, which is in the usual form, are, therefore, to authorise the issue out of the Central Fund, firstly, of the amount granted by Dáil Éireann in the second Vote on Account and, secondly, of the balances of the Estimates for Increases in Remuneration and the Health group.  Section 1 of the Bill authorises the issue of money from the Central Fund to cover these items.  Section 2 provides for the borrowing by the Minister for Finance of a similar amount and for the issue by him for the purpose of such securities as he thinks fit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that we have this Bill before us to-day in a somewhat abbreviated form is not the responsibility of this House.  Whether we agree or disagree with the policy of the Minister and his colleagues, we all appreciate that the services of the State must be maintained and that the Minister must find money to do the work which those services have been established to perform.</P>
      <P>The Minister has had a pretty gruelling time in the other House for many months past.  At times, when we hear what we say of each other&mdash;here or in the Dáil&mdash;we must wonder if any of us ever had any love of country at all. Indeed, when we separate ourselves from our fellows in the Oireachtas, we are forced occasionally to cast our minds back and ask: &ldquo;Was it true, were there men with patriotic spirit who were ready to dare all so that we might get possession of our country, to manage it in the way we will and build it up?&rdquo;  When we are alone, I suppose we are able to answer and say: &ldquo;Yes, it was true.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Over the years, a good deal has been accomplished.  Perhaps we are at times rather inclined to minimise our own achievements.  In a debate like this, it is the responsibility of Senators to look on the situation as they see it and speak what is in their minds about the present policy of the Government and to point to ways by which the aims of our youth may be carried, if not absolutely to completion, at least further on the road.  On previous occasions I have dissented from the policy of the Minister and his colleagues.  I do not think the Minister himself can say that. he has succeeded as he would wish to succeed.  I am not prepared to say that his Government and his colleagues have not done good work, but I must say in truth, as I believe, that the Government policy, and the policy of the present Minister especially, has not brought to the country those higher living standards and that justification of our hopes that would bring a comfort to all of us which we would like to enjoy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that it is not the Minister's fault that he was born amidst surroundings <Col N="436" /> not rural, not agricultural. I always feel, when I look at him and when I hear what he proposes to do, that it has been the country's misfortune that we have had for so many years in charge of the finances of the State and directing our financial policy somebody who has not understood better what is fundamental in Irish life.  I have often attempted here, I am afraid with a very small degree of success, to educate the Minister.  Others have attempted that, too.  One of the Minister's greatest faults is that, perhaps like other Ministers, he thinks he knows everything and is not prepared to listen to the somewhat obscure voices of some Senators or even some Deputies.  I do not think that success for the country lies along that path, and I would beg the Minister, even at this late stage, to open his mind and eyes and look out on the Ireland of to-day to try to discover where the flaws and faults are in the policy he has been pursuing.  He should take counsel as to how that policy may be bettered, and even though he has to borrow part of the new policy from people who are opposite to him in another political Party let him not be ashamed to do it.</P>
    <P>We need not repeat here what has been said already about unemployment. There is very considerable unemployment and there is going to be unemployment, I have no doubt, for some time to come.  I do not think the schemes adumbrated by the Taoiseach recently will resolve that problem in the immediate future.  Its causes are so deep-rooted and we are so prepared to close our eyes to those real causes that we cannot find a solution in the way that a solution must be found.  There is a low level of output in Ireland everywhere, in every field, in every factory and workshop and on the great majority of the farms.  There is a low output per unit of labour employed.  Our living standards are not at all as high as we could enjoy if our people were prepared to work as hard as they are physically able to work and as hard as the people in any of the countries to the east of us must work.</P>
    <P>I do not think that is sufficiently <Col N="437" /> emphasised at all.  We are not as courageous as we ought to be about speaking out and telling our countrymen that life will not be made better unless the people are prepared to work hard.  There is a very considerable number of people not working to-day who have a definite reluctance to work at all.  That whole situation must be studied, not from the political angle or political consequences, but from the social, economic and moral consequences.</P>
    <P>I think we erred years ago in the turning we took&mdash;it is going to be difficult to get back&mdash;but I suggest that this is a problem which is going to confront both this Government and all succeeding Governments.  It will remain until more moral courage is displayed on the part of the Government and of public men in saying what they think about the attitude we in Ireland take to work and to labour. That goes for the men on the farms as well as for those in the factories and for quite a number of people who to-day are declaiming because, they say, they cannot get work.  I am quite satisfied ministerial policy has made it much more difficult to find employment than it ought to be, but I am also satisfied that the reluctance of many people who are styled labour to give a higher output is freezing money that would be spent on employing labour simply because people do not feel they are getting value for the money.  Everyone in this House who believes that ought to say it, and responsible people who are in contact with these men should point to the necessity for a higher output if we are to enjoy in this country the higher living standards which everybody seems to desire.</P>
    <P>No Minister for Finance in this country can truly be a success unless he has a full appreciation of what is at the base of Irish life.  As I said on many occasions here before, the land of Ireland is the life of Ireland.  That does not mean that I think industry means nothing to Ireland.  You must have a balance in your life.  The human being or the animal cannot have life without a balance in food and we must have variety of occupation in our <Col N="438" /> lives if life is to be better.  However, it is very important for us and for those who are engaged in industry and who have been charged with the responsibility of developing industry in the past to realise that industrial life to-day is so highly developed and mechanised that the output of a few factories can provide the needs and requirements of our small population and that we cannot hope to compete with other people and capture export markets unless we are ready to do in industrial employment what apparently we are not prepared to do in any employment at present.</P>
    <P>I do not see why the development of industry is not possible here as it is in continental countries and in Britain. Unless the Irish race are an inferior people in intelligence, in capacity to manage and readiness to serve, I do not see why we cannot go out and compete with foreigners.  At best the numbers we can employ to provide our own needs in industry are very limited. If we were ready to go out to capture foreign markets there is a wide field, but in the absence of such a planned economy we must fall back on the natural wealth of the land, the soil of Ireland.  That natural wealth has not been developed and is not being developed as it should be.  I find fault with the Minister for Finance for neglecting the possibilities of that development in Irish agriculture which are there and of which I and others have spoken on many occasions in the past.  The facts and figures are there showing the importance of agriculture in our exports and all that goes with it.  No further argument is needed from anybody and it is the responsibility of the Minister for Finance to do his utmost to ensure that such development will take place as will enable us to increase considerably our exports generally if that can be done.</P>
    <P>As far as I see things the Minister and his colleagues are doing very little towards what requires to be done if that improvement is to be achieved.  We ought to try to argue in this connection not from the point of view of political emphasis or of the benefit to one Party or another that can accrue from the arguments that <Col N="439" /> are advanced, but from the facts as they are and the necessity for a proper appraisal of these facts so that our plans for the future will be better and wiser than those we have at the moment.</P>
    <P>On a previous occasion here I dealt with a number of figures to point to what I thought the future held.  I suggest now to the Minister that the output of Irish land is nothing approaching its potential.  What is the Minister for Finance doing or what are his colleagues doing to reach that stage when the potential output will have been accomplished?  I do not see anything satisfactory being attempted by the Minister for Agriculture or by his colleagues to achieve that end.  Some recent figures show that our total farm output is coming up to the 1938 level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is above it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only slightly above above it.  I think it is much more in value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The volume of production is up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>But the total output is very little over the 1938 level.  There is no other agricultural country in Europe of which I have any knowledge and of which I have seen reports with as low an output proportionate to the 1938 level as ours.  The Minister has a considerable degree of responsibility for that situation.  I am perturbed about this because I am inclined to think that the sunniest days in agricultural prices are passing. They might pass rather quickly and our farm income and our total national income may fall rather steeply with detrimental results to our total economy.  Perhaps I may err in my judgment, but it is a point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What this country requires, I suggest to the Minister, is something like a five-year plan, a plan that you are not going to chop and change because you change one Minister for another or one Government for another.  That is one of the difficulties.  I know Ministers <Col N="440" /> talk very loudly about the defects in the policy of their opposite numbers, but when it comes to the implementation of a policy we do not find much of a change.  To-day I see nothing being done by the Minister for Agriculture that was not being done in the main by his predecessors and, in fact, he is falling down on some of the most valuable work.</P>
    <P>It has been said that this year we are coming into the finest harvest we have had for years.  God knows, for we do not.  Some of the harvest to-day does not look too encouraging at all and it will be a very considerable hardship for many of us to reap it.  It may be true that there is a larger area under tillage.  The June figures for tillage, of course, cannot be available, but I gave figures on the last occasion here&mdash;they are on record&mdash;indicating that it is incorrect for us to believe that a tillage crop is going to yield more food than another type of crop.  It is very important for us to appreciate that fact. The figures are there and I am not going to go over them again.  It is possible that we will have a greater area of tillage crops, and if the harvest brightens and we can harvest them satisfactorily we may have a greater quantity of grain than we had last year, and that is all to the good.  That is as it ought to be.</P>
    <P>I see no justification whatever for the people of this country having to import food from abroad which we can produce at home&mdash;none whatever; and I think that as far as possible our farmers ought to be able to produce from our own fields what our own people require&mdash;everything that we can produce. I would express this view, however, that it might be a mistake for the Government to be too optimistic that they have achieved so much success because the production of wheat is up and a considerably greater area is under wheat this year.  They may be too optimistic because the reasons for that are not just the real reasons at all.</P>
    <P>In my judgment we have probably a larger area under wheat on many of our bigger farms, but I believe that the real reason is that the price of cattle this spring was so high that <Col N="441" /> many of the shrewd farmers were convinced that it would be unprofitable to purchase them at present, because at the end of the year there would be a very small margin left over as profit and they believed it would be much more profitable to go in for the production of wheat.</P>
    <P>We will not have to wait very long until we see what the margins are which farmers will have for cattle kept over the year and we will be able to judge whether it was not more profitable for those people to go in and grow wheat as many of them did.  If that be the fact, it points to something else&mdash;that we have not yet convinced our people that it is good policy for the country to try and get out of those tilled fields the grain crops we need.  We should all stand pat on that and propagate the idea, but it is foolish for Ministers or their supporters, and it does not matter who they are, to take the line that only by the production of tillage crops can we profitably farm the land of Ireland. That is not true, and let us get it into our heads.</P>
    <P>A tillage crop, a crop of wheat for the farmer, may yield a very good income. It may very well be that for the nation it might be more profitable for that man to use his land for producing a crop of good grass and the product which was fed on the grass might be exchanged for wheat that could be grown much less expensively in another country.  Now I am not advocating that, but I am pointing to the possibilities of that being true, and it might very well be that we will have to face up to that situation before many years have passed.  If the prices of wheat and grain fall outside it will not be too easy to maintain the present price for wheat that has been fixed for the coming season.</P>
    <P>What I want to urge at this stage is that there is a terrible necessity for a planned agricultural scheme that will extend over a number of years.  Might I point to something?  We had here on the last occasion a good deal of discussion about live stock and I think that Senator Hawkins will recollect, perhaps, I do not say exactly that he <Col N="442" /> contradicted some figures of mine, but I think he indicated, anyhow, that the numbers which I gave with regard to certain types of live stock since the change of Government were not accurate. The Minister, I think, will recall that I produced statistics, but he did not seem to have much faith in them. He has faith in statistics only if he produces them himself; but they were not my statistics, they were statistics coming out from the Government office and showing that we had in this country in January of 1951, according to the estimate of that time, 1,182,000 odd cows. In the following January of 1952, we had 1,143,000.  That was less than in January, 1951, and in January, 1953, we had 1,128,000.</P>
    <P>Now, I have given those figures because I want the House to have an appreciation of their significance.  They are terribly significant and they are rather perturbing.  There is no need for me to say to anybody here that you will not have calves, heifers or bullocks if we have not the cows, and we will not have them for export.  Those are the figures.  Where are we going to get them, unless some of us think that the new science is capable of enabling every cow to produce two calves in the one year, and we have not reached that stage yet.</P>
    <P>We know what the consequences of this will be in another field as well&mdash; butter.  Butter is an object which to-day is really expensive for consumers in this country&mdash;really expensive, there is no use denying it.  We had a question in the House answered yesterday, and I am raising this because it is a considerable factor in our economy. The value of our own butter produced in the year in the country from the creameries is around about £14,000,000. That is about the value of it.  Is not that a staggering figure?  Now actually we may say that at last year's prices it was about £14,500,000.  Still, we imported last year £2,000,000 worth of New Zealand butter.  Yesterday in the House the Minister for Agriculture was asked a question about the importation of butter for the coming year by Deputy Madden; it seemed possible at present, the Minister said, that home production, together with existing <Col N="443" /> stocks of imported butter, would be sufficient to meet requirements in the present season.</P>
    <P>Then he went on to say that production of creamery butter from January 1st to July 15th of this year was approximately 300 cwts., or less than 0.1 per cent. greater than in the corresponding period of last year. From the beginning of the present production season, May 1st, to July 15th, production was approximately 5,700 cwts., or 2.5 per cent. above the figure of the corresponding period last year. Now, 5,700 cwts. are about a week's consumption in the country.  Having made that statement, the Minister for Agriculture added that supplies of New Zealand butter had not been purchased but the New Zealand authorities were informed that this country might possibly require some later in the season.</P>
    <P>The value of the creamery butter on hand according to a reply given on a previous occasion was somewhere about £350,000.  That is, the value of the New Zealand butter in stock was somewhere about £350,000&mdash;£360,000 was the figure given.  That is the reply that was given on the 24th July, and we bought £2,000,000 worth last year.  We have £360,000 worth on hand.  One would not have to get out a pencil and paper to convince any member of this House that the figure of production for this year actually with fewer cows will apparently be less than we had last year and that it is quite obvious that if butter consumption is to be maintained at the level at which we consumed last year and apparently are consuming, we will probably have to import another £1,500,000 worth of New Zealand butter this year again.  Now it is important for us to appreciate the significance of that.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us something about this.</P>
    <P>I do not mind saying that if I were in the House when that question was answered, I would have probed a little further as to what the Minister for Agriculture was doing because if you were to buy New Zealand butter you have to contract for it nine months at <Col N="444" /> least before you get it, and it seems to me in the situation as I see it that unless butter consumption is going to fall considerably, we are going to buy another £1,500,000 worth of New Zealand butter this year.</P>
    <P>We have increased the price of milk to the creameries but the number of cows has fallen.  That is a serious position for the present Government to find themselves in.  I should like to hear from the Minister how we propose to extract ourselves from that difficult situation because our cow population is fundamental to the whole agricultural industry, to our total productivity, to the value of our exports, and so forth. I know many people in the dairying industry to-day who are perturbed about the future.  Apart altogether from the problem of labour in the dairying areas&mdash;and it is well-nigh an insoluble problem&mdash;there are other considerations.</P>
    <P>There have been conferences with the representatives of the dairying industry and representatives of the Government and this is what is perturbing about the present situation.  The results of some of these conferences appear to indicate that Government policy with regard to dairying is to hand it back to, or to throw it back upon the producers and to let them manage the industry in whatever way they can.  There has been control of this industry now for a great many years.  The Government cannot suddenly, at a critical time like the present, fling back the management of that industry to the producers, to their creamery committees and to the other interests concerned, without a build-up&mdash;a build-up that will take some years before it can become really effective.</P>
    <P>In my opinion dairying, not only in this country but throughout the world, will meet with intense competition in the future from the producer of margarine. We have the situation in this country in the industrial field that if the native producer finds a foreign competitor whom he cannot meet and beat he can get a quota or a tariff to protect him.  As far as the discussions with the Ministers and the dairying representatives are concerned, I understand that there was no indication <Col N="445" /> whatever that, if the dairying industry was to be handed back to the primary producers, there would be any protection of any kind whatever against foreign competition.  It is important that the Government should hesitate and carefully consider the consequences before they take a step like that.  Our cows are valuable to us from other points of view besides producing milk, cheese, the raw material for chocolate crumb factories, and so forth.  The Minister for Finance may not be interested, but somebody will suffer for his sins of omission to-day and in the past if the dairying industry is left to find a base on which it can stand after having been battered about under control for so many years and if, unorganised and unprepared, it has to meet competition from abroad of a character which it has not had experience of for a long period.</P>
    <P>The whole problem of dairying is at the foundation of our agricultural economy to an extent for which it has never been given credit.  This baby cannot be passed over from the Government now, after having been kept too close to its breast for ten or 15 years, without serious injury to the country's economy.  I believe that the whole problem of the dairying industry requires to be approached from the point of view of a complete reorganisation. The whole position with regard to the Dairy Disposals Board, the ownership of the creameries by a semi-Government authority, how these can be passed over to producer control and how you will co-ordinate and harmonise the various activities of our creameries, some of which are engaged in manufacturing butter, cheese, chocolate crumb, and so forth in a way that will be beneficial to the nation and at the same time to the dairying industry in general is something that cannot be solved in a week or in a month.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to urge his colleagues in the Government to hesitate, unless they find the producers well-equipped and unless they will be supported and backed by the Government in the same manner as other industries are&mdash;industries which are not as essential to the life of the community as the dairying industry is.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="446" /> I believe there should be a five-year-plan. I believe a programme should be mapped out.  I believe that there should be a speedy examination into the whole question of a stable price. What that should be, I am not going to say now.  Obviously, you have to take account of costs, yields and many other factors which, to-day, we are unable to discover.  We are not doing anything, from the point of view of agricultural economics, in regard to costings although that is something that is being done in every other country in the world.</P>

      <P>It is very easy for a Senator on the opposite side of the House&mdash;especially somebody who is completely uninformed as regards agriculture in this country&mdash;to talk about the costings commission.  Put down a question in the other House as to what is being done and you will discover how far the costings commission have got.  Who has been invited to make a contribution to that commission? In my county, the only invitation issued to a dairy farmer in regard to output or cost was issued to somebody in the Glandevlin area of County Cavan.  I know that the Minister passed through Glandevlin and he knows where it is.  To think that you will get a picture of dairying in Cavan in that way is so nonsensical that it fits in with an interruption like that which we have had from Senator Yeats.</P>

      <P>The Senator is very good at figures.  I have given a set of figures in this House.  I have pointed to the continuous decline in the number of dairying cows in the country since the present Government came into office. I do not know the cause for the reduction in the cow population.  Perhaps the Senator does.  After a bit, he will tell the House, in his eloquence, the reason for that decline in the cow population and I shall sit, silent and gracious, and listen to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come back now to something which I have tried to emphasise to the Minister on previous occasions.  We have no real agricultural education in this country consistent with our needs. The Minister made a speech recently and told us about the increase in the number of agricultural instructors. Apparently, in our present state, we want something revolutionary, but the present number of instructors will go no distance in the planned education which this country requires, if we <Col N="448" /> are to maintain standards in a more difficult world.  We need not get into a discussion on the possible consequences of an armistice in Korea, of unemployment and depressed prices, but all that is inherent in a situation such as we are facing.  You cannot increase agricultural production in a month or a year.</P>
    <P>I see from the recent figures of output and trade returns that the value at the port of fertilisers used by our farmers in 1952 amounted to £3,449,000. That included all types of fertilisers&mdash; nitrate of soda, rock phosphate, nitrate chalk, sulphate of ammonia, basic slag, superphosphate and so on.  I wish the Minister would realise that there is no hope for an increase of output in agriculture, unless the expenditure on fertilisers for our land can be multiplied tenfold.  I had the experience of putting on £3 or £4 worth of artificials per acre and I see value for it. I see a return.  If you multiply 10,000,000 or 11,000,000 acres by £4 per acre, you get £40,000,000 worth of fertilisers which the land requires at present. That goes for the land of Meath, South Tipperary and Limerick, as well as for the hills in Cavan and in the West.  That is essential and it is only by doing this that the country's output can be increased.  There are many other things that have to be done as well, but it is only by doing that that output will be raised and, I believe, costs reduced.</P>
    <P>That is a capital expenditure which agriculture at present will not face. One of the reasons why more is not being done in this field is the fact that our farmers lack knowledge and I see nothing being done by the Government to spread enlightenment among them.  Senator Yeats will ask me what I would do.  I would send teachers amongst them&mdash;dozens and dozens of them&mdash;and I would prefer to send these teachers amongst them than to fill the fields with inspectors.  It is not going to be simple or easy.  Farmers are very hesitant and very doubtful about getting a return for this expenditure. They have to be convinced and it will take a good deal to bring conviction to them; but we cannot get anywhere unless it is done, and it is so imperative <Col N="449" /> that it must be tackled immediately.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that farm prices may be going to show a rather steep and swift fall.  Nobody can look at the situation on the American Continent, with tremendous quantities of grain piling up, with a big harvest in South America and with the boasting we have about our own harvest&mdash;without grave misgivings for the future value of agricultural prices on the world market.  We are going to feel the consequences of this; we are going to feel the draught; and it may not be the farmers who will feel it first. Our total national economy may be very seriously affected, if the value of agricultural exports falls.  Unless the raw materials of industry fall for similar reasons, it may be a problem to keep our industrial arm going at all.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture who preceded the present occupant planned a scheme by which every farmer could borrow on the security of his land and repay, through his purchase annuities, the value of the manures distributed on his land after a soil test had been made.  I wish the Minister for Finance would make provision so that that scheme could be propagated from one end of the country to the other with the utmost vigour.  You are not going to succeed right away, because it is going to take years to convince a number of our farmers of the value of doing this.  You are not going to have to incur a very considerable liability in the first year or two&mdash;it is going to be a slow process and a slow development&mdash;but it is imperative and nothing is being done about it.  So far as I can learn from inquiries, the attitude at the moment is rather to discourage farmers availing of that scheme than to encourage them to take advantage of the facilities which they enjoyed under it in the days of the previous Government.</P>
    <P>In relation to the expenditure of money by the State and in relation to this House taking a decision to vote sums for various Departments, there is a duty incumbent on each of us to speak our minds as to how better this money could be spent, so that the <Col N="450" /> ultimate result for the country will be good.  I believe we are not getting from the State to-day the benefits from the expenditure of the money which the State gets into its hands which we should get, if there was more wisdom, more knowledge and perhaps a little more courage behind it.  I am urging that, unless there is a change of mind and a change of plan, we are going to be confronted with a situation in our economic life that will be worrying for succeeding Ministers for Finance.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that, whatever the Minister for Finance may think, this country requires to have done for its agriculture much that has not yet been done.  I am satisfied, too, that a plan of capital development for agriculture is so urgent that if the Minister were prepared to come out with a scheme and back it with enthusiasm, the country's reaction to it would be very gratifying.  Various Departments are doing things in a sort of departmental fashion, so far as agriculture is concerned, which to some of us is very disheartening.</P>
    <P>We have a scheme like the land project in respect of which any money that has been spent is going to bring a great reward, but it is very incomplete in the way it is being operated. These people come to me with machines purchased by the State&mdash; machines which, we are now told, are to be sold; I do not know what is going to happen about them&mdash;to drain my farm and to do all the other things they can do.  Under the scheme, I can have fertilisers, but, when they have been applied, there is no follow up, so far as these people are concerned.  If I invite some of the young agricultural scientists who are working on that land project to advise me about the grasses I might sow in a particular field before the artificial manures are applied, they will tell me that it is not their job, that I must go to somebody else.</P>
    <P>I believe that all over the country land has been reclaimed and reformed under this plan.  I believe there is a necessity to follow up.  The scheme would be much more complete if the men who are trained agricultural scientists were given the responsibility <Col N="451" /> of advising the farmer, when they are on the farmer's land, not only on land reforms at the moment but on land reforms in the future.</P>
    <P>I know we must agree to give the Minister this Vote on Account.  I feel, however, that the monotony in our economic life from one year to another in relation to every scheme that comes before us is very depressing to those of us who believe that much more could be made of our opportunities than we are making. Again, I say that the Minister for Finance has played more than a man's part to prevent that development in the country.  His financial policy has in the main been responsible for that.  I do not see any change of heart or mind as far as the Minister is concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not say that he does not love his country as much as he loved it when he went out some years ago, but somehow his vision is blurred.  I do not know what is the reason.  Are we all getting so old that we are losing heart and have no faith in the future?  Why is there not more evidence of that pioneer spirit which young men must have in every land that is a new land?  This is an old land but in ways it is very new. There is a great necessity for the Minister for Finance above any other Minister, to have faith in the future of the State.  He should be more ready to invest in the future and to have more faith in the people and in the land of the country.  If the Minister is not prepared to do that, then I think that the members of the Oireachtas must express dissent from the Minister's policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the second occasion since the Budget was introduced that we had an opportunity of a long discussion on the Vote on Account. In the ordinary course of parliamentary business, I expect it is the Appropriation Bill that would now be before the House but because the main Party in the Dáil considered it politically expedient to prolong and hold up the various Estimates we now have the Vote on Account.  The Minister is asking permission to pass a Bill entitling <Col N="452" /> some £30,000,000 to be expended in order that Government activities might be continued for a period of four months.</P>
      <P>It was very difficult to follow Senator Baxter while he was speaking.  I came to the conclusion that if by any chance Senator Baxter should find himself in Heaven some day he would weep because he would imagine he was at some great loss to be there.  He started off by referring to the low standards of living of our people and almost in the same breath he drew our attention to the fact that in regard to one item of agricultural produce alone there is something in the region of £14,000,000 given to the creameries for the purchase of Irish creamery butter together with, as mentioned by Senator Baxter, the sum of £2,000,000 expended on the importation of butter from other countries.</P>
      <P>I do not wish at this stage to go over the history of what brought about the necessity for the then Government to import butter but I think Senator Baxter will agree that we are now coming to the position once more when we may hope at least to be able to supply our own requirements.  Senator Baxter asked the Minister to look out over the Ireland of to-day and see what the policy given effect to over a period of years by his Government has brought about.  There is no change in the policy advocated by the Minister and given effect to from the time the Minister first entered into the national life of this country when he became a member of the Sinn Féin organisation. The policy given effect to by the Government of which the Minister for Finance is a member was that put forward to the Irish people by the Sinn Féin Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Baxter reminds me of quite a number of people you would meet up and down the country.  He always makes the same suggestion that something must be done for agriculture. There is more being done for agriculture by this Government than was ever done before.  More money has been provided in the Estimates for the Department of Agriculture and more grants made available to the various committees of agriculture than ever <Col N="453" /> before.  There are more schemes for the encouragement of agriculture than at any time before.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter with others referred to the lack of facilities for the farmers to get credit.  All the credit facilities that were there before are there now. I think Senator Baxter will recollect that when Deputy Dillon, as Minister for Agriculture, appeared in this House, there was a long discussion on this question of credit for the farmers. I think the views expressed by Senator Baxter at that time were not altogether the views that he gave expression to to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>They were the very same and if the Senator looks up the record he will see that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator had very little influence with the Minister if that is the case.  Senator Baxter glossed over the question of unemployment. We should all like to see an increase in output per acre per man.  He questioned the benefits that the proposals put forward by the Taoiseach might have in relieving the present state of unemployment.  Speaking for myself and for a great many people throughout the country, I think that those proposals are very welcome, particularly the proposals in relation to the encouragement of private enterprise and those in relation to a reduction of rates and valuation in the improvement or the erection of new buildings. I think these are steps that will have a very beneficial effect and will be greatly appreciated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we refer to the numbers of unemployed, I think it is only right that we should make some attempt to segregate.  I do not want to suggest for one moment that there are in the ranks of the unemployed men who are not willing and anxious to work and who would not work as well as any other workers if the work was available, but we must not lose sight of the fact that amongst those are a great number of people who are unemployable. I think we must direct our attention towards solving that great problem. We have, I think, something like 20,000 a year leaving our schools.  I <Col N="454" /> would be in favour of extending the school-leaving age so that those leaving school when they reached 15 or 16 years of age would not find themselves in blind alley employment or find themselves compelled to leave such employment after a number of years to join the ranks of those people who are unemployable.</P>
    <P>Somebody should issue a warning to those people, particularly politicians, who are trying to utilise the plight of the unemployed in Dublin and elsewhere for Party advantage.  That will give rise to great difficulties here, as it has done in other countries, if some of our politicians, as has been the case in Dublin in recent weeks, by word and example, encourage those people to demonstrate.  No one objects to demonstrations by any section of the people in putting forward views or grievances, but I can see the time coming when this will not end at peaceful demonstrations.  Those people in the past encouraged people to take other action and when other action was taken they were not the people who took the consequences.  I fear that those who are urging these unemployed people to-day will not be there if something more serious should occur &mdash;I hope it will not&mdash;as has happened in other countries.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter suggests that agriculture needs more teachers.  He speaks here as a practical farmer and he should be the first to tell the House how difficult it is to get a farmer to accept instruction, even from qualified persons in a rural area.  The best approach would be to encourage our young farmers to avail of whatever facilities are there.  When one farmer sees the advantages accruing to him, others will realise those advantages, too.  I do not see that the appointment of teachers or instructors all over the country would achieve the object Senator Baxter may have in view.</P>
    <P>The land project&mdash;which was only a continuation of the land reclamation scheme introduced by Fianna Fáil&mdash; was introduced with the blowing of trumpets.  The most useful and beneficial parts of that scheme are being maintained and pushed forward.  If Senator Baxter takes the trouble to <Col N="455" /> look at the Book of Estimates, he will find more money being provided this year than in any year before for this project, even by the Minister who was most enthusiastic about it.  Senator Baxter will recollect that many of us here recommended to the then Minister when the scheme was introduced that more liberal grants should be made available for the distribution of fertilisers; and we know what the attitude of the Minister was.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>They are far less liberal now.  That is the trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Baxter complains because some changes have been made in the scheme&mdash;changes brought about because Senator Baxter and others will not realise that this is a scheme to improve the land of the country and not to take the place of an employment scheme.  The Senator will agree that if we encourage the farmer to get the work done himself on his own land it is a better job, as the farmer has his own people employed, than it would be if it were done by a group recruited from the labour exchange.  It is done with less expense and therefore more people can benefit by it.</P>
      <P>We regret the circumstances that have led to the introduction of the second Vote on Account in such a short time, but that is not the fault of the Minister or the Government: it is the fault, if fault there must be, of the Opposition in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to be generally agreed that this past year&mdash; and the present moment in particular &mdash;has been and is one of great difficulties for the State.  In fact, the word &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; is being used at present to describe the situation.  We have had the balance of trade situation, the unsatisfactory agricultural production, the unsatisfactory state of production generally and, of course, the unemployment situation and the emigration situation.  A lot of reasons have been given for our present plight in the last debate on the Budget in this House and in the other House.  I feel that the cause of our difficulties is not <Col N="456" /> something that happened in the last year or two.  I suggest that there is something deep-seated, something basically wrong, in our whole approach to the working of the economic life of this State.  I suggest there has been something wrong in our policy and in our approach for many years past and that we are now seeing the results in these our present difficulties.</P>
      <P>We all remember that when we were young and secured self-government for this country we spoke of the wonderful things we would do, how we would create industries here to employ our people and our resources to the greatest advantage.  I think there is an atmosphere of disappointment amongst our people generally to-day with the results that have been achieved after 30 years of self-government. Perhaps I would venture to suggest what is wrong.  I would do so not only out of my own mouth but out of the mouths and the minds of many thinking people and many thinking groups in our country.  I think that the fact of the matter is that we have had no national economic plan, that we have had no consistent and continuous policy operating in our economic affairs over the last 30 years.</P>
      <P>All Parties here have declared that ours is to be a private enterprise economy.  Yet our whole fiscal policy would look as if it had been designedly framed to prevent the full development of a private enterprise economy.  If we choose a certain type of economy, it is only common sense that we should direct all our efforts to build up that economy in the strongest way possible. We must not fail by dividing our attention or by letting our attention be misdirected away from our true objective by playing around with other forms of economy.  For instance, it is stated in the I.B.E.C. Report that although we profess private enterprise we have been practising socialism and socialistic ideas which prevent us from building up a strong private enterprise economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have here a very advanced degree of social welfare.  We have a very high degree of taxation; everyone agrees it is now excessive.  As well as that, we have all sorts of penal <Col N="457" /> taxes on the building up and maintenance of capital in private industry and in private enterprise generally.  When I say private enterprise I do not want it to be taken as merely meaning private business.  The private enterprise system, as I visualise it, is the system where every individual in the State is allowed the greatest possible freedom consistent with the general good to develop his own life, to earn his own money by the sweat of his brow and, having earned his money and his goods, he is entitled to reasonable control and disposition of those goods.</P>
    <P>It is elementary in any economy that capital must be available to operate it. If there is too little capital available naturally the economy is thus restricted. Provided the economy is intelligently worked the greater the capital available the greater is the possibility of development.  It is, therefore, important if we adopt the private enterprise economy that we should direct and encourage as much capital as possible into the working of this economy which we have chosen.</P>
    <P>Capital is needed, first of all, to initiate schemes in the operation of the economy.  Most of our operations under private enterprise are conducted by comparatively small people, by individuals or small groups of people.  Consequently most enterprises undertaken in this country through the private enterprise system start with insufficient capital.  Therefore, it is important that our taxation and our whole fiscal policy should be designed in such a way that during their operations people who started with insufficient capital will be able to build up from the results of their work and from the result of their trading more and more capital with which to expand and extend. That is necessary, first of all, in order to expand the business, but it is also absolutely essential in any business that it should have capital available not only for operation and expansion but also for bad times and to get people over difficult periods.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the general egalitarian public opinion we have here, I do not think anybody who would examine our fiscal system could say we are directing our economy in such a <Col N="458" /> way as to build up a strong and healthy private enterprise.  Apart from the question of taxation and Government policy, it is very important that we should have a public opinion that appreciates what our private enterprise economy is and what it requires.  There is the feeling here that individuals and groups of individuals should be prevented from becoming wealthy, and if they do become wealthy there is a tendency here to call for taxation measures which will deprive them of their wealth; even if it is done not in their lifetime certainly our death duty system is devised to take away from private enterprise the capital owned either in private companies, in family businesses or by individuals.</P>
    <P>The statement which has been made in the I.B.E.C. Report in regard to our private enterprise economy is quite true, that we are in fact, preventing ourselves from working properly a private enterprise economy on which our whole state is built and on which the State relies for its taxation, for the carrying on of its activities and the social life of the people.</P>
    <P>Since 1931 up to the present date there has been a progressive increase in taxation of all kinds both by the national Government and by local government.  Since 1931, when the total revenue of this State was £25,500,000, it has reached in 1953 over £100,000,000.  An interesting item I came across was that since 1925, by means of estate duty, which I regard as the State confiscating the savings of people under private enterprise, £46,500,000 has been taken by the State.  The frightening part about this particular item of estate duty&mdash; confiscated private capital saved over a long period by thrifty people&mdash;is that whatever is collected is dissipated in one year and goes into current revenue.</P>
    <P>What would anybody think, for instance, if a man died leaving £100,000 and, there being no estate duty, left £50,000 to each of his sons and one man blew the whole amount in one year?  It would be regarded as crazy and he would be regarded as the most prodigal of prodigal sons. <Col N="459" /> Yet that is what the State does here in a private enterprise economy.</P>
    <P>What incentive is there to a man or or to a group of men to spend their lives saving&mdash;which we are all told to do by Ministers, Governments and all sensible people&mdash;if at the end of his life the more he saves the more is taken from him by the State and the more is blown up in one year.  I suggest this is not the way to strengthen a private enterprise economy.  I think it is quite safe to say in regard to our private enterprise economy as it has operated over the last 30 years that it is being over-milked but underfed.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnston and Senator O'Brien drew attention to this fact in their speeches in the last debate in this House on State policy.  They pointed out that we were not really giving private enterprise a fair chance and that we would have to make up our minds whether we are going to carry on under the private enterprise system which we profess or whether we are going to be socialists.  We cannot ride both horses at the same time. What is happening and what is being shown by our present difficulties is that we are falling to the ground between two animals which we are trying to ride at the same time.  The chambers of commerce in this country have repeatedly, year in and year out, drawn attention to our socialist policy. They have asked that private enterprise be given a fair chance and that it is time, instead of having all sorts of palliatives to deal with our unemployment situation and other situations arising out of the deficiencies in our economy, that we got down to working out some constructive basic plan to which we will work in the future on a long-term basis.  I was interested last week-end to see the statement made by the Taoiseach, and I feel that it is a heartening sign that even at this late stage there is recognition in such a high quarter of the necessity for building up our private enterprise economy. I will quote from the <i>Irish Times</i> of Monday, July 27th, which reports that Mr. de Valera said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It was the Government's view that it was not on works directly sponsored <Col N="460" /> by the State or by public authorities that its sole or indeed its main reliance should be placed.  It was by stimulating private activities by commercial and industrial firms and by individuals that the State could best contribute to the promotion of useful work.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a recognition by the Taoiseach himself that it is mainly upon the private enterprise economy that we should rely.  Now if that is the case, it seems only logical that the Taoiseach and his Government should direct all their energies to building up that private enterprise economy to which, he says, we are looking for a solution of our unemployment and our emigration problems and I agree, therefore, with that and think that it is perfectly right.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste, Deputy Lemass, and other Government spokesmen, also have repeatedly pointed out that increased productivity is essential to the increased prosperity which we need in this country and the solution of our unemployment and emigration problems and our balance of payments and other problems.  Productivity is the answer to all those things.  But increased productivity can only be got with increased availability of capital. We cannot increase productivity by merely working harder.  It is necessary if we are to get increased productivity to have increased capital to obtain the necessary raw materials and to buy better and more up-to-date machinery, to develop markets and to make research of markets, to send out men to sell goods and to develop markets&mdash;all that takes capital and there is no good in talking about increased production on the one hand if the capital is not available with which to achieve it.</P>
    <P>I happened to be at a conference of manufacturers recently, European manufacturers who met American manufacturers in Paris, and some of the biggest manufacturers in America were present and some of the most important manufacturers in Europe. This question of production and capital investment in Europe were two of the main questions that were discussed. A report which came from <Col N="461" /> this particular meeting&mdash;the Council of European Industrial Federations and the delegation of American industrialists&mdash;which was issued in Paris in May, 1953, pointed out that increased production requires increased capital. It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;America owes her high level of production to the huge investments she can make.  New and better equipment must be constantly at the disposal of industrial enterprises.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It goes on to say that this requires not only initial capital but a continuous flow of new capital.  Now in our own country here our taxation continuously bleeds our private industry, not feeds it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass recently remarked in public that there was room here for foreign capital to be put into our industrial life both agricultural and industrial. I think myself that is necessary because I do not think that there is enough capital available in this country to develop our full potential here; but it would seem to be relevant to suggest that before we go looking for foreign capital we should at least create as much of our own capital as possible because it is far more healthy that we should at first develop our own capital resources, thus making our own people thrifty and self-reliant, and if we are in the habit of developing and utilising our own capital, we will be all the more fit to utilise foreign capital when it comes into us; but as a matter of fact the same factors that militate against the building up of our own capital and against the investment of our own capital in private enterprise will also militate against the bringing in here of foreign capital.</P>
    <P>If it is impossible for our capital here to build up industry obviously it follows that the same will also apply to foreigners.  Again, in this meeting to which I have already referred, the question of what factors had to be considered in attracting foreign capital into any country was raised.  They were talking about Europe generally but their remarks apply to this country just the same.  The report says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Capital formation in Europe is not sufficient because savings are hampered by excessive currency <Col N="462" /> deflation and progressive taxation. Furthermore, in attracting long-term capital the private economy has always had to compete with Government authorities.  American capitalists had very little incentive for investing in Europe.  There could only be one incentive, that of a high dividend, and it was not the case.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>You might notice one remark is made there, that the private economy has always had to compete with Government authorities.  Senator Professor Johnston speaking the other day pointed out that we had that very thing in this country.  It is hard enough to build up capital within our private enterprise businesses themselves but it is almost impossible now to get any other risk capital because it is all being mopped up by the Government itself for its own uses&mdash;for its own capital uses and for a lot of its business ventures, many of which are uneconomic and very expensive.  A lot of them are necessary services but they are really all uneconomic.  We see one after another losing money, and that in spite of the fact that they are in the very happy position, different from us who have to function in private enterprise, that if they see that they are going to make losses, they simply raise their prices.</P>
    <P>On the last day when the Minister was in this House he referred to the drapery trade and he said that if trade was bad he would advise people in that trade to reduce prices of their goods. But that rule does not seem to apply to Government-run industries, as we saw recently in the Post Office service. When business was bad and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs saw they were going to make a loss, he decided to raise the prices on everybody.  Of course, it made little difference in the long run to the taxpayer who might as well pay the increased prices, because if he did not have to pay for it in the prices of his telegrams and telephones he would have to pay for it in the form of more taxation; so whichever way it goes, with the State-owned industry it is a case of &ldquo;heads they win, tails we lose&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In talking about this question of the <Col N="463" /> bringing in of foreign capital, another quotation from that report might be of interest.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The first condition for restoring a normal flow of capital is renewed confidence in foreign currencies and in the stability of the economic policy of poor countries and in the respect shown by those countries to private property belonging to foreign investors. Too many difficulties and threats have dissuaded foreign capitalists from investment abroad.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest that we in this country have those very difficulties and threats to home capital and they will be equally there against foreign capital.  We have these difficulties; we have even still, at this late stage, limitations on giving reasonable profit margins to people merely to appeal to a certain element in the community that wants always to get something below the economic price.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnston rightly pointed out during the debate on the Finance Bill that one of the few things in our economy that was sold during the war at proper economic prices was clothing. As a result everybody in the clothing business was regarded as a charlatan and a robber because clothes were the only things that were really bearing their full cost, whereas in other industries the prices were really false prices. Housing, for instance, was subsidised, and food was subsidised.</P>
    <P>What I would like to suggest is that the time has come when we really should cease this sort of practice of dealing with our economy merely on a year to year basis, on a system of expediency sops and palliatives all designed to disguise and postpone dealing with the true problem within our economy.  I feel that we should make up our minds whether we are going to develop the private enterprise economy which we say we believe in or whether we are going to continue on this road of socialist legislation and a socialist Government of all kinds and, at the same time, mulct the private enterprise economy and prevent it from being strong enough to bear the burden of socialism.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="464" /> The time has come when, instead of scoring political points, we should get down to planning a national economy and we should work that plan, as Senator Baxter said, on a long-term basis.  The I.B.E.C. Report has made that very suggestion.  It states that the first need in Ireland's economic programme is for a clarification of aims and a confident and wholehearted commitment to their fulfilment. If we do that, we shall be doing a good day's work for our country; we shall be doing something which will enable us to employ our people gainfully and we shall, at long last, stem the high scale of emigration which is at present taking place from this country.</P>
    <P>Instead of piecemeal experimentation in regard to industrialisation and exports, we should have the courage to stand back and look at ourselves in the light of our experience in the past 30 years and then, honestly and seriously, we should address ourselves to a completely fresh examination of the over-all of this country's potential economy.  This examination must essentially be free from political bias, prejudice and expediency.  That is why I use the words &ldquo;honestly and seriously&rdquo;.  People from abroad who have looked at us objectively and dispassionately have not been slow to show us, in a good spirit, where they think our management of national affairs has gone wrong.  The I.B.E.C. Report says in that short sentence which I have already quoted that what we should do for the future is to have a definite policy and to stick to it.</P>

      <P>Keeping in mind the vocational nature of the Seanad, I should like to raise one or two points which interest me particularly as a teacher.  They come under the Estimate for the Department of Education. The first is this.  I would put it to the Minister for Education, through the Minister for Finance, that the present scale of capitation grants to secondary schools is inadequate.  This matter was raised in the Dáil and, so far as I know, it was not replied to by the Minister for Education in his closing speech.  As I know that the Minister for Finance has always been on the side of the <Col N="465" /> angels in matters of education and in matters of culture, I hope he will bring the matter again to the attention of the Minister for Education and ask him to consider it very seriously.</P>
      <P>The fact is that the successive Governments of our country have dealt very generously, on the whole, with primary schools, with technical schools and with universities.  As a teacher, myself, I should like to express my appreciation of this generous policy. Further, as a member of the religious minority in this country, I should like to express my appreciation of the scrupulous fairness of the national policy in education since the foundation of the State.  But there is an anomaly&mdash;and that is the matter which I should like to bring to the attention of the House to-day and to the attention of the Minister.</P>
      <P>While the fact is that Government grants to all other branches of education have gone up considerably in the past 30 years, there has been one notable exception and that exception is in the scale of the capitation grant to secondary schools.  If my information is correct, the capitation grant in secondary schools remains at the 1929 scale.  It is still £8 for junior pupils, that is, pupils up to the Intermediate Certificate stage, and £10 for senior pupils, that is, pupils up to Leaving Certificate stage.  That has been the scale for 24 years.  I need hardly emphasise to the House that costs have gone up enormously in every way since then. The cost of living has risen, and the value of the £ has fallen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as speaking as a teacher, I can speak as a member of the governing bodies of two fairly large groups of schools in the Republic.  It is extremely difficult to keep these schools going.  The extra cost of food, furniture and repairs makes it almost impossible to keep them going.  To mend a roof or to replace a single window-pane would probably cost three times what it cost in 1929.  I should like to emphasise that all denominations and all kinds of schools have felt this difficulty.  In the Dáil Report for Wednesday, 3rd June, 1953, column 722, a Deputy quoted the Most Reverend Dr. Rogers, Coadjutor Bishop of Killaloe, when addressing <Col N="466" /> parents and students at St. Flannan's College&mdash;who emphasised the great need for secondary schools&mdash;and he also quoted the Right Reverend Dr. Harvey, Bishop of Cashel and Emly, Waterford and Lismore, who was presiding at the annual distribution of prizes at a Protestant school in Waterford. Both of these men insisted on the need for increased capitation grants.  Senator McGuire spoke just now about private enterprise.  These schools are good examples of private enterprise in our country.  I think it is in the interests of the Government to keep them going and to encourage them.</P>
    <P>Besides, there is a very marked contrast with schools across the Border, and schools in England, where parents can get almost free education up to a very high level for students of secondary school standard.  I think it is very serious that our secondary schools in the South should be faced with the need for raising their fees very considerably while, across the Border, parents need pay nothing at all in many cases for secondary education for their children.  I would emphasise, too, that our secondary schools are the essential nursery of genius or of higher intellectual power in our country.  They control the critical stage between primary and university education, when the pupils of real merit begin to stand out.  To the secondary schools we must look for the intellectual élite of the country, the élite in politics, in the arts, in the sciences and in industry.  If we neglect the secondary schools, the country will suffer in all these spheres.  There is, of course, the possibility of raising the fees but I think that fees, in general, have reached a stage where to raise them further would simply mean that many pupils could not go into secondary schools.  A great deal more could be said on this subject.  I would urge on the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Education that it is worth considering why the capitation grants remain at the scale they were in 1929.</P>
    <P>The second matter also comes under the Estimate for the Department of Education, and here I propose to repeat very briefly what I said a few <Col N="467" /> months ago.  I repeat that the state of our National Museum is a discredit to the country.  It is unworthy of the nation.  It is unworthy of the nation in this way, that our museums, the one to the south-east of us, the natural history museum, and the other, the cultural museum, there to the south-west, are unworthy in their standards of our national traditions. Many other smaller countries in Europe have better equipped and better displayed museums.  The reason is partly lack of space and partly lack of staff.  It is not because the present staff are not doing their duty&mdash;they cannot do more in the existing circumstances.</P>
    <P>If one turns to the Book of Estimates for the current year, one finds, on page 220, that £14,000 will be spent on the National Museum and £19,000 on the National Library.  I do not for a moment suggest that the National Library should in any way be deprived of funds, but I do suggest that there should be more parity between the two grants.  So far as visitors are concerned, our museums are much more important, I think, for the national prestige than the National Library. The National Library appeals to a few select readers from abroad; thousands of people visit our museums every month.</P>
    <P>Again, looking at this page of the Estimates, one finds that there is no administrator in the National Museum. Further, the staff of the National Museum numbers 21 and the staff of the National Library 40.  I insist&mdash;and the House, if it considers the facts, will agree with me&mdash;that the National Museum is being neglected, not through any incompetence on the part of the existing staff, but through lack of funds and lack of interest at Government level.  If any Senator wants further documentation for that, let him consult Professor Bodkin's report of a year or so ago in which he gives very precise and very pungent facts about the Museum.  I would emphasise that it makes a bad impression on our visitors to see an ill-displayed, crowded museum.  And it has a bad effect on our own scholars, art students and research <Col N="468" /> workers.  In the museum of natural history there are not the necessary facilities for up-to-date research in botany and the other branches of natural science.  That is a hindrance to the intellectual progress of the country and I think it is a pity. I hope once more that the Minister will consider that sympathetically.</P>
    <P>The third matter is very brief.  I must first ask the question&mdash;I should have checked it beforehand, but I did not do so&mdash;whether the allowance for travelling abroad is still £35?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is still £35.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest that it could be raised to the £40 level which prevails in a neighbouring country, or might I ask if there is any good reason for our keeping it at the lower level?  The £5 difference might mean the difference between enjoying one really good day in, say, Madrid or Stockholm and missing one good day there.  I appeal to the Minister to give us a reason why at least we should not have the £40 allowance which a neighbouring country enjoys.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The Finance Bill which we discussed a couple of weeks ago deals with the raising of public money and this Bill deals with the spending of the same public money. The same problems are really being considered from a different point of view.  I said most of what I have to say on these matters a fortnight ago, but there are one or two points arising out of the national expenditure which I should like to raise to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first point is one with which everybody is familiar but which cannot be sufficiently repeated.  It is that the share of the national income taken by Governments all over the world is rapidly increasing to-day.  The latest figures I have been able to obtain on this are to be found in an article in the current number of Lloyd's <i>Bank Review,</i> in which the change in the share of the national income taken by Governments from 1938 to 1951 is given. In the United Kingdom, it rose from 17 per cent. to 32 per cent.; in the United States, from 18 per cent. to 26 per cent.; in Canada, from 20 per cent. to 24 per cent.; in Norway and <Col N="469" /> Sweden, from 18 per cent. to 27 per cent.; and in Holland, from 18 per cent. to 28 per cent.  I am afraid that the figures in this country were not prepared on quite a comparable basis, but it would be interesting to know what the rise in the proportion of the financial income taken for public purposes here is.  One thing which one can assert without any fear of contradiction is that it certainly has gone up steeply.</P>
    <P>This rise in the public revenue, of course, is the result of several factors, some of which are almost beyond Government control.  The essential services&mdash;Army, police and judiciary&mdash; are rising in cost, owing to rising salaries and wages.  The sphere of Government activity is extending year by year in this and every other country.  Owing to the international tension which is now happily easing considerably, a great deal of expenditure has had to be incurred on national defence.  There is one final matter which shows no signs of abating. Social services of all kinds, for health, education, relief of old age and unemployment are all growing every day. We may take it that, with the exception of expenditure on defence, all these other services will go on rising in cost, and, unless the national income of the country can be expanded, the Budget will soon become impossibly top-heavy.</P>
    <P>I do not want to harp on a subject that has been dealt with so frequently and so recently in the Seanad, but there is a new figure which was not available the last time I spoke which seems to be striking, and striking in a somewhat unpleasant manner, for this country.  From 1938 to 1951, the agricultural output of Great Britain, which has never pretended, in recent years at any rate, to be an agricultural country, has increased by over 51 per cent., whereas the agricultural output of this country has barely held its own.  I do not propose on this discussion to consider the causes of the stagnation of our agricultural output, but what I do suggest is that, whatever the cause, as Senator McGuire said, the whole economic policy of the <Col N="470" /> country needs to be impartially and objectively inquired into.</P>
    <P>There is one type of public expenditure on which, I suggest to the Minister, more might productively be spent.  Most of the objects of public expenditure in this country are concerned with redistributing existing wealth.  There are certain types of public expenditure which have as their objective an increase in the wealth of the country and in the national income, and I suggest that there are certain types of expenditure of this kind which might be advantageously increased.  In this regard, I am following on what Senator Stanford said about expenditure on education.</P>
    <P>I quite agree that the expenditure on primary, secondary and even on university education has been reasonably satisfactory, but there are certain educational services on which public money might still, I think, be advantageously spent to a greater degree than at present.  I refer to every type of research.  The expansion of national incomes in every country to-day is based largely on scientific research. Competition between countries is becoming much keener than it was and the countries which are forging ahead to-day are the countries which are making the most intelligent use of their national resources and the brains of their inhabitants.  Other countries are spending a very large amount on research of a kind on which this country is spending comparatively little.  Research in pure science may not appear to pay an immediate dividend but in the long run nothing pays a greater dividend to society.  Research in all types of technology could be greatly advanced.  The new Institute of Management is an attempt to improve the quality and the efficiency of management in this country.  That is an object upon which the Government might also, I think, spend some public money.</P>
    <P>The science of industrial psychology in this country is still in its infancy. The whole question of incentives or the relation between efforts and rewards could be advantageously studied.  Finally, there is another <Col N="471" /> very important matter which, perhaps, does not receive sufficient attention. I refer to the adaptability of producers to change.  That is a matter which should be investigated.  There is a great deal of inertia and stagnation in agriculture, in business and in trade union movements.</P>
    <P>Everything that can break down the resistance to change and which can wake up people to the necessity of improving their methods might pay a dividend to the country in the long run.</P>
    <P>The only way in which we can intelligently tackle the unemployment problem about which everybody is talking is to develop the natural resources of the country.  Anything short of that is only a makeshift.  Anything that does not in the long run add to the national income and export capacity would be only some sort of a magnified form of relief works whatever else it might appear to be.  Unemployment is unquestionably the essential political problem of this country to-day.  It occupies&mdash;or it should occupy&mdash;the same part in Irish public discussion that the question of the land tenure occupied 70 or 80 years ago.</P>
    <P>That question has been finally solved.  After a great deal of bitter dispute the correct solution was finally reached, I think.  I think that the verdict of history on present day Irish Governments will largely depend upon the intelligence with which they attack the new urban social problem which is taking the place of the land problem of the last century.  It is no use tinkering with relief works even on the most magnificent style and scale.  The only way in which the problem can be intelligently tackled is on the technical level.  The natural resources must be investigated to discover what there is there that can be produced. Amongst the natural resources of the country the brains and the skill of the people must not be neglected.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, as I said the matter must be studied on the psychological side.  There may be people who are unemployed who could possibly be <Col N="472" /> induced to accept employment by a different psychological approach on the part of employers, the Government and by public opinion.  Finally, the unemployment problem must be approached as a political problem.  It cannot be solved in the way in which it is solved in totalitarian countries.  Democratic countries can only approach unemployment in a democratic way.  All these problems require to be attacked.  In other countries research into scientific matters, technical matters and management matters can be left to the initiative of private industries and private enterprise.  In this country, with one or two exceptions, one of which I think should be given honourable mention, Bord na Móna, and their work in relation to the development of peat, these matters must be taken over by the central Government.  We have not got the large business enterprise here to indulge in research of this kind.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the attention of the House to work that has been done by a country which in many ways resembles this.  It is a small country without a great variety of natural resources and it is a country slightly behind in the industrial race.  It has tackled this question of research in a big way.  The country is Norway.  No doubt members of the House will have seen an article in the <i>Times</i> of yesterday, where an account is given of the way in which the Norwegian Government has utilised the resources of a great central football pool for the development of sport and scientific research.</P>
    <P>We cannot pretend in this country to have any conscientious objection to using the proceeds of gambling for good social purposes.  To pretend that would be hypocrisy.  For the last 30 years we have been raising every penny we can for the hospitals by appealing to the gambling instincts of the people.  We tax the proceeds of gambling.  We license betting shops. If there is a habit of this kind capable of getting revenue for public purposes, I suggest it should be turned to good account.  The Norwegian Government has nationalised football pools and without going into any details I simply <Col N="473" /> want to point out that, according to this article in yesterday's <i>Times</i>, a very large amount of money has been raised which has been devoted to the very type of scientific research which I am advocating this afternoon.  Three research councils have been set up.  It is stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The achievements of the three research councils form a remarkable chapter in Norway's scientific development. The most immediate results have been achieved in the applied field, which is the responsibility of the technical research council.  For instance, the new Atomic Energy Institute was made possible by grants from the football pool profits, and 2 years ago built its own uranium reactor, the first of its kind to be built outside the great Powers.  Norwegian and Dutch scientists at this Institute are now considering the practical problems involved in building a reactor for propelling a merchant ship.</P>
    <P>The Research Council has also helped to establish a number of other institutes in specialised fields ranging from seaweed exploitation to geotechnology. The major project at the moment is the establishment just outside Oslo of a technical research centre where about 20 specialised institutes will have their headquarters. At this centre will also be a Central Institute for Technical Research which will accept research commissions on behalf of private firms and smaller institutes lacking adequate research facilities of their own.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I need not continue to quote, but the point is that Norway, a country somewhat like ours, is spending a considerable amount on scientific research.  I suggest that we could spend more than we are spending with beneficial results.</P>
    <P>All the research in the world and all the science technology and management will not produce practical results and give employment unless adequate capital is forthcoming.  Therefore, I cannot forbear from drawing the Minister's attention to a problem which has frequently engaged the Seanad, namely, the necessity for building up by every means in his <Col N="474" /> power new supplies of saving in this country.  The conditions for saving in a country are that there must be an expansion of national income.  There must be a surplus over the necessary consumption expenditure of the people. There must be some class of people with a surplus income which is not necessary to maintain themselves and their families from day to day.  There must be security regarding the future of the currency and there must be security regarding the future of the fiscal system.</P>
    <P>If all these conditions are present, saving should take place.  I do not attach much importance to a high rate of interest.  I think that a high rate of interest is important in encouraging saving by small investors, and in attracting small savings to thrift accounts, the Post Office Savings Bank and saving certificates.</P>
    <P>A high rate of interest is relevant there and I think it should be maintained at its present level.  But when it comes to the savings of the rich, the savings of the people who provide risk capital, my own opinion is that the rate of interest is not so much relevant to the volume of saving as to the way in which the savings are utilised and put to account.  That saving will take place very largely without regard to the rate of interest.  Confidence regarding the future of the currency and regarding the fiscal system are more important, in my opinion, than the rate of interest. Therefore, while from the point of view of encouraging small savings a high rate of interest is important, I do not think a high rate of interest is equally important to maintain the savings of the better-off sections of the population.</P>
    <P>The high rate of interest offered in the recent loan may have had the effect less of inducing people to save than of inducing people to switch from old securities into the new security which the Minister offered.  In other words, the Minister may have been justified in offering this high rate of interest in order to bring about a voluntary and painless repatriation of Irish capital held abroad, to induce people to part with existing securities <Col N="475" /> in exchange for his own loan.  The rate of interest offered may have been unnecessarily high, even for this purpose. The fact that the recent loan stands at a premium indicates that a slightly lower rate might have been attractive to the Irish public.</P>
    <P>The Minister in the Dáil last week argued that the high rate of income-tax in this country reduces the burden of the national debt, that a gross rate of 5 per cent. paid on an internal debt is not as great as it looks owing to the fact that the income-tax recovered back by the Minister is 8/- in the £.  I think that argument is a good one but, if it is, there is no gainsaying the argument that a lower rate of income-tax will enable the Minister to borrow at a lower gross rate in future.</P>
    <P>I suggest there are certain possibilities that have not been explored in this country.  I have mentioned them here before.  One is an attempt to float a loan free of income-tax.  If the Minister's argument about the effect of the high rate of income-tax on the net yield of the loan is correct, it should be possible to float quite a large amount free of income-tax at something like 3 per cent.  That may be worth trying.</P>
    <P>Another matter, which I have referred to before, is the possibility of capitalising the gambling instincts of the people.  We cannot pretend that we have any moral objection to gambling. We cannot maintain in this country the Nonconformist attitude that everything in the nature of gambling is socially evil.  We profit by it in every way we can.  The Government profits by it, the hospitals profit by it; it is regarded as a perfectly legitimate and proper form of activity.  In regard to the lands bonds, we have drawings. Why should there not be drawings in regard to other loans?  If 5 per cent. has to be paid at par, why should the Minister not float a loan issued at 80, carrying less than 5 per cent., with some occasional drawings, and give people a 20 per cent. premium on what they subscribe, free of all income-tax? Land bonds until recently have all stood at a premium and therefore the <Col N="476" /> drawing involved a loss to the holder. If the Minister can satisfy his conscience in regard to annual drawings which involve a loss to the holder, I really cannot see why he cannot satisfy his conscience in regard to annual drawings that might give the holder an occasional profit instead.  If the result were to raise a considerable amount at a lower rate of interest than what he has been accustomed to pay in the past, the effect on his conscience might be quite good.</P>
    <P>I would just remind the Minister of what I said a moment ago.  Norway&mdash; which, I am sure, is a country with at least as puritanical a conscience as we pretend to have&mdash;is not above capitalising football pools.  Football pools in Norway now are being utilised, not only for the encouragement of sport, which is good for the health of the people, but also for the encouragement of scientific research in a very large way.</P>
    <P>The last matter I would like to mention is the suggestion so frequently made in public discussions, that a great deal of capital could be obtained by the Government by a change in the composition of the assets in the Legal Tender Note Fund.  This is a matter which has been discussed so much in recent years that the public, who really were quite unaware of the very existence of the Legal Tender Note Fund up to recently, are now talking about it quite a lot.  Therefore, some effort should be made to get it into its correct proportions.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is sufficiently realised that, if a certain percentage of the assets of the Legal Tender Note Fund were allowed to be held in domestic securities&mdash;which is the nature of the suggestion made&mdash;the only effect would be a once-for-all transfer of a certain amount of sterling from the Central Bank to the commercial banking system, that £x millions in the Legal Tender Note Fund in sterling securities would be replaced by domestic securities.  These domestic securities, of course, would be Government securities.  That is understood.  We should try to clarify our minds as to where these Irish Government securities would come from.  There are only <Col N="477" /> two ways in which this transfer could be made.  One is by the creation of new Government securities and the other is by the purchase of old Irish Government securities.  In either case, the effect would be that somebody outside the Central Bank&mdash;the Government, in the first case; the people who sold the Irish securities, in the second case&mdash; would find themselves in possession of sterling which they had acquired in return for Irish Government securities supplied to the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>The first case is the one which, of course, is mainly in the minds of the people making the suggestion&mdash;that the Government itself should issue new securities in return for a certain amount of the British Government securities in the Legal Tender Note Fund.  I do not want to express an opinion as to whether a transaction of that kind could ever be justified or not.  The matter was carefully investigated for four years by the Banking Commission.  The commission, as a result of prolonged investigation, came to the conclusion that the Irish Government should not borrow from the Central Bank.  That was fully debated when the Central Bank Bill was being passed through the Dáil and this House in 1942.  The matter was discussed and both Houses came to the same conclusion as the Banking Commission.</P>
    <P>The reason why the Banking Commission came to that conclusion was that it considered that direct advances by the Central Bank to the Government would have an inflationary effect. That opinion is still valid to-day.  New securities issued by the Government to the Central Bank would unquestionably have an inflationary effect in this country.  This would show itself in disequilibrium in the balance of payments which is the only way in which inflation can show itself in Irish conditions. That would result in a certain liquidation of external assets.</P>
    <P>Again, that may, or may not be in itself, a good thing, but I want to say that the liquidation of external assets, although it may be perfectly justifiable, is not self-evidently a good thing in itself.  Everybody in the country talks to-day as if external assets were something <Col N="478" /> which we should get rid of if we possibly can.  There may have been some reason for saying that during the period when sterling was depreciating in value.  Any business tries to stock up at a time when prices are rising. During the period of world inflation, when the prospect for sterling was not very bright, there would be something to be said for buying things while the going was still good.</P>
    <P>As far as we can read the signs in the world to-day sterling has become a stable currency.  The worst days of depreciation of sterling are definitely at an end.  Therefore the argument for getting rid of sterling for its own sake because it is a wasting asset, if it was ever valid, is no longer valid to-day.  Every other Government in the world is trying to build up external reserves and is praised for building them up.  As far as I know, this is the one country in the world where it is looked on as in some way or other reprehensible for a Government to build up external reserves.</P>
    <P>I quite agree that a repatriation of assets and a certain expenditure of external reserves may be justified in the long run to build up productive investments; or it may even be justified in the short run to cure an emergency unemployment situation.  However, in the long run&mdash;and after all, Governments and politicians must look to the long run&mdash;the maintenance of external reserves and of equilibrium in the balance of payments is the necessary condition of providing employment. Any public works which may be kept going by the Government, any secondary industries which may be started will not be a success without a considerable volume of imports, of consumer goods, raw materials, machinery and other things.  That is essential and elementary and cannot be sufficiently stressed.  Therefore, in the long run, unless equilibrium is kept in the balance of payments, unemployment and emigration will become cumulatively and progressively worse.</P>
    <P>To come back to the point where I started my observations, I would say that the only way in which employment can be kept up in this country is by the development of the natural resources <Col N="479" /> of the country, physical and human. That depends on research.  If we can build up more substitutes for imports and build up more exports, then there will be a long-term healthy increase in employment which will benefit people all round.</P>
    <P>There seem to be people in this country who are itching to get rid of the savings of the nation.  There are also people who cannot understand why anybody in the street should be standing idle when other people have bank deposits which they are not using.  Why should one person be poor when somebody else has a big credit account in the bank?  I am not going to enter into the ethics of the matter as to whether a person who has a credit account in the bank is bound to come to the rescue of persons who are unemployed.  If every person with a credit account in the bank came to the rescue of every person unemployed in the street, in the long run the situation of everybody would not be better but worse than it was before.  That, I suggest, is an analogy we ought to keep in mind.  The existence of savings for an individual or for a community is not a reason for spending them.  It is a far better reason for adding to them, conserving them and building them up.</P>

      <P>It is certainly hard to address the Seanad after the very interesting discourse of Senator O'Brien.  I suppose it is well for us politicians who have to run the machine that it would be explained to us from time to time how the machinery runs and that there may be limits beyond which we ought not to drive the economic machine.  I would like to turn my attention to some of the remarks that were made here this afternoon.  Senator Hawkins said that if Senator Baxter were in Heaven he would weep.  I pondered that statement for some time as to why, if Senator Baxter were in Heaven, he should weep, and although Senator Hawkins did not develop the reason, I could draw no other conclusion than that Fianna Fáil must have given us <Col N="480" /> at least a fifth Heaven, and that none of us here realise the great benefits that are being conferred upon us in the wonderful State in which we now find ourselves.  No other conclusion could possibly be drawn from the statement of Senator Hawkins, the principal speaker so far for the Government.</P>
      <P>Senator Hawkins also said that according to the statement by the Taoiseach which was given to the Press during the week, a remission of rates would be given to industry and to commerce. I do not remember Senator Hawkins saying that the same Taoiseach's Government took away these remissions of rates on industry several years ago.  It is possibly true to say that it was by the removal of the remission of these rates, with the increasing of the very heavy burden of taxation private enterprise finds itself incapable to-day of employing all the people that should be employed, incapable of giving us the strong, healthy and expanding economy we should have in this nation to-day.  They have not created the climate which will allow free enterprise to progress as it should.</P>
      <P>The State run by Fianna Fáil during almost the last 20 years has preached to us thrift and economy and hard work, but this State to-day collects £120,000,000 in direct and indirect and local taxation, and they do not practise either thrift, economy or hard work in its spending or in its use. Senator McGuire said that they have taken away something between £40,000,000 and £50,000,000 of the people's savings during these years, and they were always prodigal enough to try and make sure that they spent those savings in the year that they collected. That is a sorry indictment, an indictment by the facts of the situation and the drift that has been taking place in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary that one would say to me that I should give some solution for this problem that exists in the nation, and I believe that that which is nearest to the solution is the development of our national resources on the land by the proper exploitation of the land rehabilitation project&mdash;call it any other name you like&mdash;by the proper utilisation <Col N="481" /> of the land resources of this little country.  Recently the Minister for Local Government reduced the grants under the Works Act to half what they were last year, for what purpose or who were his advisers I do not know, because the Works Act is in many respects the precursor of the land rehabilitation scheme.  The small rivers and the streams are drained by a free grant under the Works Act, and when they are drained the land rehabilitation officers came in, drew up their scheme, and then proceeded to give the grants for the work of the land rehabilitation project.</P>
    <P>The effect of the reduction of the Works Act scheme has been that the land project is arrested in an indirect way.  I think that the Minister for Finance should insist on the Department of Local Government in the national interest using the Works Act in full, particularly where it would be used for the purpose of facilitating the land rehabilitation project.</P>
    <P>I have recently made inquiries about the progress of that scheme in Tipperary, our largest inland county, and I find that we have an estimated 850,000 acres of arable land, and probably another 150,000 acres could be made arable without great expense.  I have been told that the very minimum amount of land that would need rehabilitation is 15 per cent.  That would mean that in County Tipperary 150,000 acres could be put into worthwhile economic production.  At £10 an acre, which is the sum of what you would get from the lowest class of bullock grazing without using any strip grazing, without using electric fences or without using any short leas or modern technique, you would bring in the County Tipperary £1,500,000 a year.  If you farmed it on any sort of reasonable measure you could bring in about £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 per annum from that; and that is one of our Twenty-Six Counties.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that with a proper development of the land rehabilitation project on that basis you could increase our national wealth by £50,000,000 a year; and nothing succeeds like success in agriculture or industry or anything else.  If the <Col N="482" /> farmers find that by having a proper technique they can keep their sons at home and prevent them going away, the sons will be quick to see it.  They are prepared to work the land at least as efficiently as the Danes or the Dutch or anyone else.  I think that many farmers' sons in this country have come to the realisation that in some ways this is a more pleasant country to live in than many of the countries like Holland and Denmark where they may have greater economic strength, but they certainly have not the facilities for enjoyment or the pleasure that you have in living in rural Ireland.  I would ask the Government to devote all its efforts first to the development of the land in this country, because it is the only way that we are going to employ our people and employ them continuously.</P>
    <P>It may be necessary, and I think it is necessary to-day, to use some of the national wealth to give relief schemes, but relief schemes should be of a temporary nature and plans should exist alongside those relief schemes that would absorb a whole lot of the unemployed of our nation in doing something that was for the benefit of our agricultural industry, that agricultural industry which would build up secondary industrial activities the by-products of which would come from the land and in which we would not be affected by the ebb and flow of the international price figure.  When the proper utilisation of the land as our major resource would have been achieved, one of the things we must direct our attention to is the establishment of a governmental machine and a bureaucratic machine that is more in keeping with our resources.  As I said earlier on, £120,000,000 a year is far too heavy a burden on our people to carry and something will have to be done about it, but I do not intend to delay the House any further in that respect.</P>
    <P>There are one or two small matters which I would like to mention.  One is that mentioned by Senator Stanford when he spoke about the difficulty that all educational bodies were having with regard to the building and equipping of schools.  I think that, in large <Col N="483" /> measure, subsidising by the State has made the building trade generally inefficient in this country and it is costing us far too much.  It was mentioned to-day by Senator Stanford that the cost of building schools is putting an unnecessary burden on educational authorities.  It is putting the same burden on industry.  It is putting the same burden on the boy and girl who want to get married, and it is putting the same burden on every shopkeeper and on every factory proprietor.</P>
    <P>Everyone is up against this problem and it must be solved.  A healthy competitive spirit must be brought into the building industry.  They have in Britain a permanent commission investigating building efficiency.  I happened to see recently that they have devised a scheme whereby they can reduce the ordinary artisans' dwellings by £100 by the introduction of certain machinery for lifting all the building materials up on to the scaffolding.  That was a reduction of somewhere between 8 and 10 per cent. in the cost of building, and it is a considerable advance.  We must, if we want to give our people a proper way to live in this country, have that investigated.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien spoke about scientific research.  That is one of the forms of scientific research that it would pay this country to develop.  Further, there should be some form of incentives in the giving of State grants for housing.  Those who are efficient should be rewarded for their efficiency and for the work they do and those who are inefficient should pay some penalty for their lack of efficiency and for being a drag on the community.</P>
    <P>I believe that none of our problems will be fully solved until we have an agreed approach by all political Parties.  I should like to see a period of national government in this country under which we could approach the major problems from a non-political standpoint.  Many of the things on which we disagree could be left aside and we could concentrate on the matters on which we agree&mdash;the giving of a decent way of life to the ordinary man and woman of this country, the <Col N="484" /> solving of our immediate unemployment and economic problems, and so forth.  These are some of the points which any national Government should tackle.</P>
    <P>We had a civil war.  I believe that the evils of that civil war cannot properly be undone until we have a national Government.  The people who disagreed during that civil war disagreed for patriotic motives.  If those people could come together and agree to push our economic aims and objectives for the benefit of our community I think that, historically, they would be considered as probably the only people who, having fought a war, were prepared to agree later so that the nation might progress and reach its proper destiny.  It was that the nation might reach its proper destiny that they disagreed and fought.  Our earlier disagreements have now passed and are gone into history but I think we must have some measure of agreement on our national problems.  We must tackle them with the drive, determination and the continuing effort that will ensure their successful solution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to say a few words on this question of a national Government.  I have been hearing about it since first I became a member of this Oireachtas. To my mind, it is just a kind of cover for people who have not any plan of their own to do anything.  The Party to which I belong represents all sections of the people of Ireland.  I think we have in it representatives of every section of the community, and, since it was established, it has done great work for this country.  In addition, we have all the other different Parties in the Dáil who represent various sections of other sections of the people. If they wish to discuss, on their merits, all the questions which the Government raise, we can have the type of discussions here and in the Dáil that Senator Burke evidently wishes to have.  So far as I can see, every proposal is discussed from a purely political angle.  If we defend ourselves here, very often we are accused of doing something which is disreputable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="485" /> I think it is essential that we should have a Party system in this State.  I do not think that democracy can survive unless we have a Party system. If we arrive at a position where everybody is in complete agreement with everybody else then we shall have gone beyond this world and the human element will be completely eliminated. In my opinion, we must have a Party system.  All we need is that the people who are in government will receive constructive criticism from the people who are in opposition.  I maintain that when we were in opposition we gave criticism on that basis, but I also maintain that we have not received criticism on that basis since we resumed office.</P>
    <P>Several times this afternoon it was stressed here that very little progress has been made in this country in the past 30 years.  That is an outlandish statement to make when one considers what has been achieved by this country in the past 30 years and particularly in the past 20 years or so.  I just want to make a passing reference to these things.  Try to cast your mind back to the position of this country&mdash;nationally, economically, culturally and every other way&mdash;in 1932 and consider the progress we have made since then.  It cannot be denied that we have made tremendous advances since then.  We are completely free, nationally and economically, at the present time.  We were completely tied in 1922.  A tremendous battle had to be fought to achieve the freedom which we have achieved since then.  We have made tremendous efforts&mdash;and we have succeeded in great measure&mdash;to rehouse our people.</P>
    <P>I think it can be said that in great measure we have succeeded not only in giving a new lease of life to industries already in the country but in establishing quite a large number of new industries. We have succeeded in making the farmers of Ireland prosperous.  I remember a time when the farmers of Ireland were a very miserable section of the community even though they constituted the great majority of the community.  At that time, they had to work too hard and they had nothing to look forward to.  To-day I think we <Col N="486" /> have arrived at the position that, definitely, the farmer is the most independent person in the country and those of them who work can earn a livelihood for themselves which is equivalent to that earned by their opposite numbers in any other country in the world.  Undoubtedly tremendous advances have been made.  It may be that we could have got further, but at least we have reached a stage when it is possible to go ahead much more quickly than was the case in the past.</P>
    <P>I believe, with Senator O'Brien, that the development of our own resources is the only method whereby we can eventually reach a very much higher standard of living than we have at present. I am happy that we have increased the standard of living of our people in the past 20 years out of all belief.  Anybody who is old enough to remember the condition of our people 20 years ago will realise that my statement is true.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased that somebody spoke here to-day on subjects other than those on the bread and butter angle.  I was delighted that Senator Stanford raised the question of our treatment of the Museum and other matters associated with that particular aspect of our life.  I fear that we devote too little attention altogether to things of that nature.  Sometimes I feel that it is the one aspect of our national life in which we have failed. We have not given enough attention to it and, somehow or another, I have a feeling that we are afraid to talk of the things about which Senator Stanford spoke to-day.</P>
    <P>When I go to other countries and see how much they have progressed, I make excuses for my own country because of the difficulties we had to contend with before we secured a native Government.  However, I was rather ashamed when I read that only £14,000 is being devoted this year to our National Museum.  I urge the Minister to take heed of what Senator Stanford said in that regard.  We should try to do more in this country for cultural matters.</P>
    <P>I remember that, even quite recently, <Col N="487" /> great political capital was made out of the fact that our Government at one time examined the advisability of spending a large sum of money, over a lengthy period of years, on the erection of public buildings in this country.  I was ashamed to think that Irish statesmen&mdash;men in responsible positions&mdash;should argue against the expenditure of money for such a purpose.  They argued that these moneys could be spent on the unemployed, the poor and so forth.  The fact is that here in Ireland we have so few buildings that our people can be proud of, and we have spent so little over the past 30 years on erecting buildings which would show that we are a people who are ambitious and who wish to see our country develop and have buildings of which our people could be proud.</P>
    <P>I am hoping that the Government will in the future go ahead with these great schemes and encourage our towns and our cities to erect buildings that will be proper, so that we will approach something like the state which the people of other countries have reached.  I am conscious of the fact that, in the erection of buildings of that description, useful work will be done and useful employment be given to our own citizens.</P>
    <P>I understand that when Senator Baxter was talking&mdash;I did not hear him&mdash; he spoke slightingly of the Costings Commission which has been established for the dairying industry.  I am something like Senator Quirke and Senator Burke, a hobby farmer, and I do not like to talk too much about farming.  Both he and I derive our livelihoods from something outside farming but, at the same time, the great majority of the people of Ireland sprang from the land and on that account we all have some interest in it. One thing I always lamented was that farmers were at the mercy of a market which might decide prices for their commodities on the basis of whims of various kinds, and, when the Costings Commission move was made, I supported it very freely because I believed that if the farmers needed anything, it was the knowledge that the <Col N="488" /> goods they produced could be sold at a price which would show them a reasonable profit.</P>
    <P>We know that when this commission was established it was made a very representative commission, embracing all sections of the community.  There was appointed as chairman a person who was absolutely the best person who could be selected for the position.  Why any person should speak in a disparaging way about a commission of that description, set up for the purpose of ensuring that farmers would get what would be a proper price, taking everything into consideration, a price which would be fair to the consumer but which would definitely give them a profit on their labour, I cannot understand. As Senator Hawkins has said, it is another sign that, if the Senator were in Heaven, he would find something to grumble about.  The only conclusion I can come to, as a townsman, is that his reason for objecting to this commission was that he was afraid the commission might decide that farmers were getting too much for their produce. If that commission is to decide anything, it is to see to it that they will get a reasonable profit and possibly he was afraid that the commission might decide that they were already getting too much.</P>

      <P>I was not listening to the Senator, as I have mentioned. Senator McGuire spoke a lot about private enterprise and suggested that we were becoming more or less socialistic.  I was rather amused by that.  He was referring, of course, to the way in which the State was interfering in manufacturing and various other industries.  The first State interference I remember in industry was when the Shannon electric power station was erected, and I think it was the previous Government, the inter-Party <Col N="489" /> Government, who decided that the railways should become a State enterprise.  There is nothing wrong, in my opinion, in the State doing something which the people themselves will not do for the benefit of the people generally.  That is my angle on it.</P>
      <P>The biggest industry in the country, we are told, is the agricultural industry. There are somewhere in the region of 400,000 farmers in the country and there is nobody can say that they are interfered with to a very great extent.  It is private enterprise and the great majority of our industries are absolutely private enterprise undertakings. The few there are in respect of which the State has butted in are essential in order to give the people the best the country can give and if the State did not butt in, nobody else would, and the people would have to go without the amenities or benefits that these enterprises confer.</P>
      <P>The Bill we are discussing is due, as we know, to what some of us might call the wastage of time in the Dáil over the past few months in discussing such things as general elections and topics of that description.  The Dáil spent all the time discussing these things instead of discussing the Estimates which would make it unnecessary for the Minister to look for a second Vote on Account.  While I have spoken for a quarter of an hour on this Bill, I am conscious of the fact that there should not be any need, so recently have we discussed the same thing, to deal with these matters.  The fact is that it would be impossible to carry on the services of the State without this Vote and it is, to some extent, a waste of time to continue to discuss these questions.  I have no doubt, however, that the Seanad will vote this money to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister looks very well and healthy.  I think we must admit that in many respects a Government, and particularly a Minister for Finance, is not a free agent.  He is a prisoner of the past record of his predecessors and, indeed, of himself and his own Party Government. Some of the policies which govern his present outlook and actions go back even to the period when the British ruled in this country.  Other of his problems or difficulties are imposed upon him by general world circumstances. There is then his own past record and the past, indeed, of his Party and also of his immediate predecessors who have certainly created certain problems which his Government has had to face.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I tried to suggest in my remarks on the Finance Bill that, <Col N="491" /> although we claim to be a private enterprise capitalist economy, there are, nevertheless, important socialist and even communist features running through our whole national economy. I drew attention, I think, to the anomaly of the fact, that whereas everybody is accustomed to paying at least three times as much in money for food and clothing as was paid prior to 1914, a large section of the population expect to get shelter, that is, to pay in the way of rent for housing only about one and a half times the standard that prevailed prior to 1914.  I think I am right in suggesting that the necessity for the heavy subsidies on the building of dwelling-houses for important sections of the community, not only the working classes but the middle classes, is caused primarily by the continued operation of the rent restrictions code which we have inherited from the days when the British ruled in this country. Those housing subsidies are an important element in our total financial expenditure. To the extent they are met by borrowing they are making a continual addition to the dead-weight debt of the nation.</P>
    <P>May I draw the attention of the Minister to some of the items on pages 185-6 of the Book of Estimates?  He will see that about £1,000,000 a year is contributed under the heading of contribution to loan charges.  That, apparently, arises from the fact that at various times since 1933, on the money lent from the Local Loans Fund, the interest was not paid in full by the people who profited by those loans; but the State stepped in and paid not only the money but a substantial proportion of the interest on the money they lent&mdash;a very kindly proceeding on the part of the nation. That particular element of subsidy of the order of £1,000,000 is a continual drain on the resources of the taxpayer from year to year and will go on for many years to come.</P>
    <P>I assume&mdash;I hope I am right in assuming&mdash;that that particular subsidy is met from the proceeds of current taxation, for it has certainly <Col N="492" /> built up no new element on capital account.  I hope the Minister will reassure me on that point later.</P>
    <P>There are other elements in that subsidy catalogued on pages 185-6 of the Book of Estimates.  Under the heading of Grants, there are substantial sums aggregating £2,500,000 paid for housing in one aspect or another. I would like to know from the Minister whether these contributions come from the proceeds of current taxation or whether they are met by borrowing.  As I hope shortly to explain there can be no justification for borrowing in order to find that particular item of so-called capital expenditure.  Therefore, I hope that that particular item of subsidy is also met from proceeds of taxation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Senator be good enough to give me the subhead? There are two separate ones there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>It is on pages 185-6.  The reason why I think it would be illegitimate to borrow for that particular item of subsidy is this.  As a by-product of the rent restrictions code, the private owners of houses let to statutory tenants are quite unable to maintain those houses in a proper state of repair.  In fact, many of them are being slowly bankrupted by the whole situation that exists between them and their tenants.  Consequently, it is a question as to what is the relevant proportion of old houses let on statutory rents which are rapidly falling into decay to the number of new houses being built with the help of subsidies from the public purse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suspect that the depreciation in capital value of the many houses let to statutory tenants far exceeds the value of the net addition to housing created by heavily subsidised housing in accordance with the various schemes with which we are familiar.  If that be so, the money spent on subsidising new building of dwelling-houses is not a net addition to the capital assets of the country at all but only a slight off-set to the serious depreciation in the capital value of the existing houses, many of which are let to statutory tenants.  I think it would be agreed <Col N="493" /> by the Minister that there is no justification for borrowing at all, except with a view to creating a permanent net addition to the capital assets of the nation in some form or another.</P>
    <P>One of the results of that curious relationship between subsidised new housing and old houses let to statutory tenants is that employment&mdash;especially employment in the building trades&mdash; depends too much on the rate at which new housing is being pressed forward, very often with the help of borrowed money.  In the ordinary way, in a free enterprise market, and in the absence of an artificial restriction of the rents of old houses, the principal demand for the services of carpenters, decorators, painters, plumbers and the rest would proceed from the owners of houses let to tenants at an economic rent and you could count on their demand to create a normal state of reasonably full employment for all that category of workers.  But because of the semi-bankrupt position to which the State has reduced the owners of houses let to statutory tenants, they are not in a position to repair and maintain their houses.  Consequently, the whole demand for the services of the craftsmen engaged in building houses devolves on the special schemes that we call housing schemes and, therefore, is apt to fluctuate widely according to the extent to which the Minister is in a position to provide money for such purposes.</P>
    <P>There are other social and economic consequences of the contrast between old houses and new.  I think I mentioned in my former remarks that the rent restriction code has operated to transfer a substantial part of the capital value of old houses let to statutory tenants from the owners to the statutory tenants.  Now, that is a kind of confiscation of a capital value.  If the confiscation of capital value took place in the interest of the community as a whole it would be intelligible and from the point of view of a communist ideology it would be even defensible; but this is worse than communism, for the confiscation that is taking place by the operation of State legislation is transferring capital values from one section of the community to another <Col N="494" /> section of the community, impoverishing one lot of people in the interests of the other lot, while that other lot my have done little or nothing to deserve such treatment.</P>
    <P>In fact, the kind of confiscation involved is the use of the power of the State to transfer wealth from one section of the people to another exactly analogous in principle to the great confiscations of Irish history when the State used its power to rob one section of the people in favour of another.</P>
    <P>Not only are the economic consequences of this whole situation one of the perennial causes of periodic unemployment in the building trade but they have also worked grave social injustice to a very worthy and deserving section of the community who unfortunately are unorganised and largely inarticulate and do not command very many votes.  I have a letter which is a regular cry from the heart from a victim of the rent restrictions legislation and I would like to put at least part of it on the records of the House. This poor woman is trying to live by letting to tenants a house which she bought for over £1,000 about 20 years ago.  Among other things she says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The law was all in favour of tenants. I worked and saved for my old age.  I am 71 years of age and it is misery.  The value of my property has gone in the market.  No one wants to take on tenants.  With the control tenants go to the corporation with their petty complaints. It is just legalised robbery. Give me back my own.  I have no strike weapon, doles or old age pension.  I saved for my old age and men with £10 to £15 a week are getting the benefit.  They get social services.  I prefer to work if I am let.  I have good health but there are other women and the hardship on them is terrible, to stand the impudence and abuse from tenants, the dilapidation, scarred walls and dirt, plumbing bills, choked lavatories and sinks.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hope that will in due course go on the records of the House.</P>
    <P>I think we really have only two alternatives in this matter, either as rapidly <Col N="495" /> as may be to abolish the rent restrictions code and let the rents of old houses rise to something approximating to the real economic cost of housing under modern conditions, in which case you will get a normal, permanent demand for the services of craftsmen to keep all houses in repair; or we can continue our present illogical and inconsistent policy of trying to ride the two horses, the capitalist horse and the communist horse, and the final result will be that we will go from bad to worse and keep piling up the deadweight debt.</P>
    <P>What is the ultimate cause of this housing shortage in Dublin?  Ever since the industrial drive began about 20 years ago there has been a terrific exodus of people from the rural areas and a correspondingly terrific influx of people into all the larger towns, and especially into Dublin.  Therefore, we have really created this problem of the housing shortage, in the cities at any rate, as a by-product of the over-hasty industrial drive we pursued for 20 years on a rather shaky agricultural foundation.  For fear of stimulating Senator Summerfield to excessive eloquence I am not going to deal with that line of thought now, but I am going to suggest that it is a pity we were not able to increase our agricultural output in the course of the last 20 years in anything like the proportion that we have increased our industrial output.  Had we been able to do so we probably would have a better distribution of population, less congestion in the cities and towns, less of this kind of housing problem and more real production and real wealth in the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter made reference to some of the facts about the static character of our agricultural output, in general, but also from even painful, personal experience.  However, I would like to put the matter in a slightly more statistical way.  I do not know whether other Senators recently acquired a valuable report of the F.A.O. entitled &ldquo;Output and Expenses of Agriculture&rdquo; published in 1953.  From that report it is possible for us to see ourselves <Col N="496" /> in the European setting as regards our agricultural effort in the last 20 years.  The result, I am sorry to add, is not very flattering.</P>
    <P>There are 14 Western European countries in this comparison, many of them countries that were overrun and disorganised in the course of the Second World War.  In these 14 countries as a whole the volume of agricultural output&mdash;I am speaking about volume, not prices&mdash;has increased by 10 per cent. since 1938.  We have barely got back to the level of 1938 thought I am glad to note in the last year there is evidence of a slight increase in the physical volume of output in agriculture.</P>
    <P>There are two comparisons which it is usual to make in regard to these matters.  One is output per acre and the other is output per person in active agricultural employment.  In order to put the output per hectare&mdash;we speak about hectares in this report&mdash;on a comparable basis the report uses an expression &ldquo;hectare of arable equivalent&rdquo;. That makes allowance for the fact that an acre of rough mountain grazing is not the same as an acre of good arable land in a good pasture area.  Consequently it squeezes down the acreage of rough mountain pasture to get a comparable amount of typical arable acreage.  By making that allowance it compares as regards the different countries, the net output per hectare of &ldquo;arable equivalent&rdquo; and in that comparison among the 14 countries I regret to say Ireland comes 14th.</P>
    <P>You may be interested to have a record of the figures given on page 18 of that report.  In 1950 the value of net output per hectare in U.S. dollars was as following for the countries concerned: Netherlands, $377; United Kingdom, $156; Denmark, $226; Finland, $130; Ireland $85.  Of course statistics can be very misleading and there may be qualifications and modifications that ought to be made but there they are on record and they are certainly a challenge to us.</P>
    <P>The other comparison is the net output per head of active agricultural population.  In this comparison we <Col N="497" /> come out rather better because it is characteristic of our whole history in the last 50 or 100 years that we seem to have the same physical output of agricultural produce with a gradually diminishing man-power employed in obtaining it, with the result that the output per man continues to increase whereas the output per acre remains painfully and continuously static.  The recent increase in the output per head of active agricultural population is in the main the result of the reduction in the number of persons employed in agriculture.</P>
    <P>Here are the figures for net output per head of active agricultural population in 1950:&mdash;United Kingdom, $1,550; Denmark, $1,200; Netherlands, $850; Ireland, $550; Italy, $350.  So you see we are well above Italy, but we are only little more than half the Netherlands achievement and about half the Danish achievement and about one-third of the United Kingdom achievement, so as Senator Baxter argues there is room for considerable improvement of our output per head in agriculture as well as in our output per acre.</P>
    <P>The British, in the course of the last 15 years, since 1938, appear to have increased the volume of their agricultural output up to 1950 by some 41 per cent., and I think in recent years the increase is of the order of 50 per cent. I am not saying that there are not certain excuses for our failure to increase the volume of output, and I am quite aware of the fact that there were high and very attractive prices paid to British farmers and every possible facility given to them which enabled them and encouraged them to achieve that remarkably high output; but all the same I do say that if we could have increased the volume of agricultural output by anything like the percentage that was achieved in the United Kingdom there would now be less rural depopulation to deplore in our country, and I think less housing congestion in Dublin and in the larger cities, and less of a transport problem, because transport capacity would have been used more up to its maximum possible amount instead of <Col N="498" /> the present situation where we have far more transport than things to carry in it.</P>
    <P>Now, if you ask me why we did not manage to increase agricultural output in the course of the last 15 years, various answers could be given, and I am not going to commit myself to any one answer rather than another.  Some people say lack of capital on the part of the farmers of the country generally. Well, if what our agriculture primarily needs is fresh capital, was it not a pity that when there was an influx of fresh capital coming in in the form of Britons and North of Ireland people buying Irish farms and settling over here that that influx of fresh capital was stopped by the imposition of a 25 per cent. tax on property acquired by non-Irish citizens?  I think it was really a sign of lack of national self-confidence that we stopped that influx in the way we did when in accordance with our finest historical traditions we should have made it our business to absorb those people and make them more Irish than the Irish themselves.</P>
    <P>Further, if you want fresh capital in the form which could not possibly give rise to any balance of payments difficulties you can get it by abolishing that 25 per cent. tax and giving citizens of the neighbouring island exactly the same right to buy property over here that we enjoy if we want to go to buy property in Britain.</P>
    <P>Others might say lack of enterprise, other people might say lack of markets or proper marketing organisation, or the absence of sufficiently attractive prices, and so on.  Other people might say maldistribution of population with reference to agricultural resources&mdash;in other words, the old problem of agricultural congestion in the West, and the problem we have intensified ourselves, lack of adequate manpower for agriculture in the best agricultural districts in the centre of the country.  Again, other people might say that the principal sinner is the wrong-headed policies pursued and administered by the Department of Agriculture.  The principal advocate of that theory is a writer in the pages of the <i>Irish Times,</i> Mr. P.F. Quinlan, who happens to be president of the <Col N="499" /> Young Farmers' Club movement and in some ways he is a pretty important factor in what I might call agricultural politics.</P>
    <P>I am not going to say which of these various theories is right, but I do suggest that, sooner or later, the Department of Agriculture will have to face the problem of the dual-purpose cow.  On the face of it, it is absurd that the dairying industry should be expected to produce the raw material of the beef cattle industry of the rest of the country and in the process of doing so be content with cows which give an average of 200 to 300 gallons a year less than they could get if they went in for a pure bred dairy breed. That is a matter which requires further looking into and further justification, and I am not saying that I side with either one side or the other, but I do think that the time has come when the matter will have to be inquired into very seriously and very objectively.</P>
    <P>Most of all, I would suggest that we need a kind of agricultural survey, not only of our agricultural land but of our farmers, the people who own the land; and I would like that survey to be carried out by the Department of Agriculture, under whose auspices, I suppose, it should be carried out, with the fullest co-operation of such bodies as the co-operative movement, the young farmers' clubs and the local county agricultural committees with their expert personnel; the final result of that survey should be to grade the farmers of Ireland into at least three classes&mdash; Grade A, Grade B and Grade C.  Now, I do not know in the least what area of land or what proportion of farmers would qualify for the Grade A category, but I suspect that it would be something of a shock to public opinion to find how large a proportion of our farmers of every size of farm and how much acreage of land was owned and exploited or misused by farmers of the C grade or even the C 3 grade.  It is a question of ascertaining the facts in a perfectly judicial and objective way, putting that on record with a view to creating a more healthy public opinion about the responsibility of <Col N="500" /> every kind of farmer for making the best use of his land in the national interest as well as in his own.</P>
    <P>Now, if the survey did that&mdash;grading every one of our farmers into one or other of these three classes&mdash;and you could go further if you like and have A1, A2, A3, and down to C1, C2 and C3 &mdash;having got that I would then lay down as an absolute principle that any farmer of the Grade A and Grade B classes had an absolute right of security of tenure and under no circumstances could he be deprived of his land by the operation of any of the powers possessed by the Land Commission.  On the other hand the Grade C farmers, whether they had 1,000 acres or ten acres, should be absolutely subject to the powers of the Land Commission and even to increased powers which should be used with reference to their land with a view to bringing about a more efficient use of the national agricultural resources.</P>
    <P>In fact, the power of the Land Commission to expropriate land should be confined to the Grade C farmers, and while still retaining such provision as may be necessary in order to relieve congestion I would like to see recognised a new category of claimants for land that is taken up by the Land Commission with, of course, adequate compensation even to the C3 farmers. I should like to see new categories of landless men recognised as worthy claimants for farms of that kind thus made available by the Land Commission. I am thinking especially of what I might call surplus sons of efficient successful farmers who have not got enough land of their own to provide an adequate outlet for the energies of all their sons and who have not got capital enough to buy land for these surplus sons.</P>
    <P>One of the qualifications for acquiring these new holdings made available by the Land Commission should be that the landless man in question, the surplus son of a hard-working farmer, should, if possible, be a diligent and successful student of an agricultural college.  That should be one of the principal qualifications for obtaining access to one of these new farms.  I am not suggesting that the Land Commission <Col N="501" /> should transfer that new farm to him on the usual terms.  I should like to see the Land Commission remain the owner on behalf of the State of these ex-C grade farms that have been expropriated&mdash;the Land Commission, in fact, entering into the position of a landlord with reference to all that land and performing all the functions that, under a good landlord system, a landlord has performed with great success in other countries.  Consequently, the land would be made available to the new type of landless man at a rent which would cover the actual cost of making that land available so that no burden whatever would fall on the general taxpayer.</P>
    <P>An important principle is involved here.  If we must use the powers of the State to expropriate land or anything else, let us expropriate that land in the interests of the community as a whole and not use the powers of the State in order to rob Peter to pay Paul &mdash;to plunder one section of the population in order to enrich another.  I suspect that some of the operations of the Land Commission in the past have had the effect of robbing Peter to pay Paul and have not made any positive contributions to the welfare of the State as a whole.  However, we will let that pass: it is ancient history.  I should like to say that any further increase in the value of the land that might arise from economic circumstances should redound to the advantage of the State as a whole rather than go into the pockets of the private proprietors of that land which had been made available to them by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Under present conditions, if a farmer gets land on the annuity principle of gradually purchasing it, he profits by the unearned increment of the land and the State is making a present to him of an unearned capital increment. But, by the State becoming the landlord of this C grade land and letting it on a lease to desirable tenants, the State would retain ultimate ownership and would profit by any change in the value of land which, unfortunately, now goes solely into the pockets of the fortunate private owner.  There is here an interesting application of the principles advocated by Michael Davitt.  Mostly, <Col N="502" /> we regard Michael Davitt as the spiritual father of the whole present system of land tenure which, according to Senator O'Brien, has successfully solved the problem of land tenure in Ireland.  I do not, however, agree with him in that regard.</P>
    <P>I have in my hand a paper on &ldquo;Michael Davitt and the British Labour Movement&rdquo; published by Professor T.W. Moody F.T.C.D., in the <i>Journal of the Royal Historical Society,</i> 5th Series, Volume 3, 1953. Michael Davitt is called &ldquo;father of the Land League&rdquo;, but by no means have his ideals triumphed in the solution of the land tenure problem.  Let me quote a sentence from this paper which gives a general idea of Michael Davitt's concept of what the State should be in its economic relationships:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No one can say absolutely what is and what is not the duty of the State.  It is for every successive generation in any given community to say what duties shall be discharged independently by individuals or collectively by the State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That quotation is taken from one of Davitt's works&mdash;<i>Leaves from a Prison Diary,</i> ii. 128.  Dr. Moody goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The battle-cry of the Land League, &lsquo;the land of Ireland for the people of Ireland&rsquo;, meant to Irish farmers their own conversion into owners, and this was in fact what the land war eventually brought about.  But Davitt was in passionate revolt against the whole institution of private property in land.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;....Davitt argued that the mere multiplication of landowners through State-aided land-purchase would not remove the evils inherent in the private ownership of land, and in particular that it would help neither the agricultural labourers nor the industrial workers.  &lsquo;By what right are the public funds to be utilised for the benefit of a section of the community merely?&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The above question which is quoted by Professor Moody is also taken from Davitt's <i>Leaves from a Prison Diary</i>, <Col N="503" /> ii. 99.  I should like to echo that cry not only with reference to housing but also with reference to Land Commission policy.  However, we must be realistic.  We must admit that the principle of private property in land and the ownership of it by hundreds of thousands of individual Irish farmers has triumphed and is now part and parcel of the set-up that we must be content to carry on.</P>
    <P>I realise, so far as A and B grade farms are concerned, that that principle must be fully respected.  But the other farmers&mdash;especially the C 3 grade of farmers&mdash;whatever size of farm they possess should be liable to expropriation with compensation and the State should retain the ultimate ownership of this land thus capturing the increment of value, if any should occur, after the State had acquired it.</P>
    <P>As I said before it should be let on a long lease at an economic rent that would fully cover the annual cost of providing that land to new categories of landless men.  I have in mind especially what I have called surplus sons of successful farmers&mdash;preferably those who have gone to an agricultural college and done well at an agricultural college.  It is one of the characteristics of our agricultural education that not all the places in agricultural colleges are filled: not enough farmers think it worth their while to go there.  There ought to be some encouragement, some reward to those farmers' sons who are willing to undertake the exertions and the study involved in going to one of these agricultural colleges.</P>
    <P>I think a willingness to get married would also be an important qualication for these future farmer-tenants of the Land Commission.  Also, of course, the type of person I have in mind would be a farmer's son who had capital enough to stock a farm but had not capital enough to buy land.  As a matter of fact with the present extraordinarily high price of farm land, any farmer who buys land is incurring a very serious risk&mdash;the risk that the capital value of that land may fall very considerably in the course of the next ten years.  That is a reason which would deter any cautious-minded <Col N="504" /> young farmer from buying land if he could possibly avoid it and a reason why he should welcome the possibility of acquiring land from the State on a lease of a sufficiently long tenure.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion I will make is derived from Danish experience. Apparently, in Denmark, the custom is for the sons of farmers to work as farm labourers on farms other than the farms their fathers own.  The farmer therefore has to pay the full usual agricultural wage to the workers whom he employs, who are simply the sons of neighbouring farmers, and there is a kind of interchange between the families in the different farming districts.  Our custom is completely different.  The farmer with numerous sons expects these sons to work for him for nothing, or perhaps for a half-crown given occasionally to go to the pictures or go to a football match. That is a very demoralising situation for both the farmer and the farmer's sons and may be one of the reasons why emigration from the land is so prominent a feature of our present social circumstances.</P>
    <P>I am not foolish enough to imagine that you can revolutionise the social customs of the Irish rural scene overnight, but I suggest that if we could bring about any such fluidity of the working population as between different farmers, it would have a very healthy social effect and, in particular, might help to solve the late marriage problem, because farmers' sons, work ing on the farms of neighbouring farmers, would be brought into close association with the daughters of that neighbouring farm which would be a very good idea.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that something of that kind might be a remedy for emigration, as well as a remedy for rural depopulation and a remedy also for the low marriage rate; but above all, if the improvement in the quality of the farmers exploiting what is now C grade land were brought about, it would have a most desirable effect in improving the <Col N="505" /> low average output per acre to which I drew attention earlier.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect of the agricultural scene to which I should like briefly to refer, that is, the rigidity of agricultural wages which are determined by the Agricultural Wages Board in accordance with the law&mdash;a certain minimum fixed which puts a legal obligation on every employer employing farm workers.  I think that that very rigidity is, in two ways, the cause of agricultural unemployment, because, for one thing, the farmer who has need of more than two or three workers, because he has to pay perhaps more than he is worth to the less efficient of his workers, feels unable to pay as much as he is worth to the most efficient of his workers, and, that being so, the fellow who is really highly efficient and worth far more than the minimum wage becomes discontented and is apt to emigrate.  On the other hand, if there was more fluidity in the wage relationship, it would be humanly possible, and even probable, that the farmer, having to pay only what he is really worth to the less efficient of his workers, would be disposed to pay a much higher wage in order to keep the more efficient of his workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When there is a minimum wage fixed, a farmer has to consider whether the fellow he is thinking of employing is really worth that wage or not.  If he thinks he is not, he will not employ him, and so it may be that the rigidity of that minimum wage becomes a reason, from the point of view of the employer, why he should not employ certain people and they, in turn, become unemployed although, if they had been content to accept a lesser wage, or if the farmer had been legally entitled to give a lesser wage, they might have found employment at home at a wage which really corresponded to their agricultural merit.  The really important thing, however, is that there should be a gradation of wages which would reflect the relative efficiency of the workers of every grade, and freer bargaining as between agricultural workers and agricultural employers and less of this rigidity which, I think, <Col N="506" /> is the cause of unemployment in present conditions.</P>
    <P>In a general way, what I should like to do would be to create a public opinion which was less sympathetic to the down-and-out, the unfortunate and the inefficient and a good deal more sympathetic and encouraging to the fellow who is making a really efficient use of his agricultural resources and is a good man not only for himself but for his country.  I think it is almost a national vice that we are unduly sympathetic to the unfortunate, even in cases where the misfortune is largely the fault of the victim, and that we are too envious of the successful when we ought rather to be inclined to admire the successful and hardworking type and wish him continued good luck.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach announced recently that he intended to remit rates for a period of years on new buildings connected with industry and commerce.  I should like an assurance from the Minister that that principle will also be applied to new farm buildings, because it is frightfully necessary that farmers should be encouraged in every legitimate way to improve the layout and structure of their existing buildings, and, behind it all is the principle that the engine of public taxation, which must necessarily act as a disincentive to some extent, should as far as possible be modified in such a way as to penalise inefficiency and reward the efficient.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickSummerfield" hpid="Mr. Summerfield Mr. Summerfield">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had in the course of this debate some very long speeches and some speeches that covered practically every phase of our economic life.  In contrast with these speeches, mine is going to be short and confined to one or two important matters. First, I should like to say how delighted industrialists generally were to hear from the Minister in the Dáil that he proposed to set up a special sub-committee to investigate the effect of direct taxation on industry generally. We hope that committee will get into action soon and do useful work.  More recently, we have had a statement by the Taoiseach that, in order to stimulate industrial activity, remissions of rates and other matters <Col N="507" /> of importance to people about to speculate their money are being considered by the Government.  This is doing something which has been pressed by all the organised industrial bodies on this Government and its predecessors.</P>
      <P>Senator Baxter in the course of his remarks referred to industrial activity and I think he said he knew of no reason why industries here should not export, as was the case elsewhere.  At the outset, I am happy to tell him&mdash;I can prove it, if he wishes&mdash;that quite a number of industries in this country are doing a worthwhile export trade. These are industries in which the nature of the article made and the quantity of the production gives them that volume which, first of all, is essential to a really economic competitive price.</P>
      <P>We have to remember that in the other industries where there is no export the reasons largely lie in the fact that the domestic consumption of that particular article is too small. Furthermore, the raw materials situation is too difficult.  I would say this, and perhaps surprise the House, that, generally speaking, the wage content of articles made in this country is too high.  It is not a matter of wages.  I am not saying that the trade unions have forced up wages too high, but I am saying that they forced up wages too high in relation to the output of the factories where the men are employed. It can be shown that there is a recession of trade and a shortening of employment simply because the wage content of the article has made it too dear for the Irish market, not to speak of the export market.  The sooner we understand that, the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any man connected with industry deplores the sight of able-bodied men walking about the streets of Dublin or any other part of Ireland.  If we accept, as we must, that it is the duty of the State to see that none of its citizens starve, surely it is the duty of all able-bodied citizens who expect assistance from the State to do something in return for the money that is spent on keeping them going?  I have heard it <Col N="508" /> argued that it would be too totalitarian for the State to say, so far as able-bodied men are concerned: &ldquo;There is work for you on the bogs&rdquo; or &ldquo;There is work for you here and there.  You have to do that in return for the sustenance the State is prepared to give.&rdquo;  I do not know whether that is so totalitarian or not, but at any rate it appeals to me and I think it should be done.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuire dealt with private enterprise.  All things considered, over the past 30 years private enterprise, bearing in mind all the handicaps peculiar to this country, has already justified itself as something that ought to be supported by everybody in the State.  A lot is heard about the profitable industries.  Some of us have bitter recollections of the early speculators who fell by the wayside, but it was from their mistakes that many others built up the industries which to-day form so important a part of our economy.  Whilst I am sometimes accused of being supersensitive when criticism is hurled at Irish industry, I think the nation ought to be pleased that private speculative industry is still as vigorous as it is where people are expected to invest their own money without any surety of a market.  The only thing they are sure of is that they would be highly criticised if they do not conform to certain standards set up by their critics.</P>
    <P>Was Senator Johnston really serious in chiding the Government with putting a heavier purchase tax on the purchase of property here by non-nationals? I was amazed when I heard him suggest that.  He knows, as many of us know, that why the Government put on that higher purchase tax on non-nationals was because money, much more easily got than we could get it, was coming into this country by the boatload&mdash;money described as &ldquo;hot&rdquo; money.  What was it used for?  Without that purchase tax the mere Irishman could not have held on to the land he had and could not acquire any other.  The price of property went up because these people were determined to come and live here under better conditions than they had <Col N="509" /> left and to acquire Irish property at any price.  I am only sorry that in many cases they were able to get round that purchase tax with the connivance of people in this country.  Do not let it be assumed that the tax is a matter in relation to which the Government should feel guilty.  We ought to compliment them.</P>
    <P>In the course of the many arguments during the debate, reference was made to the standard of living in this country.  Listening to some Senators, one would imagine that we were all living in sackcloth and ashes.  I have experience of many industrial countries and I wonder can it be denied that in recent years the standard of living in this country has gone up by leaps and bounds in proportion to the wage paid?  I wonder is there any other country where such a big proportion of the wages is expended on nonessentials and on leisure of one kind or another?  I am not saying this is wrong, but I say that if that connotes a certain high standard of living, then let us drop the argument that the standard of living has receded rather than progressed.</P>
    <P>The cost of Government is something that we ought to deplore.  The Government itself deplores it.  I accept the statement of the Minister that he was greatly concerned with the matter and was going to achieve economies where most of us feel economies have to be effected.  We cannot ignore the recent statement of a Parliamentary Secretary that there is a 20 per cent. redundancy in the Civil Service.  We all know, as working people, that a 20 per cent. redundancy cannot be got rid of overnight.  If that statement is true, it means that we can, and should, expect from the Government a very considerable reduction in the cost of administering the State.  We should leave the Government to carry out the promises they indicated.</P>

      <P>The Minister was always a great fisherman.  He carries a pocketful of red herrings.  On the 10th March last Dáil Eireann ordered to be printed a Bill known as the Valuation Bill, 1953.  The Minister, for some reason, perhaps it is because he is not as modest as I thought he was, appears anxious that I should not deal with the subject.  The Valuation Bill of 1953 was introduced in Dáil Eireann as a Private Members' Bill by three members of the Fine Gael Party.  It provides in Section 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Save and except in the case of the improvement or enlargement of any building or the erection of a new building the valuation of a tenement shall not be increased.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It is before the House in a way the Senator does not like.  In other words, the section provides that no increases of valuation may take place in connection with premises except there is an enlargement or improvement.  Section 3 goes on to provide that in cases where a revaluation is made, because the buildings are enlarged or improved, there will be a remission in respect of those buildings for at least seven years.  Section 4 of the Bill makes similar provision&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The only development of note since this House last discussed the question of Government policy was an announcement which appeared on the Sunday papers by the Taoiseach.  I do not know if the Taoiseach had the assistance of the Minister for Finance with regard to the law relating to rates remissions when he made this announcement, but we find it here reported in the <i>Sunday Independent.</i> It is reported also in the official Government paper, the <i>Sunday Press</i> and it was reported in the daily papers on Monday.  It is a statement by the Taoiseach which starts off by saying:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Government were examining the possibilities of increasing the existing inducements to commercial and industrial firms and had already decided in principle on a scheme of subsidising remission of rates on new buildings and on buildings which had been improved and revalued.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would ask Senator Summerfield to bear in mind that a particular Bill which I am not allowed to mention was introduced into Dáil Eireann last week.</P>

      <P>No wonder the Minister is cowering.  Apparently this new child was ten years old according to some Senators and even older according to others.  This is what Senators opposite proclaim as the new charter of industrial freedom.  This is what the Minister for Finance and his leader hold out as the new Fianna Fáil plan.  This is what the members of the Government have decided is what is needed, and all that is needed, to solve all the ills produced by Government policy over the last two years. This is the Fianna Fáil solution to the unemployment question.  This is the Fianna Fáil solution to the trade depression. Senator Summerfield says it was suggested three months ago by the chambers of commerce.  It is a fact, whether the Minister wants to admit it or not, that it is introduced in the form of a Bill into Dáil Éireann already.  I am not criticising the Taoiseach for his conversion to this particular point of policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>Are you criticising the <i>Independent</i> for publishing it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been accused of various things, but even my mind could not keep track of Senator Quirke's assertions there.  I just do not follow them.  I am not criticising the <i>Independent</i> for publishing it. What I am saying is that it is very welcome that the Taoiseach and the Minister have been converted to the point of view expressed in the statement. Do not let Senator Summerfield, Senator Hartnett or Senator Johnston get the idea into their heads that this was some new miracle of the Fianna Fáil financial wizard.  It is not.  It is not necessary for the Government to do anything about it, other than give Government time for the discussion of the matter which I am not allowed to mention.  If they do that, if they give <Col N="513" /> Government time in the morning, this particular matter which I am not allowed to mention will become law in this country the day after.</P>
      <P>The Bill is there.  It can be passed, if the Government want to pass it. Why is it not done?  Why was it not done at any time from the 10th June to 26th July?  Is not the reason why it was not done that the Minister and his leader wanted to make a show in public, they wanted to put on a bit of a bluff, they wanted to think of something to say and something to put forward as the new Fianna Fáil plan?</P>
      <P>We had a lot of Fianna Fáil plans in the past.  As far as the ordinary people of the country are concerned, normally speaking, I think they have now come to the conclusion that they would like to see Fianna Fáil plans hit and hit hard, before the Fianna Fáil plans hit them.  The Fianna Fáil policy over the last two years is the direct cause of the present situation which the Taoiseach now thinks it is time to remedy.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that the Taoiseach introduced this particular matter in connection with emergency relief schemes at all.  It should not be considered in that light.  Senator Douglas mentioned that the matter was suggested in this House a decade ago.  My view of it is simply that it is an amendment to legislation which should have been carried out a long time ago, which could be carried out in the morning if the Government facilitated it and that it should not be tied up with the Government relief schemes at all.</P>
      <P>Let us get back to this statement of the Taoiseach, the up-to-date Fianna Fáil plan.  What is it?  What is the result of it?  What is the picture we see in front of us?  We see a Fianna Fáil Government which has been in office now, with the exception of the three and a half years of the inter-Party Government, for a period of in or about 18 or 19 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would care to work it out with me? With the exception of a period of three and a half years, the Fianna Fáil Party have been the Government of this State for about 20 years.  We have heard Senator Loughman describing all the boons and benefits which floated to the people from 1932 onwards. In common with other disciples of the Taoiseach and the Minister, the Senator apparently considers that Irish history started in the year 1932.  Be that as it may, it is not my business to give Senator Loughman or anyone else any grind in the history of this country.  However, it is a fact that, with the exception of the three and a half years to which I have referred, the present Government has been in office since 1932.  Over most of that period they had opportunity, without let or hindrance, to implement their policies.  They had a majority over all other Parties in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>They were not, after the last general election, dependent on a handful of votes which could sway them this way or that way.</P>
      <P>During most of the period to which I refer they had a majority in the Dáil which, looking back on it, the Minister for Finance must envy to-day.  At the end of that period what happened?  We have this announcement by the Taoiseach.  After 20 years of Fianna Fáil Government we have relief schemes.  After 20 years of Fianna Fáil Government we have an admission by the head of the State that the employment problem is such that exceptional measures are required.  That is the sum total of Fianna Fáil achievement over the long period which they have been in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunately necessary that relief schemes, emergency schemes, of this sort should be adopted to-day.  I doubt if any of us believe that the statement of policy made by the Taoiseach will be sufficient to meet the very real problem which has been created by the Minister for Finance over the last two years.  I have read the Taoiseach's statement very carefully <Col N="515" /> and there is reference to very few matters by way of solution for the present position.  One of the matters to which he refers is this question of rates remission.  I am glad he is doing that. I believe that, in the long run, it will have an effect in business circles.  It will ease&mdash;but only in the long run&mdash; the question of unemployment.  It will not have any immediate effect and there is nothing in the Taoiseach's announcement to show that the point of view suggested by Senator Johnston is in contemplation by the Government.</P>
    <P>What else was in this statement? The Taoiseach announced that the Fianna Fáil Government have apparently persuaded their masters to permit them to proceed with a scheme of spending something in the region of £4,000,000 on the civil servants' quarters in Dublin Castle.  I believe if this money is going to be spent in that way it will be ill-spent.  If the Government propose spending £4,000,000 for the relief of unemployment there are many more worthwhile projects which will occur to the mind of any Senator in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Other Senators who are more interested in rural areas will immediately tell Senator Hartnett that the land project should be proceeded with as it was intended it should be proceeded with.  If I and other Senators can think of such projects I am sure Senator Hartnett can think of many more.  To spend the money in the way in which the Taoiseach and the Government have decided to spend it will be fruitless and of very little value.  I believe&mdash;although I may be wrong in this; I presume the Government have had their expert advisers on the subject&mdash;that the labour content in the work of repairing, redecorating or renovating Dublin Castle would be very much smaller than the <Col N="516" /> labour content on ordinary building work, on road work and on other schemes that many of us could think of.</P>
      <P>The first part of this statement of policy is devoted to an apologia for the activities of the Minister for Finance over the last couple of years.  One of the matters mentioned by the Taoiseach&mdash;and this is put forward seriously by the head of the Government as one of the reasons, if not one of the main reasons, for the unemployment situation to-day&mdash;is that there was some delay about a drainage scheme on the north side of the city.  I wonder did Senators ever hear anything more ridiculous than that?  Is it not a fact that the present unemployment situation has been created because of the policy of the Minister for Finance, because the Minister for Finance set himself in the last two years to implement the recommendations contained in the Report of the Central Bank of Ireland.  One of these recommendations amounted, by implication at any rate, to a suggestion that there should be created in this country a pool of unemployment.  That has been implemented very fully by the policy of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>I suppose I should apologise to Senator Loughman for getting back to what he described as the bread and butter line.  Senator Loughman said he was delighted that Senator Stanford had gone outside the bread and butter line.  I think his delight was born of relief.  Senator Loughman probably has a lot in common with the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>I am quite sure the Minister for Finance was also delighted that Senators tended to get away from the bread and butter line. I propose coming back to the bread and butter line.  Before I do so I think I should say that I deplore the statements made by Senator Loughman in relation to the spending of money on public buildings as against spending it on the poor and the unemployed in our cities.  Senator Loughman possibly did not intend to say what he said but his remarks, as I have noted them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is unnecessary to go over in full the effect of the present Minister's policy over the last 12 months.  Senators have had an opportunity already, and I have availed myself of it, of discussing the question of food subsidies.  That was one of the ways in which the Minister increased the cost of living.  The increase in the rate of bank interest was another. The restriction of bank credit possibly had the most serious effect of all in creating the present unemployment situation in the country.  Now the Minister for Finance, I think, has never denied that he set out to implement and did implement the report of the Central Bank of Ireland for the year ended 31st March, 1951.  I am aware, as other Senators are aware, that several of his colleagues have stated that it was Government policy while noting the report of the Central Bank to pursue a course diametrically opposed to the recommendations made by the Central Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we look back for a moment on the main recommendations made by the Central Bank we will find whether the Minister for Finance, who has obstinately <Col N="518" /> refused to say whether he set out to implement it, or his colleagues who said for him that he was bypassing this report, was right.  One of the recommendations made in the general review appears on page 13 of the report, and this is the recommendation which I say suggested the creation of an unemployment pool.  The third paragraph, the second half of paragraph 17 on page 13, reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The public works programme differs from some other elements of State expenditure in being largely discretionary thereby affording special opportunity for the exercise of a policy of contraction or expansion as economic circumstances may require.  It is commonly accepted as an expedient for coping with problems of depression, especially unemployment. In view of the unusually favourable state of employment for a considerable time past there is the less need at present for the artificial stimuli provided by such a programme especially as prevailing high costs cause it to encroach rapidly on resources which may be badly needed at a later time when conditions afford more justification for this expedient.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And then it goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The general character of much of these works has been such as to place a strain on the balance of payments in several aspects.  They have, for example, entailed the immediate import of materials and equipment; they have through their labour content created a demand for imported as well as other consumer goods.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister has ever set out to explain the meaning of that particular recommendation, but so far as I can see&mdash;I am not talking as an expert on these matters&mdash;the plain and simple meaning of that recommendation is that because of the unusually favourable state of employment for the past few years it would be well to let it slacken off for a while, because the more employment and the better the wages paid, the more demand there will be for consumer goods, and that some of those will have to be imported. <Col N="519" /> If that is the true meaning of that recommendation there is no doubt whatever but that the Minister, in implementing his policy, certainly succeeded in implementing that recommendation of the Central Bank as well.</P>
    <P>The second principal recommendation made was that in relation to food subsidies.  We know what the Minister did in relation to food subsidies.  He certainly carried out that recommendation.</P>
    <P>The third recommendation of importance was that there should be a policy of restraint in wages.  It is only necessary to think back over the past few months, to think of the Civil Service arbitration, to know whether or not the Minister implemented that portion of the Central Bank report.</P>
    <P>The fourth principal recommendation was that there should be increased restriction of bank credit for non-essential and less urgent purposes.  I do not think that any member of the House will doubt but that that recommendation has been adopted in full by the present Government.</P>
    <P>At the time that particular report came out members of the Opposition&mdash; the Leader of the Opposition and members of all Parties opposed to the Government&mdash;warned the Government not to implement the recommendations contained in the report.  They warned the Minister and they warned the Government that if the Government set out to implement those recommendations the result would be a slump in trade and unemployment and emigration. The Minister ignored those warnings, and it is because he ignored those warnings that you now have the Taoiseach announcing emergency relief schemes.</P>
    <P>So far as Senators in the Party to which I belong are concerned, we will welcome any step taken by the Government which will genuinely increase employment, which will reduce the hardships which have been imposed by Government policy, although I do not believe that the steps announced by the Taoiseach will meet the situation adequately.  Although I am convinced that there is an element of bluff <Col N="520" /> in the statement by the Taoiseach, nevertheless, as far as I am concerned and as far as others in the Fine Gael Party are concerned we are glad to see that even now at the eleventh hour of their existence the Government are making some effort to remedy the damage which they have caused to this country.</P>
    <P>It may be that the Taoiseach's announcement is the swan song of the present Government.  Many, apart from myself, will hope that that is so. Whether it is or not we hope that it shows the first glimmering of returning sanity in the field of financial policy on the part of the present Minister and his colleagues.  I hope that the expectations of the Taoiseach will be fulfilled, although I doubt it.  I doubt if sufficient energy, sufficient enthusiasm, exist in the Fianna Fáil Party to solve the problems which exist to-day and which are entirely of their own making.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>This Finance Bill is rather unusual because it is rarely, I think, that a second Vote on Account is applied for in the Dáil and, consequently, finds its way here into the Seanad; but at least it gives Senators an opportunity of debating general Government policy, giving our criticisms or our praise, if we have either to give, as the case may be, on this measure. For my own part, I do not intend to delve too deeply into financial affairs because I feel that I would not be as competent, perhaps, as other Senators who have made it their job and their profession; but my intention will be to point out, as far as I know, the state of affairs in rural Ireland and particularly amongst the agricultural community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister in his statement that there is a 20 per cent. redundancy in the Civil Service.  From my knowledge of the Civil Service since I came into politics&mdash;and I am sure that every Senator and Deputy who would speak his mind openly would say the same&mdash;the redundancy is not 20 per cent. but 50 per cent. so far as delayed action tactics are concerned. However, it would be unjust to blame the civil servants for that.  A fortnight ago, Senator P.F. O'Reilly mentioned here, among other things, that there has been a tremendous amount of legislation <Col N="521" /> in this country over the past 25 years.  I will take off my hat to the average civil servant&mdash;no matter how long he has been in Government employment&mdash;who would be able to peruse that legislation, to grade it and to get through it so that the work he would have to do could be done in any sort of a speedy manner.</P>
    <P>I agree that there is a redundancy somewhere in the Civil Service, but I do not think it would be fair to blame civil servants for this redundancy, because the amount of legislation which they are asked to go through, to simplify and to apply to the everyday affairs of this country, is entirely too complicated.  The sooner some effort is made to codify that legislation, the better from the point of view of expediting the everyday affairs of the country as a whole.  Despite all that, I think that a small amount of speed could be introduced and a small amount of this redundancy removed. I may be wrong, but I think that the only way we can now get rid of redundancy in the Civil Service is to start a probe into the work of the Civil Service and to relieve certain individuals of their employment.  Of course, that would add still further to the number of unemployed who have been marching through the streets and, anyhow, I doubt whether it is a method that the Government could adopt or put into effect.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, we must remember that the Civil Service is a non-productive body.  It is producing no wealth for the nation: it is totally administrative. An immense amount of money is finding its way into the Civil Service every year for the purpose of administrative work&mdash;work which is not in any way productive&mdash;and we must begin to wonder whether we are going to take cognisance of the position.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Central Fund Bill is to provide £30,000,000 odd to enable the Civil Service to carry on for the next three months.  We find that some of the Estimates and some of the Government services which have not been discussed in the Dáil require to be criticised and commented on.  The biggest problems facing this <Col N="522" /> country are unemployment and emigration. Because there was no work for the young people there, there has been so much emigration from the western seaboard that now there is practically no unemployment there&mdash; nobody is left there to be unemployed. The Minister may smile and say that that statement is incorrect, but I say that it is the truth.  Last year, the Government introduced the Undeveloped Areas Bill.  In time, that Act may be of some help, but it is not doing what it was boasted it would do &mdash;absorb all the unemployed, or a very fair proportion of them, in those areas. It would take millions of pounds to keep all those people in the whole-time, permanent employment to which they are entitled, not to speak of the amount which is at present devoted to that purpose.</P>
    <P>The inter-Party Government put schemes into effect which would benefit the people of rural Ireland&mdash;schemes which would give the maximum amount of employment with the very minimum of delay.  The inter-Party Minister for Local Government introduced the Local Authorities (Works) Act which was responsible for providing an immense amount of work and, at the same time, for doing an immense amount of good.  The type of drainage carried out under that Act was more or less small drainage of a type which we know well, but of which people who live away from the countryside know very little.  Of the £70,000 or £80,000 which was expended on local authority works in County Mayo, almost the entire amount of that money found its way into the pockets of people who, before that, were unemployed.</P>
    <P>We had gangs of men who were practically assured of nine or ten months' work the whole year round. There was no outlay on machinery or on the different materials that are necessary for the making of roads. Every single penny found its way into the pockets of the people who were earning it there.  That was one scheme which the inter-Party Government devised to absorb the unemployed whose number at that time was drawing pretty close to the red line, in the <Col N="523" /> region of 70,000.  The amount allocated this year for those drainage schemes is practically negligible.  It is not worth the while of a local councillor to submit a scheme&mdash;so few of them could be done in the whole of the Twenty-Six Counties.  Because of that, fewer people will be employed on those schemes and it is not worth our while thinking that any employment can be given in that connection.  Why that should be so I cannot understand, because, as well as giving employment and giving wages and earning power to people who sadly needed it, it was making the land productive.</P>
    <P>Side by side with the Local Authorities (Works) Act was the land project which the inter-Party Government introduced some little time later.  This scheme did not provide as much employment as the Local Authorities (Works) Act so far as man-power is concerned, because a good percentage of the work had to be done, could only be done, by the use of heavy machinery; but they both went together and the completion of one was absolutely essential for the beginning of the other.  Between the two there were gangs of men in all the Twenty-Six Counties engaged in work which was useful, first, from the point of view of providing employment and, secondly, from the point of view of adding to the productivity of the country.  The local authorities' works schemes have practically disappeared and even the land project is now staggering along in such a way that neither farmers nor officials administering it know what is going to happen next or where it is going to end or begin.</P>
    <P>We now have a new idea introduced. We know all about the sale of machinery and I am not going to criticise that.  It is late in the day to talk about its sale, but there are plenty of contractors or people who have bought out this machinery and we know that these people, because of human nature, because of their anxiety to recoup themselves the thousands of pounds they have invested, plenty of which they had to borrow, will not go into the small farmer's land.  These people will be anxious to make the most <Col N="524" /> money they can and to recoup themselves the expenditure involved in the purchase of these machines.  Because of that, in a short space of time, if it is not so at present, the small farmer with two, three, five or ten acres will find it very hard to get any contractor to go in to improve his land or to increase its productivity.</P>
    <P>In addition, we are now told that a new Order has been issued and that, where the cost per acre of rehabilitating any land exceeds £30, neither Department nor contractor will have anything to do with it.  We know that where four or five acres have to be dealt with it will cost more per acre, taking everything into consideration, than would dealing with 50 or 60 acres. The ground of manæuvrability is smaller and generally&mdash;unfortunately for ourselves&mdash;we small farmers are on the worst land and there is much more work to be done per acre, in eight out of ten cases, than on the larger farms. We find now that if it costs more than £30 an acre, we must either do it ourselves, in the hope&mdash;the vain hope in 19 out of 20 cases&mdash;of benefiting under this new scheme where a man does it on his own, or leave it there and forget about increasing its productivity.</P>
    <P>That is the situation at a time when everybody admits that our greatest industry is agriculture.  Everybody looks with a certain amount of pride at the way our imports are being reduced and our exports increased.  Our exports are being increased mainly by our agricultural output and by the marketing of a good article on the world market, a market into which we must go without protection or help and without anything to give us a chance of getting a better grip on it than our neighbour, if he engages in agriculture.  We are doing that and doing it splendidly, I admit.  Whether it is due to hunger all over the world at present, I do not know, but it is to our benefit and, that being so, we should get every single £ and shilling we can get for our farmers out of it, because we never know when the lean years will come and it is only right that they should have a little in hand for the times which may not be so prosperous for agriculture as they are at present.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="525" /> America has so many billion dollars worth of foodstuffs rotting, foodstuffs which they do not know what to do with and we know that, when a huge nation like that has expanded its food production so greatly, sometime or other they will make an effort to cut across our path and bring down the value of our agricultural exports.  In that situation, will we not agree that the greatest help we can give, when the expenditure of public moneys is being considered, is to expend it on the soil and the land of this country which is going to give not a 50 per cent. but a 100 per cent. dividend, as drainage work under the Local Authorities (Works) Act and work under the land project have done over the past year or two?</P>
    <P>At column 555 of Volume 141 of the Dáil Debates, I find a Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Secretary saying this about Local Authorities (Works) Act drainage:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Rushed orders were sent out to every county manager and county engineer to get on with the work, to spend the money anyhow.  They did so, and undoubtedly the gangers were humane men and so were the county engineers.  They could not see their way to put unfortunate men down in the bottom of a river to cart up the &lsquo;spoil&rsquo;.  They skimmed in the brinks and threw the soil down into the flood and as a result in two years the river was worse than before they started.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is wrong.  I do not care what anybody says or whatever criticism is sought to be levelled at the Local Authorities (Works) Act, I have never in my county seen any of that, and the County Galway man who said that will find it very hard to justify it.  I was surprised that the individual concerned should have made such a statement, knowing well, as a practical farmer, that no engineer&mdash;the county engineer in Galway any more than any other&mdash; would allow the sides to be cut down into the river and left there.  That is a statement that should not be made, and it is definitely untrue.</P>
    <P>It is not the intention of the Government, in spending money for the relief of existing unemployment, to spend <Col N="526" /> it on the further development of agriculture, but on an idea which has come into the mind of the present Government&mdash;the renovation of Dublin Castle.  I wonder why would they have said 25 years ago about Dublin Castle. Do you not think that money could be spent on any other project around Dublin to give employment rather than on the renovation of Dublin Castle, for civil servants' quarters?  We are told that we have redundancy in the Civil Service, and, in the next breath, we are asked to spend a couple of million of pounds renovating the establishment in which they work.</P>
    <P>With regard to the unemployed and the 90,000 people who are supposedly unemployed at present, I will say, in all fairness, that the figure we have does not and never did represent the actual number of people who are unemployed. There are generally more registered unemployed than are willing and able to accept work.  We can always take a percentage off the figure as representing the people who are not capable of, or not available for work of a certain kind.</P>
    <P>We know that over the years there has been a rush from the countryside to Dublin City.  We did our best to stem that and to keep the people at work on the land, and although we succeeded to a great extent, there is still a rush.  I suppose there always will be.  Instead of the Government spending millions on Dublin Castle, they should endeavour to get those people out of Dublin City and bring them back to the countryside from which they came and provide them with work which would be productive from the point of view of agriculture. If the millions were spent on agricultural work they would find their way almost entirely into the pockets of the workers.</P>
    <P>With regard to grants in connection with the development of tourist roads, no county councillor, no matter who he is or whom he represents, will utter one word against any free money coming into a county.  I, for one, would not have the slightest objection.  When the Local Authorities (Works) Act was enforced the Minister's colleagues had <Col N="527" /> not the slightest notion of saying anything about it because it represented free money coming into different counties.  Tourist roads are not such a pressing problem, in the opinion of the country people, as is ordinary drainage.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why there is such a horrible hostility towards drainage problems on the part of the present Government, having regard to the fact that they must have seen the successful results of drainage schemes carried out by their predecessors.  Yet the Government diverts money from local authority drainage and gives grants towards the development of tourist roads.  Ninety-five per cent. of the people of rural Ireland, irrespective of politics or of how they would vote, would prefer to see this money devoted to drainage and to putting right the drainage schemes so long neglected.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give me some indication as to what is going to be done in regard to the relief of rates during the coming year.  That is a matter which has been agitating the minds of members of the county councils. We were led to believe that we would have the same reliefs from rates as we had over the years past and we struck our rates accordingly.  We then found that we were not to have this relief from rates.  I admit that in County Mayo the burden on the ratepayers is not anything as great as that in other counties.  Nevertheless, this is an extra burden put on certain sections of the agricultural community.  The numbers engaged in agriculture in the County Mayo may not be very big; there are not very many of them, but there are enough to mean that a substantial extra sum would be paid in rates because of the action of the Government. The officials of the county councils proceeded to issue their writs accordingly but now we have another change over.  A new Order is about to come into force whereby credit notes are going to be issued to people so that in the end they will not lose anything extra by way of increased rates.  I do not know whether that is right or wrong but I should like the Minister to say something about the agricultural <Col N="528" /> grant.  I would be very grateful to the Minister if he stated whether the position would be as it was last year or whether we are going to be out of pocket with regard to the agricultural grant.</P>
    <P>As there is a reasonable amount of prosperity in agriculture, now is the time to make the very most out of it. This may not continue for a very long time.  Agriculture over the past 25 years has brought us the most benefits. On that account when we have money to spend on the relief of unemployment I think we should spend it on something which will be to the national benefit as well as relieving unemployment. We all like to see industry helped out and supported in every way, but on the whole if industries had to stand on their own feet in the same manner as agriculture, I think they would be so insignificant that they would not be worth bothering about. At the same time they need and deserve support and protection, but the most important industry, agriculture, should get the most consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister if he would be willing, when he is replying, to give a little more information with regard to the Taoiseach's statement in relation to the possibility of relief of rates where there is a revaluation following repairs. Is that something which could be done by administrative action or would it require legislation?  If the latter, will that legislation be introduced and carried through quickly?  I think the matter is of some importance.  It is very important that we should not go into recess before action is taken and the people informed where they stand. I should be glad if the Minister would clarify the position.</P>

Might I put it to you, Sir, that we have had an <Col N="529" /> exhaustive debate, first to fall, on the last Vote on Account and then on the Finance Bill and there does not seem to be much purpose in covering the ground again?</P>

      <P>I do not wish to avail of the opportunity that this Bill gives of covering the wide field concerning the various services that we could cover but I have been here since a quarter past three and I should like to pass a few observations on the Bill before the Minister replies.</P>
      <P>Last year during the discussions on this measure a member of the Seanad from the opposite side of the House expressed the hope that as a result of the very heavy burden that last year's Finance Bill put on the people the improvement would be such as would make it unnecessary for the Minister to tax the people so heavily this year. Unfortunately, the bill this year is in excess of last year's.  That increase has gone on since the country got control of its own affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>In the efforts to increase employment, honest efforts made by all Governments, by the introduction of new industries, the one important basic industry has been neglected. We have had legislation with an agricultural bias, but the results we all wish to bring about have not been achieved.  In 1946 we passed an Arterial Drainage Act, but up to the present it appears to be in cold store. If it had been implemented after it was passed, much employment would have been given in rural areas, the flight from the land would have been prevented and infertile land would have been put into production.  However, it is good to know that even at this stage something is being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I were asked to suggest what could be done to bring about an improvement in conditions, I would say there should be more co-operation between all Parties.  There is no reason in the world why a Bill or a scheme or <Col N="530" /> a plan emanating from one Party should be denounced in all moods and tenses before it is discussed by the others.  We know that the Works Act to which Senator Commons referred was held up in the Dáil for a long time by many frivolous amendments and did not pass until the season had gone by when it would have brought great benefit throughout the country.  If Governments, inter-Party and Fianna Fáil, can co-operate with the Stormont Assembly on matters of interest to both parties, I do not see why we should have not similar co-operation here.  My interest is to see more co-operation in local government between the Minister and the local bodies. Legislation is introduced frequently which has to be operated by local bodies, without any consultation with them.</P>
    <P>We have experience of large schemes being operated throughout the country at present, and many of us would not mind if we felt that value was being given for the excessive expenditure, but it is most peculiar that in the drafting and supervision of these schemes the engineering staffs in the various counties will not be acceptel by Local Government as competent to draft or supervise housing schemes and water and sewerage schemes.  That has held up many important extensions in several institutions in various counties.  Until we have more co-operation between the Minister responsible and the local bodies, progress will not be what it should be.  We know that the Health Bill has practically gone through the Dáil without any consultation with local bodies that will have to administer it, and the majority of local bodies do not approve of it.  Some time ago, the Taoiseach stated that this country was staggering under the weight of taxation.  I can assert that the rural areas are staggering under the weight of the local rates.  I know one little town of 1,000 population where £4,000 was collected last year in rates and a similar amount in electric light charges.  Trade in that area is practically <i>non est</i>, and if something is not done to bring about a more economic administration of local affairs <Col N="531" /> to restore trade, I see no possibility of the local bodies carrying on.  At the present time, the rates have reached saturation point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard a member of the Lower House say in his maiden speech the other day that the members there spoke too long and too often.  I am afaid that is apposite to our own Chamber nowadays, as unfortunately many of us, trying to catch the eye of the Cathaoirleach all day, have been precluded.  As a result, the Minister has had to wait until now&mdash;unfairly, I think&mdash;to make his reply.  I am not saying that in condemnation of the Chair.  No matter how much we may differ on financial policy, I always feel great sympathy for the Minister for Finance in having to listen here all day to the debate.</P>
      <P>We had some speeches which were quite impartial but did not deal at all with the gist of the Vote on Account. Very few of them contained anything about the effects this will have in a real sense on the national economy.  My difficulty is that I cannot put up an argument that taxation is not just, but I do say that it is too high, considering our total production.  We have a habit of thinking, both here and in the Dáil, that whichever Party is in power and no matter what they put on by way of taxation, it is wrong, it is false and it is a penalty on the people.  We should not approach taxation in that way.</P>

      <P>The Vote is not concerned with taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain portions of this Vote on Account must necessarily come out of taxation.  If you rule me out of order, I accept your ruling.  The greater portion of this £30,000,000 must come out of taxation of one form or another.  The total amount is £103,000,000.  Taking our total national production, agricultural and industrial, it is costing us about one-third to run the country.  I am not standing up as an economist like Senator O'Brien or Senator Johnston, to say that is too much or too little.  As an industrialist, <Col N="532" /> I can say it is affecting industrial development, as we are not allowed to put back into industry moneys which should be put back for its full development. I am not putting up an argument like that of Deputy Commons, on my left, for the farmers, that because that happens to be my particular vocation I ought to get particular blessings. We are still very young in the industrial field and any assistance that can be given to industry will be repaid, not 50 per cent. but 100 per cent. in time.  I am not going to criticise the Minister for the Vote being so high.  I just say it is high.  I may be laughed to scorn, as on all sides of the House we have been developing an omniscient quality of mind, that the people on the other side do not know anything about any of these things.</P>
      <P>The Minister may forgive me if I say that it would be appropriate for him to consider the appointment of a commission consisting of people in outside walks of life, such as economists and businessmen, to discuss with him occasionally the effects of taxation and ways in which the cost of running the country might be lowered.  I know the Minister makes occasional forays to organisations such as our Federation of Manufacturers and to chambers of commerce and that he hears discourses of various sorts.  I have yet to visualise a Minister for Finance of any Party who would come to industry generally or to any organisation and say: &ldquo;I think the country is costing too much to run and this is how I propose to run it at a lower rate.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I remember the Taoiseach saying the country was staggering under the burden of taxation.  I was very glad to hear that honest admission from the Taoiseach.  I do not suppose even the Minister here will refute that in the slightest degree.  I think the matter should be examined in order to see if we can reduce the amount which it is costing to run the country.  The Minister himself should give us a lead in suggesting some means by which that could be accomplished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it very difficult to analyse this Vote on Account to find out how much of the money involved is going into productive employment.  We have a <Col N="533" /> habit of talking glibly about the cost of the Civil Service.  The growth of the Civil Service is the result of our own requests.  As long as people keep asking for services and as long as we have the present Party system the Civil Service will continue to increase. We would have to change the whole system of Government because no Party can afford to refuse to grant improved services if they do not want to be put out of office.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to understand that I am not being critical of him when I draw attention to the cost of Government.  I would ask my friend, Senator O'Brien, if I am wrong when I say that it costs roughly about one-third of our annual turnover to run this country.  How much goes back into productive enterprises or how much is of a wasteful or non-productive character, I do not know.  Instead of discussing the matter with officials of his Department I would like the Minister to consider setting up a commission for the purpose of making recommendations in regard to this matter. It could be composed of people outside the Oireachtas, people with independent points of view who would be as much interested as we are here in putting forward suggestions for the cheaper and better administration of the country.  I am afraid that the amount of money that is going into unproductive enterprises is much more than the amount going into productive enterprises.</P>
    <P>I welcomed the recent statement by the Taoiseach in regard to unemployment and am glad to find that at last the Government have realised that the unemployment situation is serious.  I think it was a most dexterous performance on the part of my friend, the Minister for Finance, when he spoke for over an hour without once referring to the subject of unemployment which had been discussed here.  I and other members stressed it many times and whether it was forethought or good political strategy I admire his dexterity in omitting that one factor.  However, since the Taoiseach accepted the fact that the unemployment situation was serious it would be discourteous on our part if we did not acknowledge that <Col N="534" /> admission.  Whether we agree with the cure, we are glad to see that the effort is being made.  I hope it is the beginning of a more enlightened financial system being operated by the Government side of the House.</P>
    <P>This is a rich country potentially. Money is a mere artificial creation which influences our economy.  An economist in last Sunday's Press said, however, that Ireland at the present time has reached the stage which Canada reached 30 years ago.  He made an impassioned plea to intending Irish emigrants not to leave this country now, that the prospects were greater here to-day than they have been in other countries for many a long day. He pleaded that they should give a chance to the country to prove that living here was worth while.</P>
    <P>I would like to support Senator Stanford in the appeal he made.  I know the Minister can come back on me in this matter because it is an appeal for more money.  It does seem, however, that the cultural aspects of Irish life do not receive the same patronage as other aspects.  While the amounts provided for different Votes may have to be reduced I hope that the amount provided for cultural development will be increased.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see the amount devoted to forestry has been increased but I was sorry to see that the amount for fisheries has been reduced.  I think that is a mistake.  I hope the Fisheries Vote will be brought back to the full amount because that at least is a productive investment.</P>
    <P>I would make a further appeal to the Minister in relation to the encouragement of scientific investigation in this country.  There are quite a number of scientists here, men of good quality who are endeavouring to investigate the possibilities of unexplored potentialities. I would hope that the Minister will see his way to include in some Vote an amount of money to be devoted solely and entirely to scientific investigation.  I understand a certain scientist in this country has made an important discovery in regard to power production which would solve many of our difficulties from that point <Col N="535" /> of view.  The particular scientist has not been able to progress very far because he has not received any assistance either from the State or from any other source.  I hope it will be possible to give assistance and that some amount will be included in the next financial provisions.</P>
    <P>There is one last point I would like to make and that is to appeal to Professor Johnston in his old age not to try to foist on us a new Pale.  He argued to-day that in order to bring back money into the country it would be a good idea to reduce taxation on the purchase of land by non-nationals, to provide facilities so that we could bring in all the Anglo-Irish and foreigners to make them more Irish than the Irish themselves.  I think we have enough Irish at the moment and although I agree with Senator Johnston in regard to many other matters I would ask him not to request us to create a new Pale.  Although the Minister may have done many things with which I do not agree I feel sure he will not do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should reply, first of all, to the question which was put to me by Senator Douglas. The Taoiseach's statement in regard to rates will require legislation to implement, but a statement will be made in the course of the next few days which will make it quite clear that the legislation to be introduced will be retrospective and that persons who, on foot of the Taoiseach's statement, engage in building works or construction works of the kind which he mentioned will be entitled to the rates relief granted under that measure.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I take it that that statement will be made available to us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be a public statement which will be made by the Minister for Local Government within the next few days.  A great deal has been said by Senator Baxter regarding the very disappointing increase which has taken place in agricultural production over the years.  He <Col N="536" /> said that among other things the soil of Ireland is not being fully utilised, at least not to its full potential; but the Senator, when he raises this matter&mdash;and it is a very important matter from the point of view of the economy of the nation&mdash;always talks as though that were an occurrence which was peculiar to this year.  But if he would look back over the figures of the statistics for the volume of gross agricultural output he will find that taking the base in 1938-1939 as 100 the index for the total gross output in the year 1950 was 99.5.  For 1951 it was 98.9 and for 1952 it was 100.5.  I do not want to make any special claim that the Government has been wholly responsible for that.</P>
      <P>As we all know, there are other factors that operate in regard to agricultural production, not the least important of them being the weather conditions during the critical periods; but there are the facts, that if the volume of agricultural output has appeared more or less stagnant in latter years it is not a recent phenomenon by any means.  It has characterised all the years since 1947, and last year, I might say, was the first year in which any appreciable improvement, if one can put it that way, manifested itself.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to get into a long controversy with Senator Baxter in relation to the dairying industry, but when he endeavoured to ascribe to the Government a policy for decontrolling that industry and imputed to us sole responsibility for it I think it is well to have this on record, that representatives of the dairying industry themselves, when they were discussing the question of milk prices before and in negotiations which led to the termination of the milk strike last February, some of them at least indicated that they thought that the industry would be better served if the Government were to remove the controls off it altogether and let the industry operate in a free market.  But there are, of course, two sides to that proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish, as I have said, to enter into controversy with Senator Baxter about it, but it is quite clear, I think, that the people who are engaged in <Col N="537" /> the dairying industry cannot have it two ways.  If the Government, under the existing system, is to come in and act as an arbitrator or an honest broker between the producer on the one hand and the consumer on the other, then all question of withholding milk supplies and all question of engaging in milk strikes will have to be abandoned, because you cannot have arbitration and strike action at the same time.  The two ideas are just not compatible with each other.</P>
    <P>I made a note of what Senator Stanford said in regard to the question of the capitation grants to secondary schools.  Of course, that will involve, as the Senator knows, additional expenditure and perhaps additional taxation, but I will take occasion to call the attention of the Minister for Education to that particular matter, and also to the Senator's plea for an increase in the grant for the National Museum.</P>
    <P>With regard to the travel allowance, the position is that it remains at the figure at which it was fixed early this year, that is to say, at £35.  We have fixed it at that figure because it is necessary in our circumstances to do so, since we have had to face the problem of the balance of payments and to try and conserve to the utmost extent that is possible and reasonable our resources for the time being.  If our production were to increase, if our agricultural and industrial production were to increase and we were exporting in greater quantity and to greater value so that the adverse balance of our visible trade would be reduced, then we could afford to increase the travel allowance.  We may perhaps be in a position to do that next year, but I think that even if it does represent perhaps just £250,000 to us, nevertheless it is a quarter of a million which with other savings we have endeavoured to make and which have perhaps caused greater inconvenience to the public is vital to us in our present situation.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien having quoted the statistics which showed that in the United Kingdom and in the United States and in other countries there had been a substantial increase in the amount of the national income which <Col N="538" /> had been appropriated by the Government for public purposes asked me what the position was in relation to this country.  Well, the position is roughly this, that in 1938 the State and the public authorities between them took about 22.3 per cent. of the national income.  To-day they are taking about 26 per cent. of the national income.  We certainly are not nearly so high as they are in the United Kingdom or in most of the other countries, but we do stand on a level, say, with the United States, which having regard to the fact that ours is primarily an agricultural economy may well be considered to be too high.</P>
    <P>The Seanad is never short of surprises, at least for me, but I think that the greatest surprise of all was to hear Senator O'Brien so strongly advocating resort to gambling as a means for financing the public services.  It is the last passion that I would have ascribed to him.  I would, however, suggest that though what the Senator tells us was quite true, the State does take advantage if you like of the human weaknesses of the majority of our people, their love to have a gamble and make a bet, so that in one way and another we take quite a substantial amount of money out of them in the form of betting tax and again, if you like, in the form of the Hospitals Sweepstake which contributes, of course, as you know in two ways. Under one head it provides a substantial sum for capital investment in hospitals&mdash;I think perhaps a great deal more than Norway secures from its football pools&mdash;and under another head quite a substantial amount to the revenue of the State in the form of stamp duty.  As long as we have the betting tax and the Hospitals Sweepstakes I do not think we should put another competitor in the field.</P>
    <P>I was rather surprised when I heard Senator O'Brien say that the rate at which the last national loan had been issued was unnecessarily high because I think that the Senator must have forgotten the facts in the matter.  You see, it took that loan five days to fill. It was reasonably over-subscribed but we had not to cut down applications <Col N="539" /> by 25 per cent. or by 50 per cent.  We merely managed to secure the £20,000,000 which we were looking for&mdash; £20,000,000, most of which, not all of which, but by far the greater part of which has been invested in reproductive undertakings.  At the present moment the loan is standing at a slight premium.  Apparently, because credit in the country has appreciated over the past 12 months, the Government is to be blamed in some way or other. I wonder what would be the criticism of those who say that the rate was unnecessarily high if the loan, instead of standing at a premium as it is to-day, were standing at a discount.</P>
    <P>I remember the first borrowing operation for which I was responsible: it was when we issued the 3½ per cent. national loan in 1933.  Unfortunately, it did not go to a premium though, during the war, it was standing at par and perhaps carried a slight premium. In the early days, however, it was quoted at a discount.  We had to listen to a barrage of criticism pointing out how the credit of the State was being undermined by the policy of the then Government and all of our critics cited the 3½ per cent. national loan as proof of the statements which they were making.  The Senator suggested that we should float a loan, free of tax, at 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>I am afraid, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, that, in view of the fact that the division bell is ringing for Dáil Éireann, it may be after 10 o'clock before I shall be free to return to this House.</P>

      <P>I will not take too long to-morrow.  I should like to have an opportunity of dealing with some of the very interesting suggestions which have been made by Senator O'Brien.

      <P>I should like some information, but I am not asking the Minister to wait.  Can we get any more information as to whether or not this House will sit next week?  Is it intended to finish the Order Paper to-morrow? Is there any prospect of any information as to how we stand as regards next week?  The Minister said that the Seanad should hurry up if we do not want to meet in Horse Show week.  I thought that, in any event, we would meet that week.  There is, however, a general idea that we should not meet after next week but should adjourn and come back before the Dáil reassembles so as to deal with any business that might be outstanding.  I am not laying down the law about it, but I should like some information on the matter and I think this is a suitable time to try and clear up the position.  I know that several Senators want to know how they stand in this connection.</P>

      <P>Another Senator from the other side of the House suggested that we should not meet this week because it is Galway race week.  My personal attitude is that the Seanad should meet whenever there is work to be done, regardless of whether the Derby, the Galway Races or Horse Show week is on.  We are all interested in going to these places but our first duty, to my mind, is here.  With regard to the programme for to-morrow, I said earlier to-day that the procedure would be that we would take Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 5, as set out on the Order Paper, omitting Nos. 4, 6 and 10.  I suggest now that when we come to the end of that programme we can then discuss what we will do the following week.</P>

      <P>Evidently Senator Quirke was not in attendance in this House to-day when this matter was <Col N="541" /> previously discussed.  The Seanad would like to know whether or not we are meeting next week.  Is it possible to know whether or not we will take the Health Bill next week?  That is the net point which Senator Douglas had in mind.  Perhaps Senator Hearne has more information on the matter because he has been more closely in touch with the proceedings of the Seanad to-day.</P>

      <P>I hope Senator Baxter does not intend to take any disciplinary action so far as my attendance in the House is concerned.  If he does, we can take that with the rest.  So far as the Opposition are concerned, I do not propose to take any dictation from Senator Baxter or any of the rest of the people in the Opposition as to when <Col N="542" /> I should be in this House.  I do my job regardless of what anybody may say.</P>
