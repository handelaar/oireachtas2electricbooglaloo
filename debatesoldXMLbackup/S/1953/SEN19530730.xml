      <P>When the House adjourned last night, I was expressing some amazement at the zeal with which Senator O'Brien was pleading that the Irish public should be permitted to make offerings to the goddess of Chance.  His justification for that was that he felt that the terms on which the last national loan had been offered to the public were unnecessarily high.  I had pointed out that, despite the fact that the Senator regarded the return offered on the national loan as being unduly attractive, it had nevertheless taken five days to persuade the Irish people and some outside investors to entrust £20,000,000 to the Government, mainly for works of capital development.  I say mainly for works of capital development, because I do not want to disguise the fact that some part of this loan was being used for purposes which, I think, my predecessor, or, if not my predecessor the ex-Taoiseach, described as social capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator is entitled to that point of view.  Nevertheless, I think it is well recognised among the exponents of the science&mdash;or is it the art? &mdash;of which he is such a distinguished practitioner that the price which must be offered in relation to any particular proposition is that it will attract the marginal element and secure the full satisfaction of the purchasers' need. On that principle, it is possible, if one's offer is not sufficiently attractive, to defeat one's own purpose and I take it the purpose of any Government endeavouring to carry out a programme <Col N="544" /> of national development is that in order to avoid the inflationary dangers which might otherwise arise, their financial requirements should be met, if possible, out of current savings.</P>
    <P>In the case of this country that, at any rate, was the position prior to 1948.  In the years 1949 and 1950 that principle was not observed because State expenditure on what our predecessors described as capital purposes so far exceeded the current savings that not merely had the State to borrow from our own people but from abroad, and to realise a substantial proportion of savings which had been previously built up.</P>
    <P>If one wishes to secure the use of any commodity in considerable quantity, it is necessary to pay the price for that commodity which will attract an amount which will meet one's own requirements.  We did that in regard to the last national loan, and because we did it that loan was fully subscribed and, indeed, over-subscribed, not to any great extent, but I think I can say it was fully subscribed by the Irish people in the person not merely of institutions but of small, medium and large private investors.</P>
    <P>We should contrast that experience of the 5 per cent. loan with the experience which my predecessor suffered in September, 1950, when he offered a loan of £15,000,000 at 3½ per cent. The hard fact which transpired as a result of that offer was that the terms were insufficient, the loan did not fill and the general public&mdash;and in that term I include not merely investors who are domiciled or resident here, but investors from outside this country &mdash; only subscribed approximately two-thirds of the total amount required.  The balance of approximately £5,000,000 was supplied by the underwriters, by the banks on the one hand and by the Government.  Obviously as the Government had to realise existing securities and put new money into circulation and the banks had to do the same, the general influence of that 3½ per cent. issue, which failed to fill, was inflationary. It contributed, if one might say so, to <Col N="545" /> the rise in the cost of living and in prices which began to manifest itself at that particular period.</P>
    <P>I think, therefore, that it would require something more than a merely <i>ex parte</i> statement on the part of Senator George O'Brien to convince me at any rate and to convince any person who meditates upon the characteristics of these two transactions, the one signally unsuccessful, the other the most successful issue that has ever been made in this country, that the rate of interest offered on the last national loan was unnecessarily high.  Starting on that assumption, Senator O'Brien offered one or two suggestions which he thought I might bear in mind so that we might issue a loan at a lower rate of interest, that is nominally.  It is important that we should bear in mind what Senator O'Brien proposed.</P>
    <P>He offered two suggestions.  First, that we should float a loan at 3 per cent. free of tax.  Of course, that does not necessarily imply and, indeed, in our circumstances could not possibly imply, that the real rate of interest offered on the loan would be lower than 5 per cent.  On the contrary, if we consider what the standard rate of tax is we shall see that in regard to many investors, those, for instance, who pay tax at the full standard rate and pay surtax, the net yield to them would be very much greater than 3 per cent.  Of course, that is a very important consideration to bear in mind, but there are other objections to that proposal and the greatest to my mind, having regard to the general public interest, the interest of the State and to social factors, is that a loan issued on those terms would be unduly beneficial to the large investor and correspondingly unfavourable to the small man.</P>
    <P>Take the case which was quite frequent in regard to the 5 per cent. loan. By far the largest category&mdash;I am talking from memory now&mdash;of subscribers to that loan was that which invested up to £1,000.  In many cases the net rate of tax payable by the small man on the loan would be considerably less than the standard rate.  Those who invested £100 or less&mdash;and there was a substantial number; I think, about <Col N="546" /> 800&mdash;in that loan would probably not pay tax at all.  Therefore, the tax-free concession would be of no value to by far the largest category of subscribers to the last loan but it would be of considerable value to insurance corporations, surtax payers and others who were able to take up substantial blocks of the loan.  They would get a very considerable benefit indeed.  So that, though the net cost to the Exchequer would be considerably higher, I think, than in the case of the 5 per cent. loan issued subject to tax, nevertheless all the benefit would, in fact, inure to the more substantial taxpayers with the consequence that the number of subscribers to the loan, I think, would be considerably reduced.</P>
    <P>I think it is generally recognised that it is beneficial to the public interest to have the greatest possible number of citizens interested directly in the stability of the State and in the soundness of the public finances. Therefore- from the point of view of the State, Senator O'Brien's proposal for a tax free loan would tend to exclude from a direct interest in the finances of the State and the soundness and stability of its currency a very substantial proportion of our population. It has been, I think, the aim of every system of Government that has wished to ensure that it will perpetuate itself and survive, to see that the greatest possible number of its citizens are directly concerned to ensure its survival.  From that point of view, Senator O'Brien's proposal for a tax free loan can scarcely be regarded as a commendable one.</P>
    <P>The next suggestion which the Senator made was that we should consider whether we could not make the loan more attractive to subscribers if we incorporated in it a very large element of chance.  He went so far as to say that perhaps a 4 per cent. loan issued at a discount, issued at £80 per nominal £100 stock, and subject to the condition that small blocks of the stock would be drawn from time to time for redemption at par, may be a much cheaper way of getting the money than the straight and honest offer which was made to the public last October.  I think that the Senator has somewhat <Col N="547" /> overrated the possibilities that the State may be able to run itself very much like a gaming house and that the public finances can be conducted on the same principles as a man may run a roulette table at a fair.</P>
    <P>The thing which we will have to concede is that the gambling instinct upon which Senator O'Brien relies to such an extent is, in general, not highly developed in the thrifty and industrious sections of our people who are prepared to stint themselves a little to save, in order that they may invest and in other years enjoy the benefits of the self-deprivation to which they submit in order that they may amass a little loose cash to invest in a long-term loan such as the national loans are going to be.  Therefore, I do not think that an offer such as the Senator has suggested would be likely to be very much more attractive to the investing public in general than a straight offer would be.</P>
    <P>I think that the origin of the Senator's suggestion was that, again, the rate of interest on the last loan was unnecessarily high, that by some subterfuge we could secure our money at a lower nominal rate of interest. Undoubtedly, if you offer 4 per cent. stock at £80 per nominal £100, the 4 per cent. looks less than the 5 per cent.; but when you begin to take into consideration the discount at which you are offering the stock you will find that the overall cost, the true cost, to the State would be considerably higher.</P>
    <P>Assume that this 4 per cent. loan, issued at such a heavy discount, is going to run for a 20-year period.  If it is issued at £80, that gives a capital profit of £20 at the end of 20 years; that is the minimum yield which such a stock will give to the unluckiest investor, the man whose bond is never drawn at all but who has to hold on to this nominal 4 per cent. stock until it matures 20 years later.  On the other hand, let us assume that the number of lucky investors and the number of unlucky ones are equal; then, on the average, one would have to wait, say, only ten years for one's £20 and this, even on a flat rate, is equivalent to an extra £2 per annum on every <Col N="548" /> £100 cash, that is to say, it is equivalent to 2½ per cent. on top of the original 4 per cent.  Therefore, instead of paying 5 per cent. subject to tax&mdash; which Senator George O'Brien rates unnecessarily high&mdash;we should be paying 6½ per cent.</P>
    <P>When one considers, again, that the premium would be free of tax, the real rate of interest on this 4 per cent. stock would be higher still.  I would say that, taking it all in all, if we worked it out, probably the true rate which this 4 per cent. stock would carry would be of the order of about 8 per cent.  I think that would be a rather expensive price to pay in order that we might allow the gambling members of the community a chance for a flutter in Government stocks.</P>
    <P>Though I have criticised the proposals which Senator O'Brien has put forward, I do not think he intended them to be taken seriously, but rather that he offered them as an incentive to the Minister for Finance to try to approach the question of raising capital from the public with, shall we say, a more alert mind than perhaps the Senator thinks he has hitherto done.  I can assure the Senator if I can find any possible way of raising the capital requirements of the Government at a lower rate than heretofore which will attract the full amount of money we require, I shall certainly have recourse to it provided, of course, it is not a method which would carry such a heavy inflationary influence as to be harmful to the general economy.</P>
    <P>It is hardly necessary for me to say very much about Senator Burke's speech.  I know that the view he has expressed that housing subsidies have led generally to inefficient building and perhaps to excessive profits on the part of the builder is one which is shared by many people, not merely by those who sit on that side of the House, but by people who do not participate to any great extent in the public life of our country.  But there is a difficulty here again.  Supposing we were to cut subsidies out altogether, how are we going to ensure that the housing problem, which is among the greatest of the social evils we have inherited, will be solved?  Uutimately it would appear <Col N="549" /> that the offer of something for nothing is one of those factors which influences people to decide to provide themselves with their own home.  The justification for the subsidy is perhaps more psychological than economic.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnston asked me a number of questions in relation to the various contributions and grants which appear in the Estimate for the Department of Local Government.  He suggested that it was wrong from the point of view of the general canons of public finance which used to prevail to borrow these moneys.  He was referring in particular to sub-head I (1) on page 185 and sub-head I (3) on page 186.  So far as I (1) is concerned, I can give him this assurance, that the subsidies in relation to grants towards housing loan charges of local authorities, for which £840,000 is provided this year, is taken out of revenue and is not borrowed for.  On the other hand, I have to confess that the grants under I (3), that is, grants under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts, 1933 to 1952, and other Housing Acts, have been borrowed for since 1950-51; so also has the grant which is provided under I (6). They form part of the voted capital supply services which, as the Senator knows, has been a matter of controversy and contention elsewhere.</P>
    <P>If times were different&mdash;and it must be remembered we could not do everything at once&mdash;I, at least, in so far as I could influence Government policy in relation to these matters, would endeavour to secure that they were provided out of revenue for the reason which the Senator himself has given, that the number of houses built in respect of which these grants are given barely makes good the depreciation and wastage on existing houses.  That was the principle on which these grants were voted from 1932 to 1939, when I was formerly Minister for Finance and on which they continued to be voted until 1950 when a new procedure was adopted.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnston also asked me does the principle of rates remission apply to farm buildings.  I have not had time to verify my recollection but I think <Col N="550" /> my recollection is correct, that in the case of farm buildings the original Valuation Act of 1852 provided that reconstruction, improvements, extensions or enlargements of farm buildings were not to be valued for a period of seven years.  That is not precisely the same thing as granting a remission of rates but it does mean that for a period of seven years the improvements are not valued and accordingly escape rates; but at the end of the seven years rates must be paid at the full rate.  However, it is, perhaps, from the point of view of the farmer, much more advantageous than any rates remission might be because the rates remission would entail valuation straight away; there would only be a partial remission of the rates, say, two-thirds, and that would continue for only a limited period of seven years.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Higgins has been complaining very bitterly about the increase in unemployment.  That increase in unemployment has, for a number of reasons, been concentrated very largely in the City of Dublin and also very largely concentrated in one trade, the building trade.  We know, of course, that no housing programme, no matter how extensive you may make it, no matter how well you may plan it, no matter how you may regulate it in regard to time, can be carried out at a continuous fixed rate.  There must be periods when there will be considerable slackness, not merely in the building trade but in an ordinary manufacturing industry, and we have run into such a period here in the City of Dublin. The corporation own considerable tracts of land which they acquired for the purposes of their housing programme, but they have not been able to develop those lands and to build upon them because there is a major engineering work which is only now in course of execution, and so accordingly we had this increase in unemployment in the building trade of Dublin arising very largely out of the cessation of the corporation building programme. Again, you see, we have also had a temporary decrease in the amount of building carried out for private persons.</P>
    <P>I am going to give figures which will <Col N="551" /> show that that situation also is righting itself.  We have had long experience&mdash;after all we have been in Government for 16 years.  When we came in and took office in 1932 we inherited an unemployment problem of dimensions at least four times that with which we are dealing to-day, but it was an unemployment problem for which no provision whatever had been made for the sustenance or subsistence of the people who had been unemployed.</P>
    <P>There was then no Unemployment Assistance Act.  People who had been for years out of employment and therefore out of unemployment benefit were depending entirely upon home assistance, and for the six or seven years that we were there from 1932 to 1939 the then Government had to vote considerable sums for the relief of unemployment not merely in the City of Dublin but throughout the whole of the Twenty-Six Counties; and during that period prior to 1932 those of us who are old enough to remember it will recall that we had not people marching through the City of Dublin asking for increased unemployment assistance.  What we had then was people marching through the City of Dublin who were hungry and asking for bread.</P>
    <P>The situation, as I have said, was very much graver then than it is to-day, and it was because of our experience during that period that the Government which was in office from 1932 to 1948 set itself to devise, to draw up, a programme of useful public works, not a programme of sporadic relief works which would be undertaken for three, four, five or six weeks and which would yield no permanent benefit to the community.  We set ourselves to draw up a programme which involved among other things the reconstruction of certain buildings which were dilapidated and in a dangerous condition and which themselves had been, as I have said in the other House, in some cases, converted stables which were, apart from anything else, apart from the menace which they may have constituted to the health of the <Col N="552" /> staff, certainly not conducive to efficient or economical administration. Among these projects was, as I have said, this Dublin Castle reconstruction.</P>
    <P>Now what do we find?  We find people like Senator O'Higgins who have been trying to make capital out of this unemployment problem, the moment that the Government indicates that it is prepared to proceed with a public work which will justify itself in the savings in the cost of administration which will accrue from it, then begin to talk about constructing palaces for civil servants in Dublin.  Of course, that may appeal to the patriarch of 80 or 90 living somewhere in the remotest parts of the country who has not been in any Government office in Dublin, but it is not going to carry very much weight with the ordinary person who knows that if you want to have work done efficiently and economically you must house your staffs properly.  You must do it with your live stock on the farm and you cannot propose to treat human beings with any less consideration than you will treat them.</P>
    <P>Let us have a look at this unemployment problem of which we have been hearing so much.  The remarkable thing about it is that the number of people who are on the live register and claiming unemployment benefit has very substantially diminished over the past four or five weeks.  Now that has happened before any proposal was made for carrying out special works or for undertaking those major works which the Government has indicated it proposes to proceed with.  I have here the live register statistics starting from the 20th June, 1953, and dealing with claimants to unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>Now, we may take this as being in general true, that the people who are normally employed are those who draw unemployment benefit.  The people who have to have recourse to unemployment assistance are in general people who are not in insurable employment, people who live down the country and people who have been so long out of a job that nobody is prepared to give them a job.  Again, of course, there we have to consider a great many things.  So far as the <Col N="553" /> unemployment register is concerned any person who claims to be out of work, to be looking for a job, is entitled to sign it whether he is actually working or not, and he is entitled to sign it and probably will continue to sign it until he reaches the age of 70 years.</P>
    <P>We cannot assume from the figures that I give you that all these people who are on the unemployment register drawing unemployment benefit are all young people in the vigour of their youth, or indeed are all people who might be described as likely to give a satisfactory return for the wage which they are paid.</P>
    <P>However, having made these prefatory remarks, let me get back to the real statistics.  I am giving now the number of claimants to unemployment benefit on the live register for a number of weeks.  This live register, let me point out again, covers the whole country.  The preponderating class of individuals who sign the live register will, I assume, be those who live in our cities and towns.  The number of people who sign the live register for unemployment benefit in country districts is comparatively small.  What proportion it bears to the whole, I am not prepared to say.  On 20th June, the number of men&mdash;and I think we should deal only with men because there is no use talking about women and girls&mdash;who signed the live register was 36,577.  These were claimants to unemployment benefit.  On 27th June&mdash;a week later&mdash;that number had fallen to 35,875.  On the 4th July it had fallen to 34,952.  On the 11th July it had declined to 28,118 and on the 18th July it had declined to 26,177.</P>
    <P>Another factor which we have to keep in mind when we are considering these figures is the fact that the Social Welfare Act of 1952 made it much more easy to become entitled to unemployment benefit.  Not merely that, but the number of persons and classes who were covered by the Unemployment Insurance Acts was very considerably enlarged so that&mdash;even there&mdash;there is no true basis of comparison between the year 1953 and, say, the position as it was in 1950 or 1951.  By reason of the changes which the Social Welfare <Col N="554" /> Act of 1952 has brought about, the number of persons claiming unemployment benefit was certain to increase. I am not going to suggest the extent to which the figure may have been enlarged but I think it is not insignificant. The main thing I want to point out is that, without any special action being taken by the Government, there has been a considerable decline in the number of persons claiming unemployment benefit since 20th June last.  So far as one can see, that trend is continuing.</P>
    <P>We had another statement from Senator O'Higgins which I think it is necessary to correct.  The Senator suggested that the wage rates had been declining over the past few months. That statement is contradicted by the index numbers of wage rate which the Senator will find on page 127 of the <i>Irish Trade Journal and Statistical Bulletin.</i> There he will see that, in the Dublin district, the wage index has gone up from 158.7 in 1948 to 192.7 in 1952 and 210.6 in 1953&mdash;showing, I suggest, that so far as the cost-of-living index is concerned, wage rates followed the rising trend in it very closely.</P>
    <P>Senator Commons asked me whether I was in a position to make any announcement regarding the projected change in the system upon which the grant for the relief of rates on agricultural land is given.  I am not able to add anything to what the Minister for Local Government himself has said on that matter.  Some change will be brought about, but I think I can say that no county&mdash;I want to be quite careful&mdash;will be any worse off in the year 1953 in regard to this matter than it was in the year 1952.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is an extensive one, but as it has already been so fully discussed in the Dáil and has received so much publicity in the Press, I feel that it will be unnecessary for me to delay the Seanad with a long discourse on its provisions.  It results largely from the consideration by the Government of the representations which have been made by Deputies, Senators, organisations representing the Old I.R.A. and ex-servicemen for improvements in the existing Army pensions code and it represents the full extent to which, in the present financial circumstances, the Government have found themselves able to go in their desire to meet these representations as far as possible.  The Bill does, in fact, provide substantial benefits in a number of ways which I will outline briefly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="556" /> The existing Army Pensions Acts make certain provision for the dependent relatives of those who were killed or executed during the 1916-1923 period, or who died as a result of wounds received or disease contracted during that period.  The Government have decided to provide in this Bill for increases in the allowances at present payable to those relatives, and, in particular, to recognise in a special way, the position of the relatives of deceased persons who, having had pre-Truce service, died during the 1916-1923 period or died within four years from wounds or disease attributable to their military service during that period.  As I indicated to the Dáil, the death of a person within the four years period from wound or disease is being regarded as meriting the same consideration as if the person had been executed or killed outright during the period from April, 1916, to September, 1923.  The enhanced allowances which will now be payable&mdash; generally as from 1st January 1953&mdash;to the relatives of the deceased persons to whom I have been referring are set out in Part II of the Bill.  A widow, a parent, a sister or a permanently invalided brother may benefit under this part, although, of course only one allowance will, as at present, be payable in respect of any deceased person. In the case of a widow the allowance will be £250 a year; in the case of a parent, £180 a year, and in the case of a widowed or unmarried sister or a permanently invalided brother, £125 a year.  There will be a dependency test for brothers and sisters.  These allowances represent a considerable increase on those payable under the existing Acts, but I am sure that the Government's decision to provide for these enhanced allowances will commend itself to every member of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>In addition to making provision for those allowances the Bill provides, at Part III, for increases in the pensions and allowances payable under the existing Acts.  Under the Army Pensions (Increase) Act, 1949, certain of those pensions and allowances have already been increased.  Later, by the Pensions (Increase) Act, 1950, the pensions and superannuation of the various classes of State pensioners, such <Col N="557" /> as civil servants, to which the Act related, were increased according to a scale which is now set out in Section 12 of the present Bill.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill is rather difficult, because it refers back to a large number of the provisions of the existing Acts, but what is being done, in effect, is to take the pensions and allowances as they were before they were increased by the increase Act of 1949, and to increase them by the appropriate sum in accordance with the scale as laid down in Section 12.  Where a pension was not increased at all by the increase Act of 1949, it will now be increased by the full appropriate sum and where there was an increase in 1949 which did not equal the appropriate sum as we are now considering it, there will be a further increase up to the appropriate sum.  A number of pensions and allowances were increased by the full appropriate sum in 1949, and these will not, of course, be further increased by this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is a ceiling of £450 a year, beyond which pensions under the Army Pensions Acts, or combination of such pensions with Defence Forces service pensions will not be increased, and where pensions are related to pay, as is the case, for instance, with the disability pensions payable to officers who left the Forces after 1st October, 1924, the pensions will not be increased beyond the figure which would represent the pension payable to an officer of similar rank and service who was serving on 2nd September, 1946.  These conditions already apply to the pensions payable to the other classes of State servants to which the Pensions (Increase) Act, 1950, apply.  The increases now provided for in the Bill will operate as from the 1st January, 1953.</P>
    <P>I should perhaps mention particularly that the allowances of £100 a year at present payable to sisters of the signatories of the Proclamation of 1916 are being increased to £250 a year, and I might also at this stage say that, in Section 45, provision is made for new allowances of £125 a year for certain children of the signatories.  We are also, by Section 25 of the Bill, providing <Col N="558" /> for enhanced allowances for the widows and children of members of the Defence Forces who are killed on duty, or die within four years of wounds received on duty.  The ordinary allowances payable to such dependents are set out in Section 27, but, in the special cases I have mentioned, these will, under Section 25, be increased by 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>The existing Acts provide for additional married pensions, subject to certain conditions as to the date of marriage, for persons who are in receipt of pensions in respect of wounds or disease attributable to military service. Speaking in a general way, in order to be eligible for a married pension, a person must have been married on the date of his wound or on the date on which he was discharged suffering from disease.  Where a person dies while in receipt of a married pension, his widow and children are eligible for certain allowances.  The Government have now decided, in the case of persons who had pre-truce service, to extend the statutory dates of marriage for the purposes of married pensions and widow's and children's allowances; and the date which has been decided upon, and now provided for in Part IV of the Bill, is 9th December, 1932, that is, the day before the Army Pensions Act, 1932, became law.  The decision will apply to all disablement pensioners under the Acts of 1923, 1927 and 1932, and to their widows and children.  The bringing forward of the marriage date will benefit a considerable number of disablement pensioners who are not at present in receipt of married pensions and also a large number of widows and children who are not now eligible for allowances because, owing to the date of marriage, the deceased husband had not a married pension at the time of his death.</P>
    <P>I next come to Part V of the Bill which relates to special allowances. Senators are no doubt aware that these allowances are payable to persons who gave pre-truce service and who are, owing to age or infirmity, incapable of self-support.  Almost 3,000 of these allowances are now being paid.  A number of new provisions relating to special allowances is contained in <Col N="559" /> Part V.  In the first place, pensioners under the Connaught Rangers (Pensions) Acts are being made eligible for these allowances.  Secondly, the maximum allowances are, in the case of persons under 70 years of age. being increased by £26 a year for persons eligible for the unmarried rate and by £33 10s. a year for persons eligible for the married rate.  I should explain that persons of the age of 70 or over have already received considerable benefit by having military service pensions, disability pensions, special allowances or any combination of them up to £80 a year ignored as means for old age pension purposes and by having old age pensions completely ignored as means for special allowances purposes.  The increased allowances now proposed for persons under 70 are, therefore, called for in order to give some corresponding degree of benefit to them.</P>
    <P>Part V also enables the Minister to consider, in cases of hardship, a further application within 12 months from a person who has been refused a special allowance or who has had an allowance terminated.  Up to the present the Minister has had no discretion in this matter and a person, on an allowance being refused or terminated, had to wait for 12 months before being able to make a fresh application.  I should emphasise that it is not intended that there should be any general departure from the 12 months' rule.  The new provision is, as I said, intended for cases of hardship.</P>
    <P>I should perhaps mention, as I did in the Dáil, that the joint directions of the Ministers for Defence and Finance governing the assessment of means for special allowance purposes are being amended so as to enable the first £30 of a military service pension or a disability pension or combination of them to be ignored as means in the cases of persons under 70 years of age and to provide for revised methods of assessment of the earnings of children under 18 and also as regards transfers of property by applicants for special allowances.</P>
    <P>Part VI contains a number of <Col N="560" /> miscellaneous provisions which are explained in the memorandum which accompanied the Bill.  I do not think it is necessary for me to go into them now.  I have, in fact, confined myself to a general review of the principal provisions of the Bill.  If any further explanation of particular sections is required, I shall be glad to give it.  I hope, however, that what I have said will have been sufficient to show the Seanad that the Bill marks a considerable advance on the provision of the existing Acts and that the Government have made some effort to accede to the requests made to them from the various interested sources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that the Bill represents a considerable improvement, based very largely, I think, on the fall in the value of money.  Some of the things done are extremely welcome, indeed, to men with pre-Truce service and to the dependents of the people who died in pre-Truce periods.  While that is so, the Bill is one of the very worst examples we have had of legislation by reference.  I wonder whether anybody could answer questions offhand about this Bill?  I wonder whether the Minister, having a brief, could answer any questions about the Bill, or could anybody alive answer such a question?  I doubt it very much.</P>
      <P>After a lapse of 30 years, one would imagine that it would have been possible to make some arrangement whereby a reasonably well-educated person, by reading a document, could tell a person what pension he is entitled to.  We have not yet reached that position.  One who understands a good deal about pre-Truce service, Army Acts and Pensions Acts could get this Bill and fail in an effort to tell a particular person what he is entitled to.  For example, in Section 2 there are nine separate Acts mentioned, and Heaven knows how many sections are mentioned later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying that it is the fault of this particular Minister, but the situation whereby there is no code or no consolidation of these Pensions Acts makes it very difficult to discuss them.  I understand that the general <Col N="561" /> position is one of great difficulty and that it is difficult even for the Department of Defence to determine what a pension is.  I have heard, for example, of high-ranking officers who are being paid a pension without prejudice because they do not know, nor can anybody tell them, what precise pension they are entitled to.  They are taking the pension and keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that the final decision will give them more than they have been receiving.  If it is less that would be very serious.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister's arguments will be the same&mdash;they always are&mdash;that this Bill has been given careful consideration and so on.  It should be possible to make this matter, which is of interest to so many people, comparatively simple.  Not only is the Bill itself not simple but the memoranda circulated with it&mdash;and memoranda are usually of a helpful nature in explaining matters&mdash;do not make it any clearer to me.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I entirely agree that the Minister has made a <i>bona fide</i> effort to improve the situation.  Having regard to the system, the coils and the involutions in which he finds himself, he is doing the best he can.  I feel that one of the jobs the Seanad might be called upon to do&mdash;it has plenty of time&mdash;is to consolidate all these pensions provisions.  That might reasonably be referred to us and it would be an immense improvement.  There may be a few points of detail in the Bill which have to be dealt with but the Bill in its main provisions and intentions is sound and I agree with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be ungenerous for anyone to cavil at this Bill.  We know that the Bill is a long time overdue.  I, for one, would like to pay a tribute to the Minister for having introduced it and I should like to join in the expressions of appreciation made in the other House in regard to this matter and with the sentiments expressed by Senator Hayes.  I also agree with Senator Hayes that it is practically impossible for any human being really to understand the Bill.  It should be a lawyer's paradise.  In connection <Col N="562" /> with the section dealing with interpretations alone it would take the best part of one's lifetime to read them.</P>
      <P>In so far as the Bill is an effort to improve the conditions of the people concerned, people who probably deserved earlier recognition, it is to be welcomed.  No matter how perfect a Bill may be you will find many people who will not be satisfied.  The members of the Old I.R.A.  Pensions Committee are not satisfied with certain sections of the Bill.  They object, for example, to the limitations stipulated.  The pension of the widows of people whose deaths occurred later than 1925 and 1927 is affected.  The Old I.R.A.  Pensions Committee say that the limitation in regard to dates should be extended. I presume that the Minister has been approached on this matter because I think he referred to it in the other House.</P>
      <P>The Old I.R.A.  Pensions Committee also make the case that the increase in regard to wound and disability pensions is inadequate.  They require at least an increase of 100 per cent.  When the pensions were originally granted in 1923, the cost of living stood at 57 points and it is now 127.  Although I am putting up this case, I am sure the Minister has an answer to it.  Many of us have been critical of the high Budget, so it would be at least an anachronism if I were to plead now for higher spending.  In this particular case you have a diminishing cost because a number of people are dying off each year and there will be fewer and fewer as time goes on.  That applies to many pensions, though not to all.</P>
      <P>I would also point out that there are inconsistencies in the grants and variations in the percentages.  Certain officers get 80 per cent., while other officers with greater disabilities get 100 per cent.  The people concerned want to know why the provision of allowances for the widow of a man who died in receipt of a wound or a disability pension is confined to those who were married before 1932.  I have tried to read the Bill and it seems to me that that clause still applies.  I thought the Minister might have amended the Bill, but I cannot see that he has done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="563" /> There is another matter, but I am not sure that it arises on this Bill. Last night a letter appeared in the <i>Evening Mail</i> from the widow of a man whom we all honour and respect.  She claims there was a cut in her pension since December, 1950.  I do not want to mention the name, as the Minister can see the letter for himself and it is not a matter which I should like to discuss in public.  If the statement made by the widow is true, I think none of us would care to have that happen.  I hope the Minister will investigate the matter and see that if by any chance an injustice has been done it will be rectified.</P>
    <P>I again congratulate the Minister on bringing in the Bill, although it is long overdue.  Everybody will not be satisfied with it, but it is a step forward. It will give the men a chance of a better and happier life.  They deserved it long ago and anyone who would cavil at the Minister's gesture would be unworthy of membership of this or the other House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRuane" hpid="Mr. S.T. Ruane Mr. S.T. Ruane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to express my approval of the Bill and to congratulate the Minister on introducing it.  In common with those people directly concerned and who hope to benefit by the provisions in the Bill, I know what it is about; but I confess that I am at a loss to find out the various benefits that it means to confer or the extent of the grievances that it means to correct.  As Senator Hayes pointed out, it is a complicated document.  One would need to go into the Library and go over the provisions of at least nine Acts, extending from 1923 to 1939; and by the time any layman would have done that he would suffer from a very severe headache. Men of the legal profession may treat that class of research as part of the day's work, but we who come into contact with those who individually and collectively carried on an agitation that has led to the introduction of the present Bill will be at a loss to explain the extent to which it goes to remedy their grievances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper accompanying the Bill is equally complicated.  It should have been possible to provide a simple <Col N="564" /> memorandum for members of both Houses of the Oireachtas that would give an idea as to what the Bill really proposes to do.  It would give information on the matter, not alone to them, but to the people who are looking forward to benefit.</P>
    <P>Though it is difficult to find out the extent to which the Bill remedies grievances, there are certain outstanding features which prove it does not go quite far enough in certain very deserving cases.  In the case of the provision made for the dependents of those who died from injuries received in action or who died as a result of participation in hostilities, those who died later than 1925, and in some cases 1927, are to be left out of consideration.  I think that is a flaw in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Another flaw, to my mind, is the fixing of a time limit of 12 months for the making of claims and leaving no provision for making an appeal.  I hope it may be possible to amend the Bill to meet these points.</P>
    <P>We owe a debt of gratitude as a whole to those responsible for bringing about the wide measure of freedom that the country enjoys.  No one who realises that would feel in any way embarrassed by shouldering any burden, no matter what financial burdens the country has to bear, in order adequately to express that debt. None of us would shirk an addition to that burden in order that adequate return could be made to those people for the unselfish service they gave.  I trust that the Bill will operate as soon as possible, and that under it many of the grievances will be removed.  In a few short years, the people that this Bill provides for will have passed away and gone to a greater reward; but while they are with us they are deserving of the best we can do for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcCrea" hpid="Mr. McCrea Mr. McCrea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCrea</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with previous speakers in congratulating the Minister on bringing in this Bill.  It is unfortunate that it is belated, that it has taken 31 years to do justice to the dependents of those who lost their lives or paid the supreme sacrifice in the struggle for independence. <Col N="565" /> This is really the first reasonable or generous effort to cater for them.  It will not please everybody, and there will be still some snags, but it is a reasonably generous measure, and I certainly welcome it.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with some of the speakers that this Bill will prove a Chinese puzzle to anyone.  Most people affected by it will very quickly know what their rights are under it.  I do not see that there is any great difficulty, if one had time to go through it, in seeing where one stands.</P>
      <P>The great objection I have is to Section 3.  I agree there should be a time limit, and possibly 1927 is a reasonable year at which to draw the line; but there will be isolated cases&mdash;I know some of them&mdash;of people whose health was impaired and broken down and who passed away only within the past few years.  I think the Minister did give an undertaking in the other House that he would look into that section and see what he could do about it.  I hope he will be able to take some powers to deal with exceptional cases of hardship with which he will find himself faced when the Bill becomes law.  I again congratulate the Minister and repeat that the Bill is a reasonably generous effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an even more expeditious handling of the Bill than that for which I praised the Dáil.  I feel certain that Senators are influenced by the fact that the sooner this measure passes through both Houses the sooner it becomes law.  I have no doubt also that Senators will have noticed, in the course of their reading of the Bill, that in certain circumstances allowances will not become available to the recipients until the Bill actually becomes an Act.  Therefore, the plea I made in the other House and the plea I am making now is on behalf of that class of person who will not be entitled to retrospective payment to the beginning of this year but who will be enabled to secure payment from the date the Bill becomes an Act.  That is the only reason why I make any plea for expedition and it is the reason why I now express my <Col N="566" /> gratitude to the Seanad for the speed with which they have taken the Second Stage.</P>
      <P>I certainly agree that the Bill is a complex one.  It is built up on nine other complex Acts, and when you have to deal with it by reference to those Acts it is only natural that the Bill would be as difficult as Senators realise it is.  The fact remains that I could see no way out of the situation which confronted us other than to include fully the sections of the previous Acts which are now only referred to.  If we had approached the problem from that point of view there can be no question but that the Bill which Senators would have had in their hands, instead of being the fairly compact document it is, would be a voluminous document which would have been no easier to follow.</P>
      <P>Senator McCrea hit the nail on the head when he said that this Bill will be thoroughly understood by those who will benefit from it.  Naturally they will make certain that they will get the information from their Deputies or from other people competent to give it to them.  Probably Deputies and Senators will be their main source of information, and if there is any particular section to which a Deputy or Senator has to refer, it will be easy for him to consult any previous Act which may be mentioned in it.  Here, where we have all the amenities that can be afforded to us in the way of an excellent Library, it is not too difficult to obtain previous Acts, to pick out the particular section and relate one to the other, thus making the matter clear.  However, in its present form it is a very complex document, and to quite a large number of people must be difficult to follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Donnell made reference to a letter published in one of last evening's newspapers.  The letter was brought to my attention and, while I have no information at the moment, I presume that the cut referred to in the letter was in relation to the recovery of income-tax.  No official cut has been made in any pension, so <Col N="567" /> I can only assume it has something to do with the recovery of income-tax and that possibly a sum of money was retained in that connection.</P>
    <P>If I properly understood the query raised by Senator O'Donnell as to the reasons for the percentages, 80 per cent. and 100 per cent., I would explain that they represent the extent of disease or the wound or the degree of disablement brought about by the disease or the wound.  It does not represent anything in the nature of class distinction, if that was in the Senator's mind.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the marriage date.  Heretofore a man became eligible for a married pension under the Army Pensions Acts, 1923, 1927 and 1932, if he was married on the date on which he received the wound or was discharged on account of disease.  As a result of that, a number were disqualified for married pension.  Not many of those who were fighting at that time were married.  Most of them married after the cease-fire order.  If the man was married when he received the wound or if he died within a certain period after that and was married, his widow became eligible for the widow's allowance.  We thought that that could be extended somewhat and when we set out to see to what degree it could be extended we naturally had to have reference to the Acts involved.  The one which we found to be most relevant to the situation was the 1932 Act.  That Act was brought in by the present Government and was the last of those which dealt with the 1916-23 period with regard to wounds or disease attributable to service.  From that point of view we decided that the 1932 Act was the most appropriate Act and we fixed the marriage date by reference to the date of the passing of that particular Act.  That is the explanation of what might appear a peculiar date, in the middle of December, 1932.</P>
    <P>Senator Ruane made reference to a time limit of 12 months.  Actually, of course, there has been a time limit always in all these Acts.  There must be a time limit, but in the case of the special allowances and in the case of <Col N="568" /> application for medals which would permit an individual to secure a special allowance we have extended the date by another 12 months.  I know that it has been argued in the other House: &ldquo;Why have a time limit at all?&rdquo;  and there may be a case for that, but there is also quite a good case against it.  I feel that there should be a time limit from the point of view of making people come along and clear up the situation that has existed over so many years.  I think that, as regards military service pensions, we have extended the time limit on no less than 16 occasions, and one would feel that there must be some finality to a situation of that kind.  However, as I told the Deputies in the Dáil, if there is any strong desire at any time to extend this, it will always be very easy for a Minister to provide for an extension, either by way of legislation or in whatever other way is appropriate.</P>
    <P>I think that those are all the matters that were raised as regards the pensions.  I have no doubt that there may be other complexities which will arise, both in the minds of Senators and Deputies, but I am sure that Senators who have had communication with the officials of the Department of Defence will be the first to admit that any queries made to these officials are not only courteously received but are very expeditiously and accurately answered; and I feel certain that any Deputy or Senator who may at any time find himself in difficulties with respect to this Bill and who may not be in a position at the time to make reference to the appropriate Acts referred to here will find that a telephone inquiry will result in the matter being cleared up without delay.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senators for the manner in which they have dealt with this Second Stage of the Bill.</P>

That does not, however, apply to final pensioners or pensioners who are receiving &ldquo;aggravation&rdquo; pensions. There is no treatment afforded to the I.R.A. as a general body.  With the hospital facilities that are available now and the general amenities, it is not necessary to bring them in under this at all.</P>

A person who retired from the Defence Forces after 1949 gets an increase but a person who retired before that date does not.  A great many people were, in the circumstances, almost forced out of the Army <Col N="571" /> about 1946 and a number of people who served in 1922 and later retired, in the ordinary course, about that time.

      <P>I have, on a number of occasions, explained the position with regard to members of the Defence Forces who retired or were discharged before 1st September, 1946, and the 1st September, 1949.  A pay increase came into operation on the 1st September, 1946, and officers and soldiers who had the benefit of that increase before leaving the Army received increased rates of retired pay and pension&mdash;a flat 30 per cent. increase in the case of officers and varying increases in the case of non-commissioned officers and men. These increases were granted by the pensions scheme of 1947, and they followed from the principle that if a person's pay is increased, there should also be an increase in his pension.  As from the 1st April, 1949, the same increases were granted to personnel who had left the Army before the September, 1946, increase in pay was granted. These former officers and men had no entitlement to the pension increases by reference to an increase in their pay. Their pensions were increased on the same basis as were those of other classes of former State servants by the Pensions (Increase) Act, 1950&mdash;that is, the Government decided to increase the pensions of those who had left the State service before October, 1946, up to what they would have been eligible for if they were still serving in October, 1946.  The decision was based on considerations such as the increased cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot now take the officers and soldiers who were retired or discharged before September, 1949, and give them the increases proposed in the present scheme which, as I have said, are related to pay increases.  It may be that, at some time, the Government will decide to give further increases to former State servants generally whose pensions are pinned by the increase Act of 1950.  If that is done, former <Col N="572" /> members of the Defence Forces whose pensions are similarly pinned will be eligible for the same consideration. The former members of the Defence Forces, cannot however, be dealt with separately; their position can only be considered in conjunction with that of similarly circumstanced State pensioners generally.</P>
    <P>In other words, pension is normally based on the pay an individual is receiving when he is retiring.  In between the various years that have been referred to, quite a large number of members of the Defence Forces went out on pension.  Those who went out with a certain rate of pay had their pensions based on that pay. Those who remained longer, and who received an increase in pay, went out on pension based on that increase. That must be the position until it is decided to take all the earlier cases and bring them all on to a new level. It would not be possible to deal with one section alone, such as the Army, because it is obvious what would happen if that were done.  If one section were catered for, the others would regard themselves as being victimised. Until such time as some action of that kind is taken, pensions will have to be related to the salary which the person is receiving when he retires.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I formally move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the National School Teachers' Superannuation (Amendment) Scheme, 1953, made by the Minister for Education, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, be confirmed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Moylan) Seán Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Moylan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This national teachers' superannuation scheme has a number of clauses, only two of which are really important. <Col N="573" /> Senators will remember that there was a conciliation and arbitration scheme on trial for a year.  It is necessary to give the agreements reached between the two parties at that scheme the force of law.  One matter that arose was the question of payment of pension.  Up to now, the retiring pension of a teacher was payable on the average salary paid to him for his last three years of service.  Section 11 proposes that his pension will be based on the salary of his last year of service&mdash;which gives a certain advantage to the teacher.</P>
      <P>The other clause deals with the payment of a gratuity to teachers who retired before 1950.  As a result of the negotiations at conciliation level and also, possibly, as a result of the findings of the Roe Commission, for the first time, in 1951, a lump sum was made payable to national teachers. That, like the advance in pay given then only applied to teachers who were actually in the service.  There was a certain, shall I say, difficulty in the fact that those who retired just previous to the bringing in of this proposal felt that they had a very definite grievance.  In order to mitigate the feelings that had been aroused, it has been decided to pay a gratuity to those teachers who had retired before the new scheme came into operation.  This scheme proposes to give it statutory effect so as to allow the payment.</P>
      <P>One of the other items in the scheme is a book-keeping arrangement which makes a certain pension fund responsible for certain payments.  There is nothing to it.  Another allows the bringing in of certain teachers to benefits who were previously excluded. There are others, and it seems to me, without knowing what is in the mind of the parliamentary draftsman, that they are drafted to meet a contingency that can never in any circumstances arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This scheme should be welcomed.  Teachers of all classes, primary, secondary, vocational and university, are not well paid and are, as a general rule poorly pensioned. There have been some improvements for some years past and the Minister's <Col N="574" /> predecessor was successful in making certain improvements, particularly that in relation to the payment of a gratuity.  I think the Minister is to be congratulated on having remedied a difficulty whereby certain people who came out on a particular date felt they had a grievance.  The payment of a gratuity to national teachers on their retirement is a very substantial step forward.</P>
      <P>Teachers generally are rather criticised for talking too much about their pay and their pensions, but when one remembers that more than 90 per cent. of our school-going population get all their education in the primary schools, there can be no possibility of begrudging to the teachers in the primary schools reasonable salaries and pensions. While there must be an allowance made for nobility of intention and for vocations, it is very difficult in a competitive world to get children properly educated if the people who have to do the work are not as well paid as people in comparable employment. We should be grateful to the Minister and should congratulate him on this step forward.  As he said, this is based upon the arbitration proceedings and the arbitration scheme which his predecessor succeeded in putting into operation.</P>
      <P>For myself, I always feel sympathy for a Minister for Education who has to cope with the Minister for Finance. It does not matter what Government is in office&mdash;the Minister for Education has always great difficulty, and when he succeeds in wringing from the Minister for Finance even small concessions, he is to be congratulated and we should be grateful to him.</P>

      <P>I welcome this amendment of the teachers' superannuation scheme and I congratulate the Minister, not only on the very generous way in which he has met the representations made to him on behalf of the national teachers but on having succeeded in securing from the Minister for Finance his consent to the provision of the moneys necessary to implement this scheme.  Ministers for Education in the past have been very well-disposed towards the teachers, but they always found the Department <Col N="575" /> of Finance a stumbling block in the way of securing redress.  That is not so now and I must say that the national teachers are singularly fortunate in having Ministers of the type of the present Minister and his predesessor, Deputy General Mulcahy, both of whom went out of their way to familiarise themselves with the prevailing grievances&mdash;and there were many&mdash; grievances which they, in their time, either removed or eased.  This scheme will be received with joy by many, amongst them myself, who hope to live long enough to enjoy it.  I speak not only for myself but for many of my kind, for the older teachers and the younger ones, too, who can look forward to a pension scheme which, if not the best, is one of the best in existence in the State.</P>

      <P>I should like very briefly to associate myself with what has been said in support of the Minister's action.  As a teacher, I feel every sympathy with the teachers in their approach towards pension age without very much to look forward to. Senator Hayes mentioned the allowance made for a vocation in the teacher's profession.  I have always been struck by the argument that, because a person has a vocation for teaching or nursing or some such work, he or she ought to be prepared to carry on that work for much less than the ordinary market value of such services in other spheres.  I have never been able to see the force of that and I can say quite frankly that, while a vocation is all right at the beginning when one starts his profession, the shine very soon wears off as one goes on in that profession with a salary much less than one's neighbours and others of one's community in their professions. I read last week a very striking book called <i>Chalk in My Hair</i> by a teacher who was apparently afraid to put his name to it and who called himself &ldquo;Balaam&rdquo;.  Presumably, the other half, the Ass, was the pupils.  He put the case very forcibly and said it should be read by all teachers and all governors of schools and, he might have added, by all Ministers for Education.</P>

    <Title>Consideration of Health Bill: Extension of Period&mdash;Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That on the passing of the Health Bill by Dáil Éireann, the stated period in respect of that Bill shall, in pursuance of Article 23 1 2º of the Constitution be 120 days;</P>
      <P>That a message be sent to Dáil Éireann requesting their agreement to the period mentioned.</P>
      <P>As this is a matter entirely concerning the Seanad, it might very well be taken without being concluded, and, if a particular Minister desires to speak on it, we could take it again next week. The motion on its face seeks an increase of 30 days in the period allowed to the Seanad for consideration of the Health Bill, but, although it mentions the Health Bill, I should like to explain that the intention of the motion is general and is not directed particularly to the Health Bill or towards a particular Government. What I desire to do by way of the motion is to assert a principle, to ask the House to agree, and to apply it this year to the Health Bill, and, in subsequent years to any Bill of a similar character, that is to say, any Bill of an important character.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senators know, the period allowed to the Seanad for the consideration of Bills is 90 days from the time the Bill is sent from the Dáil.  If a Bill of any importance is passed at this time of the year, at the very end of July, and sent to the Seanad, the 90 days begin to run immediately. There must be some conventions and some arrangements even for people who have to legislate or for people who have to work in the service of the Oireachtas and it is generally assumed, as I think it should be, that the months of August and September are two <Col N="577" /> months when normally the Houses would not be sitting.  The result, therefore, is that if an important Bill &mdash;the Army Pensions Bill we have just dealt with, which is a Money Bill and which meets with general agreement, does not fall within the category of the Bills I am now referring to&mdash;an important Bill like the Health Bill or another Bill which I shall use for my purposes, the Adoption Bill, is passed on the 30th July and sent to the Seanad on that date, the House, in effect, has only 30 days to consider it instead of 90.  The motion asks that in that kind of case the Dáil and Seanad should agree between themselves, as they are entitled to do under the terms of Article 23, Section 1, paragraph 2, which reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The stated period is a period of 90 days commencing on the day on which the Bill is first sent by Dáil Éireann to Seanad Éireann or any longer period agreed upon in respect of the Bill by both Houses of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am suggesting that in that kind of case the period should be extended to 120 days.  This, in effect, gives the House two months in the autumn to consider it.  The arguments in favour of that should be considered calmly and without reference to the merits of a particular Bill.  Under our Constitution the Government of the day is assured of a majority in this House. The power of the House is to hold up a Bill for 90 days.  Therefore, no matter what character the Opposition may have politically, it would be very foolish and undesirable, even if it were possible, to defeat a Bill on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>That is to say, Second Stages are stages during which a Bill is discussed and a particular line of thought and a particular line of amendment in regard to the Bill is set out.  Amendments cannot be inserted in a Bill at all unless it has received a Second Reading in this House.  It also means&mdash;and I think this has certainly been the practice under different Governments &mdash;that amendments here must be urged in a persuasive manner and set forth objectively.</P>
    <P>You cannot really work obstruction <Col N="578" /> in this House&mdash;I am saying that quite without prejudice&mdash;for two reasons. First, if you put amendments in that particular way they will not pass because an Opposition in this House is always confronted with a substantial majority.  Secondly, if you take steps to obstruct any particular Bill in this House you are not wasting the Government's time but your own.  You are wasting the 90 days which the Seanad has at its disposal to pass a Bill.  It seems to me that although the Constitution, the nature of election and the general proceedings in regard to this House do tend to make this House resemble the Dáil, it is desirable that the Seanad should give a Bill a different kind of consideration from what it gets in the Dáil.  In spite of the Constitution, we have often succeeded in doing that since 1938.</P>
    <P>Curiously enough, amendments have been accepted here by Ministers who steadfastly refused to accept them in the Dáil.  Similarly, Government amendments have been put down on several occasions to remedy the flaws in a Bill which were not discovered when the Dáil was discussing the Bill.  One of the best examples of getting a Bill at the last minute and of being hampered from the point of view of time is that offered by the Adoption Bill.  Amendments were put forward here to the Adoption Bill and agreed to by the Minister.  There had been a delay in putting forward the amendments.  This delay was occasioned not by neglect on the part of Senators or on the part of the present Minister for Justice but because the agreement of certain religious bodies between themselves had to be awaited. The Minister was in favour of the amendments, but when they were inserted in the Bill the point was made that the period at the disposal of the Seanad had elapsed and that, therefore, they could not be made law. There is a case about which there was no fundamental difference at all where the period might have been extended.</P>
    <P>As between the Seanad and Dáil, there should be the maximum of courtesy and good feeling.  One of the things we should never do is to refer <Col N="579" /> to members of the Dáil by name or to what they said in the Dáil.  It is inevitable in the case of a Minister, but he is present in the Seanad in person when making his case.  The 90-day period is mentioned in the Constitution. This motion does not profess to be an amendment of the Constitution, but I submit we are entitled to urge, and I think the House should consider that the Constitution should be interpreted as to allow in reality a period of 90 sitting days when the House is sitting normally.  When the Dáil deals with a Bill at this time of year and sends it to the Seanad we really have not 90 days to consider it at all.  If we get a Bill now from the Dáil&mdash;the Health Bill, for example; I am taking the Health Bill as an example without discussing its merits&mdash;the period will run out at the end of October, but owing to the necessity of passing the Bill some days before signature we really would want to get it finished by the 25th October.  Even then we would have only a little more than three weeks to consider it.</P>
    <P>I should like to put this point to the House.  This motion does not indicate reluctance to sit in the Seanad, to have the Seanad meet or to do the work the Seanad ought to do.  This motion is an appeal to allow the Seanad to consider Bills properly and thoroughly and to do its work in a helpful manner to Governments and Ministers.  We could, if we liked, do all the stages of the Health Bill next week but I take it that every member, whatever his views may be, would consider that would be a disgraceful proceeding on our part. It would stultify us and make us an object of contempt to everybody, including ourselves.  I do not think anybody would advocate that.</P>
    <P>I put down the motion in a completely non-Party spirit and from the point of view of the House itself and the performance of its business, and also in an endeavour to establish a practice to be agreed upon by the Government and by the House that, when a Bill of importance is passed at the end of July, the period of consideration by the Seanad should be extended.</P>
    <P>There is another method of doing <Col N="580" /> this.  In the case of the Health Bill or other Bills the Minister could postpone the Fifth Stage in the Dáil until the autumn but I am sufficiently experienced to know that no Minister would agree with that because his chances, whether he has a large or small majority, of getting the Fifth Stage passed at the very end of July with a comparative short debate are much better than would be his chances in October.  I am advocating a much simpler method.  Many Ministers have been facilitated here and Ministers have treated this House fairly so far.</P>
    <P>I should like to appeal to the House for consideration of this matter as one which concerns the Seanad as a whole. I think we should be jealous of the rights of the Seanad.  We should endeavour to do the work we have to do in the best possible manner. Nobody could argue that when we get a Bill at the end of July we could consider it adequately.  Even if we were to give the Health Bill a Second Reading next week we should still find ourselves in the autumn obliged to pass all the stages in a few weeks.  That is bad for ourselves, bad for legislation and ultimately a scheme that is not for the benefit of Ministers or of the law being passed.</P>
    <P>I would like, therefore, to get consideration of members of the House for the motion on that basis.  If we sent a message to the other House in these terms, the other House would probably agree&mdash;although I know that, in the circumstances, if the Government does not agree the other House is not likely to agree.  If the case is put up to the Government and if the Minister considers it, there will be very little difficulty in arriving at an arrangement which would make for the smoother passage of legislation, for better legislation and for better work by Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed at the speech we have just heard from Senator Hayes.  One would think we were just dealing with some &ldquo;two by four&rdquo; motion, something of no importance whatsoever, when Senator Hayes knows better than anyone else that as a result of this speech he has changed <Col N="581" /> this into a very big question which is far too serious to be discussed in the way it is being discussed here.  If it is desirable that such a change should be made, it should be dealt with as a special item, with a definite motion put down and sufficient notice given for various people to go into the matter and study it and see what they thought of it.</P>
      <P>Senator Hayes was most unfortunate in linking this up with the Health Bill. In his opening remarks he told us he did not intend at all that it should apply in fact to the Health Bill but to other measures of importance.  The Minister had no intention whatever of being present during the discussion of this particular motion, but when I asked him to come up, as I thought it would be desirable, in his usual courtesy he agreed.  He said that the only time available would be about 7 o'clock, as he is engaged in the Dáil and likely to be there until well after six.  He said he could be here at 7 o'clock if that would suit us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would. In any case, he was agreeable to come. I think this motion must be dealt with on the basis that it is connected with the Health Bill.  The circumstances which make it possible for the Health Bill to arrive here only at this date are no fault of the Minister for Health. I suggest, without wanting to enter into any controversial matters, that the reason why we are facing it in these circumstances is the organised opposition in the other House.  I do not anticipate any such opposition here, but after all the controversy there has been, if we say now we want another month to consider it, in actual fact, another month to hold up the benefit which will accrue from the measure and prevent people from getting the advantages they are bound to get when the Bill is passed, we will not be any more popular with the people than we are at present.  In fact, we will be a little less popular than before&mdash;and we are not too popular as it is.  I think three months <Col N="582" /> ought to be sufficient.  No one can anticipate what the attitude of the Dáil will be, but I think they would be very unfavourable to extending the time to 120 days, which means four months.</P>
      <P>Senator Hayes makes the point that the three months or 90 days have a certain number of weeks of holiday time coming into them.  That is so, but there would still be plenty of time to deal with the Bill.  I would suggest that we take the Second Stage next week or possibly the week after, by agreement, and that the House should meet in the last week in September to take the Final Stages.  I do not think it is right for us to try to hold up legislation of this kind, with this short notice.  I suggest we should agree on that procedure.  If and when it is deemed desirable, a motion should be put down covering the other matter, which could be discussed absolutely on its merits without being mixed up with controversial matters or matters of high political interest to anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJessop" hpid="Professor Jessop Professor Jessop">
      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator Hayes' motion very strongly.  I do not think any of the things said by Senator Quirke are relevant.  The very fact that there has been so much controversy makes it all the more necessary for us to have as much time as we need to give the Bill full consideration.  It is one of the most vital Bills likely to come before us for a long time.  It affects practically every aspect of everybody's life, and in order to give it full consideration we will need at least the time covered by the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said that if the extra time is given it will defer for a month the time when the people may hope to receive the benefits which the Bill undoubtedly confers on them.  I do not want to enter into the question as to whether there are going to be such benefits conferred, but I would point out that it is now two years since the first Bill was introduced and an extra 30 days will not make a lot of difference. There is necessity for this House to give the Bill full consideration and to make sure that when it comes into law it will suit its purpose as well as <Col N="583" /> possible.  That reason is so important that we must give ourselves an extra 30 days.  We have only about three weeks at the end of September to consider all the amendments which may be brought forward, not only by Senators but even by the Minister, and I think that would be too short a time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be a fundamental error in the assumption made by Senator Jessop, that by merely passing this motion we would get 120 days rather than 90.  Even if this motion were passed, it would be ineffective until a similar motion was passed by Dáil Éireann.  There is a good deal of force in what Senator Hayes said, that August and September normally are regarded as two months in which no legislation is dealt with by Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann.  This motion must of necessity be related to the Health Bill; it is unfortunate that that is so, as I would far prefer to have it dealt with independently. In the case of this particular Bill, we should face up to the fact that the Seanad sits so infrequently that if necessary it is our duty to be here even in August or September, that our personal convenience must take second place to the job that we were elected here to do.  There is not a single one of us but was anxious to be elected to this House.  No one asked us; we asked an awful lot of people to elect us; and, because of that, we should do whatever work is before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further point I would like to make is that, in the interest of harmonious relations between the two Houses, it is desirable that on a motion like this there should be an indication as to the attitude of the Government before it is dealt with in this House.  Suppose, for instance, we pass this motion now and it goes to Dáil Éireann or a similar motion is put down in Dáil Éireann and that, as is quite possible&mdash;my guess is as good as anybody else's on this&mdash;in view of the acrimonious discussions that took place in Dáil Éireann on the Health Bill, such a motion would not be passed in that House, the Seanad is then in the <Col N="584" /> same position as if it had never passed the motion and the relations between the two Houses might not be as friendly as we would all wish them to be.  If I were convinced that the passing of this motion was desirable I certainly would resent very much Dáil Éireann taking a different view although they would be quite entitled to take it.</P>
    <P>However, it seems that unless there is some indication as to what the attitude of Dáil Éireann would be to such a motion, the dangers inherent in our passing that motion are such that they cannot be treated very lightly.  I recommend to the House that no formal decision be taken on this at the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I made that quite clear to the people opposite. I do not know whether I said it when I was speaking but I thought that the views of the House should be sought and that before any decision was taken on the motion an opportunity should be taken to have a ministerial pronouncement on it.  We all know that naturally what the Government thinks is all-important in the Dáil.  I had that intention myself and I would suggest we adjourn the debate to hear the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">

      <P>The difficulty I see is that if the Minister walked in here during the discussion&mdash;although I do not think it could be possible for him to leave the Dáil at present&mdash;and stood up to speak, I am quite certain that he would deal with this question on the basis that this was a motion to deal with the Health Bill only and if it were to deal with anything else I suggest that another Minister, or whatever Minister would be nominated to deal with it, should have more notice than five or ten minutes.</P>
