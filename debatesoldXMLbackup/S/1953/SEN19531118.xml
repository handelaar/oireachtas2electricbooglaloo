    <Title>Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946 (Continuance) Bill, 1953&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Seanad is no doubt <Col N="3" /> aware that the Supplies and Services Act, which was enacted by the Oireachtas in 1946 on the repeal of the war-time Emergency Powers Act, gave the Government certain powers exercisable by Order of the Government or by a Minister to whom the powers of the Government had been delegated, to regulate and control supplies and services essential to the community, to control exports, to maintain restrictions upon foreign exchange transactions, to regulate the cultivation of land and empower local authorities to do certain things, to guarantee the principal and interest of borrowings of State companies and suspend certain customs duties.  That Act was expressed to operate for one year only, but in fact in each year since 1946 up to date the Act has been renewed by amending legislation for a further period of one year.  The Act is due to expire at the end of December.  The purpose of this Bill is to continue it in force for a further period of 15 months, that is, up to the 31st March, 1955.</P>
      <P>As I informed the Dáil when moving the Second Reading there, the Government has decided that this will be the last extension of the Act.  Every Minister has been directed by the Government to consider which, if any, of the powers now exercised by him under the authority of the Supplies and Services Act are likely to be required after 31st March, 1955, and, if there are such, to have them made the subject of separate legislation to be submitted to the Oireachtas next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary that the Supplies and Services Act should be continued for a further period because there are powers at present being exercised under it which are not available to the Government in permanent legislation and which could not be relinquished without adverse public reactions. There are five Departments interested in the operation of Orders made under the authority of the Act.  The Department of Agriculture still controls certain aspects of the dairying industry and the marketing and distribution of certain agricultural produce.  The Department of Finance is still operating <Col N="4" /> its exchange control regulations under the authority of a supplies and services Order and is also guaranteeing the borrowings of certain statutory bodies.  The Department of Local Government is maintaining certain regulations relating to road traffic and has also used this Act to authorise local authorities to acquire boglands for turf production purposes.  The Department of Social Welfare initiated certain social services&mdash;the cheap fuel schemes, the footwear schemes and the food centres&mdash;by means of supplies and services Orders and requires to have these Orders in force yet until proposals for permanent legislation have been prepared. The Department of Industry and Commerce is still operating its price control arrangements under this Act and Orders have also been made, which are still in force, suspending the operation of certain customs duties, and control of exports is exercised to the extent that it is still necessary to do so.</P>
    <P>Some progress has been made in the preparation of permanent legislation to replace these supplies and services Orders.  There is a Bill before the Dáil dealing with State guarantees of the borrowings of public authorities and other proposals of that kind are going forward.  It may be that a number of these Orders will no longer be required, nor will permanent legislation be needed to replace them, by March, 1955, but it is to be assumed that on that date we will still need to maintain powers of controlling foreign exchange transactions.</P>
    <P>Presumably it will be desired to continue in some form these social welfare schemes to which I have referred, or some of them, and I think it will be agreed that price control powers will need to be available on some permanent basis.  There is, of course, the Control of Prices Act which was passed by the Oireachtas away back in 1937.  It would be possible to bring it back into operation &mdash;to re-establish the controller and the commission for which that Act provided.  I think the general view now is that it did not deal adequately with the problem of price regulation and that legislation of a different <Col N="5" /> type is required.  I hope to have available for the consideration of the Oireachtas, by next year, certain proposals for legislation in that regard.  A number of customs duties and quotas which have been suspended are, I think, no longer necessary. Their permanent repeal will probably be proposed.  Some of the duties which have been suspended were brought into operation by means of normal finance legislation and their permanent repeal will be proposed in the Finance Bill of next year.  In other cases, the rate of these duties and quotas can be determined by means of Orders made under the Emergency Powers (Imposition of Duties) Act.  So far as the control of exports is concerned, that is being operated now, in most cases, for the purpose of complying with certain international requirements relating to the export of strategic materials.  I think, however, that it will be desirable to have permanent legislation providing powers for control of exports in certain circumstances. I contemplate bringing to the Oireachtas proposals of that character also.</P>
    <P>The number of Orders in operation under the authority of the Supplies and Services Act has been very considerably reduced during the course of the past year.  Some dozens of these Orders have been revoked because they have no longer been required. The process of shedding powers which are no longer needed will not be suspended merely because the whole Act is to cease to operate in 15 months' time.  If it should prove to be practicable, without public inconvenience, to repeal any of the remaining Orders between now and March, 1955, then that will be done. It is, in fact, almost true to say that, apart from Orders suspending the operation of certain customs duties and quotas, there are none now being maintained which will not be required permanently, and powers to enforce them will be secured either by new legislation or by proposals for the amendment of existing legislation.</P>
    <P>I am sure Senators will agree that, however much we might like to see <Col N="6" /> these temporary Emergency Powers Acts finally disappear, we just cannot get rid of this one yet and that it is desirable to give the time proposed in it&mdash;that is, a period of 15 months from the end of December next&mdash;to make all the changes necessary to enable it to be put into the pigeon-holes of the Government until the next war.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should just like to get this point clear.  Am I correct in understanding from the Minister that he intends to substitute for this system of Orders a system of legislation whereby each Department will operate under an Act and each Minister will, therefore, bring in a Bill dealing with his own Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the legislation will not, of course, necessarily be similar to the Supplies and Services Act.  For example, if the Minister for Social Welfare is proposing to maintain in operation the cheap fuel scheme and the footwear scheme, he will bring in legislation relating to these particular schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The position, then, is that each Department will bring in its own legislation and the operations will be under an Act instead of an Order in an omnibus Bill.  If that can be achieved within the next 15 months it certainly will be an immense improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody concerned with public administration in this country must welcome the early disappearance of the Supplies and Services Act from the Statute Book. It was an emergency measure introduced for war purposes, and, like many other of the hang-overs from the last war, it survived the war for too long.  It gave the Government considerable powers to govern the country by decree.  Those of us who have served on the Committee on Statutory Instruments in this House are aware of the very large number of Orders which were made under this Bill, many of which were complicated, obscure and potentially dangerous.  Therefore, it is welcome news that the Bill is to be re-enacted <Col N="7" /> for a period of not more than 15 months.</P>
      <P>At the same time, I think it necessary to draw attention to the fact that the new proposals designed to take the place of the Bill contain certain dangers of their own, in that the Orders made under this Bill are at least subject to parliamentary revision and parliamentary control.  I think it very important for us to ensure that the new Bill which will be brought to the House will not give to Ministers too much uncontrolled power to legislate inside a wide field. Each of these Bills, I take it, will come before the House.  Every Department will have its own Bill.  I think it will be a very peculiarly suitable function of the Seanad to try to safeguard the rights of the individual when these Bills are going through. The Restrictive Trade Practices Bill was, I think, improved in the Seanad and I hope these Bills will also be improved.</P>
      <P>The Minister made particular reference to the control of prices and perhaps there is no field inside which the Supplies and Services Act has operated with more effect than in regard to the control of prices.  It is interesting to hear that the principles of the 1947 Act are being scrapped, that that particular experiment is not regarded as a success and that a new Bill is to be introduced in its place. In regard to the control of prices, there are certain general observations which ought to be made&mdash;that the control of prices is something which ought to be restrained to the absolutely bare minimum scope, that prices in the economic system are rather like the movements of a barometer, that the movements of prices indicate the coming changes in the climate, that they show changes in demand, in supply and in costs and that an artificial interference with the free play of prices is rather like trying to nail down the hand of the barometer to prevent observers from seeing certain useful indicators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The movements of the hand of the barometer are very useful to people trying to forecast the weather, and, <Col N="8" /> if you attempt to keep it nailed down at one particular point, people trying to forecast the weather are deprived of a very valuable aid to their observations. Nailing the hand of the barometer in that way has no effect on the weather and also keeping prices fixed at a certain point by law very often has no effect on the real underlying price structure.  Simply keeping prices, by means of subsidies and so on, at an artificial level, merely has the result of distorting the whole price structure, driving goods under the counter, blinding people, both consumers and businessmen, to the realities of the situation and depriving the Government, businessmen and people generally of very valuable business indicators.</P>
    <P>The very important part played by the free movement of prices in this society is shown in a striking manner in the figures published in to-day's newspapers of the change in the balance of trade.  There are two lots of prices which are really quite outside the control of anybody in the country, import and export prices, and no measure of price control, however well devised, can do more than make a very small impression on the general movement of import and export prices. Changes in the relative movements of import and export prices have a vital effect on the welfare of the community and the recent change for the better in the balance of payments, to which the Minister referred in the Dáil and to which I wish to address a few observations to-day, is almost entirely the result of a favourable movement in the terms of trade.</P>
    <P>The figures given on page 11 of the Central Bank Report refer to the first half of the present year, but the figures in to-day's newspapers, giving the trade for the first nine months of the present year, show the almost spectacular way in which a change in the relations between import and export prices can alter the whole external trading position of the country, without any material alteration in the volume of goods, either imported or exported.  The recent improvement in the balance of payments is, of course, a matter of congratulation, but, at the <Col N="9" /> same time, it must be emphasised that it is very largely the result of changes in price movements for which nobody in this country can really claim any great merit or has any reason to be praised.  It must also be remembered that a reversal of this movement, a change in the terms of trade in the other direction, could very easily produce a very bad effect on the balance of payments again.  The balance of payments, although it has improved, has not yet got into equilibrium and, therefore, the change, although it is in the right direction, has not yet gone to a sufficiently great extent.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister himself is prepared to agree with that.  It is owing to the great importance of the balance of payments, especially in relation to price control, that I am tempted to say a few words regarding some of the observations made by the Minister when this Bill was being debated in the Dáil a couple of weeks ago.  Some of the remarks made by the Minister are such as to commend one's complete agreement, but there are other remarks which, to my mind, are slightly obscure and which I should like to have clarified, because one or two of them, as they read, do not appear to me to be completely valid.</P>
    <P>In the first place, I should like to congratulate the Minister on his insistence on the importance of our external assets to the whole position of the country.  At column 1753 of the Dáil Debates of 10th November last, he said that it was a good thing to realise that external assets are of very great value to the country, and he went on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Other countries are making substantial sacrifices at present in order to get into the position we are in, of having external reserves to call upon in times of difficulty.  If the terms of trade should turn to our disadvantage, or if the policies of other Governments should make it impossible for us to expand our exports in sufficient degree, it will be a good thing to have these reserves of foreign currency with which to finance imports of essential materials required to keep the level of industrial activity going in this country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="10" /> It is most important that the value of these external assets should be widely proclaimed and understood.  There has been a certain misrepresentation regarding their volume, their importance and their rôle in recent discussions, and it is most important that public opinion should be educated up to realising that they are part of the main constituents of our national, economic, financial and political strength.  I am, therefore, very glad that the Minister made such a strong statement as the statement I have quoted.</P>
    <P>He also said at column 1754:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If we can, by utilising them, secure release from the necessity for imports by expanding production here, it will be something worth doing and something the doing of which we will encourage; but to dissipate these external assets, merely to get rid of them, on the importation of goods we do not need to import because we can produce them for ourselves, would be, as I have said, a policy fit for a madhouse.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At column 1751, he had said that the policy of planned repatriation of external assets by deliberately planned deficits in trade is the policy of a madhouse.  I repeat that statement in order that it may appear with the authority of the Minister on the records of the Seanad as well as on the records of the Dáil, because I think it is an important statement, coming from the Minister.</P>
    <P>There are other parts of the Minister's speech, however, which I think require a certain amount of clarification. At least, as it stands in the Official Report, I find it impossible to agree with the whole of what he said.  I refer to column 1752.  This is a matter which has been discussed in the Seanad before and I make no apology for referring to it shortly again.  It is one of the central political problems of a country.  I think it is a problem upon which it is most important that everybody should think clearly even if everybody does not entirely agree with everybody else.  At column 1752 the Minister states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="11" />&ldquo;... in case that observation of mine is misunderstood may I make it clear that, in using the expression &lsquo;profitably employed at home&rsquo;, I do not confine their use to purposes which are profitable in the financial sense.  I disagree with the view implied in the Central Bank Report that external assets should be repatriated for utilisation here only if they can earn more money here than they are at present earning abroad.  We could be satisfied with a much smaller financial return if the general economic or social consequences were sufficient to justify the change, but the aim of the Government is to induce people to bring back for use in this country any external funds they may control for the purpose of their productive investment here.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On this matter I have no hesitation at all in stating that I agree with the report of the Central Bank and I disagree with the Minister.  I think that the utilisation of external assets to bridge gaps in the balance of payments can only be justified in three cases.</P>
    <P>The first is the one to which the Minister refers in the passage from which I have already quoted, that there may be a period of emergency, a depression in our export trade caused by such a thing, let us say, as Government import quotas in other countries, an outbreak of cattle disease or something of that kind and that it is most important to preserve our external trade in those circumstances. It may be quite legitimate to use a certain amount of our external assets to tie up an emergency of that kind.  That can be paralleled in the case of an individual who lives on capital during a period of illness. I think that is a matter upon which everybody will agree.</P>
    <P>The second justification for the utilisation of external assets is, in my opinion, different from the one which the Minister describes in his speech. Unless there is some pressing military, social or political need, having a high and agreed priority, external assets should not be utilised except for investment <Col N="12" /> in the production of capital in this country which produces at least as high a yield as those external assets do in the foreign country from which they are being repatriated.  I quite agree that it is very hard to draw the line between what is productive and what is not productive.  In the debate in the Dáil a great deal of capital was made about the road operations and the road labour.  The Minister, at column 1749, stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I resent most strongly the suggestion that workers employed on road improvements are on relief work.  Twenty-three thousand workers are employed on road operations at the present time, and they are doing a job which I think is essential to the development of the country.  Their work will not merely save lives; it will save costs and it will increase the over-all efficiency of the national organisation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>With that I entirely agree.  It is obviously difficult to say that any particular work is productive or not.  I think we must all agree that certain works are productive of an increase in the national income and, above all, are productive either of additional exports or of additional home produced products which will act as substitutes for imports which are now being brought in from abroad.</P>
    <P>I certainly believe myself that the second justification for the repatriation of external assets is the production of capital investments yielding as high a return as the external assets yielded abroad, and, if possible, a return which will tend to build up the volume of exports in future.</P>
    <P>The third justification is the one to which the Minister refers.  That is to say, the investment in social, amenity or non-financially liquidating assets.  I do not for one moment suggest that foreign investments should not be repatriated for this purpose, but I do suggest that they cannot be repatriated for this purpose unless the export industries in the country are otherwise building up a volume of exports to fill the gap created by the decline in the volume of external assets.  If the agricultural <Col N="13" /> industry and other export industries build up new exports, then and only then can foreign capital be repatriated for what you might call amenity investment&mdash;housing, hospitals, schools and things of that kind.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to suggest in the course of his speech that investment is an end in itself.  That is an opinion against which I would most positively protest.  Investment is a means to an end.  Investments are simply meant to produce consumer goods.  The Minister not only suggests but positively states very categorically what to my mind is even a greater fallacy, that employment is an end in itself.  At column 1748 the Minister states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I admit that unemployment is the biggest problem of all.  This Government are prepared to take, as a test of the soundness of their policy, its effect on employment.  If we put more people in employment, create more jobs, then the Government's policy is successful.  If there is not that result, then its policy is a failure.  We will accept that test and will stand by the results.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That, I say with respect, is to my mind a very fallacious statement, that work is an end in itself.  Investment and employment are means to ends.  The justification for the expenditure of public money is to build up investments and employment and to try to expand the productivity of the nation. If that productivity is expanded in the right direction&mdash;and by the right direction I mean a direction leading to exports&mdash;then it will be possible for the country to import more.  If the country imports more it will be possible to raise the standard of living of the existing population or to raise the size of the population, to reduce emigration, or better still, raise the standard of living of a growing population.</P>
    <P>These are the aims of policy.  Investment and employment are simply means to these ends and, if the Minister's statement that the criterion of good economic policy is the giving of employment, then I do not see any logical answer to relief works of the worst old-fashioned kind.  I do not see any answer to the famous statement <Col N="14" /> of Keynes that it is better to have people digging holes and filling them up again than to have them unemployed. If the Minister means that I disagree very strongly with him.  If he does not he might explain in his reply the statement I quoted.  Perhaps the statement as reported was slightly bald and does not quite represent his meaning.</P>
    <P>As I said, the improvement in the balance of payments position is satisfactory. I do not think that anybody in the country, public or private, can claim any very great credit for it.  It is mainly the result of changes in the terms of trade which in their turn are mainly the result of world forces of demand and supply.  It is satisfactory but it is not perfect.  Equilibrium still remains to be restored and the only way to restore equilibrium without depressing the standard of living is a further expansion of exports.  I do say that, instead of the giving of employment and putting men to work being the ultimate criterion of economic policy, success in building up exports is a much more proper object of policy in this country to-day.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the question of whether there are any difficulties in the way of expanding exports.  I think the answer to that is to be found in the tables on page 11 of the report of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>In these tables it is shown that the internal price level in this country, wholesale prices, agricultural prices, the cost of living and wages, have got out of gear with the import index price number; that, when import prices are falling, internal prices fall less; when import prices are rising internal prices rise more.  In other words the Irish internal price level is tending to be higher than that of the outside world.</P>
    <P>That is unquestionably a symptom of inflation.  If the internal price level, however caused, is higher than outside prices, a country is suffering from an inflationary condition and a country suffering from an inflationary condition finds it difficult to export.  In order to build up exports to restore equilibrium in the balance of payments at a high <Col N="15" /> level and not at a now level, it is most important for us to try to restore a competitive level of prices into our export trade.  It is well known that Irish exporters are finding it difficult at present to sell in the United States market.  With the freeing of the agricultural markets in England, with the admission of more and more goods from the Continent, with the general freeing of English trade, the Irish exporters will find themselves faced with a growing volume of competition in Great Britain.  It becomes a matter of great importance, not only to expand the gross output of our agricultural produce, but also to reduce costs to a competitive level so that we will be able to deal with the situation in the outside world.</P>
    <P>The tendency for industrial exports to expand, to which the Minister has frequently referred, is of course a matter for congratulation.  The Minister is entitled to be congratulated on the success of his industrial policy to the extent to which Irish industries are now able to export abroad.  At the same time it is very important to expand those exports further and exports cannot be expanded further unless Irish costs are kept down to the bare minimum.</P>
    <P>Anything in the nature of subsidies on production or subsidies on export will rob the country of the full advantage of improved industrial exports. Exports which cannot stand on their own feet, exports which require internal subsidies, are only a sort of facade.  They are not really building up the trade of the country in the healthy way in which it could be built up if it could stand on its own feet.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the high level of prices in the country.  The price structure in Ireland is distorted at the moment by a whole group of subsidies in every direction.  There is a very large number of things in this country not selling at their true price.  A large number of imported industrial articles are still protected by tariffs and quotas and in that way their price is kept above the world price.  The price of wheat is kept on a totally artificial <Col N="16" /> level.  The guaranteed price of wheat has recently been raised here at a time when the world price of wheat is falling. The result is that the subsidy on flour and bread is maintained in the region of something like £5,000,000 a year.  The public transport company is only operated by means of heavy Government subsidies.  The social services and the health services require heavy subsidies to-day and heavier subsidies in the future.  The housing programme, the amenity investment for which the Minister is prepared to repatriate external assets, carries a large amount of subsidy from rates and taxes.</P>
    <P>The whole price structure is distorted and made artificial by this series of subsidies.  Who pays for these subsidies?  Who meets the cost of this distortion?  Let us be perfectly clear, the cost is met by somebody in this country.  We are not in a position to dump our subsidies on the outside world.  We are not in the position to export our subsidies on outside consumers. I do not wish to enter into this big question as to who pays all these subsidies, but I do suggest that the answer to that question in a few words might perhaps be worth giving an opinion on.</P>
    <P>In the first place, in so far as articles are kept artificially high in price, the subsidies are paid by the consuming public.  There is a wide range of articles which are unquestionably dearer here than in other countries. In regard to the range of articles which are kept artificially low by Government policy&mdash;the opposite of those which are protected and kept high, those which are subsidised and kept low&mdash;the price of the subsidies must be paid by the general taxpayer and is paid in particular by that very small group of taxpayers who bear the total burnt of the whole direct taxation of the country.  Only about one taxpayer in 15 pays direct taxes and a very large part of the cost of these subsidies lies on that small section of the population.  The people in the towns with fixed incomes who have no escape from the income-tax collector, who pay full rates, the people whose land does not enjoy subsidies&mdash;which <Col N="17" /> is another subsidy to which I might have referred, the subsidised rates on agricultural land&mdash;bear a completely disproportionate part of the cost of these subsidies.</P>
    <P>However, the whole community bears the cost of these subsidies in a more indirect and less obvious way. In so far as our exports are throttled and made difficult by these subsidies, our import capacity is reduced to the same amount.  To the extent to which our imports are kept down the standard of living of the population is artificially kept down to the same extent.  The only way in which the population is maintained at its present standard of living is by bridging the gap by the utilisation of old savings.</P>
    <P>Ultimately&mdash;and this is the last point I want to make&mdash;the cost of these subsidies is going to be borne by future generations.  In so far as we find it necessary to spend old savings to keep our balance of payments in equilibrium, and in so far as we refrain from taking the appropriate steps to correct that disequilibrium by building up exports which in turn require a restoration of reality into the price system, we are keeping the present generation afloat by living on the savings of the past.</P>
    <P>Any person who keeps his own standard of living up by living on the capital that he has inherited from his forebears is doing a very poor service to the people who come after him.  I am afraid that some future generations of Irish people, observing the events of recent years, may say that the people of the first 30 years after the Treaty maintained themselves at a higher standard of living than was justified by their own exertions or their activities; in other words, that the country has been on a sort of a spree lasting for a good many years&mdash;that it has been living on capital.  The people who will ultimately pay for that are the unborn generations of our people.</P>

      <P>Most Senators will agree with the view put forward by Senator Hayes and Senator O'Brien that any form of permanent legislation on the matters set out in this Bill <Col N="18" /> would be preferable to the present temporary Bill, particularly if, as the Minister seemed to indicate, the temporary legislation is to be such that the powers will be contained in the legislation and not through ministerial Orders.  I hope I am interpreting the Minister correctly.  The Minister's announcement of his intention to introduce permanent legislation does not absolve him from giving some satisfactory reason why the present temporary legislation should be continued. The only satisfactory way in which the Minister could make his case would be to let us have a review of the work done by himself and other members of the Government under this legislation over the last 12 months. He has carefully avoided doing that.</P>
      <P>This Bill is the instrument which enables the Government to shape its entire economic policy.  It gives the Government the power to direct that policy and the authority to implement it.  I want to ask the Minister what evidence there is to put before this House or before the country that the Government has made any genuine effort over the past 12 months to maintain a proper system of price control.  Remember, when the Minister and his Government contested a general election just over two years ago one of the main points of their programme was the exercise of a proper system of price control.  Over the last 12 months&mdash;certainly over the last two years&mdash;there has been no evidence that any ordinary member of the public can see that the Government has made any effort whatever to fulfil that promise.  There is no evidence that if they have made the effort they have succeeded in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that the Taoiseach and other members of the Government, within the past 12 months, have expressed some concern at the high rate of Government spending and the high rate of taxation.  The Taoiseach put himself on record as sympathising with the people, who were staggering under the burden of Government taxation. The general public would be more impressed by sentiments of that sort expressed by the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and other Ministers if they <Col N="19" /> could at the same time see some evidence that the Government intended doing anything about it; but instead of enforcing any system of price control, as far as visual evidence is concerned, at the same time as the Taoiseach sympathises with the taxpayers because of the staggering burden of taxation which he is calling on them to bear, we find that other Government Departments are imposing extra-budgetary taxation by increasing such things as the charges for wireless licences, driving licences and postage stamps.  All this talk about sympathising with the people because of the taxation they are asked to bear seems to be merely &ldquo;cod.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien referred to statements made by the Tánaiste when he was replying to the discussion on this Bill in the other House, which the present Government accepted, as a test of the success or failure of Government policy, the effect of that policy on taxation.  At column 1748 of the Dáil Debates for 10th November, the Minister is reported as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I admit that unemployment is the biggest problem of all.  This Government are prepared to take, as a test of the soundness of their policy, its effect on employment. If we put more people in employment, create more jobs, then the Government's policy is successful.  If there is not that result; then its policy is a failure.  We will accept that test and will stand by the results.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I propose accepting that the Minister meant what he said.  Senator O'Brien seems to think the Minister might like to retract that statement.  I am assuming that he intended what he said, as I have quoted it.  I would ask Senators to consider the Government policy over the past 12 months according to the test set by the Minister himself.</P>
    <P>I have here the unemployment figures&mdash;they were quoted in the same debate in the Dáil&mdash;since the present Government came to office.  Most Senators are aware that there is always a difference between the summer <Col N="20" /> and winter figures for unemployment, that the winter figures will always be higher because of the additions which take place when the period Orders cease to operate.  Taking the figures for June of the three years, 1951, 1952 and 1953&mdash;the three years which cover the period of operation of the present Government policy&mdash;we find that in June, 1951, the unemployment figure stood at 35,000; in June, 1952, it was 45,900; in June, 1953, it was 63,900.  According to the test which the Minister himself asks to have applied, to show the success or failure of Government policy, that policy is proved a failure over the period since the present Government went back to office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We turn now to the comparative winter figures over the three years.  In February, 1951, the figures stood at 65,000; in February, 1952, it had risen to 74,000; and in March, 1953, it stood at 85,500.  The Government policy was in operation for that period of something over two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the Minister, a fair test is whether they have put people into employment or knocked people out of employment.  I do not know what Senator Yeats has in mind but every single one of us has been very well aware&mdash;those of us, anyhow, who live in Dublin City&mdash;of the appalling situation with regard to employment in this city over the past 12 months.  We have seen the operation of Government policy resulting in marches throughout the streets of the city.  We have seen marching and demonstrations by people who were unable to get employment or who were put out of employment because of the operation of Government policy.  That is bad enough <Col N="21" /> at any time but it is doubly to be deplored when, side by side with that, you have the cost of living increasing on these unfortunate people&mdash;increasing to an extent that even the Taoiseach deplores the weight of taxation.</P>
    <P>I want to take this opportunity of reminding the Minister that he issued this document entitled <i>de Valera's Men</i> during the last general election and, over his signature and those of two other present members of the Dáil, he gives a number of promises to those whom, at that time, he was asking to elect him.  The second promise, of the eight, was to exercise a practicable system of price control.  I want to ask the Minister now, in relation to this Bill, where is the evidence that he or the Government have exercised any system of price control over the past 12 months.  Can the Minister even tell us what has happened to the Prices Advisory Body?  Has he driven the Prices Advisory Body completely underground?  Has he silenced them? Where is that body now?  Has he, over the past 12 months, asked them to continue their sittings and, if so, has he asked them to continue these sittings in private rather than in public?  I should like some information with regard to that particular matter.</P>
    <P>Another promise given by the Minister in this document&mdash;<i>de Valera's Men</i>&mdash;was to promote industrial peace and the workers' welfare by establishing industrial councils and by maintaining regular consultations with workers' organisations.  Will the Minister tell us, when he is replying, if he considers marches by unemployed persons, marches by civil servants, the jailing of farmers during the milk strike matters which are likely to promote industrial peace?  Does he consider the abolition of the food subsidies and the increase in the cost of essential foodstuffs as likely to promote the workers' welfare?</P>
    <P>In the same document, the Minister criticised the work of his predecessors in relation to the maintenance of price control and the question of the cost <Col N="22" /> of living.  One of the statements appearing in this document which, as I have said, is over the signature of the Minister, is this: &ldquo;At no time during the Coalition's period in office was the cost of living below the highest level reached during the war years.  It is to-day an all-time record. Many food subsidies were abolished: all of them were reduced.&rdquo;  Does the Minister recollect appending his signature to that charge and to the promise that was implied in that charge when he was seeking the votes of people in the centre of this city just over two years ago?  Whatever may be said about the cost of living at that time, due to the ineffective leadership of the Minister in charge of industry and commerce and general ineffective leadership in the Government, any record that was created before this Government came into office with regard to the height of the cost of living has been smashed and shattered in the past 12 or 18 months.  Let me read this sentence again: &ldquo;Many food subsidies were abolished: all of them were reduced.&rdquo;  What was the implication behind that a sentence?  Was it not that if the Minister received sufficient confidence to enable him to take part in a Government again, not alone would food subsidies not be abolished but they would not even be reduced?</P>
    <P>I do not suppose it would be particularly relevant, except in so far as it deals with the prices of these commodities, so I do not intend to go over the sorry history of the Government in relation to their promises and particularly in relation to their promises to maintain food subsidies. However, it is relevant to the question of prices and price control.  I said at the outset, and I repeat it again now, that while none of us wants to withhold these powers from the Minister or the Government for the next 12 or 15 months, we are entitled to find out from the Minister during this discussion what he has to say for his operation of this Bill over the past 12 months and what evidence he has to put before this House that the Bill has been used for the purpose of controlling prices and regulating supplies.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Minister intentionally <Col N="23" /> treated this House or the Dáil with any discourtesy in introducing the measure in the way in which he has introduced it but I believe that in the situation which exists in this country to-day it is not enough for the Minister merely to come in here and say: Because we are going to introduce permanent legislation to replace this measure and because we want a bit of time to do that, we are asking you to give us this measure for a period of 15 months.  I think it is the duty of the Minister to review the manner in which the Act has been operated by the various Departments concerned.  It affects prices and supplies and it affects the question of the employment to a very marked degree.  The Minister has not given any information whatever to the House to satisfy us that he or his colleagues are competent to operate this Act further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to speak at length on this Bill because, as a matter of fact, some of the points to which I wished to refer have already been dealt with by previous speakers in this debate.  As was pointed out by Senator O'Brien, this was a measure which became necessary during the period of the Emergency.  The war is over now for the past eight years and yet the Minister still considers it necessary to have the powers&mdash;the very autocratic powers&mdash;that this Bill gives the Government or to the several Departments of State concerned.  The Minister wishes to have these powers continued for a further period of a year or 15 months.</P>
      <P>It is quite true that many of the economic ills from which this country suffered are still in existence and any steps that the country could take, through its Government, to rectify these ills would be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any power the Government or any Departments need to correct these evils would be justified but notwithstanding the powers that have been given, and given, as has been pointed out, repeatedly for the past two years, the existence of these ills is still evident, and in many respects they <Col N="24" /> have worsened.  Legislation has been resorted to to correct them but, though some advance has been made, the country has not yet caught up with the very serious evil, the most serious of all that threaten it, the continued depopulation of the country.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides powers for five Departments of State.  Powers are given to the Department of Agriculture to regulate the marketing of agricultural produce.  If that power has been responsible in any way for an increase in the price of an essential food&mdash;butter&mdash;it certainly has not been used to the advantage of a very large number of people because it has succeeded in shortening the supply of butter on the tables of many of the working class, not alone in the cities but in the towns and rural areas.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance derives certain powers from this Bill and in so far as these powers are concerned with borrowing by statutory bodies. If these powers include the power given to the Department to increase the interest on sums borrowed by local bodies for works of housing, they certainly have not brought any benefit to the country; quite the reverse.  As Senator O'Higgins pointed out, if the powers given to the Minister's Department to control prices are included in this measure, we have seen no evidence during the past few years that prices have been controlled.  As a matter of fact, controls have been removed and prices have rocketed as a result.  No Party would deny the authority necessary for the correction of these evils.  We are all agreed that they exist but what we are not agreed on is the nature of the remedies by which they can be brought to an end.</P>
    <P>No later than last Monday evening our ambassador in England, speaking at a meeting in Cardiff, referred to the reduction of population in this country as a challenge to the State.  As reported in the Press of yesterday, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There are over 500,000 people in Britain who were born in the Twenty-Six Counties.  There are many more thousands in the United States of America, Canada, New Zealand and other countries.  I <Col N="25" /> sometimes hear it suggested that our young people leave Ireland for choice.  That, of course, is quite absurd.  The problem remains a challenge, but I have no doubt that as time goes on, policies of national development in Ireland will be judged more and more by how far they present a solution of the problem.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hold that the problem will never be solved by a competition in argument across the floor of either the Dáil or the Seanad.  I hold that these problems can only be solved by all Parties bending their minds to a solution and not by one Party trying to score over the other as to the means to be adopted.</P>
    <P>I submit that an experiment was made during the three and a half years of inter-Party Government which brought conflicting views together and the success of that experiment was evident to everybody.  I know that the progress and prosperity brought about as a result of resorting to that experiment was referred to as having been due to extravagance, but the people by a majority do not believe that and there is no use in trying to get that argument over any longer.  They do not believe it, and, if any Party tries to continue that line of argument, the people, in their own time, will have their revenge.  We have had plenty of legislation, all tending towards rectifying these evils, but what we want is less legislation and more concentration by all sections on remedying them.  Until that is done, I am afraid that the securing of the change we all look forward to will be a very difficult matter and will continue to remain very far away.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickSummerfield" hpid="Mr. Summerfield Mr. Summerfield">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>Whenever I address the House, I confine my remarks very strictly to the Bill before the House.  Because of that, I find myself somewhat at a loss to follow some of the speakers who have preceded me.  At the outset, I want to say that I personally welcome the way in which the Minister reintroduced what has now become rather an old Bill to most of us.  As he explained, it is merely a continuance of the original <Col N="26" /> Bill and, within the next 15 months, we are to have various Bills dealing with the powers now enshrined in this measure.  We will then have an opportunity of debating at length the features of each of the Bills presented to us.</P>
      <P>I think, however, that I should stress some of the things that have happened within the past year, even on this Supplies and Services Bill.  I do not think we realise the extent to which industrial expansion in this country is progressing, and I say quite deliberately that that development is greater than most people would imagine it could be, in face of the many difficulties and criticisms which industrialists have to face.  Industries are not created overnight.  It is not enough to merely wish that an industry will go into this village or to that town, and not enough to find local citizens public spirited enough to put up whatever capital is necessary to create an industry.  That is only the beginning of the problem, and those people who say that under this temporary measure there is no such thing as price control quite frankly do not know what they are talking about.  They should be connected with a few industries to realise the degree to which the Government exercises price control, and many of us wish that this Government, or any other Government, would leave industry freer than it is to-day.</P>
      <P>In saying that, I quite admit that there was a time when controls, other than price controls, were necessary in the national interest, but I will say also that I hope that, when we do get the Bills to enshrine permanent legislation, they will get rid of most, if not all, of the controls affecting industry to-day.</P>
      <P>Men owning or creating, or intending to own or create, industries in this country have quite enough problems to handle without having to worry about external and, in many cases, unnecessary, restrictions, however benevolent, by Governments or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made by experts like Senator O'Brien, whose contributions always delight us&mdash;I was very glad to hear it, though I do not agree with all he said&mdash;to taxation on industry. <Col N="27" /> That is one of the things that affects industry, both manufacturing and distributive, but particularly manufacturing industry.  The incidence of direct taxation on industry is something which has to be experienced to be believed.  Not one of us is allowed enough in his accounts to take care of the necessary replacement of machinery and buildings, and I mention that merely to answer the views expressed by people who, whatever they know about other things, have no intimate knowledge of the problems of industry.</P>
    <P>I have no intention of making a long speech because we meet here in the realisation that this is merely a reenactment of a temporary measure which is to be replaced, within a comparatively short time, by permanent legislation.</P>
    <P>What with the advance of social legislation in this country and, incidentally, the impact of the cost of that legislation on production, there is a disequilibrium, as Senator O'Brien said, between the various sections that make up our community.  Since we invited experts from America to come over, prepare and give us that I.B.E.C. Report, with all its recommendations and criticisms, I feel we have in this country men competent, if appointed to do so, to make an exhaustive and impartial survey of our whole economic life and make a factual report indicating the changes in the relative positions of the various sections that make up the nation.</P>
    <P>I think Senator O'Brien said that the burden of taxation is bearing quite unfairly on some of those sections of the community to which the nation looks for most of its progress.  I am satisfied that is so.  I could carry on at length but I intend carrying out the promise I made that I would be brief.  I am going to defer detailed criticism of many of the things enshrined in this Bill until it is replaced by the permanent legislation on the Statute Book.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very simple measure.  It is an annual measure which has come before the House since 1946 as the Minister stated at the outset. <Col N="28" /> I am one of those persons who do not agree with the statement that we should have permanent legislation to deal with many matters with which this Bill dealt for the past six or seven years.  It is now to be replaced by permanent legislation.  There was this in favour of the present arrangement that the Dáil and Seanad had an opportunity at least every 12 months of reviewing the activities of the various Departments.  When permanent legislation is introduced and passed, the opportunity of having any discussion on these various matters will be done away with.</P>
      <P>We had just a few speakers up to this on the Bill.  I think the first was Senator George O'Brien.  He expressed great pleasure at the present trend in regard to our export and import position.  I think he also voiced the opinion that, while the Government was prepared to carry out their national policy given effect to for a number of years through subsidies for such things as wheat, beet and butter, there was very little hope of obtaining a market for our exports.  He spoke in general terms and was very much opposed to subsidies.  One must examine carefully a statement or a warning issued by a person of such a standing as Senator O'Brien.  Immediately afterwards, however, we heard criticism from a Senator against the policy of reducing some of the subsidies. In those circumstances one would find it very difficult to discover what policy would be pursued by the other people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the suggestion coming from many sources in recent months that prices paid to large farmers are too high and that while those prices are maintained there is very little hope of a reduction in the price of butter, milk and bread, we should bear in mind that Deputy Dillon suggested the farmers should accept a lesser price per gallon for their milk than they were receiving.  The effect of that suggestion, even though there was no definite proposal made to put it into operation, was to create unrest among the farming community, particularly among the dairying community in the South of Ireland.  The result was that there was a serious drop in our dairy <Col N="29" /> stock and for the first time in a great many years we were compelled to import butter.  When we see the figures published to-day showing the huge sum paid during the past few years for imported butter we can realise how difficult it will be to bring about any reduction in the prices that are offered for our farm produce.</P>
    <P>Such a suggestion would not be put forward by any serious-minded person at a general election.  What happens during a period of that kind is that there is a contest among the Parties to see which is going to give the farmers the most.  When the election is over, suggestions such as were made in this House are given in relation to these matters.  They have had serious consequences in the past.  It is to avoid such a situation arising in the future that we should be careful.  Those people who make suggestions in regard to high prices should examine the position very carefully before they offer a solution.  There are other ways in which the matter can be met.  We could have increased production.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Higgins spoke about price control and the increased cost of living. At the outset, he suggested that the Government contested a general election on the question of price control. It may be no harm to remind Senator O'Higgins and the others how the general election came about.  The last general election was brought about on the very point to which I referred, because the Dáil was not prepared to give the Minister for Agriculture his Estimate.  Rather than face the consequences of a defeat in the Dáil on the policy of the Minister for Agriculture, the Dáil was dissolved and we had a general election.  The election was not fought on price control or any other issue, but only on the agricultural policy then being given effect to by the Minister for Agriculture. That was what brought about the general election.  The Dáil was not prepared to give approval to that policy.</P>
    <P>We have had several attempts at price control.  I think it was in 1950 when this Bill was before the House that the question of price control was raised.  The then Parliamentary Secretary announced that prices had not <Col N="30" /> increased.  That statement was received so badly throughout the country and by members of the Dáil that a panic more or less followed and a suggestion was made by the then Tánaiste, Deputy Norton, that some system of price control should be devised. There then was an attempt made to stampede the country into a Standstill Order.  All prices were expected to be controlled from a particular date in December.  I forget the exact date.</P>
    <P>Within a week of that Standstill Order being made, the great majority of articles and items over which it was expected control would be effective was removed from control.  Where control was not removed, the articles were no longer produced.  If they were produced, they were produced under a different name.  Therefore, price control would have been evaded anyhow.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Higgins also complained that no attempt was made in the case of the increase in wireless licences and postage to transfer the burden that should be borne by the taxpayer in general on to the other persons using these items.  I think it is quite justifiable for any Government to do that. It is not right that the people, many of whom are not users of wireless sets or of the postal services to a great extent, should have to pay for any losses incurred in the operation of such services.  I think it is quite right that the Post Office and the broadcasting service and many other services should be made pay for themselves.</P>
    <P>The Senator also cited the Minister's statement that the Government would be judged in the last analysis by the number of persons put into employment. He made a reference to the number of persons registered as unemployed as against the numbers employed in corresponding periods last year and the year before.</P>
    <P>Statements of this kind do very little to solve the unemployment problem and do very little in particular when the truth is not being told, when as is the case, the present figures bear no relation or cannot be compared in any way with those obtaining in those years because of the changes that have been brought about, changes in the <Col N="31" /> unemployment order and in the numbers of people entitled to be brought under the general employment Acts that were in being at the time.</P>
    <P>He also referred to the bad effect it had on the country of having unemployed persons marching through the streets of the city centre.  It is not a very difficult thing to organise a march of any types of persons through the city.  We have had marches through the city of various types of organisations in the past.  I do not wish at the moment to make very many references to them but we had at one time no less than a march through the city by a drapers' association because something was being done which would seriously affect them.  Therefore this question of marching through the city could be overrated as to its importance and as to whether the motives behind the organisation of such marches were in the best interests of the persons taking part in them or not.</P>
    <P>The question of price control is a two-edged sword so to speak.  There are people suggesting that there is no price control and with that suggestion goes the other: that the manufacturers, wholesalers and retail traders of this country are all people who are out to fleece the people in general and that were it not that there are one or two people always clamouring for price control something drastic would happen.</P>
    <P>That is not the case at all.  We know the most effective price control we could have is competition and it is only during an emergency or during war conditions that you have a necessity for price control.  It is only fair to say here that we have already&mdash; I do not think it is completely brought about by competition&mdash;a large number of items for general household use and quite a number of foods which have been reduced considerably in recent months.  That has not been done on the advice of the Prices Advisory Body or by any effective price control.  It has been done in the first instance because the people manufacturing these items felt they could be produced cheaper and that the considerable drop in <Col N="32" /> import prices enabled them to pass the benefits which occurred on to the consuming public.  It is evident that if one firm is not prepared to do that there will be another who will do it.  That is the most effective way to achieve the best interests of the consumer.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, this is a measure that is only to be in operation for a further 15 months.  As a member of a committee set up by this House to keep a close watch on Orders made by the Minister or by the Government under this measure, I think it is only right for me to say that this committee have had regular meetings; every Order has been examined and only on very rare occasions, if at all, has it been found necessary to bring the attention of this House or the Government to any Order violating the principles involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the principal points of Senator O'Higgins's speech was that the Government, in spite of the promises to the contrary, has failed to keep down the cost of living during the last three years.  I think a possible answer by the Minister would be that the Government had run into an unforeseen and exceedingly difficult international situation and that it was because of that international situation, resulting in the high cost of materials which maintained the high cost of living, that it was impossible for any Government to reduce that excessive burden on our people.</P>
      <P>That being so, I think it is entirely relevant to cast a brief glance on the international situation which imposed all these difficulties.  In particular I would like the assurance of the Minister that his attitude to the general international position has not changed materially in the past few months.  On January 7th, 1952, the Minister, speaking at Clonmel, was reported to have said:&mdash;</P>

    <P>&ldquo;Questions of economic and financial policy which must be decided this year will divide our people between those who are willing to see the nation kept as a pet of somebody dependent on foreign aid, and those who want to see it strong <Col N="33" /> enough to stand alone, maintaining its freedom in all circumstances.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are sentiments with which I thoroughly agree.  On 29th April, 1953, Deputy S. Flanagan, speaking in Dáil Eireann, is reported to have said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I hope that they (the Government) will not attempt to compromise the situation by saying that they will join any organisation, international or otherwise, if and when the independence of the 32-county Republic is established.  I hope that, instead, they will declare that this country will be neutral, in accordance with the wishes of 90-odd per cent. of the people, in any conflict between great powers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have a cynical and disillusioned view about the whole international situation for the last few years and I thoroughly agree with those sentiments too.  However, there is evidence that the Minister, and possibly the Government, appear to have changed their ground and the evidence is that there are reports of certain speeches made by the Minister on the other side of the Atlantic.  May I quote from the <i>Irish Times</i> of 6th October, 1953:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;His Government now considered that the time had come when its further progress could be advanced by permitting a limited investment of external capital, provided that it was directed to types of development which would increase Irish production capacity or bring with it needed new techniques.  It was realised that the habit of external investment on private account was not very strong amongst Americans &mdash;notwithstanding their country's strong creditor position&mdash;but it was likely to grow and there were many reasons why it might be attracted to Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That seems slightly different from the sentiments expressed at Clonmel in which he seemed not to desire that we should be too much dependent on any kind of external foreign aid.  Certain other speeches of his are even more significant, and from my point of view possibly more dangerous, because they seem to suggest a possible immoral <Col N="34" /> transaction in which the ending of Partition would be closely associated with the joining of that so-called organisation for peace called N.A.T.O. May I quote from the <i>Irish Times</i> of 2nd October, 1953, in which the Minister is reported to have said at a lunchcon of the National Press Club in Washington:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;wherever nations meet to work for the common well-being of all peoples and Ireland can make any contribution, however slight, to the success of their efforts, the representatives of Ireland will desire to be present, but we can never forget that we have some unfinished business of our own, that we hold strongly to the view that the cause of justice will never have been fully vindicated until Ireland's right to unity has been conceded.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In a speech reported in the <i>Irish Times</i> of the 26th September, 1953, he is reported to have said addressing the Ottawa Canadian Club:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Irish partition was often a real barrier for many reasons.  In regional organisation, such as the Council of Europe and the O.E.E.C., Ireland played an active part; but when the N.A.T.O. was proposed, and when they found that membership implied acceptance of the existing territorial boundaries of other member-States, then it was clear to them that, with Britain claiming as an integral part of her territory six of the counties of Ulster&mdash;a claim which no Irish Government could admit or appear in any way to accept&mdash;they were not free to consider it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The suggestion underlying those remarks is that the Minister, and possibly the Government, would be prepared to do a deal and to exchange the reunification of Ireland for membership of the N.A.T.O. pact.  That is a policy which I should strongly oppose, and I hope most Irish people would also, even on both sides of the Border.</P>
    <P>That leads me to consider quite briefly the N.A.T.O. on its merits.  In the first place, it is quite inconsistent with the principles of the U.N.O.; when originally established it contained both Communist and anti-Communist <Col N="35" /> countries and it was commonly said that it implied a willingness to live and let live in a common world and avoid treading on one another's toes.  It was agreed that if the four major Powers which were victors in the second world war were agreed on a common world policy expressed through the organisation of U.N.O., then there could be no war; but equally if those four major Powers should quarrel, there could be no peace.  The second circumstance has arisen and we have not peace but, instead, a condition of cold war.  N.A.T.O. is closely linked with the so-called European Defence Community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is the international situation which determines the whole economic environment in which we are living and that is the reason why we have these economic difficulties.  Quite clearly, if this Bill goes through and if there is a very good possibility of a third world war, we want to know where we stand, in neutrality or otherwise, in that third war.  I am in favour of our joining the U.N.O. but, as the Minister well knows, that itself is now forbidden, no longer by the U.S.S.R. but by the U.S.A. However, as the Chair seems to think I am getting away a little from strict relevancy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Perhaps what I have to say may be more relevant on the Appropriation Bill.  If so, I could postpone my remarks until then.  There are certain matters which even the Chair will admit are relevant.  I think it would be fair to suggest that our transport policy would be relevant.  I wonder if even these things might be better postponed.  I want to discuss transport policy, the destruction of the railway station at Naas, the spending of hundreds of thousands of pounds &mdash;of wasted money&mdash;on widening and <Col N="36" /> straightening the road between here and Naas, and the neglect of the by roads calling out for money to be spent on them to facilitate the movements of the ordinary country population. I want also, if in order, to refer to the proposal to strangle the navigation of the Shannon by putting a fixed bridge at Athlone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>That being so, I will postpone those remarks to the Appropriation Bill.  There is one thing still which might be in order&mdash;the question of cattle prices and the dead-meat trade.  I observe that unemployment has increased considerably of late in the dead-meat trade.  The dead-meat trade was one of the things which we all looked to most hopefully for improving the economy of Ireland and ending the uneconomic procedure of exporting so many cattle on the hoof. Latterly, there has been a loss of external markets for dead meats.  I do not know to what extent the British market is prepared to take increasing quantities of dead meat, but I fear that when meat prices are decontrolled in England there may be a reversion to the policy that prevailed between 1934 and 1948 by which the British deliberately paid us a higher price per cwt. for store cattle than they were prepared to pay for fat cattle ready for slaughter, whether they were slaughtered in this country or in England.  If the British revert to that disastrous policy&mdash;which did more to undermine our economic policy between 1934 and 1948 than even the economic war&mdash;it would be a bad day for agriculture; and I hope the Government will do all in its power to prevent any such disastrous price differentiation against the finishing of cattle and their export dead rather than alive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a remark or two, not that I am hopeful that anything one says will enable the Minister to achieve his purpose of keeping prices under control.  This Act has been in operation for some years. <Col N="37" /> Unfortunately I was not able to be present for the Minister's opening remarks, but I understand the Act is to be replaced by something better to regulate and control prices.  I am not any more optimistic about any other piece of legislation for controlling prices than I am about the present. I think it was Senator Hawkins who said that the availability of services, whether they are in abundance or in short supply, does far more to control prices than anything else.  All sorts of services are calculated in considering whether the total budget for the family is high or low.  How can you have cheap or abundant services and commodities unless people are prepared to work?</P>
      <P>What troubles me about these debates about unemployment, emigration and the other weaknesses of our society, is that so few people are prepared to stand up and speak the truth and tell the people that standards cannot be raised and prices cannot be lowered and productivity cannot be increased unless the people are prepared to work harder in Ireland than they are working to-day.  The prices of food are high.  There has been complaint that they have not been kept properly under control.  Some of my colleagues are not satisfied about the price they have to pay for butter in Connaught.</P>
      <P>As I see things now, they will find more difficulty in buying butter in the years to come than there has been in years gone by.  The problem of finding people to work on the farm is such that it is turning young farmers grey in the head.  Wherever you turn, men do not want to work in Ireland.  They want to live here and live very well here, they want plenty of money to spend, but they want someone else to earn the money and pass it on to them. If the Minister and his colleagues have erred, it is that they have taken on to the shoulders of the State the responsibility for providing too many services for the people.  They have left too many people here under the impression that you just have not to work&mdash;that, somehow or other, the grand motherly State will pass it all on to you and that you have only to stand by and wait.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="38" /> It is all very fine to talk about all the industries which we are establishing and about all the employment which will be given in these industries but what is the use of men investing capital in these industries and putting their brains and their energies into their management, if the employees are not prepared to work hard enough to produce commodities at a competitive price? The Minister should preach the gospel of hard work and it is necessary that he should get his colleagues to do the same thing.  In addition, he should invoke the aid of the Opposition in this matter.  Unless that gospel is preached, and the people take heed of it, I can see nothing around me to-day that offers any hope that this nation will be built up into a strong nation. No farm and no home can prosper unless the breadwinner is prepared for honest toil.  Too many people in Ireland to-day are not prepared for honest toil and yet they expect their homes to be neat and tidy outside and inside.</P>
    <P>You cannot get cheap food unless an abundance of food is produced from our own farms.  That is not being done.  Perhaps the Minister's colleague, Senator Quirke, will fly at me for saying so, but in my view the Government's policy on tillage, even this year, is a failure.  To my amazement, I discovered over the week-end that with all our talk, efforts and high prices&mdash;the prices for some of our tillage crops are relatively high here&mdash; we have succeeded in getting only 32,000 acres more this year than last year.  I think that that is dreadful. We are offering a price for wheat which, relative to our productive capacity, must be as high as any in the world.  What have we done?  We have increased the area under wheat by about 95,000 acres, but we have lost practically as much in the way of acreage from the production of oats and barley.  Therefore, instead of importing wheat, as we did in the past, we will probably have to import oats. I do not know what the position is in regard to other animal foodstuffs. However, that indicates a trend.  Why is it like that?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="39" /> Senator Hawkins thinks that a great deal has been achieved in the matter of milk and butter production.  Not at all.  This year has been one of the best grass years that any of us has ever experienced and yet it has given us just about a fortnight's extra butter supply over what we produced last year&mdash;and we all know what was spent on the importation of butter last year. It is the same all round in every field of the agricultural industry to-day. From my contacts with farmers up and down the country, and from my own experience, I consider that the main trouble is our inability to find men who are ready to work on the land.  I do not say that the people are working any harder in the towns and cities. I think the bad influence of some of the people engaged in industry&mdash; people who work short hours, give a low output and collect high wages&mdash;is making itself felt on the people who work on the land.  They are all meeting in different places now. They congregate in Croke Park from the ends of the country to watch a match on a Sunday.  They meet at dances, at cinemas and at various other functions which are held throughout the length and breadth of the country.  They are well able to compare notes.</P>
    <P>The influence of industrial workers and industrial conditions on rural life in Ireland to-day is truly alarming.  I realise that the flight from the land is not something which is peculiar to our own economy.  It is taking place in other countries too.  The situation in the Argentine is astonishing.  Somebody who came back from Denmark recently wrote a very interesting report on conditions there, as he saw them, and it appears that the same problem is confronting the Danes. They are wondering what the position will be like ten years hence and they do not know how they are going to carry on.  Some of our instructors and executives visited Holland recently. They reported that the Dutch people go out to work on their fields at four o'clock in the morning and that they work hard all through the day.</P>
    <P>The people in Ireland are not doing <Col N="40" /> that.  When our Irish people go out to work in our fields and factories their output is not anything like the output of the Dutch people.  They have to work hard in Holland in order to survive.  The natural resources of the country are limited and there is an immense population on a small area.  The prices there are high, too. They have a social insurance plan which is far and away more extravagant than anything we have here.  I sympathise with the Minister or any of his successors who believe that by a process of passing Bills through the Oireachtas we will control prices and keep them at a satisfactory level.  It is not being done and it will not be done.  Unless we have a greater productivity from the land, I do not see how our living standards can be raised.  I do not see how our output, how our exports, how our capacity to buy from abroad can enable us to enjoy a higher standard of living unless we achieve greater productivity from the land.  We are not getting that increased output.</P>
    <P>There has been some increase in the physical volume of goods and in the value: that is very satisfactory.  Our latest trade returns sounded a note that the position was more favourable because the price at which we bought the goods that came in had fallen, while the price which we received for the goods we exported had risen.  That is a satisfactory position, but it will not continue much longer.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be aware of that fact.  In the main agricultural countries of the world, foodstuffs that cannot be sold are piling up.  I was not in the House when Senator O'Brien was speaking and so I did not hear what he said, but might I point out that you can produce a product at a price that is too dear for somebody else to buy?  I do not think we could sell our butter in Britain.  If we are aiming to sell wheat in Britain, I do not think they will buy it at the price which we pay our farmers for it.  I do not quarrel with that but it is a fact which must be borne in mind. American farmers are producing an abundance of wheat.  The support price in America is so high that the <Col N="41" /> Americans cannot sell their wheat to people outside their country at the price which they pay to their farmers.</P>
    <P>I read recently that the Americans have so much dairy produce of their own that they have put an embargo on imports from Holland.  The Dutch reciprocated by getting the authority of some of the international bodies not to buy wheat from America.  It will be seen, therefore, that there is a vicious circle there.  We are drawing close to the time when our agricultural prices must fall, must come back. We have seen it over this year in regard to our poultry products.  There are some things that can be produced only by manpower.  These products will be in short supply in the future and may command a higher price than, perhaps, their real value as food.</P>
    <P>In the past we have not devoted anything like enough attention to the matter of raising the productivity per acre of our land.  Any of us who know anything about it must accept that as true, but that can only be done by large capital investment, by knowledge, by training, by research and, above all, by labour and the employment of men and the preparedness of men to work and work hard.  That is just what it is impossible to find on the land of this country to-day and that is going to be the real problem confronting the Minister and his successors. It may be unbecoming for a country man to speak like this about what is going on in rural Ireland, but I should be closing my eyes to the facts as I know them, as I see them every day and as I hear them from many men with whom I discuss our problems week after week, if I did not refer to it.</P>
    <P>I very strongly suggest to the Minister that we may find ourselves in very rough water indeed sooner than we imagine, for a number of reasons, to all of which we are prepared to close our eyes.  The first and most essential is that we are not getting the output from the people which the country requires.  We all owe something to our country.  There are not so many people alive now to whom the country owes a great deal, and we ought to expect of the people coming on that they will <Col N="42" /> think of this as their land, which they are prepared to serve because, in serving it they are serving themselves, that they will be prepared to work on it and to work on it as hard as they would have to work if they left it.</P>
    <P>That is not the spirit in the country to-day and that truth must be spoken and preached from the hilltops.  When we see, as I said on a previous occasion, advertisements by Bord na Móna during the year asking for men to go to our bogs to produce power for the country, and when we know that in all the towns of the country men are marching around, signing the register in the employment exchange and getting money for doing so, who will not go to our bogs, one has to confess that there is something fundamentally wrong with us, either as a people or in our way of government.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that, in passing through the Oireachtas measure after measure, we are merely scratching the surface in a most ineffective way and that, while we appear to fool ourselves into the belief that we are doing something for the Ireland we want to create, it is dying under our eyes, and responsible people in both houses of the Oireachtas will have a great deal to answer for to their generation and to other generations for failing to see the things they must see around them and to realise that they are the real canker eating into the heart of the nation, turning people away from their duty and responsibility, and not speaking more loudly about it.  I suggest that all of us require to readjust our point of view and, instead of trying to delude ourselves that we are making all the proper plans to make life better here and to make goods, commodities and services more plentiful and cheaper, we are, in fact, doing the contrary by the negligence we are displaying towards the nation's fundamental problems.</P>

Níl aon tslí chuige sin ach na <Col N="44" /> feirmeoirí a spreagadh chun tuilleadh oibre.

      <P>Cloisimíd a lán cur síos mar gheall ar an gcostas maireachtála agus, go deimhin, is rud fíor-thábhachtach é maidir le gnáth-mhuintir na tíre seo, agus go mór mhór na daoine a bhfuil cúram clainne ortha, ach cé go mbítear ag chaint mar gheall air sin agus mar gheall ar na praghsanna árda ní chloisimíd ó éinne cad is ceart a dhéanamh chun na praghsanna san a laghdú.  Is breá bog a thagann an chaint chugainn nuair a bhímid ag caint mar gheall air sin.  Ní cúrsaí polataíochta atá i gceist agam anois, mar dúirt mé an rud céana seo in áit áirithe eile cúpla bliain ó shoin.</P>
      <P>Ní mór an smacht atá ag aon Rialtas ar na rudaí seo, nuair a dhéanfá machnamh ceart air.  Tá dhá rud le thabhairt fé ndeara&mdash;na hearraí a tugtar isteach sa tír seo ó thíortha eile agus na hearraí a deintear sa bhaile, i dteannta torthaí, agus na barraí a gheibhtear ón talamh.  Maidir leis na hearraí a thagann ísteach ón taobh amuigh tá siad go mór fé thionchar na rudaí a thiteann amach ar fud an domhain.  Nuair atá an scéal amhlaidh is beag is féidir le haon Rialtas a dhéanamh chun an costas maireachtála a laghdú.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ach má deintear iarracht ar chuid den na hearraí a choiméad amach beidh daoine ag gearán go bhfuil an Rialtas ag séanadh rudaí ar na daoine a ba chóir a bheith acu.  Ansan, an dara rud, maidir leis na hearraí a deintear anseo agus i dtaobh na mbarraí a gheibhtear ón talamh d'fhéadfaimis an costas beatha a laghdú maidir leo súd.  Ach an ceart san a dhéanamh? D'fhéadfadh Rialtas luach na cruithneachtan a laghdú, luach an bhiatais a laghdú agus luach an bhainne agus an <Col N="45" /> ime a laghdú ar na feirmeoirí.  Ach an cuspóir ceart é sin don tír?  Ní dóigh liom é.  Do dhéanfadh cuspóir dá shórt díabháil don tír sa deire mar d'éireodh na feirmeoirí as an deaobair atá ar siúl acu nuair nach bhfaighdis luach ceart saothair.  Do b'oth liom go mór é sin.</P>
    <P>Nach mar sin atá an scéal?  Aon duine anseo nó sa Tigh eile a labhrann i dtaobh an chostais mhaireachtála a laghdú, an bhfuil sé sásta éirí agus a rá gur ceart luach na néarraí seo atá luaite agam a laghdú?  Ní dóigh liom go mbeadh éinne, go mór mhór daoine a bheadh ag brath ar thoil na ndaoine, sásta é sin a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Ní mian liom mórán eile a rá, a Leas-Chathaoirligh.  D'fhéadfadh díospóireacht an-leathan a bheith againn ar an mBille seo&mdash;An Bille um an Acht Soláthairtí agus Seirbhísí&mdash;ach beidh am eile againn chuige sin.  Is mór an rud é go bhfuil sé ar aigne ag an Rialtas deire a chur leis an saghas seo Bille agus na nithe a bhíonn sa mBille seo a thabhairt isteach i mbuan-Acht. Sábhálfaidh sé am na Dála agus na dTeachtaí.  Beidh fhios ag na daoine cá mbeidh eolas cruinn le fáil i dtaobh na rudaí seo.</P>
    <P>Mar fhocal scuir do b'oth liom go mór dá ndéantaí aon laghdú ar na praghasanna atá le fáil anois ag na feirmeoirí ar a mbarraí agus ar na torthaí talún -rl, praghas an bhainne, an ime, praghas cruithneachtan agus biatais, fiú amháin chun an costas maireachtainte do laghdú.  Is fearr go mór an t-airgead a thabhairt dár bhfeirmeórí féin ná é leigint amach go tíortha i gcéin chun na hearraí sin a cheannach.</P>
    <P>Mar dúras, aontuím gur maith an rud é dá ndéanadh ár muintir níos mó oibre, ach is dóigh liom go n-oibrigheann síad chomh dian le muintir mórán tíortha eile, ach ná fuil eolas ealadhanta acu ar a gcúrsaí ná maisínreadh go leor, ach tá an scéal san ag dul i bhfeabhas go maith.</P>

      <P>First I should like to congratulate Senator O'Brien on a fine and valuable contribution to our debate this evening.  I might describe it almost as the pivot or keystone of our debate.  Later I should <Col N="46" /> like to venture to offer some criticism of one point in it.  But on the whole I would like to voice my agreement with its main conclusions.</P>
      <P>He emphasised, and very rightly, as I think, that investment is not in itself a desirable aim.  We must look beyond a mere policy of investment.  He emphasised that economic policies aimed simply at creating employment can be ultimately harmful.  I think it was very necessary to emphasise that. Here we see a conflict, perhaps, between the economist and the Party politician.  To the economist this policy leads ultimately, he thinks, to the country's harm.  On the other hand the Party politician must think in terms of those many floating votes. He thinks to some extent, at least, in terms of that.  We must face that fact.</P>
      <P>Here there is a clash between economics and Party politics.  But that is where the statesman comes in. I believe that in all our main Parties in this country we have statesmen who are prepared to balance the two forces in that conflict.  There may be a need for compromise.  There may be a need for give and take.  But I look to those statesmen&mdash;I could name them but I do not think it is necessary&mdash;to do their duty in this head-on collision, not to yield to the demands of the Party politicians for easy votes and not to forget the economists' warnings.</P>
      <P>There is also the importance of Senator Professor O'Brien's warning that by keeping our protection and subsidies at too high a level we are endangering the present and future welfare of our country.  Further, there was his emphasis on the fact that it is the income-tax payers&mdash;one-seventeenth of the total population of the country&mdash; who are bearing the main weight of our subsidies.  I do not think that this can be emphasised too often.  It is a source of grave discontent in a hardworking and important valuable element in our population.  I would urge the Minister to bear it constantly in mind&mdash;the fact that the main burden is being carried by one-seventeenth of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="47" /> Again, we must pay the closest attention to his warning that posterity will have to pay for our present spree &mdash;I use his own word &ldquo;spree&rdquo;&mdash; which we are enjoying at the moment. We are living beyond our income in many ways and if we do not pay for it our successors will have to.  Those are grave warnings, valuable warnings and predictions based on expert knowledge and I urge the Minister and the House to bear them carefully in mind when considering matters of policy such as are before us this evening.</P>
    <P>There is one point on which I would with great deference venture to cross swords with Senator O'Brien on his own territory of economics.  He said that the control of prices ought to be kept down to a minimum, that there should be as little control of prices as possible.  He said that to control prices is like nailing down the hand of the barometer.  I would ask him: Is that a fair analogy?  The barometer operates in a free atmosphere.  It records acts of God, the rise and fall of the atmospheric pressure.  No one comes in and induces artificial pressure, artificial temperatures, artificial rainstorms and frosts, but I suggest that our Ministers of State are creating an artificial atmosphere to a certain degree.  Sometimes we feel the cold which they have created; sometimes we feel the wind and the rain when they open certain doors; and we who have to buy things must reckon with that.</P>
    <P>I would say that in a natural economic system we should have free competition.  It is with great deference and great compunction I argue with Senator O'Brien on this.  But surely in an unnatural economic atmosphere control must enter in.  We, the buyers, feel that certain things are dearer than they would be if tariffs were removed.  Senator O'Brien himself has told us that the internal price level is out of step with the external price level in many respects.  We are afraid that there is some exploitation of this artificial atmosphere in our country.  The barometer is not moving in a free atmosphere.  The atmosphere <Col N="48" /> is partly controlled by the Government and in such circumstances I would claim it is no more misleading to alter the scale on the barometer or even to hold the hand of the barometer than to control the atmosphere round us.  Analogies are sometimes misleading and I challenge Senator O'Brien's analogy on that point.</P>
    <P>To leave aside such metaphors, the facts are simply this: If our traders are given special advantages and special helps there will have to be careful scrutiny to prevent abuse of their special privileges.  Let me emphasise this&mdash;because I fear the wrath of some members of the House if I am misunderstood&mdash;that there are many just traders who are gaining fair and just advantage under the present system of controls and are not making more than a fair profit as a result.  But human nature is what we know it to be and I know there are various unjust traders who are exploiting this artificial atmosphere.</P>
    <P>I speak for the people who have to buy the necessities of life, the people who, whether they have a barometer or not, have to go out into the wind and the rain and buy their bread, butter and clothes.  I do not speak for scientists like Senator O'Brien who is interested in barometer readings and price fluctuations.  I speak on a matter that is simply a question of bread and butter and I claim that we must have wise control of our prices.  We have not got an environment at the moment for fair competition.  It is a complete fallacy to suggest that free and open competition within our unnatural economic atmosphere will bring about fair prices.  We have committed ourselves to an artificial atmosphere and the people who have made that atmosphere must control it wisely.</P>
    <P>Let me give a specific example of what I have been talking about.  I want to ask the Minister a question. I am relying on my memory but if I am not right I hope the Minister will correct me when I say that he was recently asked a question in the Dáil about wheat and cornflakes.  As well as I remember, the facts are these: in Belfast at the moment you can buy a <Col N="49" /> package of flakes&mdash;I am not sure whether it is wheat or cornflakes but it does not matter&mdash;for 1/4.  In the Republic you will pay 1/10 for the same package of flakes.  The Minister will correct me if I am not accurate in saying that he said he had no evidence to show that there was very great demand for these cornflakes and was not prepared to interfere on that account. Surely this is a case of flagrant excess of price, 6d. difference between our price and the price of the same package of flakes across the Border. The Minister said, I think, that the retailers in this country simply asked for 6d. more as their profit.  I think that is outrageous and that it is a case for the prices control body to step in.  I would like to assure him from my own personal experience that a great many people in this country rely on these flakes as a staple element in their diet. As a matter of fact I have heard most curious stories of the machinations of these manufacturers in flakes, stories of deals between overseas firms and local firms to charge various prices, and so on, with the result that whatever the details of the transactions are, the price of flakes has gone up sensationally.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear what the Minister has to say about that.  I can assure him that flakes are an important element in my diet and in the diet of a great many other people like me. We feel it is wrong that we should have to pay so very much more for them.  I ask the Minister if he or his Department are prepared to do something about it.  I have stated the case as an illustration of what I believe&mdash; that as long as we have an artificial economic system which I admit we may need at present, we must have careful and impartial price control.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a slice of a very important Bill and in so far as it gives an opportunity of discussing certain aspects of economic policy, we have to welcome it.  I was very glad indeed to hear the Minister in his introductory speech saying that this is possibly the last occasion on which such a Bill would be produced in this House because this matter of legislation by Order embodies the application <Col N="50" /> of a very dangerous principle which negatives any kind of democratic Government. While it may be necessary to have such Orders and such legislation implemented during a time of crisis, certainly five or six years after that crisis has passed there should be no necessity for its continuance.  However, if the Bill did nothing else than help to evoke that brilliant address of Senator O'Brien, with which I disagree to a very great extent, it has justified its introduction here.</P>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister on his speech when presenting the Bill.  I agree more with him than I do with Senator O'Brien in his attitude on various aspects of our economic progress.  Senator O'Brien spoke rather quickly, so he will forgive me if I misquote him.  It seems to me that neither the Minister nor himself has decided whether external assets are a vice or a virtue.  I think that under certain conditions, such as those we have been living under in the past, they have become a vice and have no virtuous qualities.  Senator O'Brien gave as the second reason for repatriation of external assets that it would need a pressing need to justify repatriation unless they returned an equally high yield as that in the country in which they are presently invested. On the other hand, the Minister said&mdash;and I agree with him entirely&mdash;at column 1751 of the Dáil Debates for the 10th November:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;There is obviously no sense in keeping abroad financial resources which could be more profitably employed at home, and, in case that observation of mine is misunderstood, may I make it clear that, in using the expression &lsquo;profitably employed at home&rsquo;, I do not confine their use to purposes which are profitable in the financial sense.  I disagree with the view implied in the Central Bank Report that external assets should be repatriated for utilisation here only if they can earn more money here than they are at present earning abroad.  We could be satisfied with a much smaller financial return if the general economic or social consequences <Col N="51" /> were sufficient to justify the change....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien argues that the Minister is wrong and the second reason he gives for repatriation is that they must give an equal yield to that of their external investment.  Surely, in the light of our present conditions here agriculturally and industrially, that is an outmoded point of view?</P>
    <P>I am disturbed by one aspect common to both the Minister and Senator O'Brien, a sort of virtue in itself in external investments.  The Minister says it is a good thing to have them.  I would say it is a good thing only under certain conditions, that they are no asset to this country in the real sense of the word if they are outside our own control and not yielding something which is of social or economic benefit.  Senator O'Brien said that it is more important to develop exports than to build up employment.  He said that arising out of the point that it may be essential to have a repatriation of some nature. Surely these things work together.  I would be inclined to the Minister's viewpoint that it was more important to employ people in our own industries than even to develop exports.</P>
    <P>I was rather surprised to hear the Senator say that Irish exporters were finding it difficult to sell in American markets.  I would like to point out that that is due only to the fact that America is the most highly protected country in the world.  It seems to be the fashion here to decry protection at home, but if Irish goods are failing to find a market abroad it is not because they are not competitive in price but because they cannot surmount the tariff barriers of a much higher nature than here.</P>
    <P>It may be that Irish styles are different from American, that we have not learned their market.  Most of our industries are still in their infancy. Some of them had infantile paralysis during the early stages.  There must be an opportunity given to them to grow up and to develop an export trade; and we must not decry them too much if they have not all succeeded in penetrating <Col N="52" /> the dollar barrier.  The inference I got from what Senator O'Brien said was that articles which are protected are kept high in price.  The same note runs through Senator Stanford's speech, the suggestion that Irish-manufactured goods are not as good and as cheap as those from elsewhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">

      <P>In fact, there was no such suggestion intended. I simply said that some were dearer as a result of protection; some&mdash;not all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Senator will agree with me that at the very early stage of establishing an industry, before technicians are fully run in and machines get into production and are geared up, the price of a commodity may be higher.  Speaking generally, however, Irish manufacturing industries have been for some years in reasonable competition with outside goods and in most cases the Irish goods are cheaper in price.  I would quote textiles and boots and shoes, which you can buy more cheaply here than outside.</P>

      <P>If I have misinterpreted the Senator, I apologise; but the suggestion was that Irish manufactured goods generally could not compete and that there was a tendency in this country to exploit the protective policy of this Government.  It would be very unfair if I allowed that suggestion to pass without its being refuted as far as possible.  I put the onus of proof on the people who make that statement.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I quote now from column 1739 of the Official Report of Dáil Éireann, Volume 142, number 11. In the course of his reply to the debate on the Second Stage of this Bill, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I have not the figure here for 1950.  Traders dealing in clothing made profits in 1950 representing 5 per cent. of their turnover, and that had fallen to 3.1 per cent. in 1952.  Other traders in miscellaneous goods made profits representing 5.2 per cent. of the value of their turnover in 1950, which had fallen to 4.1 per cent. in 1952.  I can give similar figures for manufacturers, but I know that Deputies, having in mind the circumstances of 1952, would not be surprised to hear that manufacturers made lower profits in <Col N="54" /> that year than they did in 1950.  The fact is, however, that in the year 1952 many groups of manufacturers made profits which were altogether too low, profits which were disturbingly low because they held out prospects of future difficulties for these manufacturers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further on, at column 1740, the Minister, in reply to a point made by Deputy Norton, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Deputy Norton contended that by reason of defective price control traders and manufacturers are making more profits now than they were allowed to make when the Coalition Government was in office.  The fact is they are making less profits now, and I think it is important for the future of industrial development that manufacturers as a whole should do better in 1953 than they did in 1952.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a refutation by the Minister of the suggestion that prices and profits had risen.  One would assume, listening to some people, that there was no control of any sort and that every manufacturer and industrialist was out to do the consuming public in the eye as hard as he could.  I wish some of the Senators here were under the control of the Minister's efficient Department.  Our prices and our profits are controlled up to the hilt. Just because the Government has aided industrial development in this country, some people jump to the erroneous conclusion that every industrialist and every manufacturer is a racketeer and is out to exploit the public.  I have heard general statements made to the effect that the people of the country are being robbed right, left and centre.  Now, the House has heard me quote the figures which the Minister gave the Dáil.</P>
    <P>This matter of price control is tied up with that of profit control.  The Prices Section of the Department of Industry and Commerce is one of the most effective organisations that I know of and I should like to disabuse the mind of any Senator who might be under the impression that he is paying an unduly high price for goods.  The labour element in the cost <Col N="55" /> of goods is probably much higher here than elsewhere.  As an industrialist, I feel I should say something about that matter.  The feeling I got as a result of the speeches made here to-day was that there was a sort of dispraisal of the work of the Minister and his policy in connection with Irish industry.  I know that the Minister can defend himself more adequately than I can but in fairness to the industrialists and to the Minister I feel that it is up to me to defend the Minister's whole policy in this matter.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate Córas Tráchtála on their work in connection with exports to hard currency countries.  I am aware that the Minister has a very effective section in his Department to deal with exports to soft currency countries but I might mention here that some of the smaller industries are anxious to export to soft currency countries.  Many of the younger industries which are expanding are anxious to do so and a little assistance of one kind or another would be of great help to them in such an export trade.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to hear the Minister's reply to a question which was put to him by Senator Johnston relative to his invitation to invest American capital here.  I do not know whether it would be fair to quote a report of the speech made by the Minister on that matter because reports are sometimes liable to misinterpretation.  However, if it is true that the Minister went to America and Canada and invited American capital to come in here, then I think we should like to hear what the Minister has to tell us about the matter.  I am not trying to discover what was at the back of his mind when he made that statement but I rather think that what he was looking for was the &ldquo;know how&rdquo; for Irish industry, which is something which we lack at the moment.  In so far as finance <i>per se</i> is concerned, I think we should like to hear the Minister's comment on the matter if it was invited.</P>
    <P>Senator Stanford suggested that we have not free competition&mdash;that there are rings, cartels and monopolies.  Only <Col N="56" /> a short while ago a Restrictive Trades Practices Bill was passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  So far I have not seen reports in the newspapers of any colossal scandal that was discovered as a result of the implementation of that Bill.  This whole atmosphere of belittlement, as it were, of the Irish industrial drive is damaging to Irish industry and it is unfair to the people who have gone into Irish industry.  Any suggestion of antagonism to the Irish manufactured article is a complete reversal of the attitude of mind of the Irish people in the early 1920s and it will negative the great work which has been done. I should like to pay a tribute to the Minister for the help he has given in the establishment of Irish industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It was natural, I suppose, that the main topic discussed on the Second Reading of this Bill should be the level of prices and the effectiveness of the Government's system of price control.  I have never attempted to exaggerate the possibilities of any system of Government control of prices in relation to the reduction of the level of prices.  I think very little can be done by any official action to determine or influence in any degree the level of prices.  It is, however, going too far, as Senator O'Brien argued, that there should be no interference at all by the Government in the regulation of prices.  It may be true that interference with prices is undesirable, that it deprives us of a barometer which tells us the economic weather or of a policeman that might check economic errors.  The conclusion, however, is not that the Government should cease price control but that everybody should cease interfering with prices in any way.  That is impossible.  Trade organisations, trade unions and other combinations will make rules and enforce procedures which are bound to affect prices one way or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My feeling about price control is that in normal times, when there are ample supplies, and assuming that the effects of the operations of the Fair Trade Commission will eliminate combinations of traders to exploit consumers, we can safely keep Government interference with trade through price <Col N="57" /> control down to the minimum, but we must ensure some means by which the individual citizen can have a complaint heard and investigated if, <i>prima facie</i>, there appears to be a case for investigation.</P>
    <P>When we have finally emerged from the emergency situation, when we have dealt, through the Fair Trade Commission, with the possibility of combinations exploiting the market, we can confine our price control arrangements within that limit&mdash;the establishment of some official organisation to which the individual citizen can go to complain that, in respect of some article, either prices generally are too high or that he, in a specific instance, was overcharged, knowing that there will be powers of investigation, if investigation appears to be necessary.  But a great deal of this discussion upon prices has been completely unrealistic and that is true in respect of those who criticised the whole idea of price control and those who urged that it has been ineffective.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien started off by saying he was glad I had said that the principles of the 1947 Bill had been dropped.  I said nothing of the kind. I still think the principles of that Bill were fundamentally sound and any system of price control that does not recognise the soundness of these principles is bound to be a failure.  What were the principles of that Bill?  It was framed in the belief that efficiency of the productive methods employed in industry had a far more important effect on prices than the profits taken by manufacturers.  I am certain that is true, and I am certain that any system of price control, such as we had before the war, which was concerned only with the margins of profits taken by manufacturers or traders, is bound to be ineffective.</P>
    <P>Even Senator O'Donnell, speaking as a manufacturer, fell into the same error.  He argued that manufacturers made less profits in 1952 than in 1950 and that proved that the level of prices in 1952 was justified.  It proves nothing of the sort.  Prices could have gone up and profits could have gone down, and that rise in prices could have been completely unjustifiable if it was due to the introduction of restrictions <Col N="58" /> by trade unions, the maintenance of obsolete methods of production, or of some costly method of buying raw materials which could be eliminated, and towards the elimination of which some Government-investigating body might be able to give a powerful impetus. Whatever form our legislative proposals for the permanent supervision and investigation of prices may take, I would not advise Senators to assume that I have completely abandoned the principles and views I held in 1947.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Higgins asked what evidence is there that a proper system of price control is operating.  What evidence is there that there is not? No Senator or Deputy tried to suggest that there was evidence that excessive prices were being charged for anything. Senator Stanford spoke about cornflakes, but the Senator is probably not aware that he was talking about a particular brand of cornflakes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Which are not Irish manufactured, either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing that happens in relation to that can upset his diet because it has become available on the Irish market for the first time in 20 years.  The manufacturers of that particular brand of cornflakes came to me to discuss their project to manufacture them here.  Their proposal seemed to involve a not inconsiderable increase in employment in a particular area and consequently I facilitated them by getting certain decisions taken by the Revenue Commissioners on which their project depended, but, from an overall supply point of view, I could not care less whether their particular cornflakes were on the market at all or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other firms in the country which could produce cornflakes&mdash; perhaps a different type of breakfast foods&mdash;which will suit Senator Stanford or any other Senator as well as these particular cornflakes.  The fact that they are now being manufactured here and sold at a higher price than in Belfast is not a condemnation of the policy of protection.  It means that <Col N="59" /> the Dublin grocers decided that they would not sell them at the margin of profit the Belfast grocers were prepared to take, and, presumably, they would have taken that decision, even if they came in completely manufactured. They may have been right or wrong in that, but I am asked to investigate that position.  I think the Prices Advisory Body and the officers of my Department have far more important work to do than to investigate the prices at which luxury foods of that kind are sold, foods which we did without for 20 years and can do without for another 20 years, if necessary.</P>
    <P>My attitude to the retail grocers&mdash; and I should like the House to understand this&mdash;is: &ldquo;I am going to control rigorously, so long as I have powers to do so, the prices you charge, the margins you have on essential foodstuffs, bread, butter, tea, sugar and other commodities in common use, and, beyond that, they can charge for non-essential supplies whatever the public are prepared to pay.  I am not going to control the margins they have upon these non-essential foodstuffs, recognising, as I do, that the margins to which I am restricting them in respect of essential foodstuffs are in some cases less than the Prices Advisory Body recommended to be fair.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>My point about cornflakes is that it has no bearing on the question as to whether the prices of Irish manufacturers are too high or too low, nor am I going to give a sweeping opinion on that question one way or the other. We have some industrial products produced here by very efficient firms and sold here as cheaply as similar commodities are sold in any other country. A number of industrial firms, because of the cheapness and quality of their products, are now developing into an export trade.  We have some manufacturers who are not nearly as efficient and to whom we may have to talk in a fatherly way at some early date, but there is no justification for a general assumption that the protection of Irish industry means that the prices of industrial products are higher than they would otherwise be. <Col N="60" /> In some cases&mdash;and I will give illustrations of this&mdash;the operation of protection here has meant that we have got our products cheaper than we would have got them from abroad. There are rings, cartels and similar organisations operating in other countries which have not hesitated to exploit this market whenever they were permitted to do so, and if I venture to mention cement as a case in point, some Senators will know what I am talking about.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Higgins probably meant to suggest that, if there was an effective system of control, prices here would have come down, would now be lower than they are, that food prices would begin to fall and fall even as much as Senator Baxter fears they may fall.  If Senator Baxter's fears are realised and if the price of farm produce declines and the price of foodstuffs in the shops falls in sympathy, I exhort Senator O'Higgins not to praise the Government for producing that result.  We will not have aimed at it.  I believe that the economic consequences to this country of a general fall in prices would be far more serious, far more disastrous, than the maintenance of the present level of prices.  I have repeatedly pointed out to the Dáil, and on previous occasions to the Seanad, that, when prices begin to fall, trade stagnates.  Even if there is a general anticipation that prices may fall, the temptation to every individual trader is to minimise his stocks.  That reduces orders to factories and causes a trade slump which can often have very wide repercussions.</P>
    <P>Rising prices may have an opposite effect in so far as the stimulation of trade is concerned but they can produce real hardship for the people affected by them.  Price stability is the desirable situation.  We have here now a fair prospect of prices remaining stable.  Senator O'Brien mentioned that over the past two years import prices have fallen while internal prices have risen.  You can prove anything with statistics provided you take the right times for the institution of comparisons. I do not think it is true to <Col N="61" /> say that between the present time and before the war there is evidence to show that our internal price level has moved out of line with the general trend of prices throughout the world. It is true that during the past two years there was a slight fall in import prices while there was at the same time a rise in internal prices, due to the higher prices paid to farmers for agricultural produce and increases in wage rates during that period.</P>

      <P>Some figures were published in the Press last week showing the general level of prices in some countries.  These comparisons are often of a very doubtful validity.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the end of the war we are roughly about middle so far as Europe is concerned.  In ten European countries the cost of living rose by more than it rose here and in nine by less, so that we are just average.  I am not claiming that we are more than that.  It would be serious for the country if our internal price level went up in a different direction to the world price level because, as Senator O'Brien stated, we have got to get an increased volume of export if we are to improve our living standards and carry through the various social programmes to which we all appear to be committed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have urged on all sections of our people&mdash;manufacturers, traders and workers&mdash;to realise that we have reached a turning point in our economic development, a point at which attention must be concentrated in greater degree upon the development of our export trade and that all <Col N="62" /> sectional policies should be reconsidered right across the whole board in relation to that national need.  If any one section of our people decide that they are not going to co-operate in creating the conditions in which increased export business will be possible, then we will not get it and if we do not get it we will have continued unemployment and emigration and a lower standard of living for those left in the country.</P>
    <P>It is true that we have some prices which are out of line.  They were deliberately put out of line with world prices for reasons of national policy which may have been good or bad.  We are paying our Irish farmers for wheat a price which on a properly comparable basis is about £6 per ton higher than the world price.  As a result we are getting a considerably increased acreage of wheat, so rapidly increased that certain problems are being created and which will have to be dealt with in the near future, problems of drying, storage, transport, and even finance.</P>
    <P>There may be a difference of opinion as to what acreage of wheat it would be desirable to maintain in normal times.  A Government committee which sat shortly after the war decided that 250,000 acres would be ample to give us a reasonable security and to keep the tradition and knowledge of wheatgrowing alive thoughout the country. We got 350,000 acres of wheat last year and we may have 450,000 acres next year.  There may be circumstances in which it may not be a bad thing to have that substantial increase, but there may also be circumstances under which it could be a financial burden.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is true to say that our social welfare or health services are so out of line with other countries as to constitute an excessive burden on our production.  I do not think that is true.  So far as transport is concerned we are not the only country in the world where transport loses money and has to be subsidised by the State.  There are very few countries in which that is not true.  If our plans, which I hope to bring to the Oireachtas in the near future, operate to eliminate the loss <Col N="63" /> and the need for a subsidy we will have achieved the position of which other countries will be jealous.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien referred to certain remarks of mine regarding the repatriation of external assets.  He said that the repatriation of external assets by engineered deficits in our balance of payments is justifiable only in circumstances of exceptional trade depression or some military, social or political crisis or to provide social amenities like houses and hospitals and then only if the export trade was expanding so as to hold out the promise of making good the gap in due course.</P>
    <P>He then went on to refer to my observations on the report of the Central Bank to indicate his own personal agreement with the views expressed in that report.  They seemed to me to suggest that it was undesirable that we should repatriate external assets by any deliberate policy unless we could hold out the prospect that they would earn here dividends or interest equivalent to those which they were earning abroad.</P>
    <P>The sense of that argument I cannot see.  It is based on the assumption that the only benefit which is derived from investment in this country is the interest earned on the investment, the dividends paid to those who made it. Surely it is impossible to invest any substantial sum of money in a productive activity here without distributing, in the process of earning the dividend, substantial sums in wages to workers, or in buying materials which will benefit other producers, without giving benefit to the nation far in excess of the amount of interest earned on the investment.</P>
    <P>It seems to me to be taking a completely false view of the value of investment in productive activity to judge it solely by the interest earned by it in relation to the interest it could earn abroad.  I am quite certain there is no country in the world which would utilise its resources in accordance with that principle, and there is no reason why we should do so.  So far as the individual owners of external <Col N="64" /> assets are concerned, I fully appreciate that they cannot be induced to realise them and use them for some productive purpose here unless they can be assured that they will get as much if not more than they would get by keeping them abroad, but so far as the national resources generally are concerned, and so far as Government policy can determine the use of these resources, there is every reason for encouraging the repatriation of these assets for investment here whether or not they earn a financial return equivalent to what they are earning abroad.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donnell's view in regard to external assets is akin to regarding the winning of a prize in the Hospitals' Trust sweep as a disaster. I am always very glad to find the balance in my bank book in black ink. That is precisely what I meant when I said that it is a good thing to have reserve resources.  What are reserve resources?  They are vouchers, or evidence of entitlement to supplies of goods from abroad.  If the circumstances visualised by Senator O'Brien were to come to pass, and there was an outbreak of foot and mouth disease which made it impossible to export cattle, these are the reserve resources on which we could draw to buy raw materials and to keep up the level of industrial activity here.  How the possession of such reserves could be regarded as an evil is beyond me.</P>
    <P>They are assets.  They are described as assets, and that is what they are. They are worth preserving as they are until we can find a better use for them.</P>

I agree that investment is not an end in itself or that employment is not an end in itself.  What I meant to imply and what I now say is that in my view in the circumstances of this country with emigration continuing, with the unemployment problem still there, a fair <Col N="65" /> rule of thumb test of the effectiveness of any economic policy is its effect on employment.  Even though I recognise it as no more than a rule of thumb test it is one the Government is prepared to accept.</P>

    <Title>Intoxicating Liquor Bill, 1953&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been introduced for two purposes.  The first is the granting of an intoxicating liquor licence for the central bus station in Áras Mhic Dhiarmada.  The second is the preservation of licences attached to public-houses which are demolished by local authorities in the course of slumclearance, street-widening and so on.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides that the licence for the bus station will be granted, and renewed from time to time, on the basis of a certificate from the Minister for Industry and Commerce specifying the part of the premises to be licensed. The Minister will not be entitled to include in the certificate any part of Áras Mhic Dhiarmada which is not part of the bus station as it is only to the bus station that the Bill applies. The licence will be an ordinary &ldquo;on-licence&rdquo;, subject to the ordinary law relating to opening hours and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>C.I.E. will not be required to go to the Circuit Court for a certificate <Col N="66" /> authorising the granting of the licence. The reason is, of course, that once the Oireachtas has decided that a licence should be attached to the bus station, there is no case for adjudication by the court.  The decision will already have been taken by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The second part of the Bill is designed to remedy a defect in the existing law.  At present, if a public-house is demolished by a local authority, the licence is extinguished and, while compensation is payable, there are times when monetary compensation, however fairly assessed, does not really recompense a person for the loss of a business which may have been in his family for years.  In addition, of course, the compensation payable is a heavy burden on local authorities.  There is no reason in equity why, because of a defect in the licensing laws, they should have to pay this compensation or why the publican should have to give up his business entirely.</P>
    <P>In the other House, certain fears were expressed that the provisions relating to premises demolished by local authorities might lead to a serious interference with the rights of existing publicans in an area in which the new premises would be erected.  I would point out, however, that such fears are groundless, because Section 7 of the Bill provides specifically that unless the premises are erected on the old site, or as near to it as makes no difference to other publicans, the new licence may be refused by the court on the ground that it would be unreasonably detrimental to the other publicans' trade.  This is a special right of objection, introduced to ensure that existing traders are fully protected against unfair interference; it is a right much more favourable to them than the right under existing law to object on the basis of the number of existing licensed premises in the area.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would explain that there is no question in this Bill of vesting in the local authority the power to issue a licence.  The local authority will issue a certificate under Section 6, but possession of that certificate is no guarantee that the court will authorise the issue of a licence.  The court will give its decision on the merits; the certificate will do nothing more than <Col N="67" /> indicate to the court that the application is one to which the provisions of this Bill will apply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has the knack of making things look very simple.  This is another Intoxicating Liquor Bill and this Act may be cited as the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1953. &ldquo;The Licensing Acts and this Act may be cited as the Licensing Acts 1833 to 1953.&rdquo;  Apparently, if you want to know what the licensing law is, you have to examine legislation extending over 120 years and two Parliaments, one British and one Irish.  That is a rather extraordinary state of affairs. The very great number of Acts make it very difficult to know what the law is.  One would imagine there would be some effort made to consolidate these various Acts so that one could know what the law was, so that various decaying or entirely decayed branches may be lopped off.</P>
      <P>It is also curious that the Bill consists of two parts which seem to be quite dissimilar.  Perhaps the arrangement is to see that if you want one part you must take the other.  I am rather neutral, like the Minister himself, on the question as to whether people are going to get drink or how they are going to get it but it is curious that there are two parts in the Bill.  As the Minister spoke this evening, it was clear that the two parts of the Bill are conceived in two completely different ways.  From Section 6 onwards, an effort is made, he says, to remedy the injustice which happened owing to previous legislation, that is to say, where a local body gave compensation for the destruction of a public-house the licence was extinguished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now proposed that, subject to the courts, another licence should be granted and the rights of other traders in other parts of the country are protected by reference, if necessary, to the courts.  In other words, if I am a trader I can be protected against other traders but nothing will protect me against a State body.  C.I.E., Bord na Móna, or any of these State or semi-State bodies are put into a separate <Col N="68" /> category of their own.  They are entirely separate from other people and the courts are prevented from having anything at all to do with them or from having any opportunity of giving a verdict in regard to their operations.  The first part of this Bill gives power to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to grant a licence to C.I.E.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I know at least as much English as Senator Hawkins. Section 2 provides: &ldquo;The Minister (that is, the Minister for Industry and Commerce) if he thinks it proper that an on-licence should be granted to the board in respect of any particular part of the omnibus station may issue to the board a certificate approving of the granting of the licence.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It says that the Revenue Commissioners shall grant the licence.  In other words when the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;who is the controlling Minister of C.I.E.&mdash;decides that his particular child shall have a licence no one can prevent the child from getting it.  I know that technically the Revenue Commissioners issue the licence, but no court can intervene between that Minister and the licence he wants to get for his own child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On general principles, without the merits of the particular case coming into it at all, when we create State bodies we take further steps which bring us farther and farther on the road of complete State control, not only over transport but now over courts.  C.I.E. needs a bar and to have a bar it needs a licence.  I do not grudge it the bar or the licence, but it does not have to submit its claim to the ordinary process of law to which every other citizen is subject.  It does not need to buy a licence, extinguish a licence or establish before a court that in a particular area a new licence is required.  It does not need to give <Col N="69" /> evidence in public.  The statement that you can do it all in the Dáil and Seanad is quite illusory.  The Dáil and Seanad are not courts and it has been abundantly proved that, like most other Parliaments, they are quite incapable of carrying out the functions of a court, that is, hearing evidence and coming to fair decisions.  They do not do any such thing.  Under this Bill the Minister for Industry and Commerce takes the place of the judges.  In effect, he grants the licence, renews it, extends it or transfers it from one part of the premises to another.</P>
    <P>Although the Minister for Justice introduces this Bill and defends it, he himself is excluded from it.  It is only because of some Civil Service notion of &ldquo;keeping the file right&rdquo;, because when you see &ldquo;licences&rdquo; you say &ldquo;Minister for Justice&rdquo;, that this Bill is given to the Minister for Justice. It should be given to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The Minister for Justice is not in this Bill; he is engaged in making provision for somebody else's child and leaving his own children to starve.  Neither he nor the officers of his Department as, for example, the superintendents of the Garda Síochána, have any function in this.  Everyone knows that normally the superintendent opposes a new licence.  That function is withdrawn from the Minister, from his Department and from the courts.</P>
    <P>What we have here is, perhaps, a necessary corollary to the establishment of C.I.E.; that is to say, you nationalise transport, then you give special treatment to the bodies that control that transport and, as in this example, you oust the courts.  It is a quicker procedure but it might always be quicker if we trusted the Minister and had no judges.  It might not be better but possibly quicker.</P>
    <P>The people who feel that they are aggrieved&mdash;I do not know whether there are such persons or not&mdash;get no opportunity of putting their grievance before a court and getting a decision from a person who has no particular interest.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has an interest in <Col N="70" /> C.I.E.; he wants to make it pay and wants to give it all the facilities he can.  He is made the judge in his own case.  Previous examples quoted were, I think, Bord na Móna and Aer Lingus. That is like saying that a fellow murdered his first wife, so why should he not murder this one too.  They also are State-controlled bodies.</P>
    <P>There cannot be any analogy with Bord na Móna, with the giving of a licence for remote country places, and that of a licence for a place in the centre of a capital city.  The same thing applies to airports.  The real analogy is that when you set up a State-controlled body you give it special treatment, you take elaborate care&mdash;as the drafters of these Bills do and as planners generally do&mdash;to see that the judges have nothing to do with it. They are the great enemy of anyone who wants to plan everyone's existence and control everyone's movements. Incidentally, if I were amending the licensing code, there are several things I would do besides these two things in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The argument the Minister gives for the second part of the Bill is that existing traders have their interests protected by the courts, but the first part of the Bill makes it absolutely certain no one will have any recourse to the courts in connection with it.  I say, in conclusion, that I have no enmity towards C.I.E. and no objection to their getting a licence.  The bus station ought to have facilities for the consumption of alcoholic liquor, but this procedure is another example of everything going into the control of the State and of ousting the courts from their proper functions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFOReilly" hpid="Mr. P.F. O'Reilly Mr. P.F. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.F. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this reading for a variety of reasons.  The principal reason is that the Minister has not made any case for it.  He has told us we should have the Bill in regard to the bus station because he thinks it would be desirable that intoxicating liquor should be sold there and we should have the Bill in regard to the position in Limerick and elsewhere because some people have been inconvenienced through the acquisition of licensed property by local authorities. He has not given us any details <Col N="71" /> or any information to support that case.</P>
      <P>The Minister is seeking to give the Minister for Industry and Commerce the right to issue a certificate to Córas Iompair Éireann by virtue of which the Revenue Commissioners will have no option but to issue a liquor licence. Let us be clear about this.  Some people appear to think that when the Minister for Industry and Commerce issues his certificate the Revenue Commissioners may refuse to issue the licence.  That is not so.  On the issue by the Minister of his certificate the Revenue Commissioners must issue a seven day licence for the premises mentioned in the certificate.  That licence will enable the board to sell intoxicating liquor of all kinds, not merely for consumption on the premises but for consumption on or off the premises.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned an on-licence, but I would like to emphasise that the licence which may be given C.I.E. will enable it to sell drink for consumption either on or off that portion of the premises mentioned in the certificate.  Bus passengers may have dozens of stout and bottles of whiskey loaded up in the bus seats beside them.  Later on, I will suggest&mdash;if I see the Minister is making any headway with the Bill here; I doubt if he will&mdash;that the licence be restricted to a sale for consumption on the premises only, so that we may not have the unedifying sight of bus passengers having buses packed with liquor which they bought in the bus station.</P>
      <P>Now, perhaps the Minister is right in saying or suggesting that it would be only proper that at this bus station people would be entitled to purchase liquor.  There is nothing wrong in saying that.  I suggest that if we are to give the Minister for Industry and Commerce the power to issue the necessary certificate, we should first satisfy ourselves that there would be a real demand for the purchase of drink at a bus station such as this.  I do not think there will be any demand beyond a very small demand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.F. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I may be wrong in thinking that there will not be any great demand.  My suggestion, submission and view is that there will not be any demand by the ordinary decent travelling public for the equivalent of a first-class public-house at this bus station.  I think that the vast majority of the travellers who will frequent this bus station, and the visitors to the bus station who go there to meet arrivals or to send off departing travellers will require not intoxicating liquor but ordinary nonalcoholic refreshments.  I suggest that the facilities already available in the district of the bus station will be sufficient to meet the requirements of those people who would like a drink. I put that part of my case in that way and I think that the Minister has no answer for it.  I do not think there will be any demand for drink.  We, in this country, are not so addicted to drink that we must have a full licence for the sale of drink on or off premises at every station which we erect, whether it be a bus station, an airport or a turf station.  We have not reached the stage that we cannot do without a drink.  It is suggested here that the position will be so bad from the point of view of the drinker in this bus station that the station must have a full licence&mdash;not merely a licence to drink in the bus station, but a licence to take away a dozen of stout so that the traveller can enjoy his trip either to Clondalkin or to Skibbereen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.F. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>He will not have the temptation that he has while he is in the bus station where he can load up merely by the process of holding out his hand.  Let us assume that there is such a demand for liquor. I do not believe we are so mad on having drink as some of the people opposite suggest, but let us suppose, for the sake of argument, that we are so keen on loading up with drink every time we set out on a journey.  Why will C.I.E. not be obliged to go in the <Col N="73" /> ordinary way, as Seán Browne must go, to the Circuit Court and there put its case to a Circuit Court judge as to whether or not it should be given an intoxicating liquor licence?</P>
      <P>In 1902&mdash;many years ago, of course &mdash;the Intoxicating Liquor (Ireland) Act, 1902, was passed.  The effect of that Act was virtually to prevent the issue of new licences&mdash;not completely but it was intended by that Act to limit the granting of new licences. Exceptions were made.  A bus station application for a new licence would come within such an exception.  C.I.E. would have to prove certain increases of population and they would also have to prove that there was not already a sufficient number of licensed premises in the vicinity of the bus station.  If Seán Browne must go to the Circuit Court to get a new licence, why must C.I.E. not go to the Circuit Court? The answer is that C.I.E. is a nationalised concern.  As Senator Hayes said, a nationalised concern&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.F. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>We did&mdash;but I am endeavouring to ensure that we are not going to nationalise licensing and that we are not going to take away from the courts the power to grant licences.  I want to ensure that nationalised concerns will not be treated in any preferential way.  I want to see that they will start with the same difficulties and the same restrictions as the ordinary citizen.  The ordinary citizen does enough for nationalised concerns.  I do not think we should enable nationalised concerns to contend with him on more favourable terms than he can get.  I see no reason why any facilities should be given to anybody or any concern&mdash; nationalised or otherwise&mdash;in regard to the granting of new licences.  I am sure that we will be told&mdash;not merely once but several times&mdash;that we have precedents for this.  We have Bord na Móna huts, the airport, this and that. I am not bound by precedents.  Further, neither of these two cases&mdash;the airport or Bord na Móna canteens&mdash; is on the same lines as this licence. The canteens were in the main, miles away from, say, licensed premises <Col N="74" /> where a person could get a drink.  The airport also was far away from licensed premises.  We had persons there going on exceptionally long journeys who required to be catered for.  I will not say anything about the airport licence: perhaps it would not be fair to the airport, but it might have been much better off if we did not give the airport a licence at all.  However, that is a matter on which I may be wrong.  I say that no case whatever can be made for a licence for this bus station&mdash;none whatever.</P>
      <P>There are ample licensing facilities in the immediate vicinity of the bus station, if people want to avail of such facilities.  I further say that I am not at all of the opinion&mdash;as apparently a number of people are&mdash; that all these bus travellers who will be travelling either to Ballyfermot or Ballydehob, will want to be loaded with beer, wine and spirits, prior to or during their journeys.</P>

      <P>You may use the Irish for it if you wish, but I think that the expression &ldquo;loaded up&rdquo; is a good one.  I am in a great difficulty about Part I of the Bill, that is the sections down to and including No. 5. I am, however, in a greater difficulty still in regard to the remaining sections. I assert that the Minister cannot made any case whatever for the latter part of the Bill.  I should like to know from the Minister if the local authority in that part is the county manager or the council itself.  I want to know if this matter will be solely in the hands of the manager or whether it will be a function of the council.  At any rate, whoever will have the right in the matter, he will have a right to issue the certificate. There is no obligation on him to do it.  Mark you, if he issues the certificate <Col N="75" /> he will issue it in respect of a particular site acquired by the council and approved by them as a site for a licensed premises.  I do not know what power a local authority has to acquire a site for a licensed premises.  If a local authority acquires property&mdash;I am speaking generally, now&mdash;it acquires it for housing or for road widening.  If they are to acquire property for one of such purposes, I do not know how they can give it for use as a site for licensed premises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.F. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that one of the functions of a local authority is not to acquire a site on which may be built a licensed premises. The person to whom this certificate will be given is to be a person who has already lost a licensed premises. That is the way it is put&mdash;&ldquo;lost a licensed premises.&rdquo;  Mark you, however, that he has lost his premises for which he has been given proper compensation. Where premises are acquired by local authorities, either the owner accepts his compensation by agreement, where he is satisfied with the offer made by the local authority, or he challenges the amount of the offer and goes to arbitration.  The arbitrator is either selected by agreement between the local authority and the owner of the property, or, in default, is appointed from a panel.  Such an arbitrator, sitting to hear claims for compensation, takes into consideration the fact that a licensed premises is a licensed premises, that it has a value as such, and makes his award accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arbitrator having made his award to the property owner, the Minister now seeks to give further compensation to the property owner because his property was acquired, but the Minister apparently overlooks the fact that he has already been paid for the property acquired.  I cannot follow why, in such circumstances, the Minister should now seek to put such a person in a position in which he may, on getting a certificate from the local <Col N="76" /> authority, proceed to build a new house.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that he must go to the Circuit Court and pass the circuit judge.  I do not think he should have any difficulty in passing the judge, having got a certificate from the local authority, and I should like the Minister to tell us why he seeks to give a new site on which a licensed premises may be built to a person who has already been fairly and properly compensated for the licensed premises acquired.</P>

      <P>Let us be clear about this.  The person from whom the licensed property is acquired is paid compensation, according to the value of the property, in the opinion of the arbitrator.  Once he makes his award for the licensed premises, the local authority pays that money and I challenge any Senator to show me in this Bill or in any other Act where a local authority, in such case as is covered by this certificate, may withhold 1/- of the compensation.  I cannot follow this at all, but perhaps the Minister will clear it up for me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the bus station, as I understand the position at the moment, the State is the owner of the entire premises and they have let portion of the premises to C.I.E.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard a great deal of talk on what is really a very simple matter in relation to the Store Street bus station.  We have heard about the position of the courts and the main objection to the provision in this Bill appears to be that the matter is not left to the courts.  One obvious difficulty is that, as the law stands, in spite of what Senator O'Reilly says, the bus station at Store Street could not get a licence.  Senator O'Reilly points out that the 1902 Act provides that if there is a sufficient increase in population a licence can be got, and suggests that that applies to Store Street.  But where is the increase in population?  I do not know that there is any increase in the population in the Store Street area, so that, as matters stand, a licence cannot be got.  Therefore, some form of legislation is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion is that this legislation should be brought in, assuming that we decide a licence is required, and that it should be then left to the courts to give the licence.  Surely the matter at issue is one which Senator O'Reilly spent a considerable time in discussing&mdash;whether we feel here, as the Dáil already has decided, that a licence is required at Store Street?  If we decide that, if the two Houses of the Oireachtas decide that a licence is needed, where do the courts come into <Col N="78" /> it?  I take it that Senator Hayes and Senator O'Reilly do not intend that the part played by the courts should be purely formal, that we should decide a licence is required for the central bus station and that the courts should then sign on the dotted line and hand out the licences.  If their interest in the preservation of the rights of the courts is to be at all realistic, it can only mean that they wish the courts to be entitled to overrule the expressed wish of the two Houses of the Oireachtas and should be able to say: &ldquo;Admittedly, the Dáil and Seanad decided that there should be a licence, but we feel, for this, that or the other reason, that there should not.&rdquo;  Surely that is not a matter for the courts.  It is a matter for the two Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>If we decide, whether we be right or wrong, that a licence should be part of the new bus station, the courts should not enter into it.  It is not a function of the courts to decide a matter of that kind.  The ordinary licensing law is administered by the courts because the State decided over the years that, in regard to the thousands of different cases, involving different types of applicants and premises and those looking for premises, the courts are the obvious instrument to make the decision, to decide to whether the prospective licensee is fit to hold a licence, whether the premises are suitable and whether there are already enough premises in the neighbourhood.  The State decided that these matters are best left to the courts.</P>
    <P>Let us take one individual instance, such as the bus station.  It need not be a nationalised concern; it could be a private company or firm.  If the Oireachtas decides that a licence is required, it is very difficult to see where the courts come in at all.  I can see no advantage whatever in leaving it to the courts as a purely formal matter, that they should hand out the licence once we have decided the matter.</P>
    <P>We come, therefore, to the only problem involving the Bill&mdash;whether we feel that a licence is required.  My own view would be that it is almost <Col N="79" /> self-evident that, in a bus station of this nature, it is desirable that there should be such a licence.  Every railway station in the country of any size whatever has such a licence and presumably all these railway stations have had the licence for many years past because the demand was there. Senator O'Reilly admitted that it was required at an airport where one might be going a long plane journey&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is perfectly clear.  In fact, a very strong case has been made for installing a licence on those premises.  That being so, I think there is no derogation in regard to the court in proceeding the way we are.  It has nothing to do with whether C.I.E.  It has nothing to do with whether C.I.E. is nationalised or not.  If they were still a private company, exactly the same provisions would have to be made.  If we decide that a licence is required, this is the only practical way of dealing with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that Senator O'Reilly is travelling a little off the beam when he suggests this is going to force local authorities to pay twice over, to pay compensation to a man in addition to giving him a new licence.  I think the position there is also reasonably simple.  If a man gets compensation it implies that he has been paid for his loss.  If he suffers no loss he gets no compensation.  That is clear enough.  If he is given a new premises and licence, it offsets against the original premises and licence which were held to be nonexistent. Otherwise, the compensation is much smaller than it would have <Col N="80" /> been.  It is very difficult to see why a person should be paid compensation if he suffered no loss.</P>

      <P>That is exactly what Senator O'Reilly, Senator Hayes and myself propose to object to.  I object to that mentality.  I think this is an outrageous proposal and particularly outrageous that it should be brought in by the Minister for Justice.  I should imagine that if the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Lands were to come in here with this proposal you might find some excuse for them.  I find it very hard to excuse a proposal of this sort emanating from the Department of Justice and formally presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas by the man charged by the Government to see to the administration of justice in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What does this Bill amount to?  I am referring to the part which empowers the Minister for Industry and Commerce to decide whether or not a premises is to be licensed.  It amounts to this.  We have had over a period of about 120 years carried forward to the present day the particular pattern of licensing law.  That may be good or bad.  I am perfectly well aware that many people feel that the licensing laws require urgent amendment.  But in any event you have the pattern there and you have the courts set up charged under the licensing code to decide whether a particular premises <Col N="81" /> should or should not be licensed. Senators Yeats and O'Reilly have indicated to the House the matters which the court must consider in deciding whether a licence should be granted or not.</P>
    <P>These are matters of public knowledge because licensing cases are usually fairly fully reported in the newspapers.  The Courts can refuse a licence if they feel the character of the applicant is such that a licence should be refused.  They can refuse a licence if they decide that the premises are not suitable and by virtue of the provisions of the 1902 Act if a licence is sought at the moment&mdash;I am speaking about a licence for the ordinary individual&mdash;he must satisfy the court with regard to a particular percentage increase in population, I think it is 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>I understand there might be difficulty in the particular civil parish in which the Store Street bus station is situate in fulfilling that condition but so far as I know there is not another civil parish in Dublin where the 25 per cent. increase in population has not occurred and I think if the figures were given for this particular parish it would be found that the percentage increase has occurred.  However, the Minister did not even bother informing the House whether that condition would have been complied with or not. It is a simple matter for him to get that information from his officers and at least it is information which is relevant to this Bill and should be put before the House.</P>
    <P>My main objection to this provision is that I believe it is entirely wrong for a Minister, particularly, as I say, a Minister for Justice, to introduce legislation of this type differentiating between the treatment meted out to the ordinary trader and the favouritism being shown to a State body or State concern.  I believe that that is bad and it is unfair to the traders in the locality and it certainly should not be encouraged as a precedent in this House.  I know that the cases of Aer Lingus and Bord na Móna have been quoted as precedents.</P>

      <P>I would not mind if liberty was given to serve wines with meals under an innkeeper's or a caterer's licence; nor, in fact, do I resent in any way the suggestion that the Store Street station should have liberty to have a public bar and to sell intoxicating liquor.  That is not my argument at all.  I would welcome that if it were done in the proper way through the courts.  I would not even mind if the law was loosened up a bit if difficulties with regard to the percentage increase in population, for instance, existed.  But I do object to the way this is being done, to the fact that traders in the locality and elsewhere in Dublin are being taxed, first of all, to erect this place in Store Street to the tune of £1,000,000 or £2,000,000; that they are taxed to the extent of £63,000 or £68,000 to put in furniture there and that the publicans in the neighbourhood, besides being taxed for this purpose, now find that their money is spent on the creation of a powerful rival in trade, because that is what this amounts to.  Remember, that when the Aer Lingus facilities were being granted an assurance was given to the Oireachtas that that licence would be used only for the purpose of seeing that travellers to and from this country were supplied with liquor.  That undertaking was not fulfilled.</P>

      <P>If the Senator would give way for a moment I would like to explain that.  That allegation was made by a Deputy and I was not able to contradict him at the time.  I had the whole of the debates on the Liquor Bill of 1943 scrutinised and there was no undertaking of that kind whatever given and neither was there any asked. That brief has been given out, but there is no truth in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am wrong I apologise and I withdraw it unreservedly, but I would like the Minister to check on whether an undertaking was given but was not given in the Dáil. Whether an undertaking was given or not there was an understanding there on the purpose for which the facilities were being granted and instead of allowing the supply of refreshments to <Col N="83" /> incoming and outgoing travellers we find that magnificent building being used in a first class way for entertainment. Some of us may like that and others may not, but the point is that it must be taking business and trade from hotels and similar entertainment centres both locally and in the City of Dublin.  I think the same thing exactly is going to happen here.</P>
      <P>Senator Yeats says that if this House and the Dáil decide that a licence is needed where do the courts come in.  I want to remind Senator Yeats that the Minister has not decided either here or in the other House that a licence is needed.  All he has suggested and the most he can suggest&mdash;and probably all of us will go with him in this&mdash;is that a licence is desirable.  It is an important matter and should be a matter for the courts to decide whether a licence is needed. Senator Yeats is a lawyer and he knows the procedure obtaining at the moment.  He knows the type of evidence which can be given to the courts to show whether a licence is needed or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred a while ago to Aer Lingus when the Minister interrupted me.  I was going to refer also to Bord na Móna.  I do not believe it is fair to quote Bord na Móna as a precedent for the bringing in of a Bill of this type.  Some other Senators pointed out that in the first place you have in regard to the facilities granted to Bord na Móna the question of canteens, where men are completely isolated, unable with any case or comfort to obtain intoxicating liquor, unable to get refreshment or to go to licensed premises.  Apart from that it is probably true to say that the canteens, particularly those of a temporary nature to which these facilities are granted, are buildings which would be condemned by any court as unsuitable for licensing and that in that way, unless special provision was taken, there would be no question at all of these canteens being licensed.  Consequently, it is not fair to quote Bord na Móna as being a parallel case.  In Dublin at Store Street you have a building about which many of us have different views, <Col N="84" /> but you have a building at any rate which we know would not be condemned by the courts as being unsuitable. Therefore, no parallel exists.</P>
    <P>I take it also there is no question of the character of the applicant being objected to by the courts on the grounds that he would be unsuitable. It seems clear there would be no question of the premises being condemned as being unsuitable.  What are the obstacles left?&mdash;that there is not the necessary increase in the population over and above 1902.  I would have no objection at all if the Minister came in and asked to have that position loosened up if the increase has not taken place.</P>
    <P>The next question is, if there is a need for a new licence in the area.  The Minister has not suggested to this House nor has he suggested to the Dáil that there is a need.  If there is not a need for a new licence in the area, why not allow he law to operate just as it would operate in the case of an individual?  Why not let it be thrashed out in court; let the pros and cons be discussed there; let evidence on behalf of the applicants and on behalf of the objectors be heard by the Circuit Court judge and adjudicated by him.  If he decides against the licence, C.I.E. can appeal to the High Court and have a complete new hearing with a fresh mind and a fresh judge.</P>

      <P>Senator Yeats posed the question that if we decide a licence is needed where do the courts come in.  First of all, I pointed out&mdash;and I do not believe the Minister will contradict me in this&mdash;that neither he nor Senator Yeats has endeavoured to make the point that a licence is needed.  I agree that a licence is desirable.  That is not the same thing. This proposal seems to me to be an outrageous one.  Senator O'Reilly and Senator Hayes have dealt with what appears to be the principle of State interference which lies behind this Bill.  It would be fantastic if, just because a particular concern provides a public service, they will get around the law in that way, that they can have laws enacted to take them outside the ordinary run of things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You might just as well say that because the Land Commission in Merrion Street performs an important <Col N="86" /> duty and because a number of civil servants there may have members of the public calling in to see them, they should be entitled to get a licence. Even if it were our considered judgment that a licence were needed for the bus station, is this the proper way to go about it?  Senator Hayes has analysed the Bill.  I would ask the Minister to consider again what is in the Bill.  He is giving power to his colleague in the Department of Industry and Commerce to decide absolutely, without interference from anyone, without advice or guidance from the Department of Justice or any other Government Department, whether a particular building in this city is to get a licence or not; and he is making it obligatory on the Revenue Commissioners to grant a licence if a certificate is given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He goes further than that&mdash;he is giving <i>carte blanche</i> to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to shift and change that licence to different parts of the building whenever the Minister for Industry and Commerce changes his mind.  Again, the Revenue Commissioners will have no option but to grant a licence once the certificate is produced.  Even if we decide a licence is needed, is that the right way to go about it?</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister for Justice is being very weak-kneed in this.  It is his job to see that equal treatment is meted out to this concern and to ordinary traders.  It should be his duty to see that the business is properly conducted, but he is shelving his responsibility, he is shovelling it off and there is not one Guard in this city who will have a right to interfere with C.I.E. or the Store Street bus station, no matter how the business there is conducted.</P>

No matter what the ordinary licensing laws may say, no matter what authority they may give to the Gardaí or the Minister for Justice and no matter how those laws are implemented in relation to the Store Street bus station, by the Guards doing their duty or by the Minister for Justice or the courts doing their duty, none of that will prevent the Minister for Industry and Commerce issuing a certificate again, and once that certificate is issued nothing will prevent or can prevent the Revenue Commissioners issuing a licence.  I say that by allowing that situation to arise the Minister is being weak-kneed, he is shelving his responsibility and he is not facing up to the task he was put into office to do.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Higgins, in conclusion, gave us several &ldquo;no matters&rdquo;; but the fact remains that, until Senator Hearne intervened, the impression was conveyed that the Gardaí would have no authority to interfere in the conduct of the business at the bus station bar.  That was the impression we got. It was the same impression that Senator Hearne had, and I am sure the records when printed will show that what I have said is correct. Senator O'Reilly began by saying that his main reason for opposing the Bill was that the Minister had made no case for it.  That is the worst possible reason that a person could give.  Any person who has any knowledge of the people would have concluded, on reading the Bill, that the provision of a bar in the bus station was essential for the travelling public.  Evidently Senator O'Reilly has no knowledge of the people.</P>

      <P>In his next statement the Senator said that there was no demand for facilities for drink at this station.  I say again that he does not know anything about the ordinary travelling public.  He suggested that the fact that people could take drink for consumption off the premises and could load up with drink&mdash;inside or in their pockets&mdash;was a reason why we should not grant the licence.  I have travelled quite a lot on buses, trains and motor cars.  I might not want to take a dozen bottles of stout with me, or a bottle of whiskey, as was suggested, but I might reasonably wish to take a glass of whiskey at the bus station or at some stop on the road. If I were aware that it might be difficult to get a drink on the way, I might wish to take with me some supply, because I would like it, but the suggestion that we were going to have the unedifying spectacle of people indulging in large quantities of &ldquo;booze&rdquo; in our passenger vehicles was an unworthy suggestion for the Senator to make.</P>

      <P>The fact remains that from the bus station in my town in Clonmel a man may load up, inside him or in his pockets, with all he needs.  I have travelled a lot in those buses and I have rarely seen people under the influence of intoxicating liquor.  The travelling public in this country are very well conducted.  I venture to say there is hardly a terminal bus station in the world like this one where you would not find a licence similar to what we are providing for to-day.</P>
      <P>One rather extraordinary thing struck me in the arguments I heard. Someone said this was intended to accommodate C.I.E. or do harm to the traders, but there was hardly one suggestion from any person who spoke from these benches that the people who are responsible for this Parliament should be accommodated in any way. I think they are the first concern of this House.  What we should be trying to do here is to see that the best possible provision is made for the people, whether they are travelling or whether they are in their own towns.</P>

      <P>We will come to that some time if it is necessary.  Coming into this bus station will be buses from every part of Ireland&mdash;North, South, East and West.  Some of them will go journeys of 140 or 150 miles.  It would be a shocking thing if within the station we had no accommodation for them so far as drink and other catering amenities are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="90" /> The Senator suggested that they could go out to the pubs in the area. Country people sometimes&mdash;at any rate, I find a certain type of them so &mdash;are very slow to go into pubs and certain types of public-houses.  At the same time, they will go into a public-house of the kind which we are trying to set up here.  I know that, from my own personal experience and from observation.  I do not know whether there are any pubs in Store Street and I am merely putting the point of view that a person who might not be willing to go into a public-house in Store Street might not, on the other hand, have the slightest objection to going into the bar in the bus station, when it is opened.  I think that this amenity is a grave necessity.  It is just as necessary as the bus station itself&mdash; and goodness knows we have waited long enough for that.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Higgins said that people are being taxed to provide the bus station.  I maintain that they have value against that tax.  We now have something which we should have had three or more years ago and which we would have had earlier were it not for certain happenings.  However, we now have the bus station.  The only objection that is made here is that we are not getting the licence through the courts.  Senator O'Higgins was satisfied that we should have this amenity at the bus station.</P>
    <P>I approve of the Bill 100 per cent.  The section dealing with people who lost their business, which may have been in their family for 100 years or more, is only just and fair.  The Minister is merely doing justice when he provides that, instead of compensation in cash, such a person can be compensated by giving him a business which his sons and his sons' sons can continue when he has gone.  It might conceivably happen that the owner of a public-house which the local authority decided to demolish would not wish that another public-house be erected for him instead.  I am reading this Bill as a layman, but my understanding of it is that, in such circumstances, the local authority can give the owner a cash compensation instead of erecting a new public-house for him.  At any rate, that point is obvious.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="91" /> I welcome the Bill, and I think that the objections to it which we have heard so far are foolish.  I hope that, some time, I will have the pleasure of going into this licensed premises&mdash;and by that time, I am sure, both Senator P.F. O'Reilly and Senator O'Higgins will be converted to the view that the licence is an urgent necessity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be brief, as a good many of the points which I intended to make have been made by Senator Loughman and some other speakers.  I want to refer to the point made by Senator Yeats&mdash;a point which Senator O'Higgins made no attempt whatever to deal with.  Instead, he circumvented it.  It was a very simple point.  It is that if we do not grant a licence to Áras Mhic Dhiarmada to sell intoxicating liquor by this method, is there any other method by which we can do so.  The answer, in my opinion, is &ldquo;no.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Senator O'Higgins referred to the ordinary processes of law.  He knows well, as Senator Yeats pointed out, that they would not do at all here. The Circuit Court Judge would be constrained to follow the law as he finds it, even though he himself might be inclined to grant the licence.  He would not be able to grant it unless, as has been pointed out, the population of the district increased sufficiently to warrant it.  Are Senators in favour of giving a licence to Áras Mhic Dhiarmada to sell intoxicating liquor?  They should express themselves in unequivocal terms in that regard and do away with all this nonsense about interfering with the rights of the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Higgins mentioned favouritism and said that we are extending favouritism to C.I.E.  If some of the Senators opposite who have spoken had their way, there would be another kind of favouritism.  If the licence were not granted to Áras Mhic Dhiarmada to carry on the business of selling intoxicating drink, the local publicans would do it and I submit that they would be placed in a very favourable position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the other traders in this city.  I see no objection at all to this measure.  I have not heard any straightforward statement <Col N="92" /> yet from those Senators on the opposite side who have spoken as to whether or not they are against this Bill.  Senator O'Higgins said that it is desirable.  I submit that it is only a very small step from something that is desirable to something that is essential. I think that it is essential for large crowds of people who have to travel on long journeys to have a place open to them in Áras Mhic Dhiarmada to which they can have access for the purpose of buying a drink, if they require one.  That is the system all over the world.  Anybody who has travelled abroad will agree that at the bus termini and at the railway stations there are licensed places where refreshments can be procured.  We have here in Leinster House a special licence for the accommodation of members.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to claim official immunity, first of all, by stating that I broke the licensing laws some weeks ago in Áras Mhic Dhiamada with the connivance of the Minister for Health.  I am entirely in favour of the granting of this licence.  The fundamental principle that arises here&mdash; though a lot of people are avoiding it <Col N="93" />&mdash;is that which was originally raised by Senator P.F. O'Reilly, namely, the question of the licensing of a State-owned organisation.  I should like to present a different aspect of the case. I am not thinking of the licensing of a premises for the sale of intoxicating liquor but of the granting of a licence to a State or a semi-State organisation. The Minister for Industry and Commerce could come along here to-morrow and make a very good case for the granting of a special licence to Gaeltarra Éireann, who manufacture a certain type of commodity in competition with certain other people.  The question which disturbs me very much is that of the granting of a licence to a semi-State organisation.</P>
      <P>I have not heard the Minister or anybody else explain why it is not possible to apply to the courts for a licence for Áras Mhic Dhiarmada. Why is it not possible?  I understood Senator O'Higgins to say that it was possible for the Minister to prove that the necessary increase in population had taken place.  Why, then, is it necessary for a semi-State organisation to have special legislation passed here? Is there any real reason for it?  If the Minister could convince me that there is a real reason for it and that there is no other way of granting a licence I would be in entire sympathy with it, but I am very much more disturbed by the general principle involved than by the mere matter of granting a licence for this bus station.</P>
      <P>The position is that any Minister&mdash; I do not care what Party he belongs to&mdash;can put up a good case why, in particular circumstances, special powers should be given to him to enable him to give a special type of facility to a State or semi-State owned organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a very dangerous position. Whether it applies to the granting of a licence for the importation of yarns to Gaeltarra Éireann or a licence to Áras Mhic Dhiarmada, I think it is a dangerous precedent.  I do not think that semi-State owned organisations should have any more rights than the common man and that is the only reason I object to it.  It is necessary that this central bus station should <Col N="94" /> have the amenities the Minister seeks to provide, but his method of asking for them leaves me rather doubtful.  I do not agree, however, with Senator O'Reilly that people will go down to the bus station to get loaded up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFOReilly" hpid="Mr. P.F. O'Reilly Mr. P.F. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.F. O'Reilly</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if I misinterpreted the Senator, but I do not believe at all that the licensed portion of the bus station will be any more abused than any other public bar elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I am not at all convinced that, in the matter of compensation, an arbitrator&mdash;from my knowledge of them, they usually take about ten years before making an award&mdash;will grant any extra money if a licence does not go with the premises at the time of the giving of the compensation.  I do not think any arbitrator will overpay, but I am really worried about the fact that we are here giving something without precedent.  I agree that similar facilities were afforded to Bord na Móna, where the circumstances were different, and to Aer Lingus, where they were slightly different, but here we are granting the Minister power to grant to a State-owned organisation facilities which might, or could possibly, react against individual citizens.  It is only on that ground that I am inquiring whether there is a way out of the Bill, because I am entirely in favour of granting a licence to Áras Mhic Dhiarmada.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>I see no reason why they should not have it at Store Street. However, I agree with Senator O'Reilly that the method of granting the licence is wrong.  If it is necessary to bring in a special Bill, I fail to see <Col N="95" /> why a special Bill could not be brought in to grant the licence to Store Street on the very same terms and conditions as those on which they hold the licence at Kingsbridge.  If the licence is granted on those conditions, I do not think that many of the abuses which other Senators fear in regard to this method would make themselves felt.  I think C.I.E. should have this licence&mdash;I see no reason why they should not&mdash;and I am in favour of giving it.</P>
      <P>There are a couple of points on which I should like some information. I presume that there will a responsible individual in Áras Mhic Dhiarmada to look after this bar.  There are many bars throughout the country with responsible individuals in charge of them but which often fall foul of the law, not through any neglect but through sheer good nature, if you like.  I could visualise a position in which the Guards might find people drinking in Store Street a few minutes after a certain time and might take certain action.  It is possible that the licence would be endorsed and, in the case of three endorsements, the ordinary licence goes. If this licence is endorsed three times, if it would be endorsed at all&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Or 20 times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentMcHugh" hpid="Mr. McHugh Mr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;will it, like the licence at Kingsbridge, cease automatically? If it does, will the Minister for Industry and Commerce issue a certificate and will the Revenue Commissioners reissue the licence?  I should like to have that point cleared up for my own information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention was made here of various other places in respect of which special provision was made for the sale of liquor.  In these places, special prices are charged.  The people who make use of Store Street are the ordinary working men and women of the country &mdash; working men, farmers, tradesmen and business people.  These people are already paying sufficiently high prices for drink and I should like some attempt to be made to ensure that C.I.E., who are getting special <Col N="96" /> privileges under this Bill, will not charge extra prices there.</P>
    <P>They already do so in many of their other bars, but they are getting a specially privileged position under this Bill, and I suggest that some Minister &mdash;possibly the Minister for Justice or the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;should suggest to them that they should not take the fact that they are getting a special bar licence from the Oireachtas as a licence to extort money from the public through excess prices.  The ordinary man and woman are paying enough in the normal public-house prices and I do not think C.I.E. should be given any opportunity to extort extra prices from them.  I am entirely in favour of the other provision in the Bill and I have no comment to make on it.  I think the Bill is one which should be passed.  The method by which C.I.E. are to get the licence is debatable. My friends do not like it, but I make no comment on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Great exception has been taken to the method by which the licence is granted.  I can see nothing wrong with it.  What is happening here is that the Oireachtas, when it passes this Bill&mdash;the Bill passed through the other House without a division&mdash;decides that this bus station ought to get a licence, and the function of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the matter is to indicate what particular portion of the bus station in Áras Mhic Dhiarmada the licence should apply to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the point raised by Senator McHugh, as to whether or not the licence would be endorsed if there is found to be illegal drinking there, the idea of endorsing a licence is that, when a certain number of endorsements have been put on it, the man running the public-house loses it and is put out of business.  What will happen here, I have no doubt, is that if the Guards, in the exercise of their duty, discover that the premises are not being properly conducted, that rowdy conduct is allowed and that illegal drinking is going on, the man in charge of the bar will lose his job. That is the same thing as a publican <Col N="97" /> having his licence endorsed so many times.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentMcHugh" hpid="Mr. McHugh Mr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is. I said that the man in charge may be a responsible individual, no doubt, but responsible individuals throughout the country have found their premises being raided a few minutes after a certain time, with resultant endorsement of the licence.  There is no rowdy conduct. It could happen through inadvertence. I am putting a case that might not happen.  I want the information for myself.  What would happen, Sir, if three endorsements are put on that licence?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing I would say. That is my opinion.  Senator Hayes thought I was trying to codify the licensing laws.  Work in that connection is proceeding slowly in regard to other laws.  We have not yet got near to codifying the licensing laws. I cannot see where the court should come in.  I think Deputy O'Higgins dealt with that himself when he said that the court decided whether the person looking for the licence is a proper person to have a licence or whether the premises are suitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Those are the things the court should decide.  We are deciding where there ought to be a licence. The Minister simply gives a certificate that such and such a portion of this bus station will be reserved for the licence.  If in some time to come it is found that it is in a different portion of the premises, then in the certificate the Minister will say that it should be changed to this portion.  Senator O'Reilly raised the point in connection with county managers.  I am referring now to that portion of the Bill which makes provision in the case of a demolition and a certificate for a licence has been issued in substitution for the other district.  The certificate will be issued by the county manager, but the selection of the sites and all the rest of it will have to be done under the Housing Acts by the county manager in conjunction with the local <Col N="98" /> authority.  Both will have to work together in such a case.</P>
      <P>It has not been found that there was a 25 per cent. increase in the population around the Store Street area.  I admit that I did not attempt to make any case to prove that there was need for a bar.  I thought it was self-evident.  I thought that everybody who travels knows that in every terminus of that kind there is always a bar and that drinks can be got.  I did not make the point because I thought it was quite clear.</P>
      <P>The other point made was that they would charge more.  It was suggested in the other House that they would be so unfair that they might charge less in order to take trade from the local publicans in Talbot Street.  If they charged more the people in Talbot Street would be very pleased, as it would mean that people would go to their premises instead of going to the bus station.</P>
      <P>I think this is a simple Bill.  With regard to that portion of the Bill which deals with giving a licence where there has been a demolition of a premises that is a long-felt one.  It has held up a big housing scheme in Limerick.  Dublin Corporation are also concerned about it.  Where the new premises might be situated somewhere other than in the area where the houses originally stood, the Bill provides, under Section 7, every safeguard that would reasonably be expected to be given to the licensed trade.  I do not think there is any danger that the legitimate business of any existing trader will be interfered with in any way.  That was brought in at the request of the Limerick Corporation and of the Deputies of all Parties representing the County Limerick.  I know there is a need for it also in Dublin, Cork and other big centres.  Therefore, we are just making provisions for something that is very necessary.</P>

      <Col N="99" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Childers) Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Childers)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is scarcely necessary for me to inform the house that the telegraph service is being run at a serious loss.  This loss amounted to £141,000 in 1939/40; it was £403,000 for the year 1951/52, and for 1952/53 it is estimated at £430,000.</P>
      <P>A number of factors have contributed to this position.  Operating and maintenance costs have more than doubled since 1944 and more than trebled since 1937; the volume of messages carried by the telegraph services has been declining steadily from year to year, and the existing rates of charge for ordinary and press telegrams, which have been undisturbed since 1937 and 1920 respectively, bear little or no relation to the level of current costs.  It is difficult to give any precise estimate of the loss per telegram at present but I am advised that on average the Post Office loses at least as much again as the charge paid by the sender.</P>
      <P>We are not, of course, alone in having the problem of a losing telegraph service.  Practically every country in the world has had a similar problem.  In Great Britain, where the population is much more dense and evenly distributed than in this country and where telegraph rates are higher, the loss on the service runs to about £4,500,000 at present and is, I understand, giving rise to serious concern. Our problem is accentuated by our sparse and scattered rural population.</P>
      <P>It is easy to suggest ways of reducing a loss of this kind without increasing charges.  The most attractive is to cut charges in the hope that traffic will increase enormously and the loss per telegram may be reduced if not eliminated. Unfortunately, this course is out of the question if your charges are already basically uneconomic.  That is the position with regard to existing telegraph charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A second possibility is to reduce expenditure drastically by economies and by more efficient methods.  That course has been and is being followed <Col N="100" /> to the maximum extent practicable. Already morse working has been abolished at a large number of offices, teleprinters have been installed at the larger centres and telegrams are being voiced over telephone lines in cases where that is the most economic way of disposing of the traffic.  We cannot, however, hope to effect economies of anything approaching £400,000 a year in this way.  We are therefore compelled to take the only other course open to us to help to bridge the gap, viz., to increase charges.  I do not think the Post Office can be accused of precipitation in this matter.  There are few, if any, services available to-day at 1937 prices, let alone 1920 prices.</P>
    <P>I need hardly labour further the point that increases in telegraph charges are necessary.  They are clearly justified and the purpose of this Bill is to enable such higher rates as may be decided upon to be brought into force and to be amended from time to time, as may be necessary, without further legislation.  Briefly, it proposes to repeal the statutory limits on inland telegraph rates and press telegraph rates contained in Section 1 of the Telegraph Act, 1928, and Section 16 of the Telegraph Act, 1868, as amended by Section 1 of the Post Office and Telegraph Act, 1915, and so enable these rates to be adjusted from time to time in the light of the costs and general finances of the service.</P>
    <P>With regard to the higher rates of charge proposed, I am not in a position to make an announcement because I wish to have every aspect of the telegraph service examined before new charges are fixed.  I have accordingly set up a departmental committee to undertake an exhaustive examination and to report to me.  Apart from any possible economies which may be possible as a result of improved methods and organisation, it will be necessary to decide to what extent, if any, the telegraph service should continue to be subsidised by users of other Post Office services and/or the taxpayer.  The telegraph service is a declining service because mainly of the rapid progress <Col N="101" /> being made in the extension of the quicker and more convenient telephone service.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, it is difficult to conceive of the telegraph service being entirely superseded by the telephone service; and unless you can dispense with it altogether you must retain telegraph staff and maintain telegraph lines and apparatus to provide the service.  In some respects, the telegraph service has been invested with the character of a social service but the ordinary person of poor or limited means uses it so infrequently that the benefits conferred by cut telegraph rates are of little a value to him.  It must also be remembered that there is probably a limit beyond which increased telegraph charges will not bring in additional revenue.  I have merely touched on these aspects of the problem to indicate that the question of fixing higher charges is not a very simple one and it is preferable to defer the matter pending the fullest consideration than to take decisions now which may have to be modified within a short time.  When the new charges are decided upon, they will be fixed by statutory regulations which will be laid before both Houses, and it will be open to all members of either House to discuss them by way of special motion.</P>
    <P>This Bill may be criticised, as it has been in the Dáil, on the ground that it will reduce control of the Oireachtas over the telegraph service.  As I have already indicated, it will be necessary to lay regulations fixing new charges before both Houses of the Oireachtas so that the control will not in any real sense be impaired.  Moreover, in proposing that telegraph charges should be fixed from time to time by statutory regulations, the Bill will do no more than bring the procedure for revising telegraph rates into line with that which operates for other Post Office charges such as postal and telephone charges.</P>
    <P>At one time similar limits applied to postal and certain other Post Office charges but they have all been removed, the last limit of the kind on the postal side being repealed by the Post Office (Amendment) Act, 1951, the Bill for which was prepared in the time <Col N="102" /> of the last Government.  I believe there is nothing really contentious in this Bill and I recommend it to the members of the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is wrong that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs should bring in a Bill of this type as distinct from Budget legislation. What is proposed to be done in this Bill is quite clear.  The Bill is a very short one and unless a person went to the bother of reading the various Acts referred to it is just three meaningless paragraphs.</P>
      <P>I understand the position to be that by this little three-section Bill a Minister is putting himself in the position to increase telegraph charges and that he is not indicating to the House what increases he proposes to impose on the public.  It is quite clear from the figures which the Minister has given that he is facing a situation in his Department where money is required, that money is going to be raised by taxation of one kind or another.  To my mind, the proper way in which to raise the money and the proper time to do it is when the annual Budget is introduced.  What the Minister is proposing here is to tax the people further.  He may argue that he is being honest and straightforward about it, that the losses are incurred by his Department and that he is going to jack up the charges in his Department to offset these losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see no reason why this could not be done by announcing the introduction of this legislation or similar legislation as part of the Budget statement and Budget policy.  The only protest I have against this Bill is that, and contrary to being honest and straightforward in introducing a Bill of this kind, I believe the Government and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs have hoodwinked the public.  Over the last six or eight months, starting with the Taoiseach, every Minister of State has been bemoaning the fact that the community here is taxed too high.  The Taoiseach himself used the expression that the people are staggering under the weight of taxation.  That has been the note sounded by various Ministers for some months past and, instead of showing their sincerity and earnestness <Col N="103" /> when they make speeches like that, we find that while taxation may not be increased in the Budget, straightway the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs proposes increased charges of one kind or another.  It may be that they are necessary.  I complain that if they are necessary the straightforward and honest thing to do is to explain that when the general financial and economic review is taking place during the Budget discussion.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to give the House some information about this Bill.  Quite frankly, I have not been able to study the earlier Bills which are referred to in the three sections here.  I want to know if I am correct in saying that the position is that the law, as it stands at present, fixes maximum charges and that it is only by introducing these repeals that the Minister can secure authority to increase these charges now.</P>

      <P>If that is correct, and the Minister tells me it is, the next thing I want to know is, will the Oireachtas have control over the Minister and his Department in fixing the increased charges?  I do not think it is right that the Oireachtas should pass over the authority to any particular officers in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  The Minister indicated, in introducing this Bill, that any regulations made would be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am satisfied if that is given as an assurance, but I want to know has it also got the force of compulsion. Does the law compel the Minister to lay the regulations before both Houses of the Oireachtas?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Higgins says this is a very simple Bill, but he did his utmost to contradict what he said. Of course, he is entirely wrong when <Col N="104" /> he suggests that this is a question of taxation.  No question of taxation arises at all.  If anyone sends a telegram he is merely paying the Post Office for services rendered.  If he were in the United States of America and wanted to send a telegram, he would go into the office, fill up a form and pay the amount required.  That would not be taxation&mdash;especially in the case of America, as the telegram would be sent by a private concern.  If he goes through the same procedure in Ireland he is also paying for services received. The fact that it is the State which transmits the telegram does not in any way alter the form of payment&mdash;it is still for services rendered and it is not taxation.</P>
      <P>Whether it is taxation or not&mdash;and I maintain very strongly it is not&mdash; there is no additional call on the public.  As the Minister pointed out, the Post Office expects to lose this year £430,000 on the telegraph service. If by increased charges the Minister is able to do away with that loss and runs the service without losing any money next year&mdash;it is not likely he can go that far, but let us hope he can reduce the losses, if he can increase the charges in time and sufficiently&mdash;that section of the public which uses the telegraph service will have to pay £430,000 in addition to what it pays at present; but, as against that, the section of the public which pays taxes will be saved £430,000.  If any element of taxation arises under the Bill, it is that there should be less taxation and not more, that there should be a general saving to the taxpayers of anything up to a maximum of £430,000 and some of the general public&mdash;some of whom never send a telegram&mdash;instead of being asked to hand over an increasing annual sum in respect of this service, will be asked to pay less.</P>

      <P>I have not much to say, except that naturally as a businessman and a member of the business community, I regret anything that is going to mean further expenses and further costs on the operation of business. I must confess that I was quite impressed by the Minister's presentation <Col N="105" /> of his case.  What struck me about it as interesting was the fact that all the factors he enumerated as being the cause of the loss and as causing the necessity for raising prices for telegrams were all the same factors that we in business encounter to-day. If the Minister is able to get his Bill through the Dáil and now through the Seanad with the approval of both Houses, I hope it will at least make people more sympathetic to the difficulties of business people nowadays.</P>
      <P>I happened to walk into the Dáil this afternoon for a few minutes and I heard a man talking about the immense profits being made in business nowadays.  It seems to me that a wrong atmosphere is being created by that sort of talk.  What really happens is that a few spectacular cases are picked out of people who happen to make profits because of some particular circumstance.  The same could be said of a Government Department.  It might have been said a year ago about Aer Lingus doing so well, that therefore all these Government places should be able to reduce all their prices.  That is the kind of comparison we get nowadays.  For that reason, I am sympathetic to the Minister.</P>
      <P>I was glad to see that he told us that he had scouted all the ordinary ways of dealing with the situation without raising prices, before bringing in this Bill.  He mentioned that he had tried to see if the Department could be run more efficiently by cutting down costs and doing things in a better way.  I should say this about the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs: I think he has made a great improvement in the postal services and that they are efficient nowadays.  For that reason, I think he has brought a good case here; but I would like to get this bit of kudos for the business community.  I hope that he&mdash;and, through him, the other members of the Government&mdash; will be more sympathetic to the difficulties of the business people to-day.</P>

      <P>Senator McGuire <Col N="106" /> showed sympathy with the difficulties we have had to face in the Post Office. First of all, I would like to deal with the speech by Senator O'Higgins.  He suggested that there was something deceitful about my action in introducing this Bill.  I have made speeches in the Dáil and up and down throughout the country, making it perfectly clear that I regard the Post Office as a semi-commercial service and that the public should regard it as such. It has nothing to do with taxation.  I dislike taxpayers having to pay a sum&mdash;which could quite easily run into £2,000,000 or £3,000,000&mdash;in order to subsidise what should be&mdash;and, as I have said before, I hope will always be&mdash;a semi-commercial service.</P>
      <P>It so happened that the increased charges for the telephone and postal service were made around about the time of the last Budget.  Before I increased charges, I was anxious that the full effect of 14,000 miles of new trunk circuits should be in evidence in the telephone service and I was particularly anxious to be able to say to the users of the postal service that only 10 per cent.  of all the regional deliveries were restricted in the sense of not being a daily post.  I managed to be able to achieve both these improvements in the service just around about the time of the last Budget and, as a result, the increased postal and telephone charges were introduced at that time to overcome a very serious deficit.</P>
      <P>We do everything we can in the postal, telegraph and telephone services to insist on a good output.  There is no branch of the Civil Service where a higher proportion of the staff is subject to measurement of the amount of work they can do.  We know, regarding accountants, roughly how many telephone accounts can pass through their hands.  All through the country, thousands of postmen have their walks checked to ensure they are doing their work with reasonable efficiency and reasonable dispatch.  We have an entire section devoted to methods of business organisation, called the O. and M. branch, led by two very able men who have been trained in business methods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="107" /> For a number of years they have been reducing the cost of the service by thousands of pounds, by introducing changes of a business kind, eliminating unnecessary forms, simplifying forms, eliminating forms of accountancy whose cost is far greater than it should be for that particular type of item.  As a result, the traffic of the three services has increased since the beginning of the last war by 70 to 135 per cent. in the various services, but the staff has increased by only 28 per cent.  There has also been a very big increase in the output of the engineering branch, which deals with the telegraphic and telephone side of the services.</P>
    <P>The reason why we have been able to maintain the service as a semi-commercial institution is two-fold. First of all, I can commend to the House the officers of the Department, who are efficient people and a zealous body of men.  The second reason why we have been able to do it is that successive Governments have wished that the service in all its branches should pay for itself and, if there happens to be a deficit in one particular branch, that another branch should help to subsidise it.  We could argue for a long time as to how far the three branches should be self-dependent.  In most countries of Europe there is an element of subsidy from one branch to another.</P>
    <P>The first reason, as I have said, is the efficiency of the staff.  The second is the willingness of the successive Governments to make these services pay.  The three services have lost £500,000 in 20 years of operation.  In some years there were profits, in other years there were losses, while in others there was more or less an even balance in the accounts.  Half a million pounds are a negligible percentage of all the turnover of the three services taken together.  I might add that the last Government during its period of office raised charges by £1,000,000 a year, taking the two services, postal and telephone, together.  I have every admiration for their so doing.  They raised charges on three separate occasions.  On the last occasion they <Col N="108" /> left the proposals for me to implement.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated already, the last Government prepared for introduction the Post Office (Amendment) Bill, 1951, which I brought through the two Houses of the Oireachtas and which eliminated all the remaining types of restriction upon the increasing of postal and telephone charges, restrictions that were the result of earlier Acts, in the same way as the restrictions we are now removing in regard to the telegraph service.  Now the whole of the three services will have charges that can be increased by statutory regulations.</P>
    <P>Under these regulations, I am compelled to place the increased charges for examination by the Dáil and Seanad.  If any member of the Dáil considers that the increased charges are excessive he can raise the matter by special resolution.  I am glad the House has co-operated with me in enabling the Second Reading to be completed to-night.  I can only assure the members of the Seanad that so long as I am in charge of the services I will do my utmost to improve their efficiency and to insist at all times on their commercial character.</P>

      <P>The law relating to friendly societies is contained in the Friendly Societies Act, 1896, the Friendly Societies Act, 1908, and the Registry of Friendly Societies Act, 1936.</P>
      <P>Under Section 56 (1) of the Friendly Societies Act, 1896, a member of a registered society to whom money would be payable on death may nominate a person to whom the money should be paid on the death of the member.  The amount so nominated may not, as the law stands, exceed £100.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="109" /> In the Dáil, Deputy Cowan introduced, by way of a Private Member's Bill, a measure proposing to increase that sum which could be so nominated from £100 to £300.  The amendment entailed certain consequential amendments.</P>
    <P>The Bill as introduced was referred to a Special Committee.  The consequential amendments were introduced at the meeting of the Committee and subsequently passed by the Dáil.  The Bill, as originally introduced by Deputy Cowan, and the consequential amendments subsequently inserted, now form the Bill as it appears before the House.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the increase of the sum that could be nominated from £100 to £300.  That is contained in Section 3 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill is an amendment of Section 8 (1) of the Act of 1896.  That sub-section of the Act of 1896 provides that a friendly society which contracts for the assurance of a gross sum exceeding £200 or an annuity exceeding £50 may not be registered under the Friendly Societies Acts.  Since it is proposed in the following section to increase the sum which may be nominated to £300, it would be anomalous to retain the upper limit contained in the sub-section at £200.  Therefore, it is proposed in that section to increase that sum to £300.  It is also proposed to increase the annuity to £52 per annum instead of £50.  I think the House will agree that that is the more convenient sum.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (a) of the Bill before the House refers to Section 57 (1) of the 1896 Act which provides that, on receiving proof of the death of a nominator, the friendly society shall pay to the nominee the amount due to the deceased member not exceeding £100.  It is clear, having accepted the sum of £300 which may be nominated, that that sum of £100 should also be increased to £300.  Paragraph (b) of Section 4 refers to the deletion of subsections (3) and (4) of Section 57 of the Act of 1896.  Sub-section (3) provides that, on the death of a nominator, if the amount payable to the nominee exceeds £80, a certificate that death duties have been paid must be <Col N="110" /> produced to the friendly society before payment may be made to the nominee. The level at which liability to death duties arises has been raised considerably since the year 1896 and, as the law stands to-day, liability to death duties commences at the sum of £2,000.  In the circumstances, it is indeed feasible to dispense with sub-section (3) of Section 57 of the Act of 1896.  Similarly with sub-section (4) which provides that the Revenue Commissioners shall give a certificate that the death duties have been paid in accordance with sub-section (3).  That certificate will no longer be necessary in the case of a nomination to the extent of £300 since the death duties will not be payable in any event.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill is an amendment of Section 58 (1) of the Act of 1896 which provides that where a member of a friendly society, entitled to a sum not exceeding £100, dies intestate or without having made a nomination, the society may, without letters of administration, distribute the sum due to the deceased among such persons as the trustees decide provided that, if the net sum exceeds £80, a receipt for death duties must first be procured from the Revenue Commissioners.  That is a means of protecting the trustees of a friendly society from claims by other parties who may allege that they are entitled to benefit under an intestacy in respect of a person whose life was assured by a friendly society.</P>
    <P>Again, since the sum which it is proposed may be nominated under this Bill has been increased to £300, it is unnecessary that such a receipt as I have referred to should be procured before the estate is administered.  The effect of the section is to substitute the sum of £300 for the sum of £100.</P>
    <P>Section 6 relates to Section 59 of the 1896 Act which provides that, where the principal value of the estate of any person entitled to make a nomination exceeds £100, any sum paid without probate or letters of administration shall be liable to estate duty and the trustees may, before making payment, require a statutory declaration by the claimant that the principal value of the estate, including the sum in question, does not, after deducting debts <Col N="111" /> and funeral expenses, exceed £100.  I might remind the House that liability for death duties does not arise, except where an estate exceeds £2,000, and therefore the necessity for retaining the sum of £100 no longer arises, and, to bring it into line with the present liability for death duties, the figure of £2,000 is inserted in the section.  These are the provisions of the Bill and I think the House will have no difficulty in agreeing with it.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that there should be no difficulty in agreeing with the Bill.  It brings certain provisions of the Friendly Societies Acts into accordance with the present value of money and with the law in regard to the limit after which death duties are payable.  One wonders&mdash;I have no knowledge of the matter&mdash;this being one example, whether there must not be a great many other examples of the same kind which perhaps should be dealt with, not by a private member, but by some form of governmental machinery.  We are administering a great many Acts of the past and this is an example of sums being fixed, up to this moment apparently, in accordance with an Act passed in 1896.  There must be a great many other examples which would certainly need amendment.</P>

This Bill is entirely a Bill making certain amendments by reference to other Bills and no one would know anything at all about its effect unless he went back to the parent Bill.  This is a matter on which a particular opinion has been given expression to time and again in this House, and I think it would be far better, if all Parties recognised that it is preferable to set out in an amending Bill the entire paragraph as amended, rather than, as in the case of Section 2 of this Bill, to refer to the substitution of £52 for £50.  It would be better to set it out in a completely new section.  While, as I have said, it may sound rather queer coming from this side, this is something about which I feel strongly, in the interests of public appreciation of legislation and in the interests of members of the House.</P>
