      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 5, Section 14 (1) line 48, to delete the words &ldquo;and dental&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;dental, optical and aural&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 deal with the same point and presumably might be discussed together.  I put these amendments down because my view of the section, as amended, is that it could be read as indicating that aural appliances would not be permissible because we find elsewhere that the word is left out in relation to appliances.  I gather that the Minister did not intend to exclude aural appliances and, if so, it seems to me that some such words are necessary. I mention the matter merely to draw attention to what I think is a mistake.</P>

      <P>This matter was referred to on Committee Stage and it was thought necessary to have a clarifying amendment inserted. I discussed the matter with my legal advisers and they are opposed to an amendment of this kind, their reason being that if we put in a specific addition of this kind, it might make it doubtful whether other things would be included or not.  I might mention that in all the Acts so far in relation to public assistance and so on &ldquo;medical and surgical appliances&rdquo; has always been interpreted as covering aural and optical appliances.  What the draftsman is afraid of is that, if we specify one thing, there may be a question with regard to other, such as abdominal appliances, which might be held not to be included and he thinks <Col N="1058" /> it better not to accept these amendments. We have what we want&mdash;the inclusion of aural appliances as well as optical appliances and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it then that medical and surgical appliances do not include aural appliances because the word &ldquo;aural&rdquo; is put in in relation to treatment?  What the Minister has said is quite correct and it is the view I expressed on Committee Stage.  I doubted very much whether &ldquo;aural&rdquo; should have been put in, but when you put in the word in relation to treatment, there is a very grave danger, for the reasons given by the Minister himself, that it would be found that aural appliances were not included.  It is purely technical and I am in the hands of the Minister in regard to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is purely technical, but the reason for putting it in in sub-section (1) of Section 14 was the reference there to general practitioner, medical and surgical services.  In the case of medical and surgical services, leaving out the words &ldquo;general practitioner&rdquo;, it appears to be all right.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 not moved.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 8, Section 19 (3), line 30, to delete the words &ldquo;and treatment&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 9, Section 24, to add the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3) The references in sub-sections (1) and (2) of this section to milk shall be construed as including references to such foods derived wholly or mainly from milk as may from time to time be approved of by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been occasions in the last few years when it was difficult to get liquid milk for supply to particular recipients and when it was necessary to supply such preparations as Cow and Gate dried milk instead. It was thought necessary, therefore, to amend the section to provide that references to milk included such foods <Col N="1059" /> derived wholly or mainly from milk as may from time to time be approved by the Minister.  It is merely a safeguard in case we should find it difficult to get liquid milk and should have to supply substitutes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Fearon</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that means that vitamin D would not be provided.  I should much prefer if, in Section 24, the words &ldquo;an adequate supply of milk and necessary nutrients&rdquo; were put in rather than &ldquo;foods derived wholly or mainly from milk&rdquo;.  There are some things which are quite important to the growing child which are not at all well provided in milk, and if the word &ldquo;nutrients&rdquo; were used, instead of &ldquo;foods derived wholly or mainly from milk&rdquo; it would emphasise the importance of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is designed merely to absolve a local authority from the obligation to supply liquid milk where it is impossible to get it and to enable the authority to substitute milk foods.  There is nothing, however, to prevent them treating that milk food by way of the addition of vitamins, if that can be done.  I will take a note of it and see if it can be provided in the regulations that the necessary vitamins be added.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 20, Section 48, to delete sub-section (5) and insert a new sub-section (5) as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>( ) Where a meeting of a consultative health committee has been held in any month no further meeting shall be held in that month save at the request by resolution of the council of the county or at the request of or with the consent of the county manager.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is reasonably clear.  If you have a consultative health committee, it is reasonable to provide that, if that committee wants to meet once a month, it should be entitled to do so.  Under my amendment, unless a meeting were called by the manager or the county council, the <Col N="1060" /> committee could not meet again within that month.  Under the Bill as it stands, if the committee were to meet six times in the first month of the year, it could not, of its own initiative, meet for the rest of the year.  I put this amendment down as a practical suggestion which would enable the committee to meet once a month if it wanted to do so.  At the same time, the amendment would not give it power to create difficulties by meeting, say, for instance, every day.  I think this is a reasonable suggestion and I would ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the idea underlying the amendment is perfectly sound. This measure will add considerably to the duties and responsibilities of those who are charged with the administration of the health services.  I think it cannot now be in dispute that we are going to have responsibilities cast upon local authorities that they have not been shouldering for a number of years. The truth of the matter is that the amount of time and discussion which local authorities devote to health services is just not one-hundredth part of the time spent on the general administration of the county.  I think that is unfortunate.  The health services, as they are being administered to-day, are separated entirely from the responsibility that should be that of members of the local authorities and if we are going to get anything out of this Bill, I think that burdens and responsibilities should be put upon the local people who will be members of the consultative committee, that their opinions should be canvassed and their advice acted upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are merely to have  meetings of the consultative committees, the intention behind the Bill will be vitiated by that method of administration.  It should be possible for members of local committees to meet for perhaps an hour or an hour and a half on the day that the county council meet.  If you are going to arouse interest in developing proper health services, you can only do so by stirring up an honest appreciation of what the responsibilities of local representatives are in this matter.  The <Col N="1061" /> members of these committees should be able to meet on fixed days in the month; perhaps on the same day as the county council met or on the day that the vocational education committee or the committee of agriculture met, whichever was more suitable for the members of the committee.  Quite definitely this should not be a matter that should be left in the hands of the county manager to determine at all. I think the idea behind the amendment is perfectly sound and I support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite see the reason for tying down the members of the committee in this way and perhaps Senator Douglas would explain it.  Why is it an advantage to tie the hands of the members of the committee in this way instead of leaving them free, as in the original section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>The last statement made by Senator Stanford would require some explanation.  He asks why the members should not be left free as under the original section.  My contention is that the original section does not leave them free at all.  Under the section if the committee had met six times, it could never, of itself, call another meeting for the rest of the year.  It is because it is tied in that way that I put down the amendment, in order to provide some restriction such as the Minister wants, plus a reasonable proposal.  Personally, I would let the committee meet whenever they wanted to meet, but as the Government presumably thought that would leave them too much freedom they wanted a restrictive clause.  My case is that they are allowed practically no freedom under the original section and that they would be much freer under my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be understood that as the section stands the county council can arrange to have as many meetings of the committee as they like or the county manager can call any meetings he likes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>That applies to both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then a quorum of four <Col N="1062" /> members can requisition a meeting but, in reference to that, a provision has been inserted that if six or more meetings have been already held in any year, the requisition need not be accepted by the county manager.  I must say that I did not visualise their meeting oftener than, say, every two months.  I did not think that you would have meetings oftener than that. When you consider the very many other duties which members of local authorities have to discharge, I thought it would be rather hard to expect them, in addition to the other meetings which they have to attend at the moment, to attend more than one meeting of this kind every two months. I thought I was giving them a fair amount of liberty by giving them power to requisition meetings to bring the number of meetings in the year at least up to six.  I wanted to guard against a danger which I mentioned before.  I did not want to have, say, four rather troublesome members, if you like, having the power to call meetings without any limit.  I admit, of course, that Senator Douglas has met that to some extent inasmuch as he has inserted a limit in his amendment.</P>
      <P>It was to guard against the possibility which I have mentioned that this sub-section was inserted.  I should be surprised if a committee of this kind would meet oftener than every two months.  I should be equally surprised, if there was any genuine reason for calling a meeting, that there would be any difficulty either in getting the county manager to call a meeting, or failing that, getting the county council to pass a resolution that a meeting should be held.  I do not think it would be wrong for the county council to pass such a resolution, even if there was a meeting every month, such as Senator Douglas proposes. To have a meeting every month they could pass a resolution which would cover the year.  I think, however, there should be some safeguard for those who genuinely want to meet to do good work and I am anxious only to see that there is a safeguard there against the activities of those who may be anxious to call meetings in a vexatious way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1063" /> Senators may have thought that I was a little too restrictive in making the number of meetings in the year six. I do not feel too strongly on the matter but I certainly think that once a month would be too often to hold meetings of this kind.  It must be remembered that, apart from the very onerous duties which members of county councils have to perform, expenses have to be paid for members attending meetings of this kind.  We have to keep an eye on that because the expenses of these local authorities are being increased in many ways and I do not want to impose any unnecessary expense on them.  I know that this is a small matter in comparison with some other huge expenses which they have to meet but, even so, we must keep that in mind.  I would prefer to leave the section as it is but I do not want to resist an amendment of this kind too strongly if a majority of Senators are in favour of the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>My reading of Senator Douglas's amendment is that he is curtailing the number of meetings of the committee rather than making provision for additional meetings.  The Senator's amendment reads that where a meeting of the consultative health committee has been held in any month no further meeting shall be held in that month save at the request by resolution of the county council.  Senator Douglas lives in Dublin and he probably has not a very great knowledge of the working of county councils down the country.  Such county councils only meet once a month or once every two months.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course they do strange things in Cavan.  They probably meet every week but they do not seem to be doing very practical business there.  If a meeting has been held on the third Saturday of the month and the next meeting of that council is to be held on the first Saturday of the next month, how then can provision be made for the holding of an additional meeting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>All the objections of Senator Hawkins apply to the original section.  This is not a Party point or anything of that kind.  It is a matter of what is the more convenient method of administration.  Under the section as it stands, four members are entitled to requisition a meeting of the health committee and can only do so under very limited circumstances.  I suggest that even if every two months would be the normal meeting of the committee the risk of allowing members of the committee, as distinct from the county council or the county manager, to call the committee into being once a month is practically negligible.  Under the original section, there is a danger that you might have a controversy arising which might do a great deal of harm which the committee was trying to meet and which the council was not prepared to meet and I can see a good lot of damage being caused.</P>
      <P>I will not press the amendment, but I would not object to its being changed to a period of two months as it would meet the point.  I feel strongly that you will find you have very much overdone the restrictions in the Bill.  It is to meet that I put down the amendment, and if this could be changed to two months it would satisfy me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister if he were a member of a county council and was also a member of the vocational committee and the committee of agriculture would he prefer to try and arrange the business of the health committee for one of the days when some of these bodies would be meeting or to have a fourth meeting in the same month?  If he had 40 or 50 <Col N="1065" /> miles to travel to a meeting of one of these authorities which would he prefer? Would he not imagine that if you permit the business to remain over for two months you would have an accumulation of work which, on the other hand, would be very easily disposed of if you were meeting once a month?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be very difficult to have a meeting of this committee on the same day as a meeting of the county council or the county committee of agriculture.  I think that this committee will inevitably be a sort of visiting committee.  They are likely to hold the meeting in the county hospital and will probably spend some time looking through things.  I think a meeting, to be satisfactory, would take a couple of hours. It is not easy, as members of local authorities know, to meet, even for two hours, on the same day as any other meeting is being held.  As far as I know, the county committee of agriculture or any of these other committees usually take up the full time available between the bus times.  I think the meetings of this committee will be held on a separate day.  There is not very much in it, I imagine, but I would rather accept the amendment than try to make any change in it.</P>

      <P>In page 21, Section 51, to delete sub-section (2) and substitute the following sub-sections:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  The Minister may by Order vary the division of the functional area of a health authority into dispensary districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3) Where an Order under sub-section (2) of this section has been made, the Minister may by Order provide for such transfers, within the functional area of the health authority, of officers whose districts have been affected by the first-mentioned <Col N="1066" /> Order, as he considers necessary or expedient.</P>
    <P>(4) Before making an Order under sub-section (3) of this section, the Minister shall send particulars of the transfers proposed to every officer proposed to be transferred and shall consider any representations which may be made by any such officer within such reasonable period as the Minister may determine.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 25, Section 58 (1), line 56, before paragraph (b) to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(b) prohibiting the importation of filling material which does not conform with the prescribed standard.</P>
      <P>This amendment is put forward as a suggestion.  I do not know whether it is really practicable to put it in here. Perhaps I ought to say that I am strongly in support of the provisions of the Bill with regard to filling material. That is something which requires attention and has required it for some considerable time.  It seems to me that there should be power by which the Department of Health or the Department of Industry and Commerce could prohibit the importation of filling material which does not comply with the required standard, whatever that standard may be.  The section gives the Minister power to have a standard and that is most desirable.  I think it is a matter of some urgency.  It is rather a pity to allow it to come in and then find at a later date that it may have come in with a warranty or it may not have.  It should be so provided that you cannot import it unless the seller gives a warranty.  We have that in connection with other things which are imported and I think the Minister should have that power. This is designed to try and strengthen the Minister's hands, which I think is important.</P>

    <Col N="1067" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we have sufficient powers at the moment.  Under the 1947 Act, regulations were made dealing with this matter, and Article 18 of the Infectious Diseases Regulations, 1948, provides:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  A chief medical officer may, if he is satisfied that such action is necessary to prevent the spread of infection, require the destruction, or the disposal, in a specified manner, of,</P>
      <P>(a)  any infected, infested or dirty substance or article or any substance or article which has been exposed to infection or infestation or</P>
      <P>(b)  any substance or article of a type likely to harbour infection or infestation which has been imported from a country where a serious outbreak of infectious disease has occurred.</P>
      <P>(2)  A chief medical officer may direct that a specified substance or article be not moved or be moved to a specified place pending investigation as to whether it is of a type which might be destroyed or disposed of under sub-article (1) of this article.</P>
      <P>That gives us power at least to deal with any article imported from any source where infection might be expected. I think that is the only power which is necessary.</P>
      <P>Senator Douglas's amendment would give power to make regulations prohibiting the importation of sub-standard filling materials.  It would be perhaps no harm to have that power, but it would be a mistake to prohibit them entirely because it might be necessary to bring in what you might regard as a sub-standard material and have it treated, disinfected and cleaned and so on, on arrival.  With that power of bringing in materials of that kind we are not in any way putting any industry here at a disadvantage. But, as I have stated, we have against that the power to prohibit if there is any danger.  I think that is quite sufficient. Therefore, I think that the amendment is not necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not convinced that the Minister would not be better to have the power.  I am not convinced that we could not get objectionable filling materials from a place where an infectious disease had not at that time occurred.  I am not quite sure whether the Minister would have power to see that articles imported should be filled with materials according to the standard.  The principal reason why I put down this amendment was because I felt that most Irish manufacturers &mdash;I am not interested personally in this line of business at all&mdash;go to a good deal of trouble to see that the filling is of a safe standard, but that causes more expense and anyone who can get away with completely inferior filling may quite easily sell it at a cheaper price.  It is there that the State has to come in to protect the public.</P>
      <P>I am not pressing the amendment, but I think the Minister would have been wise to take the power.  I do not think he would exercise it always.  By sub-standard I mean objectionable standard and I do not mean inferior quality.  The Minister, as he stated, can deal with the filling when it comes in, but I think my suggestion was a good one.  I think it would have been wise to have given the power set out in the amendment.  I do not press the amendment.</P>

      <P>The point was raised on the Committee Stage that we were only dealing in the Bill with rats and mice and attention was drawn to the fact that in recent times a virus has been discovered which destroys rabbits in some countries.  I believe the name is myxomatosis.  Attention was drawn to the fact that there should be power to include that.  As far as I can find out that particular virus is not dangerous to human beings but, on the <Col N="1069" /> other hand, some virus may come along from rabbits or other animals which would be dangerous and it is no harm to have the wider power.  I am asking the Seanad to have the word &ldquo;animals&rdquo; put in instead of the words &ldquo;rats and mice&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>This Health Bill has been designed for the purpose of extending and improving the medical services in this country.  That in itself is, of course, a very laudable object and one that we hope will, in some way, be achieved eventually and one for which we have been hoping for a very long time.  A great number of people have been hoping for better medical services.  They are really necessary.  The people who have been asking for better medical services over a long period of time are, of course, the medical profession themselves.</P>
      <P>We have pointed out many of the deficiencies in the health services and we have asked to have them improved. There was a Bill passed in 1947.  It was passed very quickly and was unnoticed completely by the doctors in this country at the time.  It was only when an attempt was made to make final arrangements in regard to implementing that Bill during the time of the inter-Party Government that the matter was brought to the notice of the doctors.  They objected to it and gave their reasons.  The Bill has again been introduced by the present Government and, again, the doctors have objected to it.  They have their reasons.</P>

    <P>I think that we should at least be given credit for thinking fairly about this thing.  I personally feel&mdash;and I am quite certain a great number of doctors in this country feel the same way&mdash;we have a certain responsibility to the people of this country as regards their health.  If we are asked whether we approve of a certain method of administering health services, if we find great defects or if we think the matter <Col N="1070" /> can be carried out in a better way, we feel it is our duty to say so.  We do not think this is a good Bill and for that reason we do not approve of it. We think it could have been a very much better Bill.</P>
    <P>On the Committee Stage I dealt with a number of defects in the Bill.  I should like to mention again that if you introduce legislation especially in regard to health which affects everybody it should be comprehensive and should apply to everybody just the same as other regulations apply to everybody.  In the same way health legislation should not be specifically designed for one section of the people to the exclusion of another section. That is one of the main objections to this Bill because we could have a comprehensive Bill to cover and assist everybody where health is concerned and it would work out much more satisfactorily.  It would be more easy to work and it would be cheaper in the end than this Bill would be.</P>
    <P>Let us consider just for a moment what the patient is going to get from this Bill.  First of all, let us take what is called the lower income group.  In order that there should be no confusion about this, I should like to mention what the lower income group is at the moment.  It comprises what we call the dispensary patient&mdash;the poor law type of patient or what has been described in other places as the medically indigent person, the person who cannot afford to pay for his own medical services.  At the moment that individual has free attention by a dispensary doctor.  If this individual is ill, he or she can get free medical attention in a hospital.  That is the position with the patient under present conditions.  Under the new Health Act there is no change.  In fact, the patient may by regulation lose something.</P>
    <P>Take the poor person in the City of Dublin.  He can go to any hospital he wishes, select the doctor he wishes to see and go on the day the doctor is in the hospital.  He can then consult the doctor if he wishes and be admitted to the hospital as a poor patient and he has to pay nothing.  He is maintained in the hospital and treated <Col N="1071" /> there.  Under the new health scheme he gets nothing more than that.  He gets exactly the same as he is getting now.  He may lose this choice by direction and he may be sent to a certain hospital, because the poor are already fairly well provided for.</P>
    <P>In regard to the maternity service, there is, perhaps, a little improvement for the patient.  Take the case of a patient in some small town in the country.  At present that patient is attended to by the local midwife and, if necessary, by the dispensary doctor.  The patient can select another doctor who is not a dispensary doctor if she wishes and the doctor can attend the patient if he is agreeable to do so and provided he has come to an agreement with the Department to attend that class of patient.  If such a doctor is in a town the patient has a choice. That is a slight advantage.  That patient will not in all cases have a choice because in certain rural areas there is only one doctor available so that it applies only to a small number of people.  In the cities the patient will go to the hospital as now and there will be no change.  There is very little change for the poor patient in this Bill.</P>
    <P>We have been promised new dispensaries but that is not really an integral part of this Bill or part of the ordinary running of these services.</P>
    <P>With regard to the class of people with salaries up to £600 a year, a great number of the patients in this class go to the hospitals and dispensary doctors and get their treatment free.  Six hundred pounds per year is something less than £12 per week.  If you go to any of the hospitals at present you will know from the trade or occupation of the patients what their earning capacity is.  We find these patients in all the Dublin hospitals.  Many of them go to the dispensary doctors; some of them go to general practitioners of their own choice and pay small fees for attendance; but when it comes to hospitalisation they go to the hospitals.</P>
    <P>A number of these people subscribe towards their keep in the hospitals. If, however, a patient of that class is <Col N="1072" /> in the public ward of a hospital he does not pay fees to the doctor. Occasionally, he may offer a fee, but such patients are not liable to be charged a fee in the hospitals, that is in the voluntary hospitals.  These patients will now be allowed to go to these hospitals.  Under this Bill they will get very much the same service as they have been getting up to the present and will be classified in the same category as the poor law patient.</P>
    <P>We have also in that category nearly 90 per cent. of the farmers of this country&mdash;the poor farmers.  The Minister for Finance told us recently that the farmers were never better off.  We saw in the papers to-day that the Taoiseach said yesterday that the farmers of this country were never better off: that everything was up, that wheat production was up, and that the farmers were never better off; but the Minister for Health tells us that the farmers are far too poor to pay anything towards medical treatment, and that practically 90 per cent. of them must be given medical treatment free. I do not know who is right.  The position, however, is rather absurd when you arrive at the state in an agricultural country of this kind, where you find that nearly 90 per cent. of those engaged in agriculture, that is to say the people who own land, are unable to pay the small fees and the small hospital charges that are made in this country for medical services.  I think that is very wrong.  They will get under this Bill the same as the poor law patient is getting and nothing more.  If they wish to go elsewhere they will be obliged to pay.  They will not get any help and they will be obliged to pay.  They may get small help&mdash;I think about £3 10s. a week towards their hospital maintenance.</P>
    <P>There is one certain section of the workers of the country who are going to be worse off under this Bill, that is those who are insured under the national health schemes.  These people at present can go to a hospital of their own choice.  They can go wherever they wish and they are paid for in the hospital at the rate of £5 10s. a week, but in the future they may be <Col N="1073" /> penalised to the extent of £2 2s. a week.  That is to say, they may be obliged to pay £2 2s. a week towards their keep in hospital.  In other words, they will get £3 10s. a week.  However, they are getting the advantage that their dependents are now going to be paid for in the same way as themselves.  Apart from that&mdash;that the same law will apply to their dependents as to themselves&mdash;these national health insured workers are going to be worse off under this Bill than they are at present.  I think that, if you compare a national health insured worker with the average farmer, you will have to admit that the farmer is getting the better of it, and that the worker is not coming out so well under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Then we have the people above £600 a year.  They get nothing unless they make a case for it to the county manager.  They will have to make the case that they are not able to pay either to the county manager or to a county councillor.  You will find people with over £600 a year who could pay, perhaps, not the full hospital and medical expenses.  They will be anxious to dodge doing so and will probably find ways and means of getting round that.  These, I think, are some of the weaknesses in the Bill.</P>
    <P>We would like to help any people who are in need of help.  I think, however, it is wrong that a lot of people, who are anxious to dodge their responsibilities, should get help.  I think that is fundamentally wrong.  That will happen now and that is one of the weak points in the Bill.  That is going to happen in a number of cases.</P>
    <P>That is why a Bill of this kind, which is related only to certain sections of the people, is so wrong, and why it is going to be so difficult to work.  We have means tests running through it the whole way.  You will have objections and difficulties of all kinds.  You will have people called upon to decide whether a man with £650 a year should have free treatment, while his neighbour, who may have £700 a year, should not.  You will have difficulties of that kind arising.  All that will throw a tremendous amount of responsibility on the county manager, who is <Col N="1074" /> the authority to decide whether people are to have free treatment or not.  I think that all that is bad, and that it will lead to all kinds of abuses.  It is one of the weak points in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The whole theme in this Bill has been a levelling down of services. What is being offered to everybody is the out-patient department of the hospitals and the public wards of the hospitals; in other words, the type of service which is given to poor people and which is meant to help a great number of people.  There are people who have in or about £600 a year, or maybe a little more, who have been accustomed to a certain amount of privacy in their homes.  These people will not be very content or very happy in the public ward of a hospital.  They may find conditions there which they are not accustomed to.  It is very important for persons who are ill to be happy in their surroundings because that is a great part in their recovery. If some of those patients are in surroundings or in circumstances in which they are not happy, it may tell against them.  For that reason, I think you will find that a great number of these people will not be greatly inclined to avail of what is being offered to them under this Bill.  They will not like it. Some of them may, but a great number of them who need help, as well as anybody else, will not avail themselves of these services.  The Bill is not going to help them one bit.  It is going to make things more difficult for them. You have that levelling down all the way through the Bill instead of which you could have had a levelling up; that is to assist people to help themselves, which is what is wanted, and not provide free services for whole sections of the people.  What you could do is help people to help themselves, and allow them to decide for themselves what services they want.</P>
    <P>I do not want to speak about alternative schemes.  Indeed, I do not know whether I would be in order in speaking about alternative schemes.  I want to say that in my view this country has not been very late in coming forward with health services.  There are some very wealthy countries which at present have no health services, and <Col N="1075" /> so we need not think that we have been very late in introducing State services or State-aided services.  We have, however, been rather behind the times in so far as our services generally are concerned.  In other words, they have fallen out of date very much.  In that connection, I would refer to the condition of dispensaries throughout the country.  The same thing would apply to some of the Dublin hospitals.  We have never helped to bring them up to date, or attempted to get them brought up to date as we should have.  We have been rather behind the times in that way.</P>
    <P>We have the advantage that we have now seen what has been happening in connection with these services elsewhere. We now have all the evidence that is necessary to know what is best as regards medical services.  We did not have that evidence three years ago, but we have it now.  It is all there in black and white.  I am sorry, therefore, that we are missing the wonderful opportunity we have of implementing a health service which would be of help to everyone in the country, which would be comprehensive and which would give assistance to everyone irrespective of their income with no means test or anything else, a service that has been successful and is proving so successful elsewhere.  I think it is unfortunate that we are missing the opportunity of implementing a service like that.  This service that is proposed here is so full of weaknesses, is going to be so difficult to run and is going to be so expensive that, in my view, it is not going to offer a great deal of help to anyone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now on the Final Stage of one of the most controversial Bills that has ever come before the Oireachtas since the inception of this State.  On the one hand, it has been very severely criticised by many sections of the people all over the country, while, on the other hand, we have seen opinions in favour of it strongly expressed by other sections of the community.  On the Second Reading I voiced my opposition to the Bill on the grounds which I then set <Col N="1076" /> forth.  I listened carefully to the discussions when the Bill was going through Committee in this House.  I think that, in these discussions, we were afforded a splendid example of constructive opposition.  That was shown in the examination of each section of the Bill.  Each section was very carefully examined and all the objections to it were given.  The result of all this examination was very, very little indeed.  The Bill has come through with very few amendments of any note; in fact, none of the fundamental objections have been met in any way.  There are merely alterations in words and meanings intended to make the scheme easier to operate.  I was here for the whole two days of the Committee Stage and listened very closely to everything that was said.  I find that all my fears that were expressed on the Second Stage have only been confirmed.  I purposely did not take part in the discussion because I think the Bill was very adequately dealt with.  There was nothing that I could have said that was not better said by other people on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>Lest the public might have got the impression that the opposition was purely from the Medical Council, due to the fact that Professor Cunningham was so prominent in opposition to the Bill&mdash;although Senator Baxter, speaking as a farmer and as a county councillor, also spoke for a certain point of view which was outside the medical profession&mdash;I feel it is necessary that I should speak as a member of that section of the community which favours private enterprise and reliance upon voluntary and vocational organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My chief objection is that the Bill offends against the idea of private enterprise and the idea of relying on vocational organisations.  Furthermore I object to it because of its cost or should I say, the lack of information as to the cost involved.  The section of the community to which I have referred looms very large as taxpayers.  We have already been told by the Government that we are overtaxed and that opinion is being expressed by Ministers <Col N="1077" /> day in and day out and is not merely a viewpoint from this side of the House.</P>
    <P>There is one thing that needs to be said and that is that it has been widely promulgated that anybody who speaks against this Bill is opposed to improving the health services.  That of course is not the case at all.  Our opposition is based on the grounds that this measure will not be in the best interests of our health services, that a better kind of Bill could have been produced which would have achieved much better results and would have given us a really practicable service that would be value for money.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I must again raise a complaint which is an old friend of mine.  I make no apology for producing it again and again on the different Bills coming before this House.  It is something that comes up in nearly every Bill nowadays and that is the dictatorial powers which this Bill gives to the Minister. This is a very frightening feature in our national life and it is disturbing to many citizens.  Opposition cannot be voiced too often in both Houses of the Oireachtas in regard to the danger to liberty and not only to liberty but also to the carrying out by farmers, business people, doctors and other professional people of their vocations to the fullest extent.</P>
    <P>This Bill is probably an all-time high in the powers it gives to the Minister.  He has complete power over all the citizens who come under the Bill, over the doctors, patients, nurses and hospitals concerned.  This is the first step&mdash;because the plan is not complete at the moment&mdash;on the road to nationalisation of medicine.  Why we should be taking steps along the road of nationalisation in this new State of ours is not understandable to me considering the examples we have all round us of the failure of nationalisation. It has failed in many ways and this has been seen even in England. According to the speeches made at the Labour Party Conference the other day, trade unions have now come to realise that nationalisation is not a success either from an efficiency or from an economic point of view.  We are pursuing these lines of nationalisation <Col N="1078" /> regardless of the experience of other people.</P>
    <P>I object to this Bill because of its non-vocational character.  Both in the preparation of the Bill and in the proposals for carrying it out when it is enacted, it ignores the use of vocational bodies both in a consultative and in an administrative way.  I feel that this is a pity in a country like ours where we have such an excellent opportunity of building up society based on voluntary effort and on vocational groups.</P>
    <P>The third reason why I object to this legislation is that even from what can be seen now it will be too expensive for this already heavily burdened community.  Having listened to the Minister answering questions on the Committee Stage, I do not think he can have any idea as to what it will cost.  The only thing we can compare it with is what happened in England. We all know that the experience there was that the estimates for the health services were fantastically short of what the ultimate figure proved to be. I have no hesitation in saying as a businessman that I would hate to be offered a business proposition with an economic background similar to this one which is being offered to us here.</P>
    <P>A further objection I have to the Bill is one which I think Professor Cunningham showed rather clearly and that is that we are undertaking to do things we have not the facilities to do. We have not got a sufficiency of beds in the hospitals and it seems only common sense that we should start on a much lower scale.  In that way we could have produced a Bill.</P>
    <P>Another bad feature in relation to this whole matter is the way the Bill has been handled from the beginning. It seems only common sense that if one intends to carry out any scheme one should get the goodwill, the confidence and co-operation of all the people who will be concerned in working it.  Here the Minister has told us quite frankly and the medical profession have told us quite frankly that they are not working together.  We have heard of the kind of language which has been used between the Minister and Professor Cunningham whenever <Col N="1079" /> there were discussions with the Irish Medical Association.  The doctors will be the officers of the army that is going to run this particular service. If the Minister is going to have an army where all the officers are on mutiny and do not carry out his orders, I would suggest that will not be a very successful army when it comes into existence.  That is what we have here.  There is a deplorable atmosphere around the whole Bill and I do not see how it is going to be resolved if this Bill becomes an Act and the doctors refuse to implement it.  I do not see where we are leading to&mdash; certainly, we are not leading to better health services.</P>
    <P>In this Bill we have enshrined what has been described as the cardinal doctrine of the twentieth century, namely, that the State can do things better and can spend people's money better than they can themselves&mdash;even than the individual can.  As I said before, this has been proved false all over the world but we are day after day and Bill after Bill coming into the House and perpetrating what I think is a false doctrine.  I think that the more we leave to the individual citizens and to individual groups of citizens to do for themselves, the better the nation we will have here of people who are provident and self-providing and self-respecting.</P>
    <P>There is one point I would like to mention, too.  I object to this Bill on moral grounds.  When you say that, everybody always flies to the ceiling, because we hear a lot of talk about the Hierarchy and about people being more Catholic than the Bishops and more moral than the Hierarchy, and so on.  I do not think anyone should ever have needed to go to Bishops or Hierarchies to find out certain moral principles.  I will enumerate some of them and they are quite simple.</P>
    <P>I suggest that for the State to take upon itself to do more than it should or could do is immoral, and I think that in this measure the State is undertaking to do more than it should or could do.  Secondly, some citizens are being given under this Bill services <Col N="1080" /> they could or should provide for themselves.  That is immoral.  Thirdly, the medical profession&mdash;doctors, hospitals and nurses&mdash;are being deprived of carrying out functions which they could and should carry out very well for themselves and which they are capable of doing.  That is immoral.  That is the kind of morality we are talking about.</P>
    <P>I think that there has been much too much talk about relying on the Bishops and so on for guidance.  If we are an educated people we should have at least enough intelligence to be able to work these things out for ourselves. I object to the Bill on those grounds I have just enumerated.</P>
    <P>One thing that I thought demonstrated the weakness of the case for the Bill was that nearly all its protagonists or people in favour of it said very little about the Bill itself.  They merely contented themselves with abusing the doctors or abusing Fine Gael.  It is a well-known thing that when you have a bad case the only thing you can do is call your opponent names.</P>

      <P>The Committee Stage of the Bill clearly showed, in my opinion, from the exchange of views that we heard, particularly between the Minister and Senator Professor Cunningham, that what we really have is a Bill based on theory.  It is the product of bureaucrats who are working theoretically and have no estimates but hopes and wishful thinking&mdash;whereas we had a person who represented practical experience in dealing with problems which this whole Bill purports to deal with, telling us the Bill was unworkable.  I must say I would <Col N="1081" /> rather frame a Bill on the advice given to me by the people doing the job of work and who have been doing it for years, than frame it on people who are merely sitting in offices and working theoretically.  I suggest this Bill is a triumph for the bureaucrats as against the people who are doing the job of work.</P>
      <P>To conclude, I would just like to quote a letter that appeared in the <i>Irish Times</i> the other day, in case Senators did not read it.  The letter explains itself.  It was written in the <i>Irish Times</i> on Thursday last, October 8th.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Sir, it does, and it talks about what is in this Bill.  It says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Your recent leader on the Health Bill seems to assume that the only opponents of this remarkable piece of legislation are the Bishops, the opposing politicans, the medical profession and some few members of the public who, one gathers, ought to know better.</P>
      <P>I am a married man, with seven children, and I have no connection either with the politicians or the medical profession.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This man signs his name, incidentally&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I strongly object to the Bill,... to paying with my fellows a sum which may amount annually to millions of pounds to provide huge hospitals and doctors and nurses for people and their dependents who (i) can well afford to pay for themselves or (ii) who will claim such services, although they can between them spend millions of pounds annually in backing horses and dogs, in staying up half the night in public-houses and clubs, in going to all-night dances and in crossword puzzles, sweepstakes, <i>et hoc genus omne</i>....</P>
      <P>I believe that there are thousands in the country who feel as I do in this matter.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I would like to say that I <Col N="1082" /> favour free health services and the best that can be done for those who cannot afford to pay, but I do not favour giving services to people who can afford to pay for themselves. That is the reason I object to this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamFearon" hpid="Professor Fearon Professor Fearon">
      <NameTxt>Professor Fearon</NameTxt>
      <P>My impressions of the various stages of these debates, now reaching their conclusion, are that for the successful working of this Bill, certainly in its early stages, when it becomes an Act, we require to establish, where it does not necessarily exist, and to strengthen, three partnerships. I think that has been put clearly during the stages of this debate.  The first partnership is the partnership between the Minister and the other Departments of the Government. We will look to the Minister to safeguard the interests of the nation in any legislation that may directly or indirectly affect our expenditure under the Health Act.  Just to make that a little more precise, I would point out that while we were debating this measure here I noticed that an Order, No. 313, came into force which has doubled the price of many medicines. This Order is in regard to glass-packed sterile liquids and it is actually on the Table of the House.  When the Health Act is operating the Minister will, we hope, be very alert to see any of these sort of changes that are coming in and, where necessary, to criticise or oppose them or interfere so as to safeguard us under this Health Act.  This new Order, for example, means that substances like insulin and all the B vitamins are going to be taxed 50 per cent., as far as I know.  That means that the expenses under the Health Act will be enormously increased.  If Orders like this are liable to be made quietly, we need to be alert as to the issues between the various Ministers, with regard to legislation that may indirectly affect expenditure under the Health Act, and we must be careful to examine to what it may lead.  Some people, I think, imagine that ampoules can be filled as easily as beer bottles. I have seen them filled and it is certainly by no means that easy, and if we are proposing to establish an ampoule-filling industry in this country I think it should be watched carefully <Col N="1083" /> by the Department of Health as well as by the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>The next partnership that needs to be preserved and safeguarded is that between the Minister and the local authorities.  In an Assembly like this which has so many admirable and worthy representatives of local authorities, nothing is required on my part in the way of an attempt to defend local authorities.  But I suppose local authorities do realise that they may lose a certain amount of their control over their expenditure as a result of the operation of this Act to be.  For example, in Section 72, the Minister is taking power to limit the expenditure that the central Government may have to bear in respect of the new services, but the health authorities have no power to limit their expenditure. They pay at least half the cost of the new services and the Minister may add to the extent of the services which local authorities must provide.  That will require good working between the Minister and the local authorities. And that is the second partnership needed to make the Act a success.</P>
      <P>The third partnership is one which you know already.  It is the partnership between the Minister and this much-maligned profession that I inadequately represent.  I have heard harder things said about the medical profession during the discussion in the other House and in this House than I ever said of it when I was examined as a medical student.  I have heard it said that the doctor has a vested interest in ill-health.  Well, of all the unworthy half-truths&mdash;you might as well say that the farmer has a vested interest in starvation, or that the lawyer has a vested interest in crime.  The doctor has a vested interest in the suppression of ill-health and if he did not succeed in that his profession would cease very rapidly.</P>
      <P>One undoubted effect of the Act will be to bring about a change in the doctor of the future.  We will have to train a new type of doctor.  He will have to be more of a civil servant and less of an easy going family consultant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act is also going to affect the <Col N="1084" /> doctor-patient relationship because the doctor will not have the same time to study his patients and will have to rely on his card-index system and on his technicians.  You can argue on all sides.  You can say the doctor-patient relationship is a luxury but many forms of humanity are luxuries and still they are very near and dear to us.</P>
    <P>All I can say in conclusion is this: I feel that anything the Minister can do to strengthen relations between the workers of the Act and the medical profession which is not prepared to co-operate to work the Act, is extremely important, and I hope that the doctors of the future are going to be at least half as good as the doctors of the past who set the doctors of to-day an example that is highly admirable and unselfish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make my own mind clear on this Bill. Senator McGuire has suggested that it is immoral to give citizens something free which they can pay for themselves. How does that apply to the educational system of this country?  We offer primary education free, without a means test of any kind, for every citizen.  How can Senator McGuire make a moral distinction between that and what we may call primary health services for some sections of our citizens?  I, personally, would say I can see no moral objection whatever to granting free medical services to all citizens of this country without any means test.  But I do see that this is probably beyond our means.  We are, on the whole, a poor country and we simply could not afford that generosity. I would like to emphasise that what Senator McGuire has said, and what other Senators have said, about the immorality of this Bill seems to be sheer rubbish in view of the fact that education is provided free to all.  That is the only point I wish to make.</P>

      <P>This Bill has been debated for a very long time and I do not think there is any need to go much further into it.  I think it will really do good in the long run to those classes of people such as the small <Col N="1085" /> farmers on low valuation and small business people and people earning small salaries.  There is no doubt but that these people were in a bad way up to now, as the high cost of living has hit them very severely.  This Bill will relieve them of many of their difficulties. I feel sure that this Bill will do a great deal of good on the whole and that we will find in ten years' time that it has not affected the morality of the people or their status or education and that things will have improved generally.  We will find that no harm has been done in any way.  I believe everybody should now set to work to see that this Bill is worked in the way in which I am sure it will be worked.</P>
      <P>There is one point which I would like to bring to the notice of the Minister concerning dispensary districts. In the country very poor people are completely in the hands of the medical officers of their own districts, and in 99 per cent. of the cases that would not matter, but in certain cases it would amount to a very great grievance.  I would suggest to the Minister that either by amending legislation or amalgamating dispensary districts&mdash;which would be to the advantage of both doctors and patients&mdash;a second opinion could be made available to even the very poorest.  I am referring to the country districts; I suppose this situation does not arise in the towns.</P>
      <P>Another matter I would like to raise is the question of voluntary insurance for those who are not affected by the present Bill.</P>

      <P>It is only right that at this stage of the Bill, before it passes from this House and passes from a Bill into an Act, we should congratulate the Minister for Health, Dr. Ryan, in the first place, for having introduced the Public Health Bill, 1947, and for having, with that patience and forbearance that he has shown in this and the other House, piloted this very important measure from being a Bill to an Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1086" /> We have had certain criticism from the other side of the House.  I do not want for one moment to enter into the morality of this question, except to add my voice to that of other Senators who have spoken and to question very sincerely whether the provisions of this Bill in making provision for medical services of certain kinds to a large section of our people are not in common, as Senator Stanford has already pointed out, with that of our primary education.  More important still, is there any member of this House or of the other House who refuses to take the children's allowances?  Has any person entering our universities raised any objection to the very substantial contributions that the State makes through the medium of the taxpayer generally towards the cost of that education?</P>
    <P>Senator Cunningham, on a previous occasion, tried to suggest that his objection to the Bill was based not so much on what he put before the House but, more important still, in my view, on what he withheld from the House.  He told us there was no change, so far as the lower-income group is concerned. That is not the fact.  If the members on the opposite side of the House believed that this Bill was not what they wished it should be, more serious steps should have been taken to amend it in order to bring it into conformity with what they would like to have.  After all, they had three years in which to give us the ideal public health service about which they are now so vocal.  They had three years in which to give us a Bill that would not clash with morals. What do we find?  We find there was a Minister for Health who was allowed to prepare and continue with a Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling. I suppose it is just as well that we should not go back and examine these things.  Senator Cunningham referred to the position of persons in receipt of £600 and over.  He said the position of such people will be no better in the future as compared with what it is now from the point of view of this Bill.  I suggest to the Senator and to the members of his profession who are opposed to this Bill that the real purpose of their opposition is based on the fact that it removes from the minds of people in that particular group the fear that their financial position will not be adequate to meet medical aid or medical advice should they be in need of them.  Because of that fear in the past people very often delayed too long in seeking medical assistance.  I am sure Senator Baxter must have met people in his own constituency in the £50 valuation group, the small industrious farmer&mdash;some of them possibly his own most ardent supporters&mdash;presenting him with a little document they had received from the board of health or the county medical services tendering a bill for medical treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure people have put their difficulties before Senator Baxter in trying to meet these demands explaining the serious position they would find themselves in if they had to meet the bill in full.  We have removed such fears through the medium of this measure.  Senator Cunningham referred to the insured worker.  He tried to suggest to the insured worker that money would be taken from him, as it were, under false pretences.  He suggested the insured worker would get no increased benefits as a result of this measure. Senator Cunningham must be aware that the insured worker only made provision for himself.  His wife and family did not benefit as a result of his contributions.  If his wife or any member of his family fell ill he had to obtain a red ticket so that that particular person could receive medical treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1089" /> In some cases he had probably contributed over a long period of years more than would compensate for any benefits he received.  Treatment for members of his family necessitated his obtaining a red ticket for such members and finding himself classified in the lower-income group, although, thanks again to Fianna Fáil, most insured workers are to-day in receipt of over £12 and £14 per week.  It is because Senator Cunningham and those for whom he speaks fear they will lose some of these moneys that we have these objections to this Bill.</P>
    <P>A very wide field was covered on the last occasion the Bill was before the House.  My only purpose in rising to-day is to congratulate the Minister on having piloted this measure through.  The opposition to this measure is one further proof, if further proof is necessary, of the importance of having a Minister and Government prepared to implement their promise to the people and undeterred from doing so by any section or class.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to make a few points on the final stages of this measure lest the Minister might be persuaded that, because of his careful and cautious handling of the Bill, he has convinced those of us who differed from him at the outset and that we have now changed our minds.  I do not know whether or not the Minister is happy about this piece of legislation. I would have expected that any Minister charged with the responsibility of initiating a Health Bill and subsequently implementing a health scheme under that Bill would like to feel that he was providing something that had the backing and support of the great majority of the people.  I do not think the Minister can feel that. The Minister could have had such a backing.  He could have piloted through the Oireachtas a Bill which would have pleased the great majority of the people, a Bill which could be implemented easily and which would be far better from the point of view of our future health service than this Bill, for which Senator Hawkins feels he must be applauded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1090" /> I shall not go over past history of the fall of the Minister's predecessors. There is no point in doing so.  I have not to account for the failure of a previous Minister to pilot his Bill through. I have not to tell Senator Hawkins the reason.  Senator Hawkins knows the reason.  So does everybody else.  I merely want to reiterate the view that I have already expressed, that I do not think this Bill will work.  I do not think it can work.  In the first place, it is a physical impossibility to do what this Bill purports to do because we have not the hospital accommodation that would be necessary to do it.  That cannot be contradicted.  It cannot work in County Cavan.</P>
    <P>In the second place, I do not think we can provide the extra millions of pounds which this Bill will cost.  A notion is being circulated that this service is free, that people will get something for nothing.  I do not think that is good political propaganda. Senators on the other side know, just as we on this side know, that this service must be paid for.  I want to say in an aside to Senator Hawkins that no farmer of £50 valuation in Cavan ever came to me to be released from the payment of a debt to a local authority for hospital treatment.  If the public are now to pay for this service for them, if they are to be a charge on the rates, it is a new concept, something which is foreign to many of our people, something which we should not have attempted to cultivate as a new idea and a new approach to life in this country.  We should have taken our stand, as I urged the Minister to take his stand, on the ideal that a person who is able to pay for a service for himself or his family should be permitted to pay.</P>

      <P>We have not got the hospital accommodation.  I do not think we will be able to find these millions that will have to be found.  At a meeting of a local authority the other day a member, who happens to be a supporter of the present Minister, declaimed against some activities of a new health inspector whose work appeared to encroach on that formerly done by the veterinary inspector.  He was searching for light, asking questions. I suggested that it was being done under the Public Health Act. Another supporter of the Minister said that he did not think the Health Act was passed yet and I said that it was the 1947 Health Act.  Then there was silence.  It is only in the years ahead that the implications of this measure will reveal themselves.  As they do and as the cost mounts to millions and millions, far beyond our capacity, it will be realised what the supporters of the present Government to-day have let themselves in for and when local authorities levy the rates there will not be any great enthusiasm on the part of Government supporters for the new health scheme.</P>
      <P>Senator Cunningham has shown many of the weaknesses in the Bill.  Senator McGuire has stuck to the principles, which are my principles and which ought to be the principles of everybody else, including the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have very strong views&mdash;I pressed the Minister in my amendment on the Committee Stage&mdash;in regard to the question of people who are given a service making some contribution towards <Col N="1092" /> that service.  The Minister came practically all the way with me.  He admitted in the first instance that the family was at the base of our society, that it was important to keep it strong, that the head of the house had responsibilities and obligations to provide as far as lay in his power for the needs of his family.  Then, when we came to the final point as to whether or not he was taking from the shoulders of the head of the house a responsibility which he ought to discharge, the Minister shied away.  I maintain that the Minister has infringed certain principles that are vital in our society. I regret that very much.  I believe that the Minister, in his persuasive way, was quite capable of bringing before the Oireachtas a measure on which there could have been general agreement. I do not mean that he could have brought it before a few members of the Oireachtas.  I do not think that out of 147 Deputies and 60 Senators, two or three or four members of the Oireachtas should be the determining factor as to what type of health service this country should have.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Minister could have produced a measure on which general agreement could be found.  I see no reason why we should differ on this any more than we should differ on the national objective or on the agricultural plan or the educational plan that we should pursue.  The Minister could have found agreement amongst all Parties.  He has taken the wrong turning; he has taken the short cut. What is in this measure will reveal itself through the years and somebody else will turn back the hands of the clock.</P>
    <P>The point that we stressed about the power which the Minister is taking to determine by regulation the shape our health service will take and as to how it will be ordered in the country is something which local people will rebel against as they discover over the years that they have no authority whatever, that it is all vested in the Minister and in the officials behind the Minister.  When one Order after another comes to the local authority for which the local authority has to find the money, a stage will be <Col N="1093" /> reached when irrespective of what political affiliations a man may have, he will realise that it is against common sense, reason and justice, that it is a rebuke to him.  These men will still have some pride left of mind and of class and there will be people brought together in local authorities who will disregard ministerial decisions and challenge ministerial decisions eventually.</P>
    <P>If we have not enough spirit left in our local authorities and a desire to do the right thing for their own people amongst whom they live, if we have not enough intelligence amongst them to direct their local services, and if we have not enough character and courage to challenge decisions of people when those decisions are given that are contrary to the best local interests, then I do not think the future of this country is very bright.  But I have hopes for the future of this country.  I saw that hope the other day at my own local authority when I saw those people who are supporters of the present Minister challenging things that were done under previous legislation.  There will be many more challenges in the future and then the shortcomings of this piece of legislation will be really discovered.  It is unfortunate that we were not able to eliminate those defects when this Bill came to the House first.</P>

I believe that we will not be able to implement this Bill and that the Minister himself will discover after a time that it would have been far better for him in trying to build the health services of the future if he had taken advice from other people to whom he would not listen now.</P>

      <P>I will not detain you very long beyond saying that I reiterate <Col N="1094" /> what I said on the original presentation, that I feel that taking the long view this Bill is a good one.  I think, taking the long view again, it may turn out to be also a good investment for this country.  It is not a Bill of perfection by any means.  It has some faults, but what disturbs me mainly in my support of the Bill is that I have not been helped in any way by the apologia put up by Senator Hawkins in its defence and the fact that the vocational organisation which should give its imprimatur to this Bill has refused to do so, and that is the Irish Medical Association.</P>
      <P>I have been very much impressed that a man like Senator Cunningham, for whose opinion in his own sphere I have the greatest respect, has criticised this Bill, and various parts of it, very honestly and very fairly.  I am just standing up here as an outsider, one who knows nothing really about the internal workings of hospitals or the needs in general of the health services of the country, to plead with the Minister that a new approach should be made to the vocational body, that is the Irish Medical Association, to see what relation can be come to between the Ministry of which he is the director and that organisation for the working of this Bill.</P>
      <P>It seems to me as an outsider that it is ironic that we hear laudations from people who know nothing very much about the qualities of a Bill or its effects on the general public and on the other hand we hear very strong criticism from a doctor of the eminence of Senator Cunningham on the other side.  Taking the long view I am a supporter of this Bill.  I think, taking the long view again, it will be a good investment for this country but I am, as I said, seriously disturbed by the fact that the doctors, the medical profession as represented by the Irish Medical Association, even up to last week strongly expressed their disapproval of the Bill; and I again appeal to the Minister to see if there is any method of approach whereby some agreement might be come to between the people who will be putting the Bill into effect and his own Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard varying criticisms and <Col N="1095" /> defences from both sides of the House of this Bill.  If it does improve the health of the people of this country, especially the people who could not afford always to get the services to which they were as human beings fully entitled, I think this Bill will justify itself in time.  The morality of the Bill which has been discussed so often here, will justify itself, too, by reason of the fact that those people who could not afford it can now get benefits to which they are naturally entitled though not financially in a position to pay for.  I was rather wondering to hear Senator Baxter making the statement there about people going to get services for nothing arising out of this Bill.  I am just wondering does anybody in this country get anything for nothing, when through direct or indirect taxation the recipient of any benefit from this Bill is to some extent paying for it.  I agree with him entirely if his attitude is that we do not want to become a nation of beggars.  I do not think that that is the intention of the Bill, and we should be aware of the fact that nobody does get anything for nothing and nobody ought to be made feel in any way a beggar because he benefits by this Bill.  We have other communal services of one sort or another and they have worked very well.</P>
    <P>All I did stand up for was to repeat this appeal to the Minister that the vocational organisation which will be carrying out the mechanics of this Bill should be again approached and if possible there should be at least a spirit of friendship engendered between the Irish Medical Association and the Minister which is not evidenced by the public protest they made some weeks ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>During the Second Stage of this Bill I voiced my opposition to it, and I would like to utilise the last opportunity I have as a public representative of reiterating that opposition before the Bill becomes law. I happen to be a member of a local body for well over half a century, for ten years of which I was intimately connected with the board of health, and during that period I never knew <Col N="1096" /> of a case of a critically ill poor person who was denied the necessary special treatment or specialist treatment that he needed.  As a matter of fact, as I instanced during the Second Reading of this Bill, our local body found it far easier to secure institutional accommodation for the really poor people than for those who were well able to pay, and in that matter I would like to remark again how very considerate the voluntary hospitals of every denomination were in the matter of treatment of patients who were sent from our county.</P>
      <P>County Mayo is a poor county, but last year, or at least the current year's budget for health services is more than £15,000 over £250,000.  That is not a bad gesture, and does not show any indifference on the part of the public representatives, the members of the local body, to the public health.  When any new service was initiated, from the very start County Mayo always did its best to avail of it, amongst them the school medical inspection, and if we did not derive benefits from those inspections which those of us who supported the service anticipated at the time, it was not due to any lack of interest on the part of the local body, which made recommendations by which more could be taken out of the school medical inspection than was taken out of it, if the Department of Health cooperated.</P>
      <P>I have found no enthusiasm in my county for this Bill among any class. The only concern that there is at the present time amongst the people who discuss the matter is: &ldquo;What is it going to cost?&rdquo;  None of us can give the cost.  Even the Minister, as far as we know, cannot give any accurate opinion of what the cost is going to be on the people when this Bill becomes law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I happen to be intimately associated with a town of just about 1,000 population.  Business was never at a lower ebb in that particular town, and rates were never higher.  Last year alone between the county council demand, the rate demand, and the demands of the E.S.B., over £8,000 was collected from that town.  I do not see how that can go on, and I, for my <Col N="1097" /> part, will not agree to adding to the burden.  I believe that the country, in its present state, cannot bear the burden that will be placed upon it by this Bill, and for that reason I make use of this my last opportunity to register not alone my personal opposition to the Bill but the opposition of a very large number of people who have confidence in me as a public representative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened very attentively to the debate on the Second Reading and on the Committee Stage of this Bill, and I must say that it had a very enlightening effect on a mere layman.  We heard the honest and sincere way in which Senator Cunningham made his objections to the Bill, and we heard the Minister reply to these objections and argue that this Bill is very necessary for the improvement of the health services in the country.  So far as I am concerned, to criticise the Bill would be difficult and, on the other hand, to praise it might be equally difficult.  Certainly, any step which will tend to improve the health services in our country must be welcomed. However, anybody who thinks that our citizens will receive free treatment must realise&mdash;as has been pointed out on several occasions, and even this afternoon&mdash;that very little is free in this country and that, either by direct or indirect taxation, money will have to be provided to finance all the services which will supposedly be given free in this country.</P>
      <P>My first worry in connection with this Bill is the amount of money which it will cost the county from which I come.  We are told that it will mean something in the region of 2/- in the £. That is a very vague statement as to the cost.  I suppose that 2/- in the £ is the thin end of the wedge so far as the cost to the local authority is concerned.  If we had a definite assurance that any cost over and above 2/- in the £ would be met in full by a grant from the Government, I should have no fear at all.  We should then know where we are right from the beginning and where we shall be in, say, ten years' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this Bill is to be implemented as <Col N="1098" /> we should all like to see it implemented &mdash;even those who have objected to certain aspects of it&mdash;every county will have to give great and active attention to the need for hospitals and hospitalisation. My second fear is that this Bill cannot be worked properly because of our insufficiency of hospitals.  If there should be a general increase in the applications for hospital beds, not alone for maternity cases but for general treatment, and we have not the accommodation, what will be the outcome?  How, within the next year or two years, can we provide hospitals to meet these demands?  In this connection, I should like to say that I cast no blame whatsoever on the present Government because they have endeavoured to continue the good work which was started by the Minister's predecessor in office&mdash;work which has been particularly successful in respect of tuberculosis.  Nevertheless, even as things stand at present&mdash;without the implementation of this Bill at all&mdash;we are a long way behind our requirements in respect of hospital beds for patients.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker has made a good effort to further the interest of all our people who are sick and in need.  In my county we have some good hospitals but it is a well-known fact that in the maternity section of our county hospital patients have to be placed on mattresses on the floor&mdash; patients who, in all fairness to them, ought to be allowed to remain in their beds for a further week&mdash;and put gently aside to make room for new patients.  In addition, we must remember that there are many women who prefer to remain at home and be attended to there.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us some time ago of his aim in regard to the provision of hospitals in this country and I believe that he was sincere in his statement.  Assuming, however, that there is an all-out drive for the provision of hospitals in this country, what is to happen to the people who become ill before adequate hospital services can be provided?  Must those who desire to enter a hospital for treatment be told, when they present themselves to the hospital: &ldquo;We should like <Col N="1099" /> to take you in here as a patient but we have no room for you&rdquo;?  That is one of the dangers which I feel is attached to this Bill.</P>
    <P>My third fear concerns possible abuse of the provisions of this Bill, when it becomes an Act.  We have often met people who lived in Britain for some years and who told us of the abuses which occurred in regard to the health services there.  In the beginning, everything was free.  A doctor had a certain number of patients on his panel and prescriptions were given free.  We have all heard stories of how prescriptions were taken, say, to the family chemist and, instead of what was prescribed by the doctor in the prescription, face powder or hair oil or some other cosmetic was given free.  Things which were not necessary at all to the health of the patient were given, in some instances, instead of what the doctor prescribed.  Last year, a nominal and small charge of 1/- was levied in respect of every doctor's prescription: that was done in an effort to stop the type of abuse that was going on.  We have heard stories of how the greyhounds in Britain were being fattened on cod-liver oil which was obtained under the health scheme there.  I mention these matters just to show that I have some foundation for my fear that abuse may take place under this Bill, when it is enacted.</P>

      <P>This House has not heard any brilliant analysis of the Bill by Senator Yeats.  If abuses occur under this Bill when it is enacted then I submit that it will be very difficult to work it.  If, however, we have the goodwill and co-operation of every <Col N="1100" /> member of the community, then every citizen will benefit by this Bill.  In addition to that spirit of goodwill, we need a quickening-up in the provision of hospitalisation services throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I find myself in disagreement with, perhaps, some of my colleagues on this side of the House in regard to specialist treatment.  We are all aware that specialists are men who have devoted their lives to specialising in the diagnosis and treatment of a certain ailment or disease and that they must be respected for their knowledge and for the services which they can render.  It is only when a person loses his health that he realises the value of a man to whom he can go, or be sent, for diagnosis and treatment&mdash;a man who knows his subjects from A to Z, who has made it his life study and who knows the best methods to deal with it and to treat it.  I am afraid, however, that over a period of years, somewhat too high a premium has been put on those specialists and their knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that it was about time some measure was introduced to make a specialist, no matter how great his learning and ability, realise that it is his duty to impart his knowledge and to give his help to all mankind rather than to set a high premium on his knowledge and his services, and to say: &ldquo;If I can get such and such a fee, I am readily available to treat a patient, but if I cannot, I am afraid I cannot treat that patient.&rdquo;  I know well that patients sent by local authorities have received first-class specialist treatment, free, gratis and for nothing, but take the case of the man or woman, or the member of such a man or woman's family, who is sent for specialist treatment, independent of the local authority.  We know that the bill presented in that case would leave that man or woman in poverty for the remainder of their lives.  There are men with the mentality of disliking going through the ordinary channels presented by the local authority service, in respect of hospital treatment, and we know that the figure demanded in such cases has been very high.  I agree that specialists should be made to <Col N="1101" /> realise that there is a limit to what they can do, but I think that if an effort were made to bring co-operation between those who will have to carry out the mechanics of the Bill and the Minister, if these could be made to work with one another, we would go far towards implementing the Bill in the way in which we would all like it to be implemented.</P>
    <P>If that cannot be done, there are going to be difficulties, because it is natural that a medical man should resent interference from a civil servant.  Everybody nowadays resents interference by Government inspectors and so on, and it is quite natural that a medical man should feel even more resentment, in view of his high specialised training, but if some effort could be made to bring about unity&mdash;I will say that I would prefer that somebody other than myself should be presented with that task&mdash;between the Minister and the medical profession, it would make for much smoother progress. If that situation cannot be brought about, there will be plenty of difficulties and problems arising which will cause trouble, not alone to the medical profession and the Department but to the local authorities who, when it is all boiled down, are the people who must provide half the cost. That will be a headache for many a member of a local authority and I agree with Senator Baxter that perhaps next year, when we come to strike our rate and find that we have to provide so much more for health services, knowing that it is only the beginning, it will be a very difficult problem for us.</P>

      <P>I have suffered from the disadvantage all through the discussion of this Bill of having to deal with generalities.  I do not wish to say anything against the speech of the last Senator, because it was a reasonable speech, but one thing I might take as an example is his reference to the giving of cod-liver oil to greyhounds. Some Senator asked under what clause that could be done.  I do not know, but it is an instance of the generalities I have to deal with.</P>

      <P>The opposition to the Bill directed by the big bodies oppose to it talked vaguely of State inter ference, of interference with the doctor patient relationship and of violation o the secrecy between doctor and patient.  Then they said the Bill was not necessary, because the service is there already, and, like the lawyers they added that if it is necessary, it is given in the wrong way.  They then say that nobody is denied free service at the moment if he needs it and they add that the Bill is going to cost 10/- in the £ of poor law valuation.  No matter what happens under the Bill, however well or however badly it may work, I have not the slightest doubt that any member of the Opposition can get up and say: &ldquo;I told you so,&rdquo; because they told me so from every side.  No matter what happens, they will be right although they cannot be right in everything they said because they have been contradictory.  It is very difficult to deal with all these generalities about undermining the morals of the people and so on.</P>
      <P>Let us take one of these points, the doctor-patient relationship.  It is one of the arguments very commonly used by many opponents of the Bill.  Let us examine that argument.  There is no change in the case of the person in the lower income group.  He goes to the dispensary doctor, as he has been going to the dispensary doctor for the past 100 years.  There was never any complaint about the doctor-patient relationship so it is unreasonable to complain now when no change is being made.  The only change being made is that the young woman in that class will have a choice of doctor and surely that improves the doctor-patient relationship.  Therefore, I can leave that class and say that in respect of that class, there is a positive gain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, then, the middle income group.  They go to the family doctor as usual.  There is no change whatever.  Is the doctor-patient relationship not the same?  Where is it going to be changed?  What we propose here is that if a person in the middle income group is advised by his family doctor&mdash;not by <Col N="1103" /> anybody else&mdash;that he needs specialist or hospital treatment, he can be helped by the local authority, or perhaps get it free.  When I use the word &ldquo;free,&rdquo; let nobody think I am a fool, that I think that money will be taken out of a hat. I know that it must come from somewhere, but so far as he is concerned he gets it free, and so far as the person in the middle income group is concerned he has the same relationship with his family doctor as he always had.  The family doctor always advised him when he wanted hospital or specialist treatment. He advised him, as a rule, as to the hospital he should go to, the surgeon he should go to or where he should go for his specialist treatment.  The only change we are making is that the family doctor will be able to say in future: &ldquo;You may be helped by the local authority in paying your bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I cannot and never could see that that interferes with the doctor-patient relation.  I do not know where it interferes with it and yet we have Senators here, Deputies in the Dáil and people in the country ever since the Bill was mentioned who persist in saying that it will interfere with that relationship. They have never said to me, however, where or at what stage it interferes with it.  At present, the doctor says to the patient: &ldquo;You must have an operation,&rdquo; and when the patient asks what it will cost, he says: &ldquo;Perhaps £100.&rdquo;  He can say that at the moment and the doctor-patient relationship is grand, but if he says to him when this Bill passes: &ldquo;It will not cost you very much.  The most you will be charged is two guineas a week when in hospital and the surgeon will cost nothing,&rdquo; the doctor-patient relationship has gone.  Is that not silly or malicious?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is malicious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, malicious.  How can anybody say that the doctor-patient relationship is gone because the family doctor says to his patient: &ldquo;It will not cost you very much to have your operation?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us go further.  The patient goes in to have his operation.  I will be told that at the moment, for the pleasure, if you like, of paying his £100, he can <Col N="1104" /> choose his own surgeon.  Of course, we know how that happened in the past.  A person went in to his family doctor.  He did not know the surgeons very well and as a rule he said to the family doctor: &ldquo;What surgeon would you advise?&rdquo; The family doctor in the past advised a certain surgeon, everything was fixed up and when it was all over the bill was paid.  Now the doctor says: &ldquo;If you go to the county hospital, the surgeon there is a good man.&rdquo;  He cannot say anything else.  There is no conscientious doctor in this country who can say anything but that the county surgeon is a good man because these surgeons are selected on a certain basis as a result of which only the best man is appointed.  Therefore he must say that he is a good man.</P>
    <P>We know from experience what the result has been.  It is because people know that, that we have all this talk about want of beds.  Every county hospital is clamouring to have more beds supplied because of the additional demands on the county surgeon and his staff.  The family doctor then says: &ldquo;If you go to the county surgeon, everything will be free but if you prefer to go to Dublin, perhaps it can be managed.&rdquo;  I say, perhaps it can be managed.  The family doctor sends this man, if he agrees to go, to the county surgeon and everything is free.  If he wants to go to another hospital it may be arranged; I do not know.  If it cannot be arranged, all you can say is that he can go to the hospital of his own choice but at least he gets accommodation in that hospital by paying the difference between the figure for maintenance and that in the county hospital &mdash;say two guineas weekly.  If he takes the advice of the family doctor he will be better off and he will get good treatment. Suppose he does go to the county surgeon, what is the difference&mdash; I want to get this answered&mdash;between the doctor-patient relationship in the case of a man who goes to the county surgeon and the doctor-patient relationship between a Dublin surgeon and a man who comes from the country?  Is it that the county surgeon is an inferior type who is not capable of having a proper doctor-patient relationship? Where does the difference come in and <Col N="1105" /> at what stage?  That is what I want to know.</P>
    <P>We could deal with all these other generalities just as well if we had time to take them <i>seriatim.</i>  On this stage we are discussing the Bill as it appears in its final form and, therefore, we are not discussing any change that might be advisable or that could be suggested.</P>
    <P>Senator Cunningham, I think, gave a fair enough analysis of the provisions of this Bill, now that it is about to pass through this House.  He said that the lower income group were in much the same position as heretofore, except that a young woman had now a choice of doctor which was a considerable improvement.  He did mention, however, that an insured person would not be as well off because he might be charged £2 2s. a week.  He mentioned, also, that his dependents would get services which they are not entitled to from the fact that he is insured at the moment.  That is fair enough, except that, of course, at the present time the insured man is entitled only to six weeks' benefit.  If his term in hospital runs over that he has to pay for the treatment somehow or other. Under this Bill there will be no limit of that kind.  Otherwise the case was fairly well stated.</P>
    <P>Senator Cunningham, however, has an objection to the Bill in a general way&mdash;that it does not apply equally all round.  Well, of course, there are many Bills that do not apply equally all round.  It is not always possible to introduce a Bill that will apply to everybody in the same way.  We have had many Bills with means tests and tests of other kinds.  I think we need not delay too long on that aspect at this moment.</P>
    <P>Senator Cunningham also said&mdash; maybe not to-day but on other stages &mdash;that this Bill was likely to cost 10/- in the £ on the poor law valuation. He said that, I think, on the Report Stage.  I do not say that he said it very definitely but at least he indicated that it was put to him that it might cost 10/- in the £.  Senator Cunningham said to-day, speaking from his long experience in a voluntary hospital in Dublin, that any person in <Col N="1106" /> the middle income group, that is, a person with an income under £600, always got treatment in these hospitals, if it was needed, and was never turned away from the hospital because he would not pay.  I am not disputing what Senator Cunningham says; I am sure he is giving his own experience, but if that is true, that most of those in the middle income group are getting free service now, does it not mean that this Bill is not going to cost very much?  It is surely not going to cost 10/- in the £, because 10/- in the £. when it is covered £ for £ by the Minister for Health, would mean between £7,000,000 or £8,000,000.  That would be as much as all our health services are costing at the moment.  It is not possible, however, to hold both viewpoints.  It would be possible, of course, for the Senator to say it will cost a lot more, or that it may cost a lot more, but if it is going to cost a lot more it means that there is a big number in the middle income group who are not getting free services or subsidised services at the moment.</P>
    <P>It is true that the Taoiseach said at the Ard-Fheis that the farmers are fairly well off, taking them all round, but yet there may be many farmers who could not stand the shock of a surgeon's bill.  I mentioned some cases here on the early stages, which I just quoted at random from letters which I received when the White Paper on this Bill was first published and when the Bill came up for discussion in the Dáil.  I said I had received many letters written by people from all over the country pointing out to me how necessary a Bill of this kind was. I quoted one particular case of a widow with a valuation of £15, who had a family and who had just received a bill for £115.  That widow, on ordinary standards, might be considered to be fairly well off.  She has enough to eat for herself and her children and she is able to clothe them fairly satisfactorily, but there is no doubt whatever that a bill for £115 was a bit of a shock to her.  Even though farmers may be well off, I still think a Bill of this kind is necessary.</P>
    <P>Senator Cunniningham stated that he thought it was wrong to have this provision for the higher income group <Col N="1107" /> which would enable them to plead hardship and therefore to claim either free or subsidised treatment in hospital and make their case to the local authority for that help.  It may be wrong to tempt people of that kind, but we must put in some provision like that.  If we did not put in that provision and suppose a person who had an income over £600&mdash;it does not matter for my present argument whether he was deserving or undeserving of help&mdash;wants hospital treatment and is not able to pay, am I to say to the county manager: &ldquo;There is the Act; do not let him in; somebody else must provide for his funeral?&rdquo;  What can we do?  We cannot let a man die. We cannot refuse a man treatment in a hospital because for some reason his income is too high or his valuation is too high, whatever it may be.</P>
    <P>Even at the present time, a man who had, up to this anyway, an income of £2,000 or £3,000 a year, if he is absolutely derelict and if he approaches the county manager and says: &ldquo;I am unable to pay for medical treatment,&rdquo; he must get it free.  So that the people who passed the Public Assistance Acts 100 years ago were more enlightened than some of our Senators here to-day because they did foresee that even a very well-off man may need treatment and that he must get it if he cannot pay.  Therefore that wording was put in the Public Assistance Acts, and as I say, they were passed about 100 years ago.  We, if you like, tried to cover the contingency of a man who is not able to pay for hospital treatment even though his income may be higher than that laid down for the middle income group.</P>
    <P>Senator Cunningham says that the whole scheme means a levelling down. I have heard that criticism before and, as Senator Cunningham put it, I have heard that it would be better if we could level up.  What is meant by that, I understand, is that the general tendency of this Bill will be that people will go into the public wards and that we could, on the other hand, have given these people a sum of money, as mentioned by Senator Cunningham on the Committee Stage, and said: &ldquo;Go where you like; this <Col N="1108" /> will help you.&rdquo;  In that way, as Senator Cunningham said, we could have a tendency to level up, by which is meant that they would go into private wards and private homes.</P>
    <P>Now I am not concerned with social distinctions of that kind.  If, as Minister for Health, I am careful that I will not compel people to do a thing that is bad from the medical point of view, I think that I can be quite satisfied and have a clear conscience.  I am quite satisfied that if a person is concerned only with his health, he is as well off in a public ward as in any private home.  Senator Cunningham, who has followed a certain speciality in medicine, I am sure will admit that the lady who goes in for a confinement is as well off medically in the public ward as she would be in any of our private homes.  If I am satisfied&mdash;and, of course, when I say I am satisfied I want Senators to understand that I am satisfied by advice, because I do not know anything about these things or I do not know very much anyway&mdash; that people will be treated as well in the public ward as in the private home, then, as far as this legislation goes, if I provide for them in the public ward I am doing my duty as Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>I know that we should have respect, if you like, for people's feelings beyond that.  If, as mentioned by Senator Cunningham, a person is diffident about going into a public ward and would prefer to be in a private room or a private home, I am afraid we cannot legislate for that.  The best we can do is what we have offered here.  If the patient wants to choose his or her hospital, all we can do is to give a subvention and let the patient pay the difference.  We are going a good way to meet them.  After all, they are not getting anything at present.  We are going a good way to meet them by giving this subvention to help them out in such a contingency.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuire talked about private enterprise and nationalisation. I must say that I agree with him.  I do not think that nationalisation is a good thing.  But I do not see any indication of nationalisation in this <Col N="1109" /> Bill.  That is another instance of these vague generalisations and criticisms of the Bill.  They talk about destroying private enterprise, encouraging nationalisation and so on.</P>
    <P>It was rather interesting, I must say, to hear the Senator say that we are over-taxed in this country and then add: &ldquo;We are not saying that; it is the Government who are saying that.&rdquo; It is news to me that the Fine Gael Party think we are not over-taxed in this country.  Senator McGuire also stated that this Bill was going against vocational organisation.  I admit, of course, that it is not 100 per cent. vocational organisation or perhaps 50 per cent. either.  I do not know what percentage it may be, but I never claimed that the scheme was brought in on a vocational organisation basis. I do not know if it would be possible to do that.</P>

Whatever way it turns out, I suppose some of them will be right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we have the old familiar objection again, that we have not got the facilities and the hospitals.  What has it got to do with it, if you like, that we have not got the hospitals?  What we are doing here is, we are saying to the man in the middle income group: &ldquo;If you are sent to a hospital we will try to help you&rdquo;, but we assume that he has been sent to a hospital.  Such a person is being sent to a hospital at the moment, but he has to pay.  The difference under this Bill is that we say: &ldquo;We will help you out.&rdquo;  I do not know why there should be more hospital beds required as a result of this Bill.  I know that there are more wanted and we are building hospitals as quickly as we can.  I do not see how this Bill makes such a difference.  If it does make a big difference, it means that the middle income group will come <Col N="1110" /> forward for the first time for operations.</P>

      <P>Senator McGuire says that we should have got the goodwill of all those concerned.  I tried my best and I did not succeed.  He said it would be ridiculous for a man to go into battle if all the officers mutinied.  But if you had bad officers and if the men thought they should get rid of them it would be a whole lot better.  It would be an ideal solution if they would let the men come along and work this Bill.  Senator McGuire laid down his own moral principles which, of course, I agree with.  But the question is, are they properly applied?  For instance, I agree with the Ten Commandments. That does not prove that the Bill is against the Ten Commandments. That is what has to be proved and not whether or not I agree with moral principles.  Senator Baxter patronised me so much that he said I went a long way with him in agreeing on moral principles.  He said he admitted parents had responsibility for their families.  Whom did he think he was talking to?  Did he think he was talking to a heathen?  One would think he had a divine mission in this House to educate Fianna Fáil on moral principles.</P>

Here again we have one of the good moral people who talks about other people and thanks God he is not like the other men who spend nights in the pubs and put their money on dogs.  We are getting so much education from Senators McGuire and Baxter that I will not have to go to the mission in my parish next week.</P>

      <P>Senator McGuire said he listened very carefully to the arguments between Senator Cunningham and myself and that he had come down in favour of Senator Cunningham.  I suppose that was a foregone conclusion. However, Senator Cunningham talked about the Cancer Institute at a meeting last week.  I just mentioned that as an instance of an argument that <Col N="1112" /> may appear to go in favour of Senator Cunningham, that I or my predecessor, as the case might be, had set up this Cancer Institute which was a very heathen sort of institution.</P>

      <P>A State institution.  The words were not very complimentary. At column 840 of the Seanad Debates of the 30th September, 1953, Senator Cunningham said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Department of Health has been responsible, the Minister for Health&mdash;I do not say the present Minister&mdash;for the establishment of a State hospital in this city for the treatment of cancer.  There were two already but he overlooked that and established a State hospital for the treatment of cancer, and cancer cases from the hospitals in the country are directed to this hospital in Dublin.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will read out paragraph 8 of Section E of the Report.  It is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is not considered that any existing institution in Dublin is capable of sufficient expansion to provide a suitable centre.  Immediate steps should, therefore, be taken to build a modern centre equipped with full facilities for radiotherapeutic and surgical work, and comprising all necessary Departments for the ancillary services and research.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If Senators have any doubts we will have this Report put on the Table of the House so that everybody can see it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>To build, is it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, of course.  &ldquo;To build a modern centre equipped with full facilities&rdquo; and so on.  Therefore, what was recommended was the building of <Col N="1115" /> a separate centre for cancer.  It was signed by 15 members of whom Professor Cunningham was one.</P>
      <P>The Senator took me and my predecessor to task here the other day for setting up this institution.  He spoke for a long time in the Seanad on the other two institutions that were there, and also on the fact that the other voluntary hospitals in Dublin could provide this cancer surgery.  Any Senator listening to him would be under the impression that the Minister who set that up was doing something which was hostile to the voluntary hospitals, but the voluntary hospitals, in reply to Senator Cunningham and to the other on this committee, had recommended that this institution should be built for that purpose. Arising out of that, I and my predecessor were accused, I think, of refusing a new hospital in Dublin, and of refusing it X-ray facilities for its patients. Perhaps I had better give the words the Senator used:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A new hospital is being planned in Dublin at the moment and the people who were planning it were told not to make any arrangements about X-ray treatment for patients. Here we have a direction from the Department of Health as to what may or may not be done.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was the new St. Vincent's Hospital. On the 10th April, 1949, a member of the medical staff of St. Vincent's, in his capacity as honorary secretary, wrote to the Department to say that they were planning a hospital of 450 beds and that they were up against some major difficulties particularly in regard to ancillary services, namely, the out-patient, pathological laboratory and radiological departments.</P>
      <P>A reply to that was sent on the 10th June, 1949, from the Department of Health in which it was stated:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;While it will be appreciated that it is difficult to make a close estimate as to the number of special cases which may be referred for radiological investigation through local authority hospitals and public health schemes, it is felt that provision for <Col N="1116" /> dealing with 1,500 such cases yearly should be sufficient.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A schedule of accommodation was the next thing that came from the Building Committee of St. Vincent's Hospital. It was received by the Department on the 26th April, 1951, and, following that, there was a fairly long correspondence between the hospital and the Department.  As a matter of fact, I came in at that stage, or some time after that.  On the 23rd November, 1951, there was a conference with two members of the staff of St. Vincent's Hospital, the county surveyor and the architect.  The provision of deep X-ray therapy was discussed.  It was agreed&mdash;I ask Senators to remember this&mdash;&ldquo;that consideration of this would be deferred for the moment and that the Department would write to the Cancer Association inquiring whether leucemias and pre- and post-operative cancers would be dealt with in the Cancer Institute, and also as to whom they proposed to recommend to take charge of radioactive isotopes.&rdquo;  A letter on the lines agreed was written to the Cancer Association on the 30th November, 1951, and on the 24th January, 1952, the Cancer Association replied saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This association was set up by the previous Minister for Health on the recommendation of the Consultative Cancer Council.  The latter body, which consisted of a number of experienced scientific and medical men&mdash;one of whom is a member of the staff of St. Vincent's Hospital&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and whom I have identified as Senator Cunningham,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;was advised by a recognised expert on cancer treatment organisation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later on they say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In recommending that provision for X-ray therapy facilities should not be made available in the proposed new hospital, the association would like it to be understood that this recommendation in no way conflicts with the proposal of the authorities of St. Vincent's Hospital to make provision in the said new <Col N="1117" /> hospital for the future use of radioactive isotopes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A copy of that letter was forwarded on the 7th February, 1952, to St. Vincent's Hospital staff, and we have heard nothing since.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>At a joint meeting, remember, of the staff of St. Vincent's Hospital with the Department of Health, it was agreed to ask the Cancer Institute for their views.  We got their views.  We sent them to St. Vincent's Hospital and have heard nothing since.  Is that a refusal?  If that is a refusal then we will have to get more clear on these things in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to Senator Fearon.  He said that the Minister, in implementing this legislation, should be careful in his activities or in his administration, and that he should try to co-operate with everybody concerned. That, indeed, was very good advice. The Senator said that the Minister should co-operate with the local authorities and help them.  I think we are all agreed on that.  He also said that the local authorities may lose a certain amount of their control because, as he pointed out, the Minister may order them to do certain things which would cost money, and that, therefore, they would have no control over expenditure to that extent.  Well, I suppose that is true.  That happens, of course, very often in connection with legislation which is passed dealing with local government, harbour commissioners and other people.  Expenses are put upon them in that way, but it is not considered that they lose a certain amount of control.  The Senator <Col N="1118" /> went on to say that unfair attacks were made on the medical profession. I do not know who said that they had a vested interest in ill-health.  Well, of course, that is untrue.  The Senator said that, under this Bill, there would be a new type of doctor developed because he will be more a State doctor than the doctor we had in the past.  I cannot see that at all.  I dealt with that point already and I do not want to deal with it again.  He said also that I should try to co-operate with the medical profession.  Well, now, I have done my best, I must say.  I do not know&mdash;I may be at fault&mdash;but I consciously think that I have not been at fault in my dealings with the medical profession.  I think I have never lost an opportunity of saying, both here and in the Dáil, that I was only too willing to meet the Irish Medical Association and to discuss these matters with them.  I pointed out in the Dáil that not I alone but my predecessors, Dr. Browne and Dr. Ward, had met with the same reception from the Irish Medical Association in any proposals which they brought forward.</P>
    <P>It was not this country only that Senator Cunningham talked about here.  He talked about a man called Sir Earle Page who brought in a scheme in Australia.  I find that Senator McKenna, Minister for Health and Social Welfare before Sir Earle Page came in, made a very interesting observation.  He says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It (the Government) has regretfully come to the conclusion that despite the splendid services rendered by the great number of practitioners your Association is grievously lacking in a sense of social responsibility.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the British Medical Association in Australia which corresponds to our Irish Medical Association.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Having exhausted every endeavour to secure the co-operation of your Association the Government does not intend that its proposals should be further delayed or frustrated by your Council or Association.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>All right.  Sir Earle Page was a spokesman for the British Medical Association when another Socialist Minister, Aneurin Bevan, was bringing in a health scheme in England. Sir Earle Page, of course, spoke for the British Medical Association much the same as Senator Cunningham would speak for the Irish Medical Association here.  He spoke very vigorously against Mr. Bevan's scheme. Towards the end of these negotiations, much the same as our medical association here, they developed a liking for an insurance scheme.  They started feverishly to work on this insurance scheme to try, if you like, to get something out of the wreck.  When Mr. Bevan was going on with this scheme, at this stage, Sir Earle Page was made Minister for Health in Australia, and by a strange coincidence he proposed an insurance scheme to the Australian Medical Association which, of course, they accepted.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Medical Association <Col N="1120" /> told me, about two years ago, it was working well, but in fact it did not commence to work until about six months ago.  It is voluntary insurance and anybody who likes can join it by paying a certain contribution.  They get services if they join, and if they do not join the State has to look after them.  That was my objection to the same scheme here.  I said: &ldquo;What is the use of a voluntary scheme to me? It is all right for those who join but somebody must look after the persons who do not join.&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;Go ahead with your scheme.  I am not stopping you, but whether you do or not I must bring in this scheme.&rdquo;  Let them go ahead with their scheme if they want to and the State will look after the others.  That is exactly what is taking place in Australia.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If they join, and if they do not join they look after themselves. Apart from the health scheme brought in by Sir Earle Page, who is evidently <i>persona grata</i> with the Irish Medical Association, they have to give free medicines to everybody irrespective of means.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, whether they are insured or not.  This is what the State is doing apart from what the insurance section is doing.  There is also the subsidisation of hospital care irrespective of means.  In their legislation, also, I notice that they have compulsory X-ray examination for every person over the age of 14.  I would not like to try that on here because I would be excommunicated by Senator Baxter and some other people here. However, they are doing that in Australia under Sir Earle Page, I presume, <Col N="1121" /> because he is the Minister. There are compulsory powers to compel anybody who is or may be suffering from T.B., including contacts of sufferers, to undergo any medical X-ray or bacteriological examination thought necessary.</P>

      <P>I have not very much more to say.  I would not like any Senator or the public to be under the impression that I was unfair to hospitals which were dealing with cancer.  Senator Cunningham gave the impression that my predecessor and I did nothing for them.  As regards the Hume Street Hospital, they received <Col N="1122" /> £31,252; St. Anne's Skin and Cancer Hospital got £34,450, the bulk of which was received within the last two years. Therefore, there is no truth whatever in the allegation made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>St. Luke's will probably cost a great deal more on Senator Cunningham's recommendation.  Senator O'Dwyer made the observation that it was unfair for the person in the dispensary area to have the opinion of only one doctor.  I must say I agree with that and I hope the next stage in our legislation in this respect will be that not only will there be a choice of doctor in the case of maternity but a choice of doctor all round.  That will be a big step when we are in a position to take it.</P>
      <P>Senator Baxter is rather worried whether I am happy about this legislation or not.  I do not claim that it is an ideal piece of legislation, or the last word.  It is the best that can be done at the moment.  We are going as far, probably, as the country can afford in helping people out in regard to health. I do not think we are going further than we are bound to go if we want to have regard to all the factors that are there.  Senator Baxter talked about four or five people being in favour of this Bill.  There was only one division in the Dáil on it, as far as I am aware, and about 20 per cent. of the Dáil voted against it.  There was one division in this House on some clause and about 33 per cent. voted against it. Taking the two Houses together, it looks as if there is an overwhelming majority in favour of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Senator Baxter wonders if we could have got a Bill that would meet with the approval of everybody.  That would be very difficult, I must say.</P>

      <P>I think I have dealt with any point that was raised on the Fifth Stage.  The only point remaining is the cost.  I have always admitted that it is not an easy matter to give an estimate of the cost of this legislation. The estimate we have given from time to time is of the cost of the provisions of this Bill when they are all put into operation.  It will take probably three or four years before everything is brought in, but when they are all brought in the cost, according to the estimate we have given on more than one occasion, will be about £2,000,000.  That is divided&mdash;£1,000,000 on the local authorities and £1,000,000 on the State.  The £1,000,000 on the local authorities would be raised by, I think, about 1/9 in the £ on the poor law valuation.  In the same way, we usually say that we think this Bill is not going to cost more than 2/- in the £ on local authorities.  That is the best estimate I can give.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1124" /> I do not know whether there may be certain factors in the situation that I have not taken into account.  We may be wrong in our estimates, but we have estimated it as honestly as possible, without trying to keep it down or to raise it.  We have given that estimate and it is the best we can give.  I think it would be unreasonable for any Senator to expect a Department to give a firm estimate.  We do not know how far the scheme will be adopted by those who are entitled to it.  We do not even know the full range of people who will be entitled to claim under it.  There are so many unknown factors, therefore, that it is absolutely impossible to give a really firm estimate; but we think that it should not exceed about 2/- in the £.</P>
