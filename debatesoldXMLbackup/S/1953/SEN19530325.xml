    <P>Leave granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to make provision in respect of the area of jurisdiction of the coroner and sheriff of the County of Dublin in consequence of the extension of the boundary of the County Borough of Dublin by the City of Dublin (Extension of Boundary) Provisional Order, 1953, as confirmed by the Oireachtas.&mdash;(Senator Quirke.)</P>

      <P>This is a very unusual Bill and I would request the Seanad to take all stages of the Bill to-day.  It is a very simple Bill and, owing to technical reasons, it was not possible to have it ready in time.  It is proposed to preserve the jurisdiction of the coroner and sheriff for County Dublin within the same area over which they at present have jurisdiction.  That is really all that it means.  If this Bill were not passed before April 1st, there might be confusion concerning the area of jurisdiction of these officials.  We shall circulate the Bill immediately and if the Seanad agrees, I shall return at 7 o'clock.</P>

    <Title>Central Fund Bill, 1953&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is in usual form.  Sections 1 and 2 authorise the issue of money from the Central Fund to cover, first of all, the total amount of the Supplementary and Additional Estimates for the current financial year which were not already covered by the Appropriation Act, 1952, and, secondly, the amount of the Vote on Account, 1953-54. Section 3 provides for borrowing by the Minister for Finance in respect of these two items and the issue by him against such borrowing of such securities as he sees fit.</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann has granted a Vote on Account, amounting to £34,185,410, to enable Supplies and Services to be carried out until the individual Estimates have been passed and the Appropriation Act for the year has become law.  The White Paper which has been circulated to members of the Oireachtas will have enabled Senators to ascertain for themselves how this sum has been made up.  The Supply Services, according to the Estimates for 1953-54 which have been presented by the Government to Dáil Éireann, total £100,548,106, which is an increase of £5,676,483 on the figure published in the Volume of Estimates for 1952-53. In making comparison, however, it is necessary to have regard to the alterations in the 1952-53 figure which were made in the Budget for the current year.  This Budget, it will be recalled, provided for, firstly, heavy extra expenditure on social welfare services which was offset mainly by savings on food subsidies.  Allowing for these charges, but ignoring the sum of £1,000,000 which was also included to cover unspecified Supplementary Estimates, the net figure for the Supply Services in 1952-53 was £93,954,000, so that the increased sum required to pay for these services in 1953-54 is £6,594,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The largest increases over the original Estimates for 1952-53 arise in <Col N="1001" /> respect of the following services: Social Welfare Services, £6,463,132; Health, £5,308,600; Defence, £1,381,350; Primary Education, £344,440; Forestry, £295,100; Army Pensions, £291,520; Wireless Broadcasting, £280,740.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the extra provision which was made in the Budget of 1952-53 for the social welfare services.  In fact, the Supplementary Estimate taken for these services amounted to £4,754,810, but even if this sum is taken into account, provision for the coming year, that is, 1953-54, will still show an increase of £1,708,322 over the current year.  The balance of the supplementary provision for 1952-53 is £4,526,925 and includes £580,010 for Health, £715,000 for Defence, and £167,300 for Primary Education.</P>
    <P>The Health Estimate increase is mainly occasioned by the new item, Grant-in-Aid of the Hospitals' Trust Fund, which, it is proposed, will be £4,500,000.  The capital of this fund is exhausted and it is necessary, therefore, for the Exchequer to come to its aid if the hospital building programme is not to be brought to a standstill. Decreases of any significance are to be found only, I regret to say, in a few Estimates, notably the Estimate for Industry and Commerce, Agriculture, Posts and Telegraphs and the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise, I think, that a net decrease, or even a comparatively small increase, shown in any particular Estimate may tend to conceal substantial individual items of increase in the Estimate.  A good illustration of this is to be found in the Estimate for the Department of Local Government which, although it shows a net increase of only £141,740 which would appear perhaps to be merely of casual significance having regard to the size of the Estimate itself, contains an increase of £300,000 in the amount to be provided for the purchase, erection and reconstruction of dwelling-houses by private individuals and public utility societies and, in addition, makes provision for a further sum of £400,000 for a new item to wit, grants to local authorities for the improvement of roads conducive to development of the tourist <Col N="1002" /> industry in the Gaeltacht and in the congested areas.</P>
    <P>Again, the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture although showing a net decrease, provides £179,304 more for the land reclamation scheme, or the land rehabilitation project as it still continues to be described, than was originally provided in 1952-53 and it doubles the original provision in 1952-53 of £300,000 for ground limestone subsidy. Again, in the case of the Department of Industry and Commerce while we have a net decrease on the Vote as a whole, nevertheless there is included in the total £400,000 more than in 1952-53 for the repayment of advances for rural electrification and, as against a token provision of £5 made in 1952-53 for fuel subsidy, we have a provision of £240,000.  This is the amount required to cover losses connected with the stocks of coal accumulated by Fuel Importers Limited against the contingency of an outbreak of war, and, I may say, the possibility of a reduction in or cessation of supplies from Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The total of £100,000,000 for the Supply Services does not, of course, take into account the additions during the year for new services.  I think the Seanad will agree with me in my view that it would be carrying optimism to the extreme to expect that the coming year will not produce its quota of Supplementary Estimates.  Even making allowance for such additions, it must in any event be remembered that the provision for the Supply Services constitutes only part, though of course a very large part, of the total State outlay.  The problem of keeping such outlay within the limits imposed by the capacity of taxpayers to meet it and not only the capacity of the taxpayers to meet it, but their willingness to meet it, is becoming very great indeed, especially as demands for increased public services continue to be made.  However what these difficulties are will be fully revealed in the Financial Statement for the year which, as the Tánaiste has informed Dáil Éireann to-day, will be made to that House on the 6th May and which no doubt as is customary will be the subject of prolonged and acute debate.</P>
    <P>These are the main provisions of the <Col N="1003" /> Central Fund Bill and in mentioning them I have drawn the attention of the Seanad to those more noteworthy changes in the Estimates for the coming financial year as compared with those, which have already been debated by Dáil Éireann, for the current year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has told us that this Bill comes in the usual form and in presenting it the Minister has run true to his usual form.  That is to say that he is increasing expenditure and this year he is presenting us with the biggest bill ever.  It should be noted in the beginning that that is not because of any special circumstances of the moment.  It is in accordance with the settled policy of the Minister to increase expenditure and further to increase taxation and costs generally. The Minister and his colleagues have always made pronouncements of economy but they have never carried them out.</P>
      <P>The reason for that was that they never regarded economic and financial problems as a whole but they always regarded everything from the point of view of politics.  They made all sorts of wild statements inside and outside the Dáil and criticised expenditure of every kind.  They were against the higher civil servants, the E.S.B., and indeed on occasion the Dáil itself. When the Minister introduced his first Budget in 1932 of which he was very proud, he increased taxation and expenditure enormously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps it should be said that the policy of the Government&mdash;it has been always a consistent policy, lasting until the present moment and very strongly evident even in the last financial year &mdash;is to combine low agricultural production with a very rash and very imprudent form of industrial development. It was not always rash and it was not always imprudent, but very often it was rash and imprudent and very expensive.  It has had a certain effect in putting people into employment but, looking at the picture as a whole, one sees that as many people have gone out of agriculture as have come into employment in industry and, <Col N="1004" /> in spite of all that, nearly 90,000 people are now unemployed.  However, adverting again to the Minister's politicial Party point of view, no doubt the industrial revolution did help to bring money into the funds of the Party and enabled them to fight elections, even if not always successfully.</P>
    <P>One reason why this bill is higher, and has indeed steadily become higher ever since the Government went into office, is that they have an immense faith in Government and parliamentary action.  They are never done thinking up schemes and bringing in schemes, with resultant increase in the cost of government.  In 1953 we have higher direct and higher indirect taxation, higher costs in agriculture and in industry and a higher cost of living, both from the point of view of taxation and also from the point of view of tariffs. The impact of these tariffs on the cost of living is never quite ascertainable, but the process by which the Government have proceeded without using any discreation in the matter has certainly added to our costs.  All that has added up to the highest bill with which the Oireachtas has ever been confronted. Yet, with all that, there has been a complete failure to develop overall agricultural production.  We have failed, although Northern Ireland and England have succeeded in increasing theirs.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his colleagues display a curious lack of restraint.  We have had from them political polemics about high finance, economic affairs, the balance of payments and what taxes would produce.  The Minister has told us that the position now is not so bad as he had thought it was.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to vex anybody but the Minister last year described the situation in the most lurid terms and was wrong in every single prophecy he made about our trade, our balance of payments position and even about the returns from taxes <Col N="1005" /> which he himself imposed.  It would be impossible to concede that the improvement in the balance of trade is something due to the Minister's policy.  I think that is a claim which is arrogant and completely unfounded.  The more favourable position of our balance of trade, which, it now turns out, instead of having an enormous deficiency, may very well be balanced&mdash;taking into consideration invisible exports&mdash;may very well be due to the Minister's predecessor.</P>
      <P>Our general figures in respect of the balance of trade have undoubtedly improved.  However, you have little evidence for the ordinary citizen or the 90,000 unemployed that there is any improvement at all.  Whether you are a shopkeeper, artisan, builder or labourer, whatever your tastes run to in food or in drink, it is very difficult to believe that the position is good. Trade is bad and employment is bad and difficult to get.  You have two things together here which the Minister has brought about and which are quite rare: high prices and high unemployment. They do not usually go together.</P>
      <P>Similarly we have the policy of dear money of which the Minister is proud. We have paid 5 per cent. for money and we have to pay interest and sinking fund of course out of our annual income.  But the Northern Ireland Electricity Board issued a loan of £2,000,000 at what works out at about 4½ per cent. of guaranteed stock redeemable in 1968-71 at 99.  They got £26,000,000.  Their loan was over-subscribed 13 times although their income-tax is 9/6 and ours is only 7/6.  Yet our Government here is proud to have obtained a loan at 5 per cent. at par. The comparable rate here, taking the tax into consideration, is 4 per cent. Considering our trade resources and external assets it is difficult to see how our credit, which once stood so high, has fallen.  It is difficult to see why the Northern Ireland Electricity Board should be able to get money at almost 1 per cent. less than we can get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I noticed yesterday or the day before that the North of Scotland Hydro-Electrical Board is looking for £20,000,000 at 4 per cent., redeemable <Col N="1006" /> 1973-78 at 96.  The gross yield is 4¼ per cent. and the net yield, after tax of 9/6, would be about £2 6s.  The net yield on our loan is £3 2s. 6d.  That is something the Minister has accomlished and for which he has been patted on the back, but it is something we have to pay for and it was caused by the wild and irresponsible statements which the Minister made in the course of his political polemics about finance&mdash;because he spares nothing and nobody when he is on that kind of line.  It is an extraordinary thing that the Northern Ireland Electricity Board can get money at a much cheaper rate than we can and that Britain, after two crippling wars, can borrow at 1 per cent. less for comparable loans than we can.  I think at the time of the last Government&mdash;if I may be allowed to mention the last Government&mdash;our terms were slightly better than the British.  Our credit has been brought down by the political campaign of the Minister and his colleagues, by their false prophecies and irresponsible statements and by the Minister's own recklessness for the purpose of internal political Party gain.</P>
    <P>We are going to spend a great deal of money on a number of other things and I think their roots are also to be found in politics.  The Government looked around after the last election and we have several fruits of the results of that election: an Undeveloped Areas Bill, and a proposal to build turf-fired stations in four different places in the West of Ireland.  I suggest that they are not power stations but polling stations, that their aim is rather electoral than electrical and that the results may very well be to reduce the E.S.B., which is a sound concern, a large business institution in this country which gives good service to the people, to the position that it may have to be like C.I.E. looking for subsidies from the State.  All that, I think, is the result of politics.  In fact, the Minister himself I noticed in the other House, or his deputy&mdash;I forget which&mdash;said with some pride: &ldquo;The inter-Party Government squandered money&rdquo;, and next moment said: &ldquo;Look at us, we are spending twice as much as they spent on capital <Col N="1007" /> development.&rdquo;  It is very difficult to have it both ways.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelColgan" hpid="Mr. Colgan Mr. Colgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difference between squandering and spending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not get that. Perhaps it is just as well.  But I thought I knew the Dublin accent well. The Government has been in control with the exception of a little over three years of this country's resources and of the Civil Service and legislation of this State for nearly 20 years, all told. One would like to know what the policy has been and what the result of that policy has been over all those years.  The result of it is to be found now in a Bill, which is the biggest Bill ever presented to us, in a swollen expenditure and in quarrels with almost every class in the State.  The civil servants have a very substantial grievance and are agitating at the moment.  The Government now in office created the situation some years ago against which the national teachers went on strike very unwillingly.  Now we have a situation in which doctors find themselves thwarted, a situation in which civil servants of a very high grade find themselves in the position of walking the streets by way of protest.</P>
      <P>Now, it is the present Government which has been in charge of the civil servants for the last 20 years.  They have taken over the Service.  At one time they were sworn enemies of heads of the Civil Service, said they were Freemasons, Free Staters and Heaven knows what else.  They did their very best at one time to suborn the civil servants, to induce civil servants to serve the Party, to be Fianna Fáil henchmen and against the Government of the day.  They have promoted some of them for political reasons.  They staffed the temporary grades and some other grades with political hangers-on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the good things in the legislation of the present Government was the Labour Court.  The Labour Court is based upon the notion that the case of any set of employees should be heard by intelligent, impartial, independent people, that the two sides of the case should be presented and a decision <Col N="1008" /> should be made.  We know that the employer need not agree.  Neither need the employees but, in nearly every case, the employers have agreed. Surely the Government should not give a bad example in this case by adopting a completely <i>non possumus</i> attitude towards the Civil Service.  It should be said that the Civil Service, the great bulk of it, is not highly paid.</P>
    <P>A great many people enter the Civil Service, foolishly, I think, and live for the remainder of their lives in a frustrated condition.  The Government seems to have a policy which hits the unorganised white-collar class.  That class is now facing rising costs and rising prices and the falling value of money.  The Government should adopt the policy of ordinary citizens and should not employ people whom they have not the money to pay.  It might be better if one could hold an investigation and see how many civil servants we do really want.  Nothing could be more frustrating than the present situation.  Many of these people are in a state of frustration and discontent, and these are people of increasing importance in ruling the affairs of the country.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service attracts excellent people to its ranks, and they are very often, in the course of their service, reduced both in initiative and in competency. The Civil Service maintains grades of people who are much above their work.  Entrance into the clerical officer grade, for example, is based upon the intermediate certificate, but it is absolutely impossible to get a place as a clerical officer unless you have a very, very good leaving certificate standard. The result is to get people into the Civil Service of a very high grade who are better than their work.  This leads to grave discontent, and psychological disturbance for the remainder of their lives.  Perhaps, indeed, the Civil Service is swollen beyond reason, not necessarily in the higher grades, and that is a situation which has never been properly looked into.  I am quite sure that there is no real control of it.  Has the Department of Finance, for example, which works very hard and which includes <Col N="1009" /> a great many competent officials, any real control over the numbers?</P>
    <P>Take, for example, the Department of Defence.  In 1938-39 Estimates, the number of civil servants in the Minister's office was 292.  The number in the present Book of Estimates is 553. One could understand that there was a big increase during the war when the Army stood at over 50,000 men but, apparently, compared with pre-war, the number is doubled.  One could perhaps take some steps about the Civil Service which would lead to greater production and reduce the costs for the taxpayer.  The cause of the present position is, to a considerable extent, that we have carried over parliamentary procedure from the British which was created for a situation wholly different from the situation in which we now exist.  The Civil Service machinery here and in Britain is not fashioned for the job it has to do now. It includes parliamentary questions, debates, public accounts committees, and so on.  We could possibly be able to improve on them if it were looked into in an intelligent way, and were not a matter of Party politics.</P>
    <P>This Government had a fair innings with its policies.  It has been nearly 20 years in office.  It has been offered and it has been given co-operation in every national and international emergency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>That really is a fundamental point about them&mdash;that Fianna Fáil politics are not politics at all, but that everything else is politics. If you agree with Fianna Fáil, you are a faithful servant of Cathleen Ní Houlihan wrapped around in a green mantle and everything is all right; but if you say they are wrong, you are a low politician and none of them wants to let you speak.  They once tried to prevent their opponents from being heard but they were a complete failure on that&mdash;I can remember it well&mdash;and they will be a complete failure on this, too.</P>
      <P>Let me resume what I was trying to say, and the first point is illustrated by these interruptions.  The Government Party still clings obstinately to the single Party, right all the time&mdash; right in every detail, right from the bottom up, accepting advice from nobody and trying to dragoon everybody. The Minister and the Minister's friends&mdash;perhaps you will not believe me, Sir, but I have this note written down, and it illustrates exactly what I want to say, as it has been illustrated by what has happened here&mdash;are still engaged in a bad-tempered effort to justify their own stupidity and criminality in the past.  They are still incurably political in their outlook and never view our problems objectively. They never seek solutions in an economic or financial way, but always seek a solution which they think will pay a political dividend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely this Central Fund Bill is a confession that they have been a complete failure.  Look at our position: rural depopulation and emigration; <Col N="1012" /> the City of Dublin increasing every day&mdash;we had a Bill last week and we have another to-day dealing with the immense increase of Dublin, whereas one of the main features of their policy used to be decentralisation, which they certainly have not accomplished&mdash;rising taxes, rising prices, and falling production.  I would suggest also that our national spirit is not rising either, because people are getting cynical about public affairs.</P>
    <P>One of the roads towards economy&mdash; I have suggested it often before&mdash;is that there should be less power given to the State and more power left to the ordinary citizen; that there should be a truce on legislation, except legislation like this Bill and the Finance Bill which are necessary for the running of the State; that people should be left alone; and that Bills should not be constantly brought in which create more and more civil servants, give more and more power to the State and add more and more to the costs of the State.</P>
    <P>Instead of the eternal political Party approach to our problems, we should consider them as problems which have to be solved by some kind of co-operation and goodwill, and not on the basis that everybody is an enemy unless he is prepared to subscribe to every single thing the all-powerful single Party wants.  The Party now in office should give up the notion that they must use the resources of the State to preserve and improve the position of the all-powerful Party.  If they did that, the country's problems might be on some way to solution, and, instead of an increasing bill, we might possibly be on the road towards decreasing expenditure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Hayes took us back over 30 years and referred to certain actions taken by the Republican Party to ensure as far as possible that the promises made to the then Dáil Éireann by the then President that the Republican institutions would be maintained should and would be implemented.  It is because those who accepted the promises then made took the line of action they took that we have had in recent years a reconversion to these policies and an acceptance of <Col N="1013" /> all for which that particular episode was gone through.</P>
      <P>He also suggested that the economic war was a Party war, that it was begun by Fianna Fáil and engaged in for some political purpose.  The issues at that time were put to the people, and the people by a majority vote elected here an Irish Government and gave them a mandate to put into effect the policies which the people had accepted.  I have said in this House before and on various platforms throughout the country that it is regrettable to look back even now over that period and to think that there were then persons who claimed to be representatives of the Irish people, who, when the Irish people had decided on a particular line of action, did not side with the Irish people.</P>
      <P>Senator Hayes suggests that, in every crisis, whether national or international, the Party opposite gave its support to the Government.  Had the Party in opposition at the beginning of the economic war done as any national Party would have done, no matter what their views on the matter may have been&mdash;the decision had been made: the people had made a decision and the Government, in the name of the people, took steps to implement it&mdash;they would have sided with the people.  In place of that, however, we had a campaign, as we had for many years afterwards, both openly and by suggestion, that all that was necessary was to win the people from their allegiance to and support of the then Government, and all would be well.</P>
      <P>There is, however, something which the Fine Gael Party and the Leaders of the Opposition do not seem to be able to grasp or understand, something which is deep down in the hearts of the people, particularly the small farmer and the worker, a national sentiment, and when that national sentiment is appealed to, as it was during those years, it was that sentiment and that steadfast devotion of theirs which won the economic war, in spite of the opposition of the Parties opposite and the various types, classes and colours of the shirts then worn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hayes suggested that an organised attempt was made to deprive <Col N="1014" /> the Opposition Parties of freedom of speech.  There was no such thing.  The excuse given at the time by the organisers of the Blueshirt movement was that it was an organisation which was going to insist that their speakers would be given a hearing throughout the country, but there was another ulterior motive in it to which expression was given by Deputy Costello, when he said that the Blackshirts had won in Rome, the Brownshirts in Germany and that the Blueshirts or blouses would win here.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes has travelled over all that ground and I had the feeling while he was speaking that it was a very well thought out campaign of his.  He was anxious to criticise the Bill before the House but he was at pains to see how he could do it without suggesting an alternative.  If the demand that the Minister is making on the people is too high and if, in the opinion of any member of the House it is one that should not be approved of, then I think the particular Senator should state the provisions in the Bill of which he does not approve.  Senator Hayes thought it wiser, however, to talk about the history of political events over the past 30 years.</P>
    <P>I also resent very strongly the suggestion that the industrial revival brought about under Fianna Fáil administration for over a period of 30 years had the sinister motive of trying to induce the people engaged in industrial development to subscribe to Party funds.  I think it is an insult to the people engaged in these industries to suggest that because the Government or a Party advocate what they think is the best policy for the country, a policy from which those engaged in industry might benefit to some extent, they should be expected to subscribe to a political Party.  It is only from the leaders of the Opposition Parties that such a suggestion would come. Having covered a period of 30 years, the Senator made some passing reference to the results of the recent elections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to remind the Senator that the election was held because of certain events that were about to take place in the Dáil and because the then Government thought it was better to dissolve rather than face defeat in the Dáil so that they might be able to come back again, make some more bargains and, by some method or other, secure a further term of office.  Senator Hayes, of course, is a much wiser politician than the other speakers in his Party who, referring to the same period, stated that the present Government had no mandate from the people to continue in office.</P>
      <P>I would remind Senator Hayes and those people that if the results were properly examined it would be found that the very members of the Dáil who were responsible for the decision to go to the country because of their withdrawal of support from the Government were re-elected.  That in itself proved that the persons who supported them originally in 1948, and who afterwards found that certain bargains and agreements had been entered into and a particular form of Government brought about, approved of the actions they took in forcing the Government to go to the country and ensuring that once more a Government, in whom the people of this country would have confidence, would be returned.</P>
      <P>I grant this to Senator Hayes and the members of the Opposition Party for what it is worth.  From what I know of the more ardent supporters of the Fine Gael Party, and those who supported the Party right through the years, they were the people whom I found most pleased, because there was a change of Government.  At least they felt that they knew where the Fianna Fáil Government was.  They knew what their policy was and they knew where they were going, but they never knew from day to day what the others' policy was or where the members of the inter-Party Government were going.  They did not know what direction, north, south, east or west, the various Parties composing that Government would drive it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1016" /> In his opening remarks, the Senator stated that the Minister was in his usual form for increasing taxation.  If Senator Hayes examines the Estimates over a number of years, and goes back to the last Book of Estimates prepared by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1947, before the change of Government, he will find that there was a demand for £58,000,000.  In the Estimates introduced by the inter-Party Government in 1951 the demand was for no less than £90,000,000.  That is to say, within the short period of three years there was an increased demand of £31,000,000 by the Senator's own Party, or at least the major Party in the then inter-Party Government.  Together with that increase of £31,000,000 during that period no less than £39,000,000 was raised by way of internal loans together with over £40,000,000 expenditure under Marshall Aid.</P>
    <P>The loudest boast of Senator Hayes and the members of his Party was that we were spending more money now than ever and that the spending must go on but, as I pointed out already, taxation during the three years of the inter-Party Government increased by £31,000,000.  Money borrowed from the people of this country amounted to £39,000,000.  Worse still, money was borrowed from the United States of America which must be paid back in dollars, not in sterling.  This country must earn dollars in order to pay that back.</P>
    <P>What has been the result of the expenditure of this money?  Where has it gone to?  Where is the machinery? Where is the capital development we heard so much talk about during the three years?  Senator Hayes referred to the question of unemployment.  He asked why we had the number of persons unemployed we had to-day. During the three years to which I refer, we had the various Ministers congratulating themselves on the housing drive. At that time we, on the Opposition side of the House, pointed out that if we were going to continue at that particular rate of building we would have to make plans for the future. Plans would have to be prepared and drainage and all the other works would have to be undertaken to ensure the continuation of work in the building <Col N="1017" /> trades.  But in order to show some spectacular results, all these details were forgotten.  The result now is that in many instances the building is not as brisk as it would have been had the Government of that time given thought to the importance of planning in advance the works to be undertaken.</P>
    <P>We had, with all the surrounding pomp and ceremony, the laying of hospitals and sanatoria foundations and we had vast sums of money being spent.  These plans, however, were prepared during Fianna Fáil period of office, prior to 1948, and under the Fianna Fáil Administration would have been given effect to in a more rational and planned manner than they were actually given effect to under the inter-Party Government.  These works which have been begun have to be completed and the Oireachtas and the people must find these moneys by taxation.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to go back over that full period of three years beyond to say that Senator Hayes referred to the national loan.  We have heard much criticism against the Minister for Finance because he did not seek the loan earlier.  Members of the Opposition and former inter-Party Government seem to have some particular fad about loans: if it is not a fad for raising loans, it is a fad for some change of monetary reform; if that cannot be done, they say, then we must change the banks.  Between transferring direction from one of these fads to another, we will always avoid getting down to making concrete suggestions and putting the facts before the people that there is only one way in which commitments which have to be met can be met, that is by work and production and finding the money ourselves.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes put before us the example of how moneys were raised in Northern Ireland, Scotland and England, and asked why it was not possible for our Minister for Finance to secure his loan at a lower rate of interest.  He did not tell us, however, that in the three times Mr. McGilligan, as Minister for Finance, attempted to raise far smaller sums of money he had failed and the loans were not fully subscribed and had to be taken <Col N="1018" /> up by the banks.  He did not tell us that in the intervening period the manner in which they had raised £39,000,000 or £40,000,000 became known to the people of the country and, particularly, those persons who would be likely to invest in any loan. These people realised that some serious steps must be taken to rectify the financial position if we were to make any serious contribution to providing for repayments and for utilising these moneys in the best possible manner.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes suggested also that this Party could not see any good in any suggestion or in any person in the Opposition, but he is the one person who suggests that there is something evil in every suggestion put forward by the Fianna Fáil Party and Government. I think it is not right for a member of this House to suggest that, because the Government takes very serious steps to do something for the Gaeltacht and congested areas in order to give these places some of the facilities given to other parts of the country&mdash;good housing and good hospitals&mdash;and to see that the natural resources there are developed and employment given to the people, there is something sinister behind it and something is being done for a motive, not a national motive or a motive to cater for the good of the people, and that the sole thought behind it is whether it is going to react well on the Party. Senator Hayes can rest quite assured from the record of his Party so far as the West of Ireland was concerned that, if the West is the only ray of hope for getting a governmental majority for his Party, he will have quite a peaceful time, because that day will never come.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House involves a large amount but, large as it is, when one examines the Book of Estimates, one is more inclined to quarrel with the provisions in so far as they may or may not prove ample under particular headings.  There is no one in the House who is prepared to get up here or in the country and say that we want to curtail or reduce our social welfare services.  Every time there is a suggestion made regarding the extension or increasing of such services <Col N="1019" /> we all maintain that the provision is not ample and should be more generous, no matter what service is concerned, old age pensions, widows and orphans.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind the House that the major increases occurring in the Book of Estimates are under the following headings.  We have increases for widows' and orphans' allowances, unemployment assistance, old age pensions, public health, and there is provision made to have new dispensaries built, with encouragement and assistance given to county councils and public health authorities to provide better and more up-to-date dispensaries. We often deplore the fact that many of our national schools are not being replaced by more up-to-date buildings and suggest that the replacement is not taking place quickly enough.  That may be, but the money has to be found and the day will come on May 6th when a decision will have to be made as to how that money is going to be secured.</P>
    <P>Much criticism has been levelled against the steps taken by the Minister for Finance last year to rectify the position then.  I would like to say now that I think I was the first person in this or the other House to advocate during the term of the inter-Party Government the curtailment or total abolition of food subsidies.  That would open a very wide field of discussion undoubtedly, almost as wide as Senator Hayes opened here this evening, and I think it would be better that we should avoid that.  I think the time has come when the leaders of every political Party should be honest with the people and put the issues clearly before them.  If there are services required&mdash;and we would all like to see many of the present services improved and extended&mdash;we must also be prepared to support measures necessary to find the money to do so.  If we are not prepared to do that, then we should not be associated with groups who will advocate the extension of the many services that are demanded.</P>

      <P>The Central Fund Bill is one of the few occasions <Col N="1020" /> in the year in which the Seanad has an opportunity of reviewing the state of the national finances.  I do not think I need apologise on this occasion for making a review of that kind, as shortly as I can.  In making that review I intend to be objective and detached. I hope to survey the good and bad financial aspects as they appear to me, and to emphasise&mdash;it cannot be over-emphasised&mdash;that the national finances cannot be studied in isolation but must be related to underlying conditions, such as production, trade and above all the balance of payments.</P>
      <P>In saying what I am going to say, I shall repeat what I have said on many previous occasions.  I make no apology for this.  I think that the elementary principles of financial prudence are universally valid.  I do not think one need apologise for repeating them, and they cannot be repeated too often.  Although they are universally valid, I think that they should be proclaimed with particular emphasis on certain occasions.  I think that the present debate is one of these occasions on which it is necessary to emphasise certain elementary financial principles which can only be ignored to the danger of the country.</P>
      <P>Looking at the state of our affairs to-day, it seems to me there are two good features which must be considered.  I am not going to enter into the question whether the Budget will be exactly balanced or not in the present year; there is a good deal of difference of opinion about that. Usually a Government attempts to show that the Budget is overbalanced, and that their revenue is buoyant, while the Party in opposition tries to show that the state of the country is such that the Government had not achieved a balanced Budget.  In the debates in the Dáil on this Bill and on the Vote on Account, it was the Opposition who were claiming that there was going to be a surplus in this year's Budget, and the Government were proclaiming quite definitely that there was going to be a deficit.  Taking the middle line, I think we can agree that the Budget this year is just going to be about balanced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second good feature in the <Col N="1021" /> situation is that equilibrium has been restored in the overall balance of payments.  This is partly the result of the last Budget, which was of a deflationary kind, but it is the result also of certain happenings in the outside world, such as a dropping-off in prices of some imports and the disappearance of the necessity for stockpiling. Therefore, partly as a result of Government policy and partly as a result of certain developments in the outside world, the balance of payments is coming more or less into equilibrium in the present time.</P>
    <P>As against these two favourable items, there are certain unfavourable matters such as unemployment and high emigration which is consequent on unemployment.  There is a good deal of discontent existing amongst certain sections of the population.  The Civil Service is protesting against the failure of the Government to implement the arbitration award.  That is a serious embarrassment, I am sure, to the Government and to the heads of the Civil Service.  As we have seen in the Book of Estimates, the expenditure of the State is growing.  Taxation appears to have reached the point of diminishing returns.  Finally, and most menacing of all, our agricultural production, as far as we know, continues to remain obstinately stagnant.</P>
    <P>There is no great increase of output taking place.  I think it is not unfair to say that the financial superstructure in the country tends to grow at a greater rate than the productive basis of our economy.  If that tendency continues long enough, the superstructure may become too heavy for the base.  That is, I am afraid, beginning to occur.  It may be no harm to repeat that equilibrium in the Budget and in the balance of payments, however desirable that may be, are desirable as means and not as ends in themselves. The ends of economic policy are the solvency, progress and prosperity of the nation as a whole.  One must always have regard to the level at which these two balances take place. Perhaps it is not incorrect to say that we should aim at attaining the balance of payments on the highest possible level and the balance of the Budget on <Col N="1022" /> the lowest possible level.  I do not say that that is universally true, but I do say that the tendency in this country is rather tending in the opposite direction. The equilibrium in the balance of payments has been obtained by a downward pressure and the equilibrium in the Budget is being obtained by an upward pressure.  That shows that the financial superstructure is too heavy for the national productive base. Efforts should be made either to lighten the superstructure or to strengthen the base.</P>
    <P>As regards the superstructure, everybody must agree that the Government is faced with very grave difficulties. When asked to curtail expenditure, the pressure of vested interests is so great that it requires supercourage on the part of politicians to curtail existing services very much. I suggest that, on the grounds of justice, one type of economy that should not be effected, if at all possible, is economy which causes discontent in the public services and raises complaints that promises have been broken and legitimate expectations have not been rewarded.  Having said that, I would say that no new commitments should be undertaken. Commitments, the full effects of which will not be seen until further Budgets, should be avoided rigorously. The time has definitely come, in the circumstances of this country, when further public expenditure cannot be embarked upon until the productive foundations of the country have been considerably strengthened.</P>
    <P>I have to accept, looking at the Book of Estimates, that certain increases in expenditure are unavoidable or at least have become unavoidable.  The question arises how far this additional expenditure can be met with the least injury to the welfare and the credit of the country.  Most of the indirect taxes have reached the point of diminishing return and further imposition of taxation will not produce any additional yield.  As regards direct taxation, I think that there might also be very wide agreement that anything in the nature of an increase in the standard rate of income-tax would have a very depressing effect on saving, on investment, <Col N="1023" /> on enterprise and on the country generally.  Any further taxation of business profits should, in particular, be avoided.</P>
    <P>I think this subject is so important that I should strengthen what I say by quoting an authority of high value. The recently published I.B.E.C. Report states that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The business tax structure has probably been too high for Ireland's state of industrial development.  The ostensible weight of this tax burden has been increased by what appears to be an inadequate allowance for depreciation and depletion, when consideration is given to the great need for strong incentives to encourage plant and equipment modernisation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that the point of diminishing returns has been reached both in indirect and direct taxation.  Possibly, to come back to a matter that was fully debated in this House before Christmas, the burden of direct taxation might be more equitably spread, but anything in the nature of an increase in the standard rate would have an adverse effect on incentive and should be avoided.  It, therefore, seems to me&mdash;and I think it is a general opinion&mdash;that the lightening of the superstructure must take place by a reduction in expenditure rather than by an increase in taxation.  Public opinion must be educated up to realise that Budget deficits for current expenditure are fundamentally unsound&mdash; financially, politically, economically and socially.  This is particularly true at a time like the present when interest rates are high.  Deficits that necessitate borrowing at the present time involve the payment of high rates of interest.</P>
    <P>Everything I have said regarding the lightening of the superstructure is, of course, always conditioned by the strengthening of the base.  Taking the longer view of matters which should be debated in this House in the course of this debate on the Bill, the strengthening of the foundations in this country is a matter which ought to engage the attention of every member of both Houses.  One of the reasons why I <Col N="1024" /> regret the abolition of the capital Budget is that in that Budget the distinction between current expenditure and investment expenditure was at least clearly brought out and put in the forefront of the national accounts in a way that could not fail to impress even the most casual reader of the Book of Estimates.</P>
    <P>The strengthening of the foundations in this country involves a considerable amount of capital investment.  This is a word which has been abused and bandied about and used in quite a wrong sense in many discussions in recent years.  Investment does not, in my opinion, include expenditure on durable consumer goods, however desirable from the social point of view those consumer goods might be.  It does not include the construction of mere amenities, of what appear to be capital constructions ancillary to the provision of social services.  Above all, it does not include expenditure of public money for the sake of giving employment, of making work.  None of those three things is, in my opinion, correctly described as investment.</P>
    <P>Investment, in the present context, and in the discussion of the national finances which should be carried out during this debate, must be narrowly defined.  It must be defined as the production of truly productive capital goods, whether fixed capital or working capital or stocks of raw materials, which in the near or even in the distant future will add something to the size of the national income.  And in the peculiar circumstances of this country I would go further and say that investment ought to produce the type of goods which will help the balance of payments, either by producing substitutes for imports or potential exports in the future.</P>
    <P>Everybody must agree that investment of this kind is desirable from the national point of view.  Everybody may not agree with my opinion that investment by private investors is preferable to investment by Government or by public authorities.  I have three reasons to support that view.  The first is the general political reason that individualism is, I think, to be preferred to socialism.  I prefer to see enterprise <Col N="1025" /> undertaken by private people than by public authorities.  The second reason is that private investment takes place under the stimulus of the profit motive and people working under the profit motive must be efficient at their peril. The third reason is that investment undertaken by private people leaves no legacy of debt behind, if it proves unsuccessful.  It leaves no hangover in the form of vast fixed-income-bearing securities which have to be borne by the taxpayer in the future.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that in this country everything should be done to encourage private investment.  Whether investment takes place by private investors or by public authorities it must be preceded by savings.  That brings me to the central point&mdash;I am repeating what I have said before but I make no apology for that, for the matter is even more urgent now than on previous occasions&mdash;that we must investigate the sources of savings in this country and try to utilise whatever are available in the best possible way.</P>
    <P>There are three sources of savings and three only.  The first is new savings out of current expenditure by private individuals or by companies. The second is the obtaining of foreign savings by encouraging foreign investors to invest in the country.  The third is to use up old savings by the repatriation of external investments. Savings may be obtained in all these three ways and I propose to say just a little about each of them in so far as they bear on problems which are relevant to this Bill.</P>
    <P>As regards new domestic savings, I do not propose to quote any figures in what I say, but every statistician, every foreign observer and every businessman agree that current savings in this country have not been at a sufficiently high level in recent years.  That is unquestionable.  At this point, I just want to quote one sentence out of deference to people in the House and in the country who do not consider that any statement on public finances is adequate or up to date unless reference is made to the late Lord Keynes. I am going to drop my piece of incense on that altar at this stage and beyond that I will not drop any more.  If <Col N="1026" /> there is sufficient investment, that new investment itself will create a source of new savings and therefore this process of investment which I am advocating may be a cumulative one in the sense that, if the investment is successful, further savings at a later date may become easier than they are to-day.</P>
    <P>We fully discussed domestic savings in our debate on income-tax.  All I will say is this.  The Government can encourage domestic savings by differential taxation on that part of personal and company incomes which is saved. The allowances for life insurance can be modified in this direction.  The depreciation allowance for companies, the taxation of undistributed profits&mdash; these are all matters which I will just mention as possible for encouraging the flow of savings.  Savings of the less well-off members of the community should be encouraged, and can be encouraged by suitable terms for savings certificates, post office savings bank deposits, and in other ways.  I am glad to note in the newspapers in the last couple of days that the Government is about to institute a savings drive.</P>
    <P>There is one way in which savings can be obtained, but which, in our country, I think, should not be resorted to, and that is by Budget surplus.  I think that savings obtained by means of a Budget surplus do not provide risk capital for the private investor and may even have the effect of reducing the incomes out of which risk capital might otherwise come. Therefore, I consider a Budget surplus in this country as a means of inducing savings something to be avoided or, if resorted to, only to be resorted to as a last resource.</P>
    <P>The second source of savings is foreign savings.  Here again I feel very strongly that, if foreign savings come into this country, they should come in the form of equities, risk-bearing capital, not loans from foreign Governments or foreign lenders.  Such loans leave a legacy of debt behind of a kind that involves pressure on the balance of payments.  In this matter, I think the country should learn a lesson from the experience of Marshall <Col N="1027" /> Aid.  We know that we will be faced for a number of years ahead with an obligation to repay large sums in dollars out of loans which were advanced in recent years.  I do not wish to enter into this particular controversy, but I think I can safely say that these loans were not all spent in such a way as to provide the means of their own repayment.  But, although I object to the borrowing abroad of fixed interest securities, sometimes this may be absolutely necessary.  I think that if money can be obtained in that way abroad more cheaply than at home it should not be despised.</P>
    <P>The experience to which Senator Hayes referred, of the Northern Ireland Electricity Board, is relevant in this respect.  The only thing I think that might be said about that is that, although we might be willing to borrow in that way, foreign Governments might not be willing to allow such borrowings. In the last couple of weeks, the Treasury refused to allow a public authority in New Zealand to borrow in the London market for the construction of a bridge.  A similar veto might easily be imposed on borrowings which we propose in this country which were not directly related to improving the balance of payments of the sterling area, which is the test that I understand was applied on that occasion.</P>
    <P>I think that the possibility of attracting private capital from abroad has not been sufficiently explored. Numbers of people in other countries would like to get access to the Irish market, comparatively small though it may be.  Others would like to use Ireland as a base from which to reach markets inside the sterling area. Others would like to diversify the risks of their investments in a period of international uncertainty.  Therefore, I think the Government should consider ways in which foreign investors could be encouraged to invest in production in Ireland.  The making of double taxation agreements with other countries is one way in which this could be done.  The amendment of the Control of Manufactures Act, which was advocated 15 years ago by the Banking Commission, should again be <Col N="1028" /> considered.  The possibility of Irish companies being quoted in the London Stock Exchange lists should also be investigated.  These are ways in which I think foreign capital could be induced or encouraged to come into this country.</P>
    <P>The final method of obtaining capital, the repatriation of external assets, is one which has been discussed in this House many times; but it is so current, so relevant, so topical and so misunderstood that I would like to say a few words about it once more.  I do not think it is sufficiently appreciated that the process of repatriation consists in inducing the owners of those assets to shift them into private domestic investment.</P>
    <P>The best way to induce people to shift their assets is by having low costs of production in Ireland, low taxation and a feeling of confidence in the future credit of the Irish nation and the Irish Government.  To the extent to which private investors fail to avail themselves of and respond to inducements of this kind, the Government and the public authorities should try and encourage people to shift their foreign investments into Irish loans.  One way of inducing them to do that is by offering high rates of interest&mdash;and when I say &ldquo;high&rdquo; I do not mean exorbitant rates.  But I think that if a slight increase in the rate of interest has the effect of attracting a considerable amount of Irish capital home, then that is a justification for it which ought not to be overlooked.</P>
    <P>Of course, as has been said over and over again, and as every member in this House will agree in principle, repatriation of that kind can only be justified when home investment is of a truly capital productive nature of the type which I tried to define.  When we come to judge the priorities of such investment, certain problems have to be faced which I think have not been fully dealt with in Ireland up to the present.  As regards private investment, the banks should be asked to exercise certain orders of priorities. The English banks, everybody knows, take their orders in this respect from the Central Bank.  There is one small amendment of Irish banking which I <Col N="1029" /> should like to see, that is, a classification of bank advances on the same lines as the English bank advances are classified.  We could then see whether private credit was being directed towards productive purposes and above all towards export productive purposes.</P>
    <P>When it comes to the allocation of priorities in regard to public investment, I refer again to the Banking Commission of 1938 which recommended the establishment of a national investment board.  One of the curious things about that Banking Commission Report was the selective manner in which its recommendations were adopted by the Government.  The recommendation for setting up the Central Bank was adopted, but there were other recommendations which were ignored.  The amendment of the Control of Manufactures Act, the cessation of the compulsory powers of land purchase and the establishment of an investment board&mdash;all these matters were recommended by the commission but were not adopted by the Government of the day, or by any Government since.</P>
    <P>I cannot sufficiently emphasise that the repatriation of external assets is never justified to maintain current consumption and is never justified to create employment simply for making work for work's sake.  Even for productive purposes, in the narrow and most correct definition, it is a process that must be undertaken with great caution and prudence.  The amount of our external investments tends to be exaggerated and they are usually stated gross and not net.  Their value has gone down, through no fault of our own, but owing to the rise in the sterling price level.  To the extent to which they are dissipated, they never can be replaced.  They are a sort of iron ration, an essential reserve to be kept for a contingency.  The income that is derived from investments abroad is bridging a smaller and smaller proportion of the adverse balance on visible account.  For all these reasons, the process of repatriation should be undertaken with great caution.</P>
    <P>The final matter I wish to refer to <Col N="1030" /> shortly is one which I have not dealt with before in the Seanad, but I think it is important and a matter which should be ventilated.  Whether our investment is based on new domestic savings, on foreign capital or on the repatriation of external investments, it all could be lubricated and facilitated if the Irish capital market could be improved.  The question of the Dublin capital market was investigated by the Banking Commission in 1938, but, in the past 15 years, many changes have taken place and I suggest to the Minister that the question might be reinvestigated to-day.  There are certain matters which could be investigated. One is a reform of the company laws. That, I understand, is already taking place.  Others are a reform in the requirements regarding information in published balance sheets and changes in the Trustee Acts.</P>
    <P>A more important suggestion is the foundation of some corporate institution which might act as a collector of small savings.  Saving in modern times, with high direct taxation, will have to take place more by the less rich than in the past, and it becomes a matter of importance, which is being discussed in other countries, to direct all these small rivulets into one stream. I suggest that in this country there might be room for something in the nature of an investment corporation, the capital of which could be found by the banks, the insurance companies, the building societies and other authorities handling large liquid funds.  A corporation of that kind could quite possibly be used as a source of loans for agriculture.  It could also act as a support for prices in the Dublin market. Some very well informed foreign investors have complained that the comparative illiquidity of the Dublin market makes them disinclined to deal there, because, in a falling market, there is no support.  A body of that kind might perform certain jobbing functions which might have the effect of supporting the market.  To that extent the liquidity of the Dublin market would be increased and it would become more attractive for savers at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>Finally&mdash;a more controversial and <Col N="1031" /> difficult technical question&mdash;a body of that kind might deal perhaps in short obligations of Governments, public authorities and private firms.  Something in the nature of a domestic money market could at least be investigated. An investigation of that kind might lead to positive practical results. But, even if it did not do so, it at least would answer a great deal of uninformed criticism of the Irish banking system, that it does not lend sufficiently at home, that it lends short money at low rates in London and that the Irish Government and Irish borrowers are not accommodated at the lowest possible rates in the Dublin market.</P>
    <P>Any inquiry of that kind, I suggest, however, should be made with the co-operation and goodwill of the existing financial institutions.  It would be better still if it could be made by the financial institutions themselves, of their own initiative; but if the Government decides that a public inquiry of that kind should be made, it is most important that it should be made with the co-operation and goodwill of the existing financial institutions.  The most important thing at the moment is to create a feeling of confidence regarding the future solvency and credit of the country, and any serious difference of opinion, or of outlook, between the Government and the banking system would not be conducive to that result.</P>
    <P>This confidence will not be engendered by mere financial gadgets.  It must rest on a sound financial policy. This brings me back to the point at which I began what I am afraid was a rather long speech, namely, that the public finances of this country have now reached a stage where they require the most thorough investigation. The financial superstructure has become too heavy for the productive base.  Public expenditure should, if possible, be pruned, with due regard for existing commitments and legitimate expectations.  New public expenditure should be avoided at all costs.</P>
    <P>If these observations sound pessimistic and alarming, I do not make any apology on that account.  I have said <Col N="1032" /> nothing that was not said 15 years ago in the Report of the Banking Commission. That report was criticised very adversely in many quarters and yet I think many people will agree to-day that some of its warnings have proved to be only too true.  Its insistence for financial prudence was derided as the utterance of timid, old-fashioned, foolish pessimists.  But even the utterances of quite foolish people sometimes have good results.  It must not be forgotten that the Roman Capitol was saved by the cackling of that most foolish of all birds&mdash;the goose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickSummerfield" hpid="Mr. Summerfield Mr. Summerfield">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that one of the most extraordinary features of modern life is the complacency with which the citizen takes these annual demands for money.  I am going to suggest that the Minister, in coming here to-day and presenting a bill, which, on the face of it, is for a staggering sum, is merely in the position of a shopkeeper from whom we have all ordered goods, and now we have to face up to the unpleasant task of paying for them.  Is it not an amazing thing that, even now, faced with a bill of the size shown in this Central Fund demand, we are envisaging new legislation which is going to add still further to those demands?  I think that, over a period of years, we could be accused of having a gradual weakening of our moral fibres.  We ought to be ashamed to look to the State to do things that years ago we were proud to do ourselves and at less cost.  What is the use in accusing the Government or anyone of the size of the bill when it is made up of the accumulated results of the demands made over a period of years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We ought to face up to the matter as realists and ask ourselves whether we should not, as a matter of extreme urgency, make a scientific investigation of the entire cost, not merely of the Civil Service, but of all Departments in which public moneys are spent.  We heard, in the course of the past few days, reasons for the indignation of the Civil Service whose request for additional salaries has not yet been acceded to.  I am in full sympathy with the civil servants, as I am with any <Col N="1033" /> other persons operating in the State, requesting a fair return for their services, but I am going to make what might be considered a rather sensational request.  It is that we should put all Government servants, whether civil servants or people employed in any Department, on working conditions comparable with those that characterise industry.  If the civil servants had a longer working week than they have, if they had fewer holidays, the State could save, and we could then pay to the essential civil servants a salary more commensurate with their cost of living.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien, as we have come to expect of him, gave us a very careful commentary on our general economic position.  He joined with others in urging that there should be a halt called at least to incurring fresh expenditure.  To-day, industry is in the doldrums, and I wonder why.  The figures of our trading indicate that our exports are at a height seldom, if ever, reached before.  That means money is coming into the country, but what is happening to it?  It certainly is not in circulation to the degree it should be, in proportion to its volume.  For some reason or another much money in this country is immobilised and is doing nobody any good.  Money to-day in many cases is not even put on deposit where the banks could use it in some way or another for the common good.  I know, and I have heard of many cases where money is put in the banks in sealed envelopes.  That does nobody any good.  That may be the 20th century version of the old stocking, but the effect is the same.</P>
    <P>The national economy is weakened by every £ or stiver that is put in an envelope and put out of circulation. Mention, among other things, was made by Senator O'Brien of the necessity for the amendment of the Control of Manufactures Act.  I have to regard that with somewhat cynical amusement. The Control of Manufactures Act has been blown sky-high over a period of time in the light of experience by our legal friends in this State who know all the loopholes through which anyone seriously wishing to come into this State to create an <Col N="1034" /> industry can get in.  The Control of Manufactures Act is no deterrent to the man or firm genuinely anxious to come into the State and bring his industry with him.  There are deterrents not merely to the people outside but to those inside and the biggest deterrent is, of course, that we have got to pay 6 per cent. for the use of money.  Within the past weeks we have seen the accounts of companies operating on very heavy capital and after a year of trading all the board of directors could do was to ensure to the shareholders a return of 6 per cent. in respect of the industry, 6 per cent. return on a speculative industry at a time when that same industry has to pay the bank 6 per cent. for the use of money.  That does not offer any great inducement to speculate in the country.</P>
    <P>We are to-day confronted with a bill &mdash;in this connection I will use another phrase and chance the consequences&mdash; the size of which is largely due, amongst other things, to our own stupidity because if we put somebody else out to do a job which is within our own competence, we shall have to pay for the services of that person.  In this case, that person is the State.  Every new thing we demand from the State means a new State Department with all its attendant personnel.  We have got so many of these activities in our economic life that the deadweight cost of maintaining them is something we want to get rid of.  I want to see a halt called to the creation of new Departments.  We can at least do that. As I said before, there should be an overhaul of the whole system of State expenditure, no matter how it is done, to ensure that those engaged as servants should be adequately paid but if they are, they should at least work reasonable hours and with reasonable holidays and on conditions comparable with those obtaining in industry to which the State has to look for so much of its revenue.  I commiserate with the Minister in having to come before us to seek approval for this Central Fund Bill, the staggering demands of which could have been lessened had we the sense to shoulder our own obligations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamFearon" hpid="Professor Fearon Professor Fearon">
      <NameTxt>Professor Fearon</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the level of taxation has reached such an <Col N="1035" /> intensity now that apart from being what it was at one time, an incident in our life, it has become a determining and controlling factor.  From the moment we wake up, we are continually being reminded that we are faced with an economic upheaval which is getting steeper and steeper as we proceed to climb.  For that reason I should like to develop two of the points made by previous speakers.</P>
      <P>The position would not be so bad if we could feel that instead of being in a pit we were in a tunnel and that we were going to see some light when we emerged at the other end.  If we had any form of assurance from the economists that the hardship is not entirely unavailing, it would enable us to endure it, not with any pleasure perhaps, but with composure.  For we are a country with a great tradition of suffering and endurance and we can endure, if we feel that either we, or those who come after us, are coming to a better time.</P>
      <P>With regard to the position of the capital account, I feel, in the absence of the Budget, that it is easy to get an air of unreality about the debate, since it is a question of expenditure without the equivalent taxation.  One or two things, however, might possibly be developed by the Minister in his reply.  Could we have a slightly clearer approximation of the difference between capital and current expenditure? In general, the trend of current expenditure is that it is partly of a non-reversible type.  When speaking some time ago in connection with social services, I said that the trouble is that it is a one-way street, that when something of that nature is done, it cannot be undone and must be permanently maintained and preserved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second and even more serious consequence very often is that it inevitably begets increasing subsequent maintenance expenditure.  I feel it is a terrible thing that our Hospitals' Trust Fund is exhausted three weeks or a month after each Sweep and that that very powerful and effective enterprise requires State support for the <Col N="1036" /> reason that the hospital scheme has overreached itself in its building programme.</P>
    <P>The fact that we are letting ourselves in for increased current expenditure and not just capital output is particularly alarming.  I think propaganda is the best medicine&mdash;it is at any rate the best preventative&mdash;and an immense amount of good work could be done in that way.  However, that will be discussed later during the debate on another Bill.</P>
    <P>Regarding the question of civil servants, I wonder if it could not be better adjusted in some way, because it has been my experience that the staffs of some Departments, with which I and other Senators have had some dealings, are very much overworked and obviously do their best with considerable difficulties.  Yet other Departments seem to have quite an easy time and they are obviously not worked so hard.  Could there possibly be a more uniform intensity of work?</P>
    <P>What is our proper ration of civil servants?  We know our size as a Republic and we should be able to determine how many are required per hundred of the citizens.  We know that one doctor is needed for 800 people. What is the proportion for civil servants? Is there a ceiling to the size of the service or will we all end up as civil servants in a paternal State?</P>
    <P>Many years ago I urged the initiation of a savings campaign and after a suitable interim of delay, a half-hearted campaign was instituted.  It approached it in a wrong spirit, however, and treated it rather as a joke.  Jokes and comic cartoons are not likely to encourage savings any more than ringing up your bank manager in a cinema or club is likely to get you a loan. Indeed, savings have become something simply for the old folk to talk about. It is a lamentable fact that many of our younger friends and acquaintances seem to regard savings as something grotesque.  If you ask them about it, they will reply: &ldquo;I never save, I even have to borrow to live up to my income&rdquo;.  That is the type of retort you are likely to get.</P>
    <P>Another question is that even if I am <Col N="1037" /> willing to save how am I going to go about it?  If I am in business, the only time I can get out is in the luncheon interval and if I go around at that time I will probably find it shut. The only way to increase savings is by something much more than the present drive and by ceasing to treat it as a half-hearted joke.  Until we get back to some satisfactory method of savings &mdash;not just by the wealthy person but by the humble or by those who, like Mr. Micawber, will at least be sixpence right at the end of the year&mdash;we shall not be encouraging thrift which is a plant that does not grow freely on our own soil.</P>
    <P>Those are the two points I particularly wanted to make.  Can we emphasise more strongly the difference between capital expenditure and current expenditure and realise that we are committing ourselves to a certain course of action which will have to be recognised by successive Governments? The second point is Government expenditure and organisation and the third is the question of a proper drive for thrift and savings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcGee" hpid="Mr. McGee Mr. McGee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGee</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with very great interest to most of the speakers this afternoon and I do not propose to enter into something that, perhaps, I am not conversant with in everyday life.  Recently, public bodies in the country have found the same difficulty of increased expenditure on their institutions and particularly on their roads.  We have, I think, a duty to register a complaint that while there is a very great rural prosperity apparent everywhere, the expenses each year seem to be overtaking the people's savings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a magnificent sight to see the number of motor-cars around the churches throughout the country, and I think it means a possibility of a very happy future for rural residents.  I would venture to suggest to the Minister, however, to try and balance the Road Fund so that it may serve the most distant parts of the rural community. Just now, in the three or four counties through which I pass regularly, one must be struck with the very great improvements, all stressing <Col N="1038" /> the desire for greater speed.  Outside Dundalk, which the Minister knows so well, a very narrow part of the road has been widened at a cost of hundreds of thousands of pounds.  In the locality of Drogheda&mdash;which I think did not call for so much&mdash;the same thing has happened: thousands of pounds have been spent.  Similar work is going on around Balbriggan, and this morning I saw 40 men at work between Navan and Swords.  Everywhere they are widening the roads and making them faster.</P>
    <P>That is an excellent thing to do, but I beseech the Minister not to forget that there are road taxes being paid by people to whom a steam-roller never went nearer than four or five miles.  Those are the people who are sticking to the remote homes and who are contributing much to stop the flight from the land.</P>
    <P>I am sure all of us notice at times, when we pass along the main roads, and come to a crossroads and look up, the dozens of potholes which are on these minor roads.  There is a great necessity for motor cars in these areas far more than in cities and in towns, but none of the people living in the remote rural areas can afford motor cars.  I think a great deal of this neglect of the minor roads is due to the fact that county managers and county engineers require to have such excellent training that they come into the cities to the universities and they are inclined to take back to the rural areas that university outlook and a desire to get as close as possible to the biggest towns in the rural parts. If you ask the engineer or the county manager why so much was being spent on the main roads and so little on the other roads, they will tell you quite rightly that most of the tax comes from the motorists in the towns.  That is quite true because there is so much poverty that all the citizens in the rural community cannot afford the luxury of motor cars.  It would be very desirable if some system could be devised that would reduce taxation in this Department of State or if it could be arranged that a great percentage of the Road Taxation Fund could find its <Col N="1039" /> way back into the purely rural roads.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to Senator Professor O'Brien telling us that the State and banking institutions should pull together for the credit of the country.  The greatest asset the country has is its land and that asset is not receiving and has never received from the Irish Government the consideration that it should obviously have received.  To begin with, the possession of land is an old institution and it had its basis in the British days here.  Of course, the State does protect as far as it can the owner of the land.  The Land Act of 1903 provided that if land was acquired the owner should be able to get the same income from the compensation paid to him as he would if he had retained ownership of the land.</P>
    <P>I see no reason why any landholder should object if his holding, whether it be 500 acres or ten acres, is acquired by the State so long as he gets the same income out of the moneys given to him as he would have got had he been left in ownership of the land.  We have, however, legislation passed over the last 20 or 30 years providing that the land shall make what it is worth. In other words, the price to be given for land acquired compulsorily or by negotiation, was at the rate of what it is worth in the future.</P>
    <P>I hold that the State should be satisfied with the provisions under the Act of 1903 where a fair price should be paid to the owner of the land so that he should be able to get the same income from it as if he had been working it and had not been prevented through illness or otherwise from doing so.  If you want to make the most of the land, you will regard its credit as No. 1. Money invested in Irish land by Irish citizens should be regarded in a higher light than money deposited and left lying in the banks.  You would not require to have grazing schemes and other land schemes operated by the State if sufficient credit were placed in the hands of the owners of the land. It is lack of that credit which is preventing them from developing and making the most of their lands.</P>
    <P>In this House in the last 20 years, <Col N="1040" /> Senator Counihan introduced an Act to provide that the market value should be paid by the Land Commission for any land which they acquired.  We find that the market value is not being paid to-day.  When you go to Merrion Street as I have often to do, you find it is a very poor show.  It is certainly not very encouraging to go there and it is very poor as compared to the proper development which should be found in any other business.  There are a lot of delays of one type or another and there seems to be quite a stopper on all branches of the work.  There is no reason for that stopper in land development if sufficient guarantee is given by the State as to the credit of the land.</P>
    <P>The tribunal in fixing the value of lands does not seem to have any regard whatever for the value of the land bonds which are there as being equivalent in value.  Certainly that is most unfair to the owner.  Even when the bonds are allocated they extend in value when passed through stockbrokers and others.  These lettings are continued for a number of years but the lettings are held by the Land Commission and they never find their way back, as they ought to, immediately to the owner of the land.</P>
    <P>This practice is contrary to the spirit and letter of the Land Acts and very often the tenants having such lettings are small farmers and landless men who believe that by taking the land they stand in a favourable position for future allocation.  That promotes a certain unhappiness and puts people like myself in a very awkward position. I know of a holding in Joristown which the owner purchased in a public auction for £14,000 in 1949.  This was acquired by the Land Commission in 1952 and the price given by the Land Court here, despite all protests, was £14,000 in bonds three years afterwards, although the value of land had gone up in the three intervening years, and the value of land bonds had gone down.  The result was that a holding which had cost £14,000 in 1949 yielded to the owner something like £10,000 or £10,250.</P>
    <P>The financing of land is an important subject which the Department of <Col N="1041" /> Finance ought to consider as a basic problem in the State.  It helps everybody and while private ownership will always exist here it may well be that State ownership may find a certain amount of sympathy from those of us who at times think that it is necessary. Perhaps neglect of this problem is due to the fact that there are no efficient farmers' organisations or perhaps nobody gives a thought to those people whose holdings are down and out, but good use could be made of these holdings and greater encouragement would be given to the ideas of progressive farmers, if the matter is held on an even keel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRuane" hpid="Mr. S.T. Ruane Mr. S.T. Ruane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to confine my remarks to a subject raised by Senator McGee in the opening part of his speech on this Bill.  There is no use stressing the question of over-taxation in this country: the Taoiseach has himself stated that the country is staggering from taxation.  I would like to say, as many members of this House know, that the ratepayers in the several counties of this State are staggering and tottering under the burden of local rates and that is mainly due to certain innovations in local administration introduced over a period of years.  First of all, you have the extension of the local government vote to non-ratepayers where those people&mdash;and they are in the majority here&mdash;who are never worried about the payment of rates have just as much power in the selection of local bodies as the people who have to foot the bill.  Subsequently, you had the abolition of what is known as the district charge and the introduction of the managerial system.</P>
      <P>All these innovations were designed, we were told, for the purpose of bringing about higher efficiency and greater economy.  The efficiency, I hold, is being maintained but it is in no way higher than when the administration of the different bodies was under the direct control of the councillors elected. As far as the economy is concerned, it is a word which has now no meaning as far as local administration is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McGee referred in the opening part of his remarks to the question <Col N="1042" /> of road administration, and while I may not approach that matter from the same viewpoint as the Senator, I am very interested in trying to impress on the Department of Local Government the necessity for a change which, if brought about, would contribute greatly towards the reduction of the demands made on local bodies periodically. Every year towards the close of the financial year substantial grants in aid of road making are indicated for the different counties of the State. We are all glad to see these grants given to the respective counties, but there are strings attached and the extra work which these are intended to bring in making, tarring and spraying the roads, constitutes a charge on the local rates, which are subsequently levied for maintenance.  This year in County Mayo the extra charge for main road and county road maintenance was almost £60,000.</P>
    <P>I hold in common with several local representatives that as these grants are paid out of the fund built up by motor taxation and as the work carried out as a result of these grants is mainly in the interests of motorists, the maintenance costs should be continued year after year out of the same road fund.  I contend that any people who happen to travel through the country from time to time and who see the difficulties that the farming community undergo in trying to bring their horses and produce over steam-rolled roads, have no reason to be enthusiastic about the grants made each year for road improvement.</P>
    <P>There is another matter connected with local administration, namely the abolition of the district charge.  The entire county in every case has now to accept responsibility for any sanitary improvements, improved water works, and sewerage carried on in different parts of the county.  There is competition in several counties in these matters and the result is that you have schemes, as Senator Hayes pointed out, on another occasion, as streamlined schemes put forward by architects which are no doubt splendidly drafted but are too expensive for the people who have to pay for them.  Very recently, in one village with 170 inhabitants, an architect put up a scheme for waterworks which, if carried out, <Col N="1043" /> would cost over £10,000,000 and in that scheme he had a written provision for 34 fire hydrants.</P>
    <P>Now, I have no objection in the world and no member of a public body would have an objection to different districts getting the benefits of these schemes, if they could afford them.  We see no reason to object to their making applications to be considered the same as other areas because we are all contributing towards it.  The time has come when a halt must be called and when something should be done to bring expenditure in these matters within the means of the people who have to pay for them.</P>
    <P>Architects are paid on the basis of the estimated cost of the scheme and there is the temptation to have expensive schemes formulated as a result. People will answer that we do not pay directly for these, that we work on loans, but the loans must be met, and commitments for loans to repay interest and sinking fund in the different counties at the present time are very big.  The tendency is for them to increase further.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in so far as local administration is concerned, in which the Local Government Department could introduce changes that would help to bring down the costs that ratepayers have to meet every year and that certainly would mark a turning-point in the increasing rates that have gone on for a very considerable time.  If a local body at the present time feels the necessity for extending the accommodation in an institution, the Government always provides a grant, but the provision of that grant is contingent on the matter being submitted to an architect.</P>
    <P>Some time ago in County Mayo we found it necessary to ask for a grant to provide accommodation for 34 nurses who had to sleep in outside apartments. We were told a scheme would have to be submitted, with plan and specification by a competent architect, and that only when that was done could a grant be indicated.  The services of an architect not resident in the county were requisitioned, and his scheme contained an estimate for the <Col N="1044" /> building or the extension of the building that was designed to provide sleeping accommodation for 34 nurses which would cost £34,000.  Needless to say, that improvement has not been gone on with.</P>
    <P>I hold that in every county you have an engineering staff who are quite competent to carry on work of that particular kind.  Why are they not competent to come to the assistance of the body that employs them for consultation when they think that an extension or improvement is necessary? They are capable of designing water and sewerage schemes that come within the means of the people who must pay for them.  By having to go outside and accepting the rule that the local engineering staff have not the technical qualifications to look after such schemes, the costs of them on the rates in every county have soared and will go on soaring until the system is changed.</P>
    <P>In so far as the employment of architects and consultants is concerned, we have some rather unpleasant experiences in many counties.  An institution was built some years ago&mdash;a hospital &mdash;and I am informed that the architect's fees for the institution totalled over £4,000; and when everything was ready to have it formally opened it was found out that there were no bells in the different wards, not withstanding the periodical supervision of the architect and the employment of a clerk of works responsible to him.  Also within a period of half a dozen years the entire hospital had to be rewired because the original wiring was laid too near the central heating system.  Now these are matters that should be attended to and unless the Local Government Department comes to the assistance of the local authorities in giving effect to these necessary changes I see no possibility of rates being reduced.</P>
    <P>This year, in County Mayo, the members of the council had to meet on three occasions, and from the amount of correspondence covering the estimates put before them from the manager and the county survey staff the council members would need the training of an accountant to get down <Col N="1045" /> to all those statements and to discuss them sensibly.  Something must be done in the matter of local administration to bring about the change in the supervision that can be brought about without in any way interfering with the efficiency of the service, and until that is done, as I stated earlier, I see no possibility of a change coming in the rates.  There is every possibility of the rates reaching a point where the people will not be able to pay them.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter I would like to refer to before I sit down.  It has to do with a reply given earlier in the debate by Senator Hawkins to remarks made by Senator Hayes. Senator Hawkins referred to the fact that those Independents who were responsible for bringing about the downfall of the inter-Party Government were re-elected.  That is quite so.  They were re-elected at the subsequent general election; but I believe that the subsequent support they gave to the Government was directly influenced as a result of the publication of 17 points by the Fianna Fáil Party as to what their programme would be if returned as a Government.  Among those points were the maintenance of the food subsidies and a promise that the penal taxes would not be reimposed on liquor and tobacco.  We all know, of course, that those promises were not implemented.  I hold that if that assurance was not given those Independents certainly would not have supported the change.  That is all I have to say on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to comment, first, on the Estimates for Science and Art on page 218.  They are Estimates under the Office of the Minister for Education.  First I have a general criticism to make.  It is about the condition of our National Museum. It is a grave criticism.  It has been phrased to me by a person well able to judge in the following terms&mdash;that of all our national institutions, the one, and perhaps the only one, which shows definite deterioration since the Treaty is our National Museum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the exception of the section devoted to Irish archaeology, which has been developed very efficiently in <Col N="1046" /> the last 20 years or so, the other sections have deteriorated deplorably, especially those dedicated to general art and to the sciences.  This seems to me particularly regrettable because a small country like ours can excel in its museums.  There are other forms of national development which we simply cannot afford.  But a country even as small as Denmark can produce superb museums.  I would like to emphasise this deterioration.  I have the assurance of my own eyes when I go to visit the natural history section of the museum in Merrion Square, and I have consulted various experts.  The fact is that in Merrion Square, in the natural history section of the museum, there is a most valuable and interesting collection of mammals, birds, fishes, insects and so on from Ireland and abroad.</P>
    <P>That collection should serve two main purposes.  First, it should interest and instruct school children and the general public.  Here the most important matters are the condition of the specimens and the method of display. Both of these are deplorably bad, judged by modern standards.  The condition of the specimens is going from bad to worse, and the display is antiquated and generally unsatisfactory. The second function it should serve is this: it should be an invaluable source of help to research students.  I am assured on the highest authority that this function is steadily deteriorating, too, and that research students in natural science are not getting the help they need from that department.</P>
    <P>Good museums, as I have said, are within the scope of small and not very wealthy countries.  Why is ours not a good museum, judged by the standards of Denmark, Holland or other countries of that size?  It is not simply a matter of education, though, needless to say, I value that highly; it is a matter of national prestige.  One of the first places visitors to this country go to is the museum.  They judge the scientific and artistic merit of the country by what they see in the museums.  Inferior museums are thoroughly bad for the country's good name abroad and, to revert to what I said before, inferior museums are bad for the education and <Col N="1047" /> for the good taste of our own citizens.</P>
    <P>Who is to blame for this?  I do not believe that any competent judge can challenge the facts as I present them. First, I notice that the office of administrator is vacant.  If one turns to page 220 of the Book of Estimates, one finds that there is no administrator there.  Again, if one compares the staff of the museums with the staff of the National Library, one finds that they have just half, 21 in the museums and 40 in the National Library.  I should like to say, incidentally, that the National Library, in contrast, is an example of a magnificently run national institution.  It is imaginative, up-to-date, progressive and efficient, and in fact is an excellent example of what we could do if the museums were properly run.</P>
    <P>What is the cause of the museum's deterioration in standards?  First, I suggest the absence of an administrator and secondly, the numerical inadequacy of the staff.  I cannot see why 21 people should be expected to run the two big buildings devoted to the museum while 40 people are provided to run the National Library.  I fear, too, that the museum has been neglected by the Department to a certain extent.  I have been told that the visitors recently threatened to resign <i>en bloc</i> and were only prevented from doing so by the suggestion that the Arts Council would do something for the museums. So far as I know, the Arts Council has not yet done anything for the museum. I hope they will, but I chiefly hope that the Minister for Education will consider setting this matter right in our country, because I think it is doing harm both to our prestige and to our education.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the Arts Council which I have just mentioned.  I find that they have not yet issued a report.  They probably have not had time.  They have justified themselves to a certain degree by the exhibition of contemporary Irish paintings in the United States recently.  I should like to make a suggestion here.  Many of us will have seen in the English newspapers, reports of the magnificent Mexican art exhibition in London recently.  This exhibition has done an enormous <Col N="1048" /> amount to bring the culture and art of Mexico home to the minds of the ordinary man in the street in London and England.  I think our Arts Council should organise a similar exhibition on the same scale&mdash;not simply an exhibition of contemporary art, but an exhibition of art going back to the earliest times, a genuinely representative exhibition.  It would do a great deal for the country's good name.  We could bring some of our treasures out of the cupboards of the National Museum and display them, not merely to London but to the capital cities of Europe.</P>
    <P>This Mexican art exhibition has, I understand, been a tremendous success, financially as well as culturally, and I hope that our Arts Council will be able to venture on something similar. We have superb national treasures of art and we have not displayed them. Most people know something of the Book of Kells, the Ardagh Chalice and the Tara Brooch but, beyond these, what do they know?  Very little, I think.  It should be the first duty of the Arts Council to organise something approaching that Mexican art exhibition.</P>
    <P>There is one specific point in connection with the organisation of the National Museum and with the development of art in general in Ireland which I should now like to mention.  We saw in the papers yesterday that the Pieta statue was being moved from the museum in Kildare Street to a new site in Marlborough Street.  Professor Bodkin in his report on the arts in Ireland dated 30th September, 1949, commented on the siting of that statue in the National Museum in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A more inappropriate site for such a monument could scarcely be conceived.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is now being moved to Marlborough Street and I have been told&mdash;I have formed no personal judgement in the matter&mdash;that it also is an extremely inappropriate site.  I will leave it for others to judge whether that is a justifiable criticism or not, but it certainly is a questionable site.  I mention that simply as a proof of the lack of firm direction in the museum.  First, that <Col N="1049" /> statue is put in a bad site there, and now it is being moved to another site which is certainly open to question.</P>
    <P>I turn now to a completely different matter, the Irish News Agency, for which the Estimate is on page 351.  I should like to say that the Irish News Agency, in my opinion, has been doing excellent work.  Its news-sheet is admirably written and most elegantly illustrated.  As a professor, I would give it full marks as a news-sheet, but &mdash;and here is what I do not like&mdash; when the previous Minister for External Affairs, Deputy MacBride, presented the Irish News Agency Bill to the Seanad on 30th November, 1949, as reported in the Official Debates, column 182, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the second place, the news agency is not intended to enter the field of what I described in the Dáil as hot news competition.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was very clear.  Some of us in the Seanad were still perturbed and pressed the Minister on the point and he gave us a satisfactory description of the kind of news he meant&mdash;largely cultural, scientific and so on, but definitely not hot news.  It was on that understanding that I personally supported the Bill.  But now we find that the news agency definitely is handling hot news and sometimes red-hot news, as, for example, the picture of the Derry celebrations on St. Patrick's Day of last year&mdash;so hot that, frankly, I think they might have let it drop altogether.  I do not think it redounded to the credit of the country, North or South, in the end that one section of our people should circulate such a picture of another section of our people.  In my opinion, it did not redound to the good name of the country, but that is by the way.  The point is, it was hot news.</P>
    <P>They are also circulating other hot news.  In fact, I think they have a slightly guilty conscience on this.  I turn to their report for the year 1951-52 and I find on page 11 the following remark:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The allegation has been repeated that the supplying by the agency to its clients of a full and competitive news service constitutes a breach of <Col N="1050" /> faith by the board with the Dáil. This is not the appropriate place for a full discussion on these charges...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think it is a legitimate charge.  I think it is a true charge.  I think it is a breach of faith with what the Minister said.  I think it is unjust to other working journalists in Dublin that they should have to compete with State supported journalists.</P>
    <P>I notice from the Estimates, page 351, that a policy of retrenchment is intended here.  It has had the result, as we see from the newspapers, that some of the members of the staff have resigned.  I would like that retrenchment to include an implementation of the previous Minister's pledge that the agency should not handle hot news.</P>
    <P>I spoke to a member of the staff of the agency about this.  He argued with me that to speak of a news agency which did not handle fresh news was more or less a contradiction in terms. I can see that point of view.  It is almost an irresistible temptation.  But the fact remains that the Minister gave a pledge in this House, and some of us voted on that pledge, that they would not handle hot news, but they have done so.  I hope something will be done about that.</P>
    <P>There is one other point to which I want to refer.  I rejoice to see an increase in the Estimates in respect of the Department of External Affairs, in connection with the embassies abroad.  In the last couple of years I have had the privilege of meeting some members of the diplomatic corps abroad and some of the headquarters staff at home.  I can only say that I was immensely impressed.  They seem to me to have all the necessary diplomatic qualities, ranging from sheer patience to outstanding intellectual and social talents.  That is rather remarkable, I think, because an External Affairs Ministry is probably the hardest to build up in a recently independent State and 30 years is not a great deal of time to do it in.  I would like to record my own impression that we have a magnificent diplomatic service and that it deserves generous spending.  I am astonished to find that we can run an embassy in Madrid for £6,000.  I would urge <Col N="1051" /> the Minister that on this Department a policy of generous spending would be justifiable and would bring good report to our country.</P>

      <P>In the only speech which we heard from the Government Front Bench, Senator Hawkins, in his usual inimitable way, gave us a long rambling account of the many disasters which happened to this country prior and up to the re-election of the Fianna Fáil Government some two years ago. He rambled from the civil war to the economic war.  From that he went on to the attempt of his own Party to deny the right of free speech to the Fine Gael Party.  He then proceeded to deal with perhaps the greatest disaster of all&mdash;the arrival of the five Independents on the political scene.  I do not intend to go over all that.  If that is the only justification for the Minister's and the Government's policy it is, perhaps, just as well that the Fianna Fáil Party are significantly silent this afternoon.</P>

      <P>Since the advent of this Government it is common knowledge that every section of the community suffered increased hardships. They can only look forward to further increased hardships, in view of the Minister's coming Budget.  These hardships are largely unnecessary and are entirely the result of Fianna Fáil policy.  There has been an increase in unemployment, a rise in emigration, a rise in the cost of living and an increased rate of interest charges.  All this has been the result of Government policy.  Some of these, such as the increase in interest charges, were, indeed, deliberate acts of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's aim appears to have been to decrease consumption by raising taxation and increasing prices. <Col N="1052" /> They have succeeded completely in this aim but, in succeeding, they have caused a recession in trade, an increase in unemployment and an alarming increase in the numbers emigrating. During a debate in one of the Houses of the Oireachtas the figures in regard to emigration were questioned.  I do not intend to produce any proofs here of it beyond a quotation from the <i>Clare Champion</i>, dated 6th September, 1952.  A delegate at the Fianna Fáil convention in Ennis stated that people were emigrating by boatloads because they could not find employment at home.  I am sure that this delegate, like all Fianna Fáil delegates, was a well-informed individual.</P>
    <P>This week a savings campaign was initiated by the Government.  I doubt very much&mdash;anybody who attempts to understand Government policy must also doubt&mdash;whether this campaign will succeed, since the Government's policy seems to be designed specifically to prevent people saving at all costs. Since Fianna Fáil's advent to power they have succeeded in reducing the people's income by increasing taxation, thereby decreasing their spending power.  If the people's spending power is decreased it must stand to reason that the earnings of workers which depend on the amount of money spent by the general population will be reduced.  If the earnings of the average worker are reduced I certainly fail to see how he can save.  If high taxation, which bears on shopkeepers, workers, producers, farmers and all sections of the community, is any help to increase savings, it seems to me to be a completely new theory.</P>

I have to apologise for not giving the Seanad more time, but I had thought that it might be incorporated in the Confirmation Bill.  For technical reasons, however, that was not found possible.  If there had been an objection to the confirming Order there might have been a delay which would have given plenty of time, but as there was no objection this extension takes effect on the 1st April.  For that reason I have to ask that the Bill shall pass all stages to-day.  The Bill is simply to confirm the existing sheriff and coroner in the areas they have at present until they resign or die.

      <P>Before the Adjournment I was referring to the Government's saving campaign and I propose to limit myself on that subject to putting two questions to the Minister. If the State taxes the people to a higher degree, how can the people possibly save, and if they are further taxed in higher prices for food and essential commodities, how can they save?  At the moment we have approximately 90,000 unemployed in this country according to the recent figures issued by the Statistics Office.  Yet at this particular time we find that the Government appears to be concerned in providing money, not for the relief of unemployment but for the purpose of buying horses and obsolete aeroplanes. It is amazing how any Government can justify the purchase of horses and aeroplanes and still be unable to provide money for human beings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment in my own town of Ennis there are queues for the labour exchange.  We find that there are more unemployed there than ever before.  It is true that a little employment is being given outside the town by one Department of State&mdash;the Department of Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;at what has been described as starvation wages. They are offering married men with families who are paying high rates for council houses the noble sum of <Col N="1055" /> £4 2s. 6d. a week.  Yet at a time when we have people unemployed in Ennis and elsewhere we find the Government embarking on a policy for the purchase of horses at fabulous prices, one of which cost around £250,000, and to purchase obsolete aeroplanes in the region of thousands and probably millions of pounds.</P>
    <P>A short time ago we passed through this House a Bill called &ldquo;The Undeveloped Areas Bill.&rdquo;  This Bill was supposed to benefit the West of Ireland to a considerable extent.  We in Clare looked forward to our share of the benefit from that Bill.  We were glad to read shortly after the passage of the Bill through this House that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government was to visit Clare with a view to seeing what could be done for the people of Clare under that Bill.  He came down to a meeting of the Clare County Council and all the public representatives who are not members of the council were invited to attend. I was included in that category.  We were informed at the meeting that Mr. Lynch, the Parliamentary Secretary, was there to see what could be done and we were prepared to help him in any way we could to do something for the people of Clare.  We were amazed to find that Mr. Lynch had nothing to say to the people.  He preferred, first of all, to hear the views of the council on the problems confronting the people, and, having heard the council, he proceeded to repeat that he had nothing to say and no solution to the problems of the people of the county.  He told the meeting that he would return to Dublin and would go into the matters in his Department.  He also promised that he would return particularly to West Clare to examine further the problem.  To our further amazement we have not heard since from the Parliamentary Secretary about his original visit to Ennis or as to his second promised visit to West Clare.  The people of West Clare in particular are beginning to wonder what has become of the marvellous plans instituted by the Government to settle all the problems of the undeveloped areas.</P>
    <P>So far as we are concerned, these <Col N="1056" /> problems remain unsolved and untouched. I cannot help contrasting that treatment by this Government with the treatment shown to Clare by the inter-Party Government.  The people of West Clare had a problem which had been in existence for years under the previous Fianna Fáil Government. They appealed to the inter-Party Government for help in dealing with that problem of the incidence of parasitic disease in West Clare peninsula. Within six months of that appeal having been made to the inter-Party Government, that problem, which in a number of years had resulted in the deaths of thousands of cattle, had been completely wiped out.  I cannot help contrasting that type of effort for the undeveloped areas with the efforts of the present Government which alleges that they are spending more money in schemes for the development and betterment of the undeveloped areas.</P>
    <P>In referring to the action of the inter-Party Government at that time, I feel I should mention the then Minister for Agriculture Deputy James Dillon and his efforts to help the people of the County of Clare.  Many hundreds of acres have been reclaimed under the land project in Clare and many hundreds more remain to be reclaimed.  We find that the Government at the moment are considering the sale, and I understand have in fact put up for sale, a considerable quantity of heavy machinery which had been put into Clare under that land project.  I understand that they are going to sell one tractor, one drainage plough, one excavator, a big wheel tractor, a tiller and rotovator, all machinery which would help the people of Clare and which we were glad to see being brought into the county.  It is now being removed by Government policy and we are told by the Minister for Agriculture that such a step will help to reclaim the land faster and quicker.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;We have, in fact, a meat producing industry canning meat and for the export of carcase meat.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is interesting to relate that remark to an answer given to-day to Parliamentary Question No. 43 in the Dáil by the Minister for Agriculture.  His reply was as follows:&mdash;</P>

      <P>and 1948&mdash;the first year of inter-Party Government administration&mdash;97, and in each succeeding year up to date, none.</P>
      <P>I wonder if Deputy Briscoe or any spokesman of the present Government, would be able to say that we would have had a big meat-producing industry, canning meat and exporting carcase meat, had it not been for the action of the inter-Party Government in 1948 in stopping the slaughter of calves.  It would be very interesting to know what the position would be in that industry to-day but for the action of the Government of that time.</P>
      <P>Many Senators referred to the position of local rates and one Senator, I think it was Senator Fearon, to the position existing at the moment due to the exhaustion of the Hospitals' Fund. I would like before I conclude to make a few remarks about that position. Two years ago I spent a few months in hospital, in a new hospital built ten years ago with the help of the Hospitals' Fund.  I discovered to my amazement that in a hospital barely occupied for ten years the authorities at the time of my admission were building a new stack to the boiler room and were also commencing to rewire the complete hospital.  They were also building a new chapel, having torn down the one built ten years before, and had repaired practically every floor in the hospital, and in addition, had installed a new heating system for the nurses' home</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1058" /> I was told at the time by an official in the hospital that according to his estimate it would have been cheaper to have torn down the hospital two years before and rebuilt it.  That hospital had cost £80,000 and it had been built when the Fianna Fáil Government was in power.  I am sure these conditions could not have existed anywhere else and, if that is a sample of local administration and a sample of how the Fianna Fáil Government built their hospitals, it is no wonder that the Hospitals' Fund is now exhausted.  I am quite sure that the people responsible for hospitalisation must look at the future in despair, in view of the fact that no further fund appears to exist under the Hospitals' Sweepstakes for the building of new hospitals.</P>
    <P>I will conclude my remarks by saying that if the Fianna Fáil Party can justify its existence as a Government on the figures which the Minister for Finance has presented to this House, they can justify anything.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is necessary to say after some of the weary speeches we have heard that there is at least one bright spot in the country&mdash;we have largely increased the amount of tillage being carried out and that increased tillage is mainly in connection with beet and wheat growing.  Coming from the heart of the country, I know that that is so because everywhere one looks one can see fields under tillage, fields never before tilled.  We have also figures from the Sugar Company about the increased acreage of beet which they have contracted for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Judging by the figures, I think we should be heading for an increase of 20 to 25 per cent. in the sugar production for the current year.  If we in this country would grow all the beet and wheat we require, we would save moneys, amounting I think, to roughly £9,000,000 on wheat and in the neighbourhood of £5,000,000 on beet.  If we could grow all the wheat and beet required&mdash;and there is no question that it cannot be done&mdash;it would help the Central Fund considerably and create a good deal of employment, a matter <Col N="1059" /> which so many people are complaining of outside and in this House as well. I ought to say to the Opposition that we have in this House and elsewhere a number of people who are anti-wheat and anti-beet campaigners and that is a great pity.  The Opposition should give a lead to the country and ought to suggest to their followers that the growing of beet and wheat is valuable work and of the greatest importance to the nation.  If we put our shoulders to the wheel there is no reason why we would not save £14,000,000 for ourselves and the nation and give a good deal of increased employment into the bargain.  I appeal to the other side of the House to do their bit in connection with these two items at least.</P>
    <P>Senator McGee referred to motor-cars being plentiful outside our churches&mdash;motor-cars which were being mainly used by the people of rural Ireland.  All the cars one sees at the churches do not belong to farmers, and if one visits, for example, a beet factory during the campaign season one will see a long line of motor-cars outside belonging to the unskilled workers and tradesmen of all kinds who have to travel long distances and use motor-cars on that account.  I have information that many of the cars possessed by farmers are being bought on hire-purchase at a rate of interest which is about 9 per cent. per annum.  That is a bad position and if the farmers could get more credit at an easier rate of interest it would help them considerably in manuring their lands and stocking their lands.  I have no doubt that the country is badly in need of increased liming and increased artificial manuring and credit is necessary to do this.</P>
    <P>The Irish Sugar Company have a good credit scheme whereby they allow a farmer about £20 per acre with which he can buy manures not only for beet but for some of his other crops as well.  I think if that is being extended and taken up by the people interested in wheat&mdash;that if a similar scheme to that operated by the Sugar Company would be operated by the wheat millers&mdash;it would be very valuable to the countryside and it <Col N="1060" /> would help to extend the acreage of wheat.</P>
    <P>I think that Senator Ruane referred to the architects' fees in his county and he mentioned a figure that seemed to be amazing.  If there is any ground for it, and if his statement is correct, it ought to be looked into. Perhaps it happens in other counties too, and if so it is a bit of a racket and ought to be stopped.</P>
    <P>Senator McHugh referred to the dead meat trade and what the inter-Party Government did to increase the cattle of the country and the stopping of the slaughter of the calves.  I take a different view altogether to the view he took. I think the calves were not slaughtered because it was found more valuable to rear them.  I think that is what happened in connection with the calves.  I think the farmers were shrewd enough. When they saw it would pay to rear the calves they undertook to rear them, and that was not exactly to help the meat factories so much but certainly it helped to increase the cattle population. That is what I have to say in connection with the matter.</P>

      <P>I am not quite clear what Senator O'Callaghan set out to prove, but it certainly was very meagre consolation to the Minister for Finance. He says that at the end of another 12 months of the Fianna Fáil Government there is only one bright spot in the country.</P>

      <P>There may or may not be a bright spot, but it seems to me to be a very poor consolation to the Minister for Finance that, after debating the Vote on Account in the Dáil, after discussing the Central Fund Bill here in the Seanad, the only grain of hope which those on his own side of the House can find is that there are one or possibly two bright spots in the country at the end of another 12 months of the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
      <P>I want to say that, accepting Senator O'Callaghan's definition of bright spots, I believe there is a third, and I intend dealing with that first, because it is the only matter on which I can find it within myself to compliment the Government or the Minister, and that is on the initiation of the recent publicity campaign in connection with savings.  I think it is legitimate to doubt, as Senator McHugh doubts, as to whether or not, having regard to Government policy as a whole, there can be any reasonable prospect of such a drive succeeding at the present moment; but, as far as I am concerned &mdash;I want to say this quite clearly&mdash;I wish that drive every success and I hope it will succeed.  It is the one semblance of sanity in the financial policy of the present Government.</P>

It is not enough simply to have a publicity campaign&mdash;and may I say this, if the Government and Senator Hartnett thought this was a great idea born in the mind of the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs it was no such thing.  The idea of starting this campaign was the idea of the Leader of the Opposition who has, after 12 months, succeeded in kicking the Fianna Fáil Government into doing something about it.</P>

      <P>I only want to point out that savings campaigns are nothing new.  I was encouraged when I was a boy to do it and every Minister, particularly the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, has always been impressing on us the necessity to save.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that.  The difficulty is that while the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs have been urging on the people the necessity to save the Minister for Industry and Commerce has been doing the exact opposite and has been urging the people to spend.  That is one of the complaints I have made previously against this Government and make again.  However, I want to say it is a bright spot.  It is good to see them doing something about it. They are only doing something about it now because they have been kicked into it by the Leader of the Opposition. Over the last 12 or 18 months he has been calling the attention of the Minister for Finance of the Fianna Fáil Government to the necessity for doing something about this, and did at the Fine Gael Ard Fheis held in the Mansion House on the 17th and 18th of last month refer to the matter.</P>
      <P>I am quoting now from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of February 19.  &ldquo;The Leader of the Opposition stated in his speech that savings must be the main source of progress and that two things were needed&mdash;firstly, to expand them. and, secondly, to see that they were properly invested.  He recommended in connection with expanding savings that he would suggest the setting up of a central savings office which with the assistance of local bodies, trade unions, and groups like Muintir na Tíre, and Macra na Feirme would organise a great campaign.  He went on to suggest that there should be tax relief for these savings.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Senator Colgan does not like being wakened up.  The Leader of the Opposition also suggested that there should be tax relief on all new savings domestically invested in approved securities, and increased tax relief on life assurance premiums in return for appropriate undertakings by insurance companies to play their part in the Irish capital market.  He suggested encouragement of industry, savings by appropriately calculated allowances, and different rates of taxes according to whether profits were ploughed back or withdrawn in dividends.  Those were the recommendations made by the Leader of the Opposition.  One of these recommendations, and one only, is being implemented by the Government in the initiation of this publicity drive for savings.  I should like to suggest to the Minister that the rest of Deputy Costello's speech should engage his very serious attention and that the other recommendations made by him are obviously well worth carrying into effect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is one of these curious types of individuals who find amusement in serious matters. It is a serious matter for this country <Col N="1064" /> to have a Minister for Finance who will so lightly regard his duties and who will so lightly regard recommendations of that sort made to him.</P>
      <P>This Bill gives an opportunity for reviewing Government policy and actions over the past 12 months.  We have already had an expression of opinion from the other side as to how many bright spots are to be found in it.  I propose to take as my thesis for the moment a quotation from a speech reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of Monday last, 23rd March, by Mr. Erskine Childers, Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. Speaking at Mullingar, Mr. Childers said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Opposition were annoyed to hear that Fianna Fáil had the real &lsquo;know-how.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I propose to examine what &ldquo;know-how&rdquo; the Government have and what &ldquo;know-how&rdquo; they have demonstrated during the past year.  The Government certainly know how to increase taxation; they know how to increase the cost of living; they know how to increase the bank rate; and they know how to increase unemployment.  No one will dispute with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs that in these matters the Government have the real &ldquo;know-how.&rdquo;  It is not the Opposition who are annoyed with them for having the &ldquo;know-how.&rdquo;  It is the ordinary people who are annoyed that the Government should know how to increase taxation; how to increase unemployment; how to increase the bank rate and how drastically to increase the cost of living.  The ordinary people are annoyed with the Government for their &ldquo;know-how&rdquo; and they demonstrated their annoyance in this city in the recent by-election held in Dublin North-West when the Minister for Finance, who is so easily amused, was trotting around Manor Street telling the people of Dublin that they had better vote Fianna Fáil. Why?  Because Eisenhower had been elected President of America.  That is the kind of nonsense that is talked by Government Ministers and the kind of &ldquo;know-how&rdquo; that Fianna Fáil have demonstrated during the past year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They know also how to restrict credit and they knew how to slash food subsidies; they know how to depress <Col N="1065" /> trade; and how to slow down the housing drive.  Are these the &ldquo;knows-how&rdquo; the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs referred to in Mullingar?  Is there a Senator supporting the present Government who will deny the accuracy of the recital I have given, who will deny that, in the past 12 months particularly, the Government have increased taxation, have increased the cost of living, have increased unemployment and have increased the bank rate, and have done each of these by deliberate Government policy?</P>
    <P>Is there any Senator supporting the Government, or any member of the Government, who will deny that it was because of Government policy that credit throughout this country was restricted; that it was deliberate Government policy to renege on their promises and slash the food subsidies; that it was because of Government policy that practically every trade in the country has been depressed since Fianna Fáil came back into office; and that arising out of Government policy there has been a slowing down and slump in the housing trade, and that many of the 90,000 unemployed who have been referred to by various speakers are unemployed because of the slowing down in the housing trade?</P>
    <P>This is the Government with the &ldquo;know-how,&rdquo; the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs would have us believe. The Minister has become one of the principal spokesmen for the Government and that was his speech on 23rd March, a speech made after the Taoiseach had admitted, for the first time, that this country was staggering under the weight of taxation imposed by the Fianna Fáil Government.  The Taoiseach was not going to get away with that statement too easily.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs had his ears open and his eyes on him, and a short time after the Taoiseach made that statement, the Minister went this time to Longford and he again had himself reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> on 23rd February last.  He decided that some comment would have to be made on the remarks of his leader.  He was not quite sure what comment should be made or could be made and in fact he was not quite sure if the Taoiseach <Col N="1066" /> meant anything at all, and, in his speech in Longford, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government would be interested to see the reaction of Deputy Costello when the Budget came before the Dáil, because, if the Taoiseach's statement that taxation had reached its maximum meant anything, there would have to be some drastic pruning.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister for Finance has been at loggerheads with some of his Cabinet colleagues during the year, and particularly with the Tánaiste, but I do not think the Minister for Finance would have the nerve to suggest that a statement made by the Taoiseach might mean nothing at all.  I have often felt that.  I have felt that frequently the Taoiseach's statements were designed to mean two or three different things, but I do not think I have ever suggested they were designed to mean nothing.  However, that is the view apparently of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  He gives us a clear warning that, occasionally, at any rate, it may be that statements made by the Taoiseach do not mean anything at all, but he goes on to say that if that statement meant anything it meant that there would have to be some drastic pruning.</P>
    <P>That was the test.  If there was drastic pruning, we could take it that the Taoiseach meant something, and, if there was not drastic pruning, apparently the Taoiseach mean nothing. In a couple of days' time, what happened?  It was announced that the Government were going to pay £250,000 for a racehorse.  Was this the drastic pruning visualised by the Minister, or was that merely a proof that the suspicion voiced by the Minister that the Taoiseach meant nothing was, in fact, right?</P>
    <P>I feel some sympathy with the Taoiseach because, apparently, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is out with the hatchet.  He is out to get him.  We find that in another speech, reported on the 9th March in the <i>Irish Times,</i> he endeavours to pin on the Taoiseach, and the Taoiseach alone, the sole responsibility for all the ills which have befallen this country and which, no <Col N="1067" /> doubt, Senator O'Callaghan deplores. In this speech reported in the <i>Irish Times</i> he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Either Ireland was an isolated community and Eamon de Valera was solely responsible for conditions here, or from 1950 to 1951 there was a fake boom all over Europe.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Was there a fake boom over Europe in the years 1950 and '51, or was it the position that countries which had been devastated by war were making a herculean effort to rectify the damage done by the war and were doing that with very definite success?  What is fake about that?  I suggest to the Minister for Finance and his colleague in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs that there was no fake boom, that there was a definite effort made by the devastated countries to set themselves to right after the war and that to a very great extent they succeeded.  But why does the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs give us that as the only alternative for Eamon de Valera being solely responsible for the conditions existing in this country?</P>
    <P>Apart from anything else, the Minister for Finance has always been a ready defender of the theory of collective responsibility.  I want to suggest to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs that he and the Minister for Finance and the various other Ministers of the Government must join with the Taoiseach in accepting responsibility for the state of affairs in this country during the past 12 months.  I suggest that it is not the Opposition who are annoyed at the Government's know-how as defined by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs but that it is the ordinary people of the country.</P>
    <P>I instanced as proof of that the manner in which the electorate of Dublin City dealt with the Fianna Fáil candidate in the by-election of Dublin North-West.  I can give further examples of it.  I think it will be accepted without argument that the people who are most receptive to public opinion are Independent Deputies in the Dáil and the fact cannot be allowed to pass without comment that certain Independent Deputies in the <Col N="1068" /> Dáil, who have been keeping the present Government in office since its formation, some while ago decided it was time for them to sound a note of warning to the Government.  These Deputies obviously interpreted the feelings of the people in the country and in the city and the result of the North-West Dublin by-election as serving notice on the Government that their days were numbered.</P>
    <P>We find at columns 614 and 615 of the Official Dáil Debates of 18th of this month what one of the Independent Deputies who has consistently supported the Government up to now&mdash; despite the fact that the Government had jettisoned the programme which they published to secure this Deputy's vote and the votes of other Independent Deputies when they slashed the food subsidies&mdash;and who continues to support the Government said about the Government and the Government's policy over the last 12 months:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think they have the best interests of the people at heart.  They have shown that in the past.  But it does need more than good intentions in running the country, you must show results as well.  Listening to the Taoiseach, I could not help feeling that the most important matter is not whether the Government policy is the same or very much the same as that of the Opposition. I do not give a damn whether it is or not.  The only interest I have is whether the policy works, and the policy of the last year, I respectfully submit, has not worked.  I believe that the results of that policy have been too serious for many of our people to allow anybody to feel in any way complacent about it.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Independents have been defined as people upon whom no one can depend.  I take it that is Senator Colgan's view.  However, this Independent Deputy to whom I refer is one of the few who have the Government in the palm of their hand.  He can turn the Government out of office on any given day.  He also sounded a note of warning.  At columns 765 and 766 of the Official Dáil Debates of 19th March, 1953, this man said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There is now one real problem facing this country, and all other problems which have been discussed pale into insignificance beside it; that is, that there are 90,000 people unemployed.  I want to find out what exactly is the policy of the present Government to alleviate that situation. I have looked in these Estimates and quite frankly I do not see anything that promises the slightest hope of alleviation to those 90,000 unemployed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the view of another Independent Deputy who has the fate of the Government in his hand. I want to ask the Minister the same question.  What does he propose to do about the 90,000 unemployed and what plans, if any, have the Government made in relation to solving that problem which was described by another Senator opposite as a problem beside which all other problems pale into insignificance?  You have in these quotations which I have given to you an indication, to put it no stronger, that the days of the existence of the present Government are numbered.</P>

      <P>I think I am entitled in passing to say that even if the Government produces at this stage a policy, even based on the fear that their <Col N="1071" /> days are numbered, the people will, at least, pay them the courtesy of examining it.  But there are people supporting the Government and keeping the Government in power who say that in this Book of Estimates which they have given very close examination they cannot find the faintest vestige of Government policy for alleviating the position of the 90,000 unemployed. I am afraid that is a fact, and I wonder what the Minister proposes to do about it.  His record has not been encouraging. By implementing the Central Bank Report which he recommended, he created a pool of unemployed and that was precisely what the Minister for Finance set out to do and has done. Does he now intend to rectify it?</P>
      <P>Another thing that must be disturbing those Senators to whom I referred and certainly is disturbing the people interested in politics who followed the activities of the Government and read the speeches of Ministers as well as the Deputies and Senators supporting the Government, is the extraordinary contradiction in Government policy over the last 12 months.  I suggest it is quite clear that these contradictions arise from internal dissension in the Cabinet.</P>

      <P>That there is such a <Col N="1072" /> conflict is quite clear and it is equally clear that the main conflict is between the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the proof of the matter is that the Central Bank Report of some while back which was completely jettisoned and thrown overboard in the Dáil by the Tánaiste, has ever since been gradually and step-by-step implemented by the Minister for Finance.  Which of them was right?  I do not know, but the fact that there is conflict is self-evident and in that particular tug-of-war the Minister for Finance got out on top.</P>
      <P>I referred to the question of savings, and the Minister said that that was nothing new.  He was backed up by Senator Colgan in that assertion.  I do not suggest it is anything new and, in fact, the Minister for Finance in his Budget speech last year referred to the question himself, and while he cut down food subsidies and increased taxation, all on the basis&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with savings and have no intention of forgetting. While the Minister for Finance increased taxation and cut food subsidies, it was on the basis that the people of this country were eating too much, living too well and spending too much.  He pleaded with the people of the country that, over and above anything else and notwithstanding the fact that he was going to make it harder for them to eat, make food dearer and take as much money as possible out of their pockets by way of taxation, he wanted them to save 10 per cent. of their annual income.</P>

      <P>So it looks as if we are going to have this barely hit and run dog fight going on for the next few months until the Government goes out of office.</P>
      <P>Before I conclude I would like to say a word in support of a matter mentioned here to-night by Senator Professor Stanford in relation to the Irish News Agency.  Senator Stanford pointed out that when the Irish News Agency Bill was going through the Seanad the then Minister for External Affairs made it quite clear that it was Government policy and it was the policy of the News Agency that that agency would not deal with what is described as hot news.  I have a very definite recollection not in this House but in the other House of the Oireachtas that the then Minister for External Affairs gave a more definite assurance to the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only incidental to what I am saying now, that the Fianna Fáil Party undertook that their first action if returned to power would be to abolish the Irish News Agency.  However, the Minister for External Affairs did give that assurance and it was on the basis of that assurance, and in that Senator Stanford is quite right, that the Irish News Agency Bill was accepted by the Dáil and Seanad and subsequently became an Act.  It was made even clearer to the Dáil than the remark about not dealing with hot news that the purpose in establishing the Irish <Col N="1076" /> News Agency was to assist in the fight against Partition.  I regret to say and I think we must all agree with Senator Stanford that the Irish News Agency has completely departed from the assurance given by the Minister for External Affairs when the Bill was being introduced.  I am not going to deal with the question of whether or not what they are doing is an improvement on the business or not.  It might well be that that is a matter which could be the subject of a separate debate.  I know it is certainly a matter about which there could be quite strong views for and against as to whether the Irish News Agency is doing a proper job by dealing in hot news or not.</P>
    <P>That, however, is not the question in which I am interested, and I am sure it is not the question in which Senator Stanford is interested now. What I am interested in is the position now obtaining where the Irish News Agency, established by the State and financed by the taxpayers, is working against the categorical assurances given by a Minister of this State on its establishment.  Whether encouraged or not by the change of Government I do not know, but they are completely going against the assurances given by the Minister.  I would ask the Minister for Finance to consider that matter very seriously and to have it taken up with the Irish News Agency if necessary.</P>
    <P>There is not much more that I want to say but the Minister, before he concludes&mdash;and I am quite serious in asking him this&mdash;might tell the House  he has had any communication this year with the British Chancellor of the Exchequer.  You may remember that last year a meeting took place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

      <P>The Minister may go back to 1948 if he likes, but the fact that he gets peevish when I mention the British Chancellor of the Exchequer is not going to prevent me from asking <Col N="1077" /> him the question.  Most of us are aware that a meeting took place last year, and I understand that the Minister resents the suggestion that it took place on a summons from the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, but I want to know if there has been any exchange of views this year.</P>

      <P>As far as I am concerned, the Minister need not even listen to me.  As a representative, described by the Minister as a political representative, I am entitled to put this question and I am going to put it to the Minister.  Does the Minister intend to follow, as he did last year, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer in increasing the travel allowance and, if so, to what extent?  The British Budget is being introduced on the 14th April.  Finally, and this is my last question, is it in consequence of that fact that the Dáil will not reassemble until the 15th April?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to participate in this debate until I heard Senator O'Higgins speaking, and nobody listening to him could sit down here without being tempted to deal with the points which he has put forward in his speech.  Senator O'Higgins referred to the by-election in Dublin, among many other things, but I noticed that he was very careful not to refer to the three by-elections that took place in the country earlier in the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>They all took place within the 12 months.  If results of by-elections are to be taken here as any indication of the trend of public opinion, would it not be as well, then, that all these by-elections be dealt with and the verdict of the people in all of them be taken notice of?  As he did refer to the by-election in Dublin, let me say that one thing emerged from that, and that was that Fine Gael <Col N="1078" /> were afraid to put up a candidate. Therefore I cannot see for the life of me how the members of Fine Gael can claim any victory in that by-election when they refused or were afraid to put forward a candidate.  I do not think it is to the credit of Senator O'Higgins or his Party to make any reference at all to the by-election that took place in Dublin North-West.</P>
      <P>In this debate we have again heard reference to what could be described as the hardy annuals, such as high taxation, the cost of living, unemployment, and so on.  But one is amazed, when listening to Senator O'Higgins, that he does not trace the high cost of living and its causes back to the source because I am aware that there had been a steep incline in the cost of living even during the period of the Coalition Government.  In fact, it can be said that it is to the period of the Coalition Government, especially the latter part of it, that nearly half the increase in the cost of living can be ascribed.  Mind you, when any trend like that happens in the national life of the country it cannot be arrested overnight.  It takes some time to overtake it and, after all, this Government has not been so long in office&mdash;only since June, 1951&mdash;that it could be expected to eliminate all these social evils, even those that have come down from the Coalition days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could bring down the cost of living in the morning if we were prepared to take certain measures but in taking those measures we would want to make sure that it would be beneficial from the national standpoint.  For instance, recently there has been an increase in the price of butter and that, no doubt, accounts for some points in the cost of living.  We could reduce the price of butter by reducing the price of milk but would the Opposition dare to advocate a policy of that sort or would they be prepared to go back to the policy of the former Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Dillon, who proposed to reduce the price of milk to 1/- per gallon?  That is the question; that is a matter upon which we would like to get an expression of opinion from the members of the Opposition. <Col N="1079" /> The position is similar with regard to the price of wheat and the price of beet for which there are guaranteed prices.  The cost of living could be brought down if we were prepared to reduce the guaranteed price to the farmers who, we expect, will grow more wheat and more beet this year, but it would be unsound nationally to do so. Thus, when we talk about the cost of living we have to take all these matters into account.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for members of the Opposition or for members of the Seanad sitting on the opposite benches to talk about the cost of living but to shed all responsibility for suggesting any way in which it can be brought down.  Again, we have heard from Senator O'Higgins a reference to high taxation.  Of course, taxation is high in this country as it is in all other countries; indeed, it is higher in most other countries.  But if it is high, that is due to the services that have to be provided by the State, and provided in ever increasing measure.  Would those people who have spoken about high taxation recommend to the Government that such services should be cut down?  If they do, we would like to hear from them where, how, and to what extent.  That would be the realistic way to approach it, because Governments as a rule do not impose taxation for the love of it.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Higgins also referred to the housing drive and suggested that there has been a slowing down of the housing drive in this country.  The figures do not tally with that statement. The number of houses completed last year was 13,000 as against 12,000 the previous year.  What has Senator O'Higgins to say to that?  And let us take all the other activities of the Government, such as hospitalisation, the erection of schools, and the repair of school buildings.  I suggest that there has been an increase in the amount of activity, and a substantial advance in connection with these things.  Would some of the people who have spoken, especially Senator O'Higgins, who would want us to reduce taxation, advocate the cutting down of the activity of the Government <Col N="1080" /> in these spheres?  That is another question that we would like to have answered.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna have been increasing their activities year after year.  They have been turning out more machine-won turf.  There are proposals also for the erection and establishment of generating stations in certain parts of the country.  These, I suggest, are activities that are bound to cost money, and of course the money would have to be got.  I would also refer to the Rural Electrification Scheme and many other schemes that have been started by this Government for the good of the country.</P>
    <P>Again, I would refer to the social services.  We have often referred to them before.  Taxation, of course, could be cut down by reducing the social services in this country.  Are those who are dissatisfied with Government policy on the head of taxation prepared to subscribe to that idea, to the idea of cutting down the social services? No, but the point is that when increases or improvements in the social services are being put forward by the Government the Opposition are all in favour of them for the moment.  Everything is beautiful.  Then when the time comes to find the money to pay for them they have a totally different tune.  They cannot have it both ways. They cannot have their cake and eat it. It is about time that those people who are condemning the Government on the score of taxation and the cost of living would come down to the realities and tell us whether they are in favour of cutting down the activities to which I refer and whether they are in favour of cutting down the social services.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Higgins devoted a good deal of his speech to the Independents who are supporting the Government. Why are they supporting the Government? Why are they supporting this Government?  It is because they believe that the Ministers who comprise the present Government are more likely to promote the welfare of the country generally speaking than any combination of the other Parties in the Dáil; and in that they are in a position to fall back on their experience, because they had experience of the Coalition for nearly three and a half <Col N="1081" /> years, and those Independents supported the Coalition Government until they found that the conduct and behaviour of that Coalition Government would not warrant their support any longer.</P>
    <P>Experienced people, experienced public representatives, do not turn away lightly from a Government to which they have been lending support over a period.  They do not turn away without some cause, and the cause was that they did not find that Coalition Government operating in the best interests of the people.  Now of course that they are supporting this Government they are the worst in the world according to Opposition spokesmen. While they were supporting the former Government they were the white haired boys, but now there is no word in the dictionary strong enough to use in condemnation of them. Surely that is a childish approach to the whole problem of Government.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Higgins referred to savings in this country, and I think he had to admit that savings have gone up; and if savings have increased in this country what is it due to?  There must be some cause.  It is due to the fact that there is more prosperity in the country, because a man cannot save money unless he is fairly prosperous. That is a fact.  Nobody can lay aside savings unless he is able to meet his commitments and do a little over and above that.  So when we hear from these critics of the Government, who pretend that conditions in the country to-day are bad, they should take notice of that, that they cannot be so bad when it is possible for the ordinary people of the country to save more money.</P>
    <P>Now before I finish my remarks I would like to refer to a question that was asked in the Dáil.  I am reiterating that question because I believe it is all important.  It was the Taoiseach himself who posed the question to the Opposition Parties in the Dáil.  If the Coalition had succeeded in forming a Government in 1951 and if they had been confronted with a deficit of £15,000,000, such as this Government was confronted with, what would they have done to bridge <Col N="1082" /> that gap?  They were asked if they would have proceeded to meet current expenditure out of current revenue, as this Minister for Finance has been trying to do, or would they have continued along the road they had been traversing of increasing the deficit and borrowing excessively as they had been doing?  That is a question that should be answered.  It is the aim of this Government to meet current expenditure out of current revenue and, if there is to be borrowing, and there will always be a certain amount of borrowing, it must be for capital purposes, and even then in a prudent way.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the country was faced with a deficit in the balance of payments, an ever-mounting deficit.  After the first year of Coalition Government, the figure was £10,000,000; it then jumped to £30,000,000 and in the final year, it was £61.6 millions.  Would the Coalition, if they had gone into office again, have allowed that to continue? I am glad that the Government of to-day have pursued the course they have pursued and the gratitude of the people goes forth to the Minister for Finance for the wonderful job he has made of it.  He was presented in June, 1951, with an enormous task.  It took a courageous man to face it and it is a matter of gratification to us to know that he has succeeded in grappling with the problem very well.</P>
    <P>There are many things I should like to say on this Central Fund Bill but I do not propose to go into any detail. I conclude by advising members of the Opposition in the Dáil and Seanad to desist from their campaign of trying to create extra difficulties for the Government and trying to pretend that the Government are responsible for things for which they are not responsible at all.  Senator O'Higgins, for instance, mentioned the bank rate and condemned the Minister for having increased the bank rate.  Does any sensible person here think that the Minister increased the bank rate out of malice?  Is it not a fact that he had, of necessity, to follow the trend of the money market all over the sterling area?</P>
    <P>No Minister for Finance in this country could stick his head in the <Col N="1083" /> sand and ignore what was taking place in financial circles in other countries any more than the former Minister was able to ignore what was taking place within the sterling area when he devalued the £ in this country, when he followed the decision of Britain after Britain had decided to devalue the £.  The Minister for Finance here had to do the same.  These are things that are not confined to domestic circles.  The general trend outside has to be followed and if the bank rate to-day is higher than it was it is because money had become dearer and was harder to get.  It would be far better for those people who try to criticise the Government for these things to desist, because nobody will take them seriously.  The plain people know very well what is involved.  They cannot be fooled and they are much better &ldquo;up&rdquo; in these matters than they are given credit for by politicians.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that it has been agreed that the Minister will speak at 9 o'clock and I propose to say only a few words.  I feel that too much of the time in this debate has been taken up with scoring political points. I suppose that is unavoidable and inevitable in a debate such as this, where Government policy is open for discussion, but we should not forget that Government policy is, in fact, State policy, something we are all interested in, and it is important, therefore, especially in this House, that we should try to make as far as possible a vocational contribution to the debate.  I want to say a very few things, but I should like to follow a constructive line in saying them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose nearly everybody has read what is now known as the Stacey May American Report.  In that report, it is pointed out that, though we seem to be full of energy and goodwill in this country, it is, in fact, very hard to find a clearly-defined economic policy in operation after 30 years of self-government. The American report goes on to point out that if we have a policy&mdash;we say we are a private enterprise country and so on&mdash;we do not seem to be directing our budgetary policy and the general work of the community towards <Col N="1084" /> furthering it.  I think it is agreed by everybody on all sides, from the Taoiseach to the members of the Opposition, that there has been a steady and progressive rise in taxation over the past 20 years and that taxation is excessive.  Different adjectives have been used by different people to describe it, but it all adds up to the fact that taxation is too high.  That is something which seems to be above Parties and agreed to by all Parties.</P>
    <P>I suggest that one of the causes of the ever-increasing taxation is the steady and progressive extension of State control and of State helps to all kinds of people, many of which are very desirable and many of which are absolutely necessary, but others of which are not necessary.  We very often go too far in these matters and involve ourselves in ever-increasing expense of all kinds&mdash;more officials, more outlay in carrying out things for people and groups of people which they could well do for themselves.  The Taoiseach himself has made a declaration to this effect.  All this kind of thing leads to higher costs for running the State.  The State is taking on more and more as time goes on.  We see Bills going through the Oireachtas that we could very well do without.  Those Bills cost money and cause more taxation. The American report is perfectly right when it says that we have developed a high degree of statism in this country.  There are a lot of things being done by our State that could be better done by vocational bodies and groups of citizens themselves. It would be better for the State and better for the individual initiative and individual character of our citizens if they were allowed to do these things for themselves through their vocational bodies.</P>
    <P>Not only does the report say that taxation is too high but it also states that production is too low, that capital investment is insufficient, that we have too much unemployment and too much emigration.  These are statements which we can hardly contradict, and if we desire to improve our situation our financial policy should be directed towards creating more capital for investment <Col N="1085" /> both in agriculture and industry.  In other words, we should all be encouraged to save.</P>
    <P>We have heard about the Government propaganda programme which started this morning in connection with saving.  That is a very desirable object but it is only a first step to advise the people to save.  We must go further. The State should encourage the people to save.  It should make it easier for them to save by having less taxation. When they have saved, they should not be penalised in regard to their capital. There are all sorts of penalties in regard to capital and improving business premises in the country.  I will not enumerate those penalties now.  We all know them.  We should direct our taxation and financial policies towards encouraging people to save and when they have saved we should encourage them to build up large capital in the country.</P>
    <P>I think we all recognise that agriculture is the beginning and end of our economy.  It is the basis of our national wealth.  An industrial programme is all right and absolutely necessary but it is second to agriculture. Although I am a businessman and I do not know much about agriculture I realise how important it is to us all.  In England at present there is a high standard in regard to agriculture. The British people have had to develop it because of their financial position.  Their land to-day is splendidly tilled and stocked with cattle.  I was there a few weeks ago and I was very struck by its developed condition. The same position obtains on the Continent, in Switzerland and Denmark but when one turns to Ireland one feels ashamed of the undeveloped state of our countryside as compared with the condition of the land in other countries.</P>
    <P>That is not only a question of capital investment but also one of education.  I feel that the young people should be educated in agriculture. We seem to educate our people mostly for the professions.  Surely our educational system should be primarily directed towards making our young people fitted to develop our natural wealth.  They should be made to love a farming life.  The same is true in <Col N="1086" /> respect of business.  It is only within comparatively recent years that business has been regarded as something worthy of the attention of people who are educated.  During my own lifetime &mdash;I am not very old&mdash;there was supposed to be something wrong about being connected with trade.  That sort of atmosphere still persists.  Our aim in educational matters should be to equip our people to take up agriculture as well as to enter industrial enterprises. That should be our aim rather than to educate them for the professions which are already very much overcrowded.  We are really only educating our people for export.</P>
    <P>I did not intend to speak this evening but I do not think that anybody from the commercial community spoke.  I felt I ought to say a few words because there is a lot of alarm amongst the business people about our present economic position.  By the business people I mean all people who are concerned with the creating of wealth and employment in the country.  The chambers of commerce sent a letter to the Minister for Finance recently.  That is a document that was not meant merely for Deputy MacEntee as the Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance.  It was meant for the Minister for Finance of this State and applies to all Ministers for Finance.  Instead of scoring Party points off one another, instead of seeing what we can spend money on to provide all sorts of services that would be desirable if we could afford them, it is most important that, after 30 years of self-government, we should settle down even at this late stage to create an economy and a machinery which will produce the income to give us all the money we want to build up a sensible Irish economy from which we could get a decent standard of living for our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelColgan" hpid="Mr. Colgan Mr. Colgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to reply to some things said by Senator Stanford and to a lesser extent by Senator O'Higgins on the question of the Irish News Agency.  I recall that Griffith told us that the British had built a paper wall around this country.  On the outside of that wall was put what the British wanted the world to believe about us <Col N="1087" /> and on the inside was put what they wanted us to believe about the outside world.  The previous Minister for External Affairs came in here with banners flying and flags waving and gave us the impression that Partition would be ended in a short period.  One of the means to end Partition was the institution of the Irish News Agency.  I welcomed it as I felt something might be done generally to help the Irish viewpoint abroad.  I supported it.</P>
      <P>Senator Standford is right when he says that the Minister gave an assurance that no hot news would be handled, but that was an impossible thing to do as far as any news agency is concerned whether Irish or foreign. The Senator complained about the picture of the little girl being chased in Derry on St. Patrick's Day by the Royal Ulster Constabulary.  Is there any other news agency in the world who would publish that?  I think it was of great propaganda value and the news agency was quite right to distribute it as much as they possibly could.  I would be opposed to the agency going into competition with ordinary working journalists.  I feel that the attempt to muzzle completely the news agency is all wrong.  If they are told that they cannot do this or do that a success would never be made of the news agency.  Senator O'Higgins supported Senator Stanford.  We have this mythical difference between the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, but there would seem to be a difference emerging between Senator O'Higgins and the Leader of Clann na Poblachta.  I think that is more apparent than the difference he alleges to exist between the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the Government will continue to support the idea of an Irish News Agency.  It is something through which we ought to put the Irish viewpoint across because nobody else will do it for us.  We know what news agencies are, particularly with reference to this country.  Their accounts are generally garbled.  I do not believe that we should spend huge sums on the news agency but we should help it as much as possible and see that it is kept <Col N="1088" /> in existence for the purpose of disseminating Irish news abroad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that Senator McGuire did not open this debate instead of Senator Hayes because I might have found myself more devoid of controversial material for a reply than has been afforded me by the Senator who did open it.  I cannot quarrel with the approach which Senator McGuire suggests we should adopt in considering matters of public policy which come before this House for discussion. In order that there should be no misunderstanding, however, about the reference made in the Stacey May Report of the financial and economic conditions existing in this country, I think I should put it upon record that, according to the report, the field work for it was carried out in Ireland in June and July of 1951&mdash;another member of the team responsible for the report visiting Ireland in September, 1951.  Its findings therefore were obviously based upon conditions which the Stacey May team found existent at that date.  Whether, if the same team were to visit the country to-day, they would have precisely the same criticism to make is something known to none of us, of course.</P>
      <P>Senator Hayes on this occasion, somewhat unusually for himself followed my succinct and purely factual opening like an Indian brave and came in with war whoops and a tomahawk to scalp, not merely the members of the Fianna Fail administration, but every member of the Fianna Fáil Party since its inception and initiation in 1927.  In fact, the Senator went back to the days which preceded the birth of the Party and administered what one might call pre-natal scarification.  He referred to the civil war and to our attitude in 1927 when we entered the Oireachtas of the Free State.  He alleged that we had come in full of venom towards the civil servants and towards public employees generally, but I think, and I am sure Senator Hayes will agree with me when he thinks it over in his calmer moments, that that was an unfortunate reference to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We sacked no man when we came into office in 1932 because of his political <Col N="1089" /> opinions and asked no teacher, either primary or secondary, to sign a political test pledging their allegiance, support and loyalty to the Government of the day.  We accepted all the members of the Civil Service and the teaching profession as we found them and gave them what is described in America as &ldquo;a fair deal&rdquo;. We have no animus towards any member of the Civil Service or any member of the forces who were in arms against us in 1922 and 1923.  We have tried, to the best of our ability, to fulfil the precept of Tone and unite the whole people of Ireland, which is the basis of Fianna Fáil policy.</P>
    <P>I think that Senator Hayes's arguments in regard to the standards of pay, remuneration and conditions of service of the civil servants were somewhat misconceived.  He argued, for instance, that for work of a type which would normally be done by a person who had secured the Intermediate Certificate the Government were getting the very foremost who had secured the Leaving Certificate.  I assume that consistently with that he would have stated that the same thing applied to the executive grades.  What does that prove?  It can only prove that the conditions of pay and of service are so attractive that we are in fact attracting to these lower grades people of a very much higher standard than normally the work of those grades would call for.  I think that nothing else can be deduced from the arguments which the Senator advanced.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to deal at all with the Senator's suggestion that it has been our policy to increase continuously the cost of the public service, because that has already been demonstrated beyond denial to be untrue. If the norm of judgement is to be the record of our predecessors, then in 1947-1948, as has been pointed out here by Senator Hawkins, the total expenditure on supplies and services reached a figure of £58,918,000.  In 1951-1952 expenditure on Estimates which had been prepared by our immediate predecessors in Government showed an increase to over £90,000,000&mdash;an increase of 53 per cent. in three years in the cost of these services.  To the extent to which there was a further <Col N="1090" /> considerable increase in cost last year, it was due mainly to the policy of our predecessors in establishing, first of all, the arbitration board to honour whose findings we had to find £3,500,000.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, we had to find one half year's interest on the Marshall Aid Loan, and had, furthermore, to find the annuity which is payable in respect of voted supplies and services. We had also to implement, in an amended form, of course, the decision of our predecessors which was adopted and accepted by us, to extend and improve social services, and to bring in a new Health Bill.  These are factors which have occasioned this very substantial rise in the cost of public services.  We have inherited many obligations from our predecessors and we are endeavouring to fulfil them.</P>
    <P>Turning to the speech of Senator O'Brien, I should like to say that I listened to it with a great deal of attention, and with a great part of it I would not have much quarrel.  There is, however, one statement of his which, I think, might not be fully substantiated by the facts.  He stated that agricultural production was stagnant. That may have been so two or three years ago.  I think indeed that, so far as the statistics go, they demonstrate that that probably was the position in 1949, 1950 and 1951.  Undoubtedly there does not appear to have been any very great or significant increase in agricultural production over that particular period.  There has, however, been a very significant change since then-a change which has taken place during the year 1952</P>
    <P>Senator McGee, whose knowledge of rural conditions, I think, very few Senators would dispute has stated that the one thing that is clear, forthright and satisfying is the very great rural prosperity that is apparent everywhere. That is what Senator McGee has stated.  Supporting that assertion we have furthermore this very significant fact that in 1952 we had a very substantial increase in exports of agricultural produce and a very substantial overall increase in exports of all kinds. I think that the figures are worth putting on record.  Agricultural produce increased in value from £46.7 million <Col N="1091" /> in 1951 to £54.1 million in 1952.  That is an increase of £7.4 million.  Other exports increased from £33.1 million in value in 1951 to £45,000,000 in 1952, an increase of £11.9 million.  The overall figures were total exports £79.8 million in 1951 and £99.1 million in 1952 or an increase of £19.3 million.</P>
    <P>Let us now consider what the volume index discloses.  Taking the total of all exports and re-exports in 1951 as 100, in 1952 the volume index was 121, or an increase of 21 per cent.  Against that the price index for exports shows that their statistical unit value rose from 114.1 in 1951 to the index number 117 in 1952 or only about 2½ per cent.</P>
    <P>These statistics would not seem to suggest that, taking them with certain others which I shall mention, there was stagnation in agricultural production. Thus we have the fact that the number of live stock in this country on 1st January, 1950, which might be described as the last full year of the Coalition régime, was 3,821,000 head, and on the 1st of January last the cattle population had increased to 3,872,000 head.  Similarly the pig population was estimated on 1st January, 1950, at 510,500 beasts and on the 1st of January this year that number had increased by 50 per cent. to 764,700 pigs.  It seems to me, therefore, that perhaps&mdash;and I want to make this statement with all reserve&mdash;that perhaps it is no longer true to say that agricultural production in this country is stagnant.  On the contrary, agricultural production is increasing and is expanding and we have proof of that again in the statement made by Senator O'Callaghan that there will be a considerable increase in the area under wheat and beet in this year.  These are facts which, in view of the manner in which Senator O'Higgins, with the usual family facility for misrepresenting statements, has tried to distort the statement made by Senator O'Callaghan, are worth recording.</P>
    <P>I do not wish, however, while I say all this, to quarrel with the statement which Senator O'Brien made that possibly the financial structure which productive industry in this country was carrying was too top heavy for the base.  I feel that there is a great <Col N="1092" /> deal of truth in that, and so far as I can influence any new change for the better in the situation, I shall certainly endeavour to do so.</P>
    <P>I also cannot quarrel with the statement that the Senator made that while we want a balance in our external payments and a balanced Budget, we want the balance of external payments to be achieved at the highest possible level of trade, while equally clearly we want the balance on the Budget to be achieved at the lowest possible level. These are matters on which, I think, there will be common agreement.</P>
    <P>I want to come to one of the statements made by Senator O'Brien to which I might take exception, I think rather because of the implication which it contained.  Senator O'Brien said that among the economies which should not be practised are those which give rise to discontent in public service, and the allegation that promises have been broken.  I do not know whether the Senator has in fact endorsed the allegation that promises have been broken, but in case that any other member of the House might be disposed to assume that promises had been broken, if I allowed the Senator's statement to go unchallenged, I should like to say that the Government has not broken in any particular the agreement which was made with the Civil Service to establish a scheme of conciliation and arbitration.</P>
    <P>On the contrary, the Government acting in the best interests of the State and in the interest of the people has merely insisted on the right which it enjoys under the scheme to reserve taking action upon the arbitrator's award until the financial, the fiscal, consequences of giving effect to that award have become manifest, and until the capacity of the people&mdash;because it is the people who are involved in this and not the Government; it is the people who have to honour the arbitrator's award, as the money does not come out of the pockets or the coffers of the Government, but out of the pockets or coffers of the taxpayers&mdash; to meet the increased burden which the arbitrator's award would impose on them has become clear.</P>
    <P>I want to put on the record of this <Col N="1093" /> House what is the significant section, the effective section of the arbitration scheme in this matter.  The effective provision to which I refer is Article 20 of Part IV of the Civil Service Scheme for Conciliation and Arbitration.  Part IV relates to arbitration only and Section 20 reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  Subject to the provisions of sub-paragraph (2) following, the Government as soon as may be after such presentation...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>that is, the presentation of the report of the chairman to the Government</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...will either signify its acceptance of the finding contained in the board's report or will introduce a motion in Dáil Éireann recommending either the rejection of the finding or such modification therein as it thinks fit.</P>
    <P>(2)  When they receive a report from the arbitration board on a claim for a general revision of Civil Service pay, the Government will, when presenting the report to Dáil Éireann in accordance with paragraph 19 preceding, adopt one of the following courses:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  Signify that they propose to give immediate effect to the findings of the board in full;</P>
    <P>(b)  introduce a motion in Dáil Éireann proposing the rejection or modification of the findings;</P>
    <P>(c)  signify (1) that they consider that it would not be possible, without imposing additional taxation, to give full effect to the findings within the current financial year, (2) that they propose to defer a final decision on the report until the Budget for the next following financial year is being framed, and (3) to what extent, if any, they propose in the interval, without prejudice to the final decision, to give effect to the findings, the extent of the payment to be determined by the amount which can be met without imposing additional taxation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I direct the attention of the Seanad to those words: &ldquo;the amount which can be met without imposing additional taxation.&rdquo;  The Taoiseach and myself in public statements in Dáil Éireann have already mentioned that the Budget for this year will show a deficit <Col N="1094" /> and therefore it would not be possible, unless we were going to borrow in order to pay the salaries and remunerations of the civil servants, to give effect to the award without imposing additional taxation.  The general purport of paragraph (c) of sub-section (2) of Section 20 of the arbitration agreement is that if the implementation of the award is going to necessitate the imposition of additional taxation, the Government has the right&mdash;and indeed I should say has the duty&mdash;to defer taking a final decision on the award until the Budget for the following year is being framed.</P>
    <P>Now, I have said here that the Government has acted wholly within its rights and, I think, has acted as it is bound to do in the discharge of its duty to the taxpayers and to the people of the country generally.  What has been the attitude, however, of those whose conduct apparently is endorsed here by Senator Hayes and Senator O'Higgins?  They have attempted by public agitation to coerce the Government to forego its rights under the scheme.  They have endeavoured to coerce us by public agitation to abandon or to fail to discharge our duty to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Now, every article in this scheme of conciliation and arbitration is of equal weight with every other article in it. If the civil servants have rights under the scheme, the people of this country and the Government which represents the people and acts for them have rights, too.  These rights are just as sacrosanct as those of the civil servants but the action which has been taken by certain Civil Service organisations is a denial of this principle.  It constitutes on the part of the particular associations concerned a breach of the fundamental agreement between the staff associations and the Government and it, therefore, must raise the question&mdash;and it certainly has raised it in my mind at least&mdash;as to whether the Government should continue to recognise these particular associations as coming within the terms of the scheme.</P>
    <P>There are certain staff associations which have honoured the agreement in the spirit and the letter and I should like to make it quite clear that they <Col N="1095" /> are in no way covered by what I have just said.  They have recognised the difficult position in which the Government finds itself and they have accepted the fact that the Government is acting in good faith and, as I have said, in discharge of its public duty.  I have no criticism whatever to make of them. On the contrary, I have indeed to acknowledge the responsible and restrained way in which they have behaved during the whole of this very trying time.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I may leave that to come to another suggestion which Senator O'Brien made.  The Senator suggested that there should be some sort of corporation or organisation set up for the purpose of collecting, channelling and investing the small savings of the people.  There is, of course, already in that field one very big institution, the Post Office Savings Bank.  Under the ægis of the Post Office also we have the plan of savings certificates.  Both of these are designed to tap such pool of small savings as may exist.  It is quite true, of course, that the Post Office Savings Bank does not at all&mdash;nor do any of the trustee savings banks&mdash; invest or place their resources in industrial securities, and to that extent they would fail to fulfil the whole purpose which Senator O'Brien had in mind in making the proposal.  But, at any event, I think it would be quite fair to say that they receive the whole volume of small savings available and that nowadays they devote the proceeds wholly to financing capital undertakings.</P>
    <P>The Post Office telephone expansion, the telephone capital expenditure, is financed mainly from the Post Office Savings Bank.  The proceeds of the savings certificates go into the Exchequer in the ordinary way and are used to defray the cost of various capital projects that are undertaken by the Government directly or by the various statutory undertakings set up by the Oireachtas, like the E.S.B., Bord na Móna and those other concerns with which we are all familiar.</P>
    <P>Now the first question, therefore, that arises is what savings would be left to feed this investment corporation which Senator O'Brien has <Col N="1096" /> pressed for.  Would the amount of savings remaining be sufficient justification for establishing it?  I think that we can put up a very large question mark there, at any rate.</P>
    <P>The next thing is, with our very limited resources and in our very limited market, where the number of active operators in industrial securities would be very small, would such an investment corporation as Senator O'Brien has in mind be really a very great asset to us, bearing in mind that he thought of it as an agency for attracting foreign capital into our industrial enterprises.  I think that it is to be doubted, because the real difficulty in activating the market in Irish industrial securities is that in general the conditions which make for prosperity and expansion of Irish industry on the one hand, or recession on the other, are very largely outside our control.  Irish industry&mdash;we may as well face up to it&mdash;is a very narrow and unrepresentative sector of world industry, and world conditions would have much the same effect, would have full effect here on Irish investors or on potential investors from outside as they have elsewhere.  They would have all these reactions with this difference, that an investment corporation would naturally be very anxious to conserve its capital resources, would get out if it thought the market was going to fall and might not be so anxious to get in again even if it thought the market was going to rise.</P>
    <P>In conditions like a state of business recession or depression or whatever description we care to use, a large investment corporation would be anxious to get out, and will be prepared to do so, to cut its losses at a very early stage, and will be especially anxious to do so if a large part of its capital is derived from external sources.  On the other hand, if you have not any such organisation operating, if the holdings are widely distributed, the ordinary small holder of Irish industrial securities, even if the market does start to slide a bit, is generally prepared to hold on to them, mainly because it is expensive for him to get out&mdash;is generally prepared to hold on in the hope that conditions will change <Col N="1097" /> and that the market value of his securities will rise again.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate here a great many things were raised which I think the Government cannot be held responsible for.  Senator McGee referred, for instance, to the manner in which local authorities maintain county roads, particularly those roads which serve some remote districts in the country.  Well, all those roads are the responsibility of the local authority. It is quite true that in the case of these county roads&mdash;it was I who initiated it&mdash;the practice is that very substantial subventions are now given to the local authorities to enable them to maintain the county roads as distinct from the trunk roads; but we cannot expect that the local authorities will be relieved of all their obligations in this matter.  If they were there would not seem to be very much justification for maintaining the local authorities with their very large and expensive staffs.  Therefore, so far as the county roads are concerned, if in the County Louth they are not up to the standard which Senator McGee would like to see obtaining, I would suggest that instead of addressing his remarks to the Minister for Finance, he might perhaps admonish his colleagues on the Louth County Council and endeavour to persuade them to raise a little more money in local taxation and spend it upon the local roads.</P>
    <P>Senator Seán T. Ruane spoke about hospitals and sanitation and seemed to blame us for the defects of the staffs of the local authorities or of various engineers and architects and others who had been retained by the local authorities.  Surely that is the responsibility of the local authority; and certainly whatever other failures you may try to place on the shoulders of the Minister for Finance or even of the Minister for Local Government you cannot blame the Ministers because the local authorities apparently did not take action to ensure that they would get the standard of service from their officials and from those whom they had retained as specialists which they were entitled to expect.</P>
    <P>Senator McHugh had the same sort of complaint.  Now surely the Senator <Col N="1098" /> is not so green and simple as to believe that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, as it was ten years ago when the hospital to which he referred was being built, had any responsibility for building it.  It was built by the local authority.  The only thing about it was that it was financed out of the Hospitals' Trust Fund; but the central authority had not any responsibility for placing the contract or for supervising it or even for planning the undertaking.  It is true that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health would have had to be satisfied that the accommodation which was proposed to be provided would be adequate for the number of patients, but the general detailed planning would be a matter for the local authority; and certainly, if the local authority, having secured considerable sums of money from public sources, allowed that money to be spent with the deplorable results which Senator McHugh has described to us to-day, it seems to me that it is the local authority that is culpable.  I do not know if the Senator is a member of the county council, but if so he ought to indict his colleagues at their next monthly meeting for having permitted these abuses to obtain.</P>
    <P>The Senator seemed to be, in relation also to a number of other matters, very badly misinformed.  We are discussing now the Vote on Account, the amount of money which has to be provided to enable the ordinary public services of the State to be carried on for the next four months; and there is nothing in this Vote about the purchase of a racehorse&mdash;nothing whatever&mdash;nor are the people going to be taxed in order to purchase a racehorse, certainly not in the next Budget; nor is there any proposal to buy aeroplanes, whether obsolete or of the most up-to-date kind, and the simple Senator, therefore, ought not to be led up the garden path by over-enthusiastic propagandists like Senator O'Higgins.  He ought to study these matters for himself and try to find out the truth.</P>
    <P>There is no proposal on the part of the Minister for Industry and Commerce or of Aer Línte to purchase planes of any kind.  I hope that will <Col N="1099" /> be quite clear.  There was a proposal to re-establish a service which had been strangled at birth in 1948, a service which would have been a magnificent dollar earner for the whole of these three years and which would have enabled us to deal much more easily and readily, and with much less inconvenience to the public, with the deficit on our balance of payments last year.  It may be a matter of doubt whether we shall succeed in re-establishing it, because it is easy to kill a promising undertaking, such as Aer Línte was and such as it has been shown to be by the experiences of other airlines, but very difficult to re-establish it.  In that connection, if the Senator is interested&mdash;and, perhaps, coming from Ennis, he might be interested in the development of Shannon Airport&mdash;he should see what the Germans are trying to do.  They are buying planes.  They have set themselves out&mdash;they are working 60 hours a week in order to do it, bearing a very much heavier burden of taxation than we are, and living, some of them, literally in holes in the ground&mdash;to buy a magnificent fleet of the most up-to-date airliners in order that they may enter what they realise, and what we realised long ago, was going to be a very lucrative source of income for their country and for their people and a very important source of employment for the skilled men of their country.  They are lucky because they have had a Government in the past few years which has been looking ahead.  We had a Government over three crucial years of our history which was looking backward all the time, or at least, was looking with squint eyes at the achievements of its predecessors.</P>
    <P>Now I come to Senator O'Higgins. When Senator O'Higgins speaks, it is difficult to know whether one is condemned to listen to a juke box or a political corkscrew.  The Senator has the capacity of a juke box to reproduce interminably worn out records and, at the same time he has some of the characteristics of a corkscrew, that is to say he is in a state of perpetual twist. He told us that the Government had <Col N="1100" /> not done anything to initiate a savings campaign, that we had &ldquo;to be kicked into it&rdquo; was, I think, his chaste and elegant phrase, by the Leader of the Opposition.  The Government, I think, did a very effective job in initiating a savings campaign when it launched the last national loan and secured subscriptions from the greatest number of people, the greatest number of individual subscribers since 1922.  That was no mean opening to a campaign to encourage the people to be thrifty and saving.</P>
    <P>Before that, we had initiated a new series of savings certificates.  Subsequent to the success of the loan, we had made arrangements to set up a special organisation to induce the public to save and to use all the propaganda methods that might be designed to that end.  We had naturally to wait until a building became available.  The headquarters of the campaign were opened yesterday.  A director of savings was appointed some three months ago, before January last.  He had been designated for the post some time before that, and, if the Senator who said that we were kicked into this activity by the Leader of the Opposition, will turn to page 299 of the Book of Estimates for the Public Supply Services he will see there that there is a person holding the rank of senior deputy accountant whose departmental title is that of Director of Savings.  That appointment was sanctioned by me before the close of 1952.  The Leader of the Opposition, the former Taoiseach, addressed the Fine Gael Ard Fheis on 18th and 19th February, so that, so far as this institution is concerned, I do not think Deputy Costello had anything to do with its initiation.  The only thing is that he thought he would get on the band-wagon and try to make it appear that he was leading, whereas in fact he was, like the revolutionary mayor, merely running after the crowd.</P>
    <P>The Senator also read a very long quotation from Deputy Costello's speech at the Fine Gael Ard Fheis advocating tax concessions on investment in Irish industry.  It is a great pity that apparently the Senator and the Deputy whom he follows are ignorant of some of the provisions <Col N="1101" /> which were included in the Budget of 1932, 21 years ago.  They were introduced into the Finance Bill of that year by a Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance and, if I may say so, were severely criticised by the then Cumann na Gaedheal Opposition.  They called themselves Cumann na nGaedheal at that time.  There is nothing new in this, but the thing that is most astonishing is the fact that, though these tax concessions in respect of income from investments in Irish industry have existed for over 20 years, the Leaders of the Fine Gael Party and the Fine Gael organisation seem still to be unaware of them.</P>
    <P>What else did Senator O'Higgins say?  He said that I asked the people to vote for Fianna Fáil because General Eisenhower had been elected President of America.  That is a proof of what I have said&mdash;that Senator O'Higgins is living in a state of perpetual twist&mdash;because I said nothing of the sort.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>What I did say&mdash;and it is worth bearing in mind when we can come to consider the provision we are making for defence&mdash;was that the natural result of the statement which General Eisenhower had made during his election campaign, and particularly the statement he made to the Legion of War Veterans, indicating that if he were elected a very much stronger policy would be adopted towards Russia, the Russian satellites and the Russian policy, wherever it may be found, would be to increase the risk of war, because, if you are to have a hardening of attitude on the one side, which is not responded to by a commensurate softening of attitude on the other, inevitably the possibility and the risk of war become greater.  That is all I said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the experience in the few short weeks General Eisenhower has been in office does indicate the very significant hardening in the attitude of the American Government, in American policy.  That is all I said, and nothing more than that.  I wanted to point the moral that if war did come <Col N="1102" /> and if the possibility of war were to increase, the people should have at the head of affairs in Ireland the man whose leadership and guidance had been of such inestimable value and benefit to them during the last war. That is all I said.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Higgins then referred to the statement made by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and challenged the accuracy of the statement which the Minister made, that there had been a fake boom in Europe during part of 1950 and 1951.  I am not adopting the phrase &ldquo;fake boom,&rdquo; but I am going to address myself to the Senator's explanation of the conditions which developed in Europe at the end of 1950 and the beginning of 1951.  The Senator said that, contrary to the suggestion made by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, the economic activity in 1950-51 was due to the efforts of certain European communities to repair the devastation of war. It is quite true that the European communities which had been the hardest hit by the war have been using what one might rightfully describe as superhuman efforts to rehabilitate themselves and their countries, but it was not these efforts which were responsible for the sudden expansion in economic activity which characterised the closing months of 1950 and part of 1951.  May I say that, because I have, I think, in my hand, a much greater authority on the matter than the Senator?</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Senator would ask to be accepted as speaking with authority on this matter.  I think he would agree with me that he has small opportunity and, perhaps, would not be able to devote the time to the matter.  I do not question the Senator's ability.  Quite the contrary, I do not underrate it, nor overestimate it either.  I think he is able and capable of forming a sound judgement on these matters if he would only be sufficiently alert to look at the facts and not try to imagine them.  I was saying that I was doubting the Senator's capacity to speak with authority on these matters. I went further and said I had doubts whether the Senator studied them but when I want to know what the peculiar <Col N="1103" /> conditions which existed in Europe were due to I go to a higher authority.</P>
    <P>I have here the report of the executive directors of the International Monetary Fund.  It is a report for the fiscal year which ended on April 30th, 1952.  This is what they have to say about the conditions which exist in Europe in a paragraph which is headed:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Continuance of Inflationary Pressures&rdquo;:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Balance of payments developments since the outbreak of hostilities in Korea in June, 1950, afford another illustration of the inevitably close relationship between balance of payments difficulties and inflationary pressures.  It was impossible immediately after hostilities began to predict confidently the course of events.  In fact, speculative purchases, the increased cost of imports, and the expansion of military outlays produced, in a situation where there were already inflationary potentialities, a mixture of cost and income inflation in both industrial and primary producing countries.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The report goes on to say later:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;During the first few months of the Korean war, the upsurge of speculative demand and the consequent increases in the prices of imported raw materials led in most industrial countries to a sharp expansion in bank credit.  This expansion was slowed down after March, 1951, by the decline in raw material prices, the tightening of credit and money market conditions, and stronger consumer resistance in reaction to the earlier spate of buying.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was not, after all, such a misuse of words for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to refer to the conditions which existed during the period 1950-51 as being in the nature of a fake boom.  On the contrary, his diagnosis and his description of the situation were more accurate than that which the Senator endeavoured to make.</P>
    <P>I want, if I have time, to refer to the Irish News Agency.  It is quite true that when the Bill to establish the <Col N="1104" /> news agency was before the Dáil the then Minister for External Affairs, Deputy MacBride, gave certain assurances both to Dáil Éireann and to this House.  It is also true to say that no sooner did that measure become law than these assurances were violated and within a short period of time steps were taken to expand the news agency outside the limits within which the Dáil had understood it would operate. The present Government has no responsibility for the violation of the pledges which were given at that time but it does recognise, as Senator Colgan pointed out, that it would, perhaps, not have been possible for the news agency to operate successfully within the very circumscribed limits which the then Minister for External Affairs proposed to impose on it.  The only thing doubtful about it is whether it would be possible now, without doing a great deal of damage, to curb the activities of the news agency, it having been expanded, and confirm the rigid limits within which the Minister for External Affairs at that time said it would operate.  That was all done with the knowledge and consent of the members of the Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>We merely took over the news agency as a going concern in the condition in which we found it.  We have no responsibility for it beyond that and, of course, the inevitable duty of having to find the additional £30,000 or £40,000 over and above what it was understood the news agency would cost the taxpayer when it was established.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take the remaining stages now.</P>
    <P>Bill passed through Committee, reported without recommendation, received for final consideration and ordered to be returned to the Dáil.</P>

      <P>As the House is aware, Orders made under the control of Imports Act have to be approved of by Resolution in each House of the Oireachtas within eight months.  The Order to which this motion refers amended one quota Order and revoked another relating to cotton piece goods. In 1949, four quota Orders were made for the regulation of the import of cotton piece goods.  These Orders followed on and implemented arrangements which had been made previously between cotton-weaving interests in this country and interests in Great Britain.  The effect was to confine the Irish market to the Irish weavers in respect of classes of cotton piece goods which they were then manufacturing, and secure the balance of the market for the British weavers.</P>
      <P>Quota Order No. 46 applied only to classes of cotton piece goods which were not then made in the country and was brought into force for the sole purpose of providing for preferential treatment in respect of imports from Great Britain.  As the House will see from the motion, Quota Order No. 46 has been revoked and that Order was, of course, unnecessary for the purpose of protecting the cotton industry in this country.  It imposed an obligation to import supplies of cotton cloths from Britain, even though they might have been purchased more advantageously elsewhere.</P>
      <P>That form of preferential treatment for imports under quota restrictions is contrary to the principles governing international trade which were laid down subsequently by the O.E.E.C., to which this country has subscribed. That preferential treatment for British cotton imports into this country under the arrangements made was disapproved strongly by the British Board of Trade, and it was decided to revoke the Order.  The effect was to free from quantitative regulations imports of the cotton goods to which we have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1106" /> Consideration was given also to the extent to which the cotton-weaving industry had developed in this country, and it was decided to amend Quota Order No. 45 so as to include within its scope cloths which had been previously caught under the No. 46 Order, but in respect of which it was decided to include a restriction on imports. Quota Order No. 45 applied only to cloths over three ounces per square yard in weight and over 37 inches in width; that is to say, 37 inches in width when the cloths had a woven pattern, and, as cloths less than three ounces in weight and woven-pattern cloths under 37 inches in width are being made here, they are being brought under the scope of Quota Order No. 45.</P>
    <P>The position now is that, while the quota Order has been extended to include these classes of cloths, manufacture of which commenced after 1949, other cloths which are not being manufactured here at all have been freed from import restrictions.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1, standing in the name of Senator Yeats:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 21, to insert before &ldquo;which&rdquo; the words &ldquo;over which a public right of way for foot passengers, animals and vehicles exists and&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section, as framed, is very wide in scope in that it authorises the road authority to declare any road not a public road to be a public road.  The 1925 Act provided that there should be, firstly, a public right of way over a road, secondly, that such a road would connect two roads, and, thirdly, that such a road would not be less than 11 feet wide.  These restrictions are now, by this amendment which I am proposing, reduced to the requirement that there must be a public right of way for foot passengers, animals and <Col N="1107" /> vehicles before a local authority can declare such a road to be a public road.</P>
    <P>There is a possibility that if this amendment was not inserted, roads which local authorities had never any intention of taking over could be taken over.  An example which would spring immediately to the minds of city people would be the road through Trinity College which could be taken over by the road authority in the city unless this amendment was inserted.  That, apart from the merits or demerits of such a proposal, would be an interference of a right guaranteed under the Constitution, namely, the right of private property.</P>
    <P>I think that it would be very inadvisable if that were so and if we passed a Bill which might possibly cause such an injury.  Quite possibly, it might lead to the Bill itself being deemed in the courts to be unconstitutional.  For these reasons, I move the amendment for Senator Yeats, which should commend itself to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the amendment is a sound one and means that a local body cannot declare a road <Col N="1108" /> to be a public road unless it has been already in use by the public.  That is perfectly sound.  I do not think that the Bill, as originally framed, was intended to give the powers which are, apparently, contained in it.  The insertion of the amendment will be an improvement, because it will prevent the possibility, by a side-wind, of interference with anyone's rights.  I say again that the amendment is a sound one, and I support it.</P>
