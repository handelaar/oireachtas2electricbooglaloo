    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is twofold. First it proposes to extend from £50,000,000 to £70,000,000 the limit of advances which may be made from the Local Loans Fund and it proposes to provide for the writing off of sums amounting to a little over £5,000 of certain advances already made from that fund.  The need to increase the existing over-riding limit of advances arises from the fact that over £48,000,000 has already been advanced from the fund and as the rate of advances is something over £10,000,000 <Col N="482" /> per annum it is clear that in the almost immediate future the statutory limit would be reached.</P>
      <P>So far as the sums to be written off are concerned, some of these loans go as far back as 50 years and some as far as 30 years; indeed, so far as my recollection goes, the most recent of them was made 24 years ago.  The Commissioners of Public Works who manage the fund are satisfied that there is no possibility of recovering any of the remanet principal or the arrears of interest which have accrued and they accordingly recommend that the loans should be written off.  They cannot, however, be written off simpliciter since the Local Loans Act of 1935 provides that no advances may be written off except with statutory authority. Accordingly it is proposed in Section 2 of the Bill to give statutory authority for the writing off of these loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the explanation of the writing off of these sums? It is true that they are merely a matter of £5,000 odd which is not very large but the principle involved is serious. It seems to me as if somebody in the Civil Service at some period forgot to collect these amounts because I see the name of William Woods, Auditor, signed in connection with this matter, the date of February 1st, 1937.  That is 16 years ago.  It does seem extraordinary that we should now be writing off those amounts.  When we are dealing with public moneys what authority have we to wipe it out at all?</P>
      <P>I see that money was loaned to the Harbour Commissioners at Buncrana many years ago and it would seem as if somebody has slipped up in not collecting these moneys.  I would like to have some information on that matter.  There may have been questions of a real bad debt but in business an effort is made to recover bad debts through examination in the courts, and I would like to know if the State acts in a like manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not usual in matters of this sort to discuss the position of private individuals but I feel that I am at liberty to do so in this instance in view of the fact that <Col N="483" /> it is the Land Commission which is indirectly responsible.  The amount of this loan was £400.  The advance was made under the Land Improvement Act in 1913 to the gentleman whose name has been mentioned for the improvement of his farmhouse on a holding of 348 acres 2 roods and 2 perches in Offaly which he held under a fee-farm grant.  The loan was charged on the land and the land eventually became vested in the Land Commission in the year 1937.  The redemption value of the land at that time was £206.  Where lands charged with a loan under the Land Improvement or Local Loans Acts become the subject of proceedings for land purchase the amount of the loan is chargeable against the purchase price, but if that is not sufficient to meet the loan charges, then it is not possible to recover it and accordingly it ceases to be proper to regard it as an asset of the fund.  It will be seen, therefore, that the need to write down in this case is not due to any dereliction of duty on the part of any civil servant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I inquire, since I have sympathy with the questions raised by Senator O'Donnell and his interest in safeguarding public moneys, whether the reasons for writing off the amounts in the other cases of the people referred to in the Schedule are the same as those raised by Senator O'Donnell?  Will the Minister state whether the reasons for inability to recover the moneys were similar or not?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No, they are not strictly on all fours with the case raised by Senator O'Donnell.  In one case, a loan was made in 1929 to an ex-officer of the National Army under the Land Improvement Act, and, as usual, in that case it was charged on the land.  That ex-officer subsequently left the country, his whereabouts are unascertainable and therefore we cannot recover the debt.  The case of Mrs. Margaret Kennedy, if the Senator will excuse me going into details, is very much the same as that of Mr. Odlum. In the case of the Buncrana Harbour Commissioners, their position is that a considerable sum of money was spent on the building of a pier by the Office of Public Works and a Government grant was given towards the cost of construction.</P>
      <P>The works were carried out, but the Harbour Commissioners were not satisfied that they were properly carried out and refused to meet their obligations in respect of the loan.  The position in fact is that between 1929-30 and 1933-34 improvements were carried out in the harbour at a cost of £30,000. A sum of £6,000 was provided by way of loan and the balance by way of grants.  The Buncrana Harbour Commissioners took up the attitude that the works were not properly carried out and refused to meet their obligations. Ultimately, a settlement was arrived at and, in virtue of that, the amount is now to be written off.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Bill reported without recommendation, received for final consideration, and ordered to be returned to the Dáil.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Acts give the Minister power to grant loans to industrial concerns for development purposes.  The first Act was passed in 1924 for a period of one year only, but it was renewed when it expired and after being extended in scope in 1933, has been continued for five year periods <Col N="485" /> ever since.  The most recent extension of the life of the Act took place in 1949, so that it is not due to expire until 1954.</P>
      <P>By the Act a limit was placed upon the aggregate amount of guaranteed loans that might be outstanding at any one time.  That limit was £1,000,000. At present, the aggregate amount of loans outstanding is over £800,000 and, as there are some substantial applications in train, it is desired to raise that limit to £1,500,000.  That is the purpose of this Bill.</P>
      <P>It is also proposed that the Act be continued indefinitely as to time.  As it has been in operation for practically 30 years, and been extended each time the limit was reached, it is be assumed that it is now a permanent part of the legislation of the State.  The purpose of the Bill is to raise the limit on the aggregate amount outstanding from £1,000,000 to £1,500,000 and, secondly, to continue the operations of the Act without any limitation in respect of time.</P>
      <P>I think it can be said that some substantial benefit has been conferred on the country by the operation of the Act.  The 1924 Act was the first attempt made by the Government of this State to assist industrial development and, even though the earlier cases helped under it were not all successful, and the Act became less important with the establishment of the Industrial Credit Company, nevertheless some useful results were secured.  Guarantees in respect of loans were given in respect of 109 undertaking from 1924 to this date.  Of these 109 guarantees, in 70 cases the loans were repaid in full and in 12 cases the loans are still outstanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three of these cases are public authorities that sought guarantees in respect of loans for harbour works.  In 27 undertakings involving guarantees totalling £602,000, receivers have been appointed.  The mere statement of the number and amount involved may give a somewhat false picture of the position.  Of the total aggregate guarantees in cases where receivers have been appointed, one case alone, that of Irish Steel, represented one-third <Col N="486" /> of the total, or £200,000 and, as the House is aware, when the original private company went into liquidation and the State took over the undertaking and paid off the loan, it carried it on and now there is a very substantial and profitable industry in Haulbowline, in consequence.</P>
    <P>It is much the same in respect of the second largest guarantee, a loan to the Peat Fuel Company which established the manufacture of briquettes at Lullymore in County Kildare.  Again, when the private company got into difficulties and the State paid off the loan and exercised its right to take over the undertaking, it passed it over to Board na Móna, which is now carrying on a very successful and profitable business there.  There are very few cases where there was a total loss and the amount involved in these cases is more than off-set by the additions to the value of the assets where the concern was either carried on by the State or disposed of to other people who restarted and developed the undertaking for which the loan was given.</P>
    <P>On the whole, it can be said that the Acts have justified themselves and it is desirable to continue them in existence and to permit of the consideration of further applications by extending the limit which must be extended unless future applications are to be turned down automatically.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not had much experience of this Act recently but in the past I had a certain amount of personal experience.  I am prepared to endorse almost entirely what the Minister has said.  He, of course, has more knowledge than I have.  I agree that something of this kind should now be permanent.  The Trade Loans Act should be continued.  I agree that guaranteed loans should be regarded as of a permanent nature, as a necessary part of the policy of the State upon which there is no fundamental disagreement although there may be disagreement in details.  At the same time it is a mistake to regard this as being very important.  The total sum of money is relatively small.  It does not suit in cases of substantial <Col N="487" /> development.  For private individuals it has snags because of the provisions which were always applied with regard to capital repayment.  It is rather dangerous for an industry, unless in exceptional circumstances, to have a large part of its capital subjected to repayment over a fixed period of time.  These are drawbacks but as the Minister has pointed out in spite of that there have been cases where it proved very helpful.</P>
      <P>In one case to my knowledge it was of very great assistance to a company which became successful and repaid the loan after a few years.  At the particular time the company would probably have had difficulties in obtaining a loan without a Government guarantee.  There is no doubt that the House should approve of the Bill.  I take it from the Minister that there are a number of cases pending.</P>
      <P>I thought the necessity for these loans was largely disappearing and dying out but I think the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Bill should be maintained even if that is so in respect of the very few persons or companies who think it advisable to use it.  With regard to the couple of cases which are pending, I know these are not matters which should be made public but I rather gather from the Minister that the sums are fairly large and I do not know whether he could make any statement with regard to the rate of interest.  It seems to me that it is not going to be very good business in most cases to borrow under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Bill if you have to pay 5 per cent. or 6 per cent. and also make provision for repayment.  However, that will be a matter for the individuals concerned and for the Minister in dealing with it.  I do not think in present circumstances that there is going to be a great deal of use made of the Act.  Nevertheless I approve of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that Senator Douglas gave his support to this Bill and I am glad to give it mine.  The Act has never had any wide appeal to the private industrial speculator as such.  Nevertheless, the <Col N="488" /> Act does fill a particular need in peculiar circumstances.  The Minister pointed out that over the last 30 years industrial concerns had been glad to avail of the sums of money available even with the restrictions imposed when the loan was granted.  The Act does provide something that would otherwise leave a gap in our industrial economy.  I think the Act should be continued and I give my support to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just a word or two to say.  Some short time ago I was approached by a certain group who were interested in receiving some additional capital for an enterprise.  I was told that the procedure under this Act was so difficult and tortuous that people who looked for loans should try any method other than looking for additional capital or security under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act.</P>
      <P>I would like if the Minister could in any way make the procedure less difficult.  I believe that some form of an inter-departmental commission is to be set up to sit on each case that is put before them.  I may be overstating the case when I say that the business may have gone out of operation before this commission will report. If the Minister can see his way to streamline their action in such a way that they could receive the capital they would require more expeditiously I think he would make the Act a more effective piece of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to tell us what exactly is the actual loss so far.  It seems to me that the sum of £200,000 from Irish Steel was not an actual loss and neither was the figure given in respect of the Lullymore Fuel Company which was the second largest losing amount. The assets in both cases were transferred to other companies.  I would like to know in so far as it is possible to do so what the actual loss on all loans was since the Act came into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Act is one which was born directly out of the Sinn Féin movement. As such it is an Act which everybody here must support if for no other reason.  It was brought into being at a time when we were <Col N="489" /> dreaming of new industries and when it was thought that people, who might be deserving of financial support for the establishment of such industries, could not get it easily through the ordinary commercial sources such as banks.  It was then that the Trade Loans Act was devised.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Trade Loans Act has become involved in very difficult procedure.  To-day I think it is not as attractive to potential industrialists as it might be made.  It is hemmed around by all sorts of difficulties and administrative practices which have grown up over the years.</P>
    <P>I should like to re-echo Senator Burke's appeal that this procedure might be simplified.  Where a good proposition is put to the Minister and where the people behind the proposition are people of integrity and worthy of support, all these difficulties should not be put in their way.  Since the original Act was devised and approved, other methods of financing industries have been devised and some of them are being used more now. These are subsidiary organisations all working indirectly under Government control.  I presume that to some extent they have interfered with the fuller operation of the Trade Loans Act.</P>
    <P>There are still numerous opportunities for industrial developments and it might be worth while to publicise the fact that the Act is in being and that money is available to people for its operation.  I think that the public generally think that the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act is dead and that it is very difficult to make an application under it.  Consequently, it is not being availed of as much as it could.  I would like to re-echo Senator Douglas and Senator Summerfield's views.  I saw Senator Hayes looking at me when I said the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act was a Sinn Féin Act.  I can assure him it was. It came into being during the 1918 period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the amount of the actual loss it is very difficult to give a figure.  It is very <Col N="490" /> largely a matter of opinion.  As I said, the aggregate amount of loans guaranteed in cases where difficulties emerged and the State exercisd its right to put in a receiver was £602,740.  The aggregate amount obtained in cash from the disposal of the assets, where the assets were disposed of, was £157,500 so that on that basis you could calculate the loss as £445,000 That, however, would be a false picture.  Included in that £445,000 would be, for example, the £200,000 paid in respect of the loan guaranteed to Irish Steel, Limited.  There the State paid off the loan, took over the company and carried it on.</P>
      <P>It is an undertaking now established without liability in respect of share capital, but with assets in excess of £1,000,000.  In that one case alone, the actual benefits resulting from the giving of the loan would exceed the total loss on all the other undertakings.</P>
      <P>The same thing applies to the peat fuel undertaking, and in other cases where the State did not become involved in the business.  I will mention two or three which I think will illustrate my point.  The original Irish Glass Bottle Company went into liquidation and the State had to make good its guarantee to the extent of £50,000 and then disposed of the assets to a new company which restarted the undertaking and is now operating one of the largest industries in Dublin.  The same applied in respect of other companies like O'Brien Brothers of Cork and Mullan Mills of Monaghan where, even though the original company got into difficulties and it went into liquidation, the State ultimately disposed of the assets to a new firm which carried on the undertaking and made a success of it.  There were a few cases where from the State point of view there was an absolute loss, such as Aylesbury Brothers, the Cloyne Clay Company and the Allihies Copper Mines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even amongst such cases, we had the case of the Irish Fresh Meat Company, which established an elaborate premises in Drogheda with the aid of a trade loan but never went into production, yet the premises themselves now house three or four manufacturing concerns <Col N="491" /> of quite considerable importance.  Any attempt, therefore, to assess the actual loss would be a difficult matter.  There are cases involving a total of £127,000 where willingness to give a guarantee has already been intimated.  Some of these cases may be in abeyance.  The reason why they are still regarded as pending cases may be due to the fact that the persons seeking the guarantee for a loan either have decided not to proceed with the enterprise or have succeeded in raising the money otherwise and do not require the guarantee. I understand there are some cases pending involving substantial amounts. I am not saying they will be successful in their applications but unless this amending Bill is passed we would not be free to consider them.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question I have been asked about the rate of interest, I would like to state the position.  The Government guarantees repayment of the principal of the loan and payment of interest on it up to 2½ per cent.  The person who gets that guarantee, that formal intimation from the Department of Industry and Commerce that the Government is prepared to guarantee the loan, goes out into the market to negotiate the loan on the best terms he can get.  He goes to a bank, an insurance company or a private individual and tries to get his loan financed on the best terms possible.  Whether he pays interest at 4, 5 or 6 per cent. the guarantee operates only in respect of 2½ per cent.  The person making the loan stands to lose if interest is not paid to the extent of the difference between the interest contracted and 2½ per cent.</P>
    <P>It is true, as was stated, that the Act makes no wide appeal to persons proposing to engage in new industries. It is not intended that it should.  It is obviously desirable that anyone proposing to embark on an industrial enterprise should seek to finance it either out of his own resources or by capital subscribed at risk and not on the basis of a repayable loan.  It is only in exceptional cases that they should be encouraged to seek capital on the basis of a repayable loan.  These <Col N="492" /> cases sometimes involve concerns which are operated on a family basis and where there is a desire to prevent it passing out of the hands of the family, which might be involved if money at risk were brought in from outside. There are other cases where some special consideration applies to make it desirable that the new capital should be repaid over a period of time.  For example, for some time past we have been trying to get factories located in turf producing areas to use truf as their fuel, and in many cases we have been able to demonstrate&mdash;or at least Bord na Móna has been able to demonstrate, through its technical service branch&mdash;that it would pay the concerns they have approached to change over to turf instead of coal or fuel oil.</P>
    <P>Occasionally they come up against the difficulty that the proprietors of the concerns say that while it is true it would ultimately pay them they would unfortunately have to incur the capital cost of new equipment.  In such cases we would suggest the desirability of utilising the Trades Loans Guarantee Act, getting the guarantee for the additional capital required to effect the change over, intending to repay it over a period of years so that the total capital liability of the concern would not be permanently increased.</P>
    <P>I do not know that it is possible to improve the procedure and I am not sure that it is desirable to streamline it.  The tendency should be to discourage people from using this Act if they can get the money in other ways, but the procedure is not as cumbersome as someone has suggested.  There is an advisory committee by which all applications are considered and in practice the decision of the advisory committee is nearly always final, even though it takes the form of recommendation to the Minister for Industry and Commerce which the Minister may or may not accept and whose decision has to be concurred in by the Minister for Finance.  At the present time, consideration of the case by the advisory committee does not take very long. At one time it used to take more time because there were a number of these committees and it was not always easy <Col N="493" /> to get members together for the purpose of considering applications. Now the members of the Industrial Development Authority are the advisory committee and that shortens the procedure at that stage very considerably.</P>
    <P>When the committee has made its recommendation there is not much time lost between that stage and the final intimation of willingness to give the guarantee.  It is at that stage that delays have occurred and they are delays which are not under the control of a Government Department but arise out of the whole method of raising the capital by this means.  The borrower, having got his guarantee, goes off to get his loan and then a mortgage deed has to be prepared, which secures to the Minister for Industry and Commerce his right to take over the assets in the event of default on the loan.  Deputies familiar with legal procedure know that it sometimes takes a considerable time before that deed is drawn up in a manner which is acceptable to the borrower, the lender and the Minister whose rights are to be secured.  Nevertheless, I must say that in the few cases where I had complaint of delay and carried out investigations, I did not see what else could be done.  In view of the desirability of maintaining safeguards where public money is involved, it did not seem to me possible to drop any of the stages which the present procedure involved. On the whole, I do not think that people whose circumstances require them to avail of this Act have been deterred from attempting it by reason of these delays.</P>

      <P>What the Minister said was that it is the borrower's job, when he negotiates his deed, to borrow the money at the best rate he can get, but, so far as the Government are concerned, they will only guarantee repayment at the rate of 2½ per cent. I am not going to get anybody I know at the moment to lend me money at 2½ per cent. and I must go to the full banking limit of 6 per cent., and consequently it seems to me that the Bill negatives its own reason by saying: &ldquo;You go out and borrow the money and we will cover you for anything you get to the extent of 2½ per cent.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It never was.  I am afraid the Senator misunderstands. The Government does not make any attempt to determine what would be a reasonable rate of interest for a loan for an industrial concern guaranteed by the Government.  We guarantee the payment of interest up to 2½ per cent., but the actual rate of interest payable will be determined by market conditions. As a matter of fact, I was responsible for that change.  When I became Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1932 the guarantee was for interest up to 5 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the bank rate was about the same at the time also and I thought it was unreasonable that the Government should guarantee repayment of <Col N="495" /> interest at a higher rate than the borrower was able to negotiate in a few instances.  I felt that the lender should take some part of the risk&mdash; a very small part because the important thing from his point of view is the guarantee that the principal amount will be repaid in the event of default.  In any event, I felt then&mdash; and still think&mdash;that it was undesirable that the Government should attempt to calculate a reasonable rate of interest in a particular case&mdash;that we should give a guarantee of 2½ per cent. and let ordinary business negotiations settle the actual rate to be paid in a particular case.  That rate may vary according to the circumstances of the case as well as the market price of money.  I meant what I said when I expressed the view that it was undesirable that people should enter into industrial operations on the basis of having them capitalised by repayable loans, rather than on the basis of permanent investment, and, in their own interests, they are always advised, when they come to the Department, to endeavour to get permanent investment if they can.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the theory, but it is a long time since the theory behind this Bill was first discovered. When an opportunity arose for industrial development here, there were quite a number of men who had no means, men to whom the bank would not lend money but men who had gone through the fight for the country and who felt that the time might come when they might want to avail of the opportunities which would be provided by the industrial development which was to come.  The Act was devised so as to give them an opportunity of making application for trade loans which would be vetted by a body to be approved by the Government and, ultimately, by the Minister.  Maybe that time has passed and maybe these men now have all the money they want, but if the spirit of the Bill is still the same, the Minister should reconsider raising the guarantee from 2½ per cent. to 5 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Chair will forgive my stressing <Col N="496" /> this point, but I feel that it is very important from the industrial development point of view.  I know one small firm which began in those days on a loan of £6,000, and, as the Minister has told us with regard to other industries, I should say that that firm's assets to-day are well over £250,000, due entirely to the fact that it got help in its early days.  There are plenty of industrial enterprises waiting to be started here and numbers of men who need money to develop them.  If these men could get the money from other sources, they would not avail of the Trade Loans Act at all.  The Minister has said that his tendency was to discourage them, if they could get the money elsewhere.</P>

      <P>I am in complete disagreement with that point of view, because I feel that the Bill should be so operated as to enable people of integrity, people with no means but with a national outlook, to get their start through a governmental loan, even with a guarantee in respect of a high rate of interest behind them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to offer certain additional incentives to exporters to explore possibilities in dollar markets by bringing into operation schemes of insurance against certain risks which are inseparable from the export trade.  I do not suppose it is necessary to speak at any length to convince the House that it is desirable that we should expand our export trade to dollar markets.  Apart from balance of payments considerations which enter into the question, preliminary exploration of possibilities in these markets has shown them to be quite substantial, and we are anxious to encourage people to go after them, at least to the extent of providing for them the same facilities as exporters in most other countries enjoy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have not had here an export credit guarantee system similar to that operated in Britain over a number of years and, in effect, one of the primary purposes of the Bill is to permit such a system to be brought into operation. We set up an organisation called Córas Tráchtála, Teo., to supervise generally the extension of dollar exports and to take all practical measures to that end, including the making of proposals for legislation.  That organisation consulted with a group of Irish insurance companies and arranged that the group would initiate a scheme of insurance against ordinary commercial risks incurred by exporters to dollar markets. The risks which that group of insurance companies will cover are those which normally arise in business, that is to say, the risk that the purchasers will not pay or will delay payment, involving the exporter in loss and similar commercial risks.  It would not be appropriate for private insurance companies to insure exporters against what are called political risks.  Consequently, <Col N="498" /> it has been arranged to have a scheme of insurance against political risks carried out by this group of six insurance companies and underwritten by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the main purpose of the Bill is to empower the Minister to initiate such a scheme with that group of insurance companies and bring it into operation.</P>
    <P>Political risks, apart from the obvious ones&mdash;the danger of war, civil commotion, violent upheavals, preventing the movement of goods or payment for them&mdash;are those which arise out of Government action, can celling of import licences, non-renewal of import licences, custom duty variation, imposition of restrictions by Governments on the transfer of funds and similar contingencies of that kind. The scheme may possibly cover, although I do not want this to be taken as definite, the danger of currency depreciation.  The aim will be to offer to exporters to dollar markets complete coverage against commercial risks, carried by insurance companies on their own behalf as an ordinary business venture, and against political risks in which the insurance companies will act as agents for the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister will receive the premium income subject to deductions to cover administrative expenses. Under the British Export Credit Scheme there was for a long period of years a substantial accretion of income, the amount secured through premiums exceeding the annual payments. But I notice that in the last few weeks, a Supplementary Estimate was introduced in the British Parliament to make good amounts lost by British importers because of restrictions on payments imposed by one country.  That situation does not necessarily involve permanent loss and repayment may be secured sometime, but the private firms involved in the business are being recouped the amounts involved out of the British Export Credit Guarantee Fund.</P>
    <P>The practice in Britain has been to vary the premium rate for insurance against political risks, according to the <Col N="499" /> assessment of the risk involved.  The scheme will be administered by the Minister for Industry and Commerce as appears in the Bill and he will have responsibility for the details of the scheme.  In practice, however, Córas Tráchtála will advise him.  Under the arrangement there will be brought into operation a system of insurance against risk which may be incurred by exporters to dollar areas similar to that which exists in most other countries.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to go further than that and operate also a joint venture insurance which I propose to explain. A firm proposing to explore possibilities in any dollar market would naturally have to contemplate a rather long-term programme which might involve losses during the first two, three or four years in market development, and the possible recoupment of these losses by the growth of trade in later periods.  Most Irish firms limited in size as they are would hesitate to undertake expenditure on market development in these circumstances, because there might be no certainty that the possibilities they saw would ever in fact be realised, and they would have to face the danger that the expenditure which they incurred in market development would never be recovered if the market did not eventually materialise.</P>
    <P>It is proposed therefore to operate through Córas Tráchtála a joint venture scheme under which Córas Tráchtála will insure persons undertaking long term market development schemes against ultimate loss in consideration of the payment of premiums. Córas Tráchtála will be something more than insurers in cases of that kind and will have to be satisfied that the particular project in which it is being asked to join is a sound one.  It is far more likely that action under that scheme will be taken on the initiative of Córas Tráchtála rather than on the initiative of private firms.  Córas Tráchtála have been carrying out market research and have employed expert American market consultants. If they themselves decide that there are possibilities for a particular line <Col N="500" /> of goods, they can approach Irish firms and interest them in this possibility and they can inform them of this joint venture arrangement as well as direct their attention to the prospect of profitable trade.</P>
    <P>It would be perhaps unwise for me to attempt to speculate as to the types of goods in respect of which possibilities in the dollar markets are deemed to exist.  From the preliminary investigation carried out by Córas Tráchtála a number of commodities were picked out for investigation and a team of American experts was employed to report upon these commodities. The report covered not merely market conditions in America but also changes in production technique, packing and other arrangements necessary in this country.  A summary of that report will be published in a few days; the report I understand is in print and will be available shortly for Senators. It indicates commodities in respect of which Córas Tráchtála thought initially there was a dollar market available, and Senators will be able to see the extent to which the American experts agreed or disagreed with the view of Córas Tráchtála.  Córas Tráchtála has already undertaken, in conjunction with firms, the sending of trial consignments, some of which proved to be very satisfactory and others less satisfactory, but it is only by experimentation and trial that definite possibilities can be discovered.</P>
    <P>It is intended that both these insurance schemes, that is the giving of insurance cover against political risks and the joint venture scheme will be confined for the present to dollar markets.  The Bill does not say so but empowers the Minister to operate these schemes generally.  It may be that later on the schemes will be extended to other markets.  It is thought desirable that they should now be confined to dollar markets in the belief that if they prove to be practicable there they can easily be extended to cover other markets as well.  The term dollar markets covers not only the U.S.A. but all countries in respect of which payment of goods must be made in dollars. In fact, as I informed the Dáil, Córas Tráchtála are investigating possibilities <Col N="501" /> in the Canadian market and a survey of that market has just been made. Córas Tráchtála considers that the prospects there are quite good and arrangements are being made for displays of Irish goods in Montreal in connection with the St. Patrick's Day arrangements and also for displays of goods at the Toronto International Fair in June.</P>
    <P>The position that will exist after this Bill passes, and the schemes which are contemplated come into operation, is that anybody who proposes to export goods to these dollar markets can if the contract is a long term one link in Córas Tráchtála as a partner in their enterprise prepared to carry part of the losses if they should arise.</P>
    <P>There is one other change which the Bill proposes to make.  Under the 1936 Act foreign insurance companies were excluded from operating here unless they were established here on the date on which the Act was introduced.  The position at the present time is that there is no power to give licences to new foreign companies to engage in insurance business in this country.</P>
    <P>In recent years a number of Irish companies have extended their business to external markets and are deriving a substantial premium from those countries in respect of various classes of insurance.  In some cases, however, they found that they were prohibited from doing business in some foreign countries because the Governments of those countries refused them permission on the grounds that companies registered in those countries were not permitted to do business here. The Association of Irish Insurance Companies approached the Government to have the law amended so as to permit the granting of licences to foreign companies to do business here under reciprocal arrangements where the Irish companies were satisfied that it would be in their interests to grant that permission to operate here.  It is intended in all such cases to consult with the Irish insurance companies on this matter of giving licences to foreign companies to operate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been advocating the introduction of some system of <Col N="502" /> export credits for a great many years and therefore I welcome this Bill.  I confess, however, that I am somewhat disappointed, if I understand the Minister correctly, because he gave me the impression that the whole scheme is intended to deal only with the dollar markets.  This, of course, is an enabling Bill and I can quite readily understand that the Minister is not in a position to give us all the details at the moment.  I do not know exactly what the scheme will be, but as far as the principle of the Bill is concerned, I welcome it and I think the House should unanimously support it.</P>
      <P>I do not think that Irish manufacturers should be left in relation to markets other than the dollar markets in the inferior position in which they have been for many years as compared with their British competitors.  I think that generally in the matter of extension of exports most manufacturers have found that the total amount of loss taken over a number of years has not proved to be great and I think that has been the experience of the British guarantee State scheme; but the big danger is that if an Irish company has to sell £40,000 or £50,000 worth of goods they find that in an order of that size their big trouble is not in credit restrictions or import licences or political risks, but in the fact that they may have to lie out of their capital for nine, 12 or 18 months.  That is the real danger and one of the big handicaps from which firms proposing to export to foreign markets suffer.</P>
      <P>I think I have made it quite clear that as far as the latter part of the scheme refers to the operation of Córas Tráchtála it is reasonable that it should deal with the dollar markets, but so far as the general credit export scheme is concerned, I hope the Government will reconsider the whole matter and make provision for exports to other markets.  There are considerable possibilities in these other markets and it would be quite a mistake not to take advantage of them and to assume that only the dollar markets are worth catering for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made reference to commercial and political risks, but I think he will find difficulty in making a clear <Col N="503" /> distinction between these two.  I do not see how these risks can be distinguished between, and I think they should be catered for under one scheme.</P>
    <P>As far as the latter part of the Bill and the change in the 1936 Act are concerned, I would be glad if the Minister would indicate if it is proposed to have any arrangements made for vehicle owners who wish to have mutual insurance.</P>
    <P>As far as the first part of the Bill is concerned, obviously it has nothing to do with that matter at all.  I presume it is being proposed because this Bill does not, incidentally, amend the 1936 Act, and most of us, without expressing any opinion at all, would be very much interested under present conditions in a scheme by which vehicle owners, in so far as they are only insuring their own cars and property, might introduce mutual insurance.  I would not even look at this scheme if it were not quite clear in the circular I received that it must be carried out by ordinary insurance.  Whether it could be brought in under the Bill or not I have an open mind, but I am quite sure that these people have a <i>bona fide</i> interest in the matter, and I ask the Minister to say a word or two when he is replying, as to its feasibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickSummerfield" hpid="Mr. Summerfield Mr. Summerfield">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support this Bill.  I have not the slightest doubt at all that all the interests who are doing at present, or hope to do, an export trade, see in it the removal of serious obstacles to their efforts.  I join with Senator Douglas in hoping that while the Bill will, perhaps quite wisely, concentrate on the dollar market, it will not exclude the other markets that manufacturers in this country, from my own knowledge, are trying to get into.  The inability of Irish interests to get into certain markets is not due to any lack of effort on their part; it is due to the fact that there are very few markets in the world where we can send goods because of barriers set up by various Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the firms doing an export trade to-day are doing it on limited <Col N="504" /> resources.  These are even more limited than formerly because of the recently introduced very high interest on bank overdrafts.  Now, under the provisions of this Bill, they can insure against risks which otherwise they would have been unable to take, so that the Bill will give a fillip to the export trade and perhaps permit of the export of certain commodities which at present are confined to the domestic market.</P>
    <P>I join with Senator Douglas in his references to the circular which every member of the Oireachtas received from people who want to see that motor owners, who wish to develop a scheme of mutual insurance for themselves, be permitted to do so.  I heartily agree that nothing should be done which would permit of a breach of the covenant necessary for private insurance.  With a huge number of vehicles of all kinds on the road, it is of the utmost importance that everybody using the road shall be fully protected and enabled to get adequate compensation if, in fact, they are involved in an accident.  The circular indicated that those sponsoring the suggestion only envisage taking care of non third-party risks.  Perhaps the Minister will give an indication of whether he has given any consideration to the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senators Douglas and Summerfield, I am not raising any objection.  In fact, I am supporting the Bill, but I also want to press the Minister with regard to this idea of mutual insurance.  I was disappointed that the Minister did not make reference to the matter in his opening speech.  As I understand the position, the people interested in forming an association which would carry out this mutual insurance of non-third-party risks in connection with vehicles had put this proposition before the Minister and his Department and were informed that the matter was receiving consideration. I feel sure it was an oversight on the part of the Minister that he did not make some reference to that when he was making his opening statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I broach the matter in this manner is that I do not want any Senator to suggest that we should take <Col N="505" /> all the stages of this Bill to-day, because if this particular matter is not receiving consideration, and particularly is not receiving favourable consideration, from the Minister or his advisers, I intend to seek an opportunity to put down an amendment so that the matter can be discussed in more detail.  I do not want to go into details at this stage, except to say that it does seem that under Section 12 of the 1936 Act the principle of encouraging associations to insure on the mutual principle has been established.  The right of the Minister to give licences to such associations in the case of fire risk, for instance, for property owners, is given in Section 12 of the 1936 Act. In fact, it is not merely a right of the Minister; my recollection of the 1936 Act is that in certain circumstances it would be mandatory on the Minister to issue licences.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether Section 12 of the Act has ever been operated or if, in fact, such licences ever have been issued, but Section 12, in any event, does at least establish the principle that in certain circumstances people may band together and carry out some method of mutual insurance.</P>
    <P>Now, in connection with the references made by Senators Douglas and Summerfield regarding motor vehicle owners, the suggestion is merely that the principle already enshrined in Section 12 of the Act in so far as the owners of property or employers are concerned should now be extended by this amending Bill to deal with the owners of motor vehicles who want to band themselves into an association to cover themselves against risk of loss in respect of their own vehicles.  It has been made quite clear both by Senators Douglas and Summerfield that there is no suggestion whatever that the ordinary obligations to insure against third party risks, that is, damaging other people's property, are being interfered with at all.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to give the matter very serious consideration, and if he does not propose to put down an amendment for the Committee Stage by which this matter might be met, I want to say that an amendment will be put down, if it is in order, so that we <Col N="506" /> can at least give the matter more detailed consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.F. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this Bill, but I wish to repeat what Senator Douglas has mentioned, that it is merely an enabling Bill.  This Bill, if I am right, will not impose any obligation on the Minister to give guarantees.  It will merely enable him to do so if he thinks he should.  Unless the Minister acts in accordance with the powers which would be given him by the Bill, there is nothing we or any persons concerned in the export trade could do to force him to give assistance.</P>
      <P>In passing a Bill of this kind, merely an enabling Bill, and in the form in which Section 2 is drafted, we are giving the Minister exceedingly wide powers.  We are putting him in the position that he may in a bad case give a guarantee and may in a good case refuse to give a guarantee or give any help.  I think that we should think very carefully before we put a Minister into a position where he may or may not and quite capriciously refuse to give assistance in a case where assistance is very properly deserved.</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear that I am not suggesting for a moment that the Minister for Industry and Commerce would act in any way other than in a perfectly fair way.  I think we should consider very carefully before we give the Minister the powers and the rights that would be given to him by Section 2 of this Bill without in any way at the same time imposing an obligation on him to give assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand the Bill, Section 2, if passed, will be worked in this way. The Minister will accept advice from Córas Tráchtála in regard to the giving of guarantees.  We have been told &mdash;the Minister has been quite clear about this&mdash;that at the present time at any rate only dollar export trade will be concerned.  He has made, it quite clear that at any time, perhaps, trade with the sterling area may also be guaranteed.  I would repeat what has been said before that it would be undesirable that we should allow people to think that we are concerned only with dollar export trade. I am sure it is very important that we <Col N="507" /> should concern ourselves very earnestly with that trade, but I think we must not forget that we have sources of trade in the sterling area and in the non-sterling area which is a non-dollar market.</P>
    <P>We should not concern ourselves&mdash; and I would like to impress upon the Minister that he should not concern himself&mdash;too strictly with restricting exporters mainly in regard to the dollar market.  We should be concerned with our trade elsewhere in England and other European countries.  Section 2 makes provision in regard to people engaged in a business or profession of export.  Perhaps, the Minister would tell us exactly in what connection he thinks of profession in this section.  It says that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister may make arrangements for giving to, or for the benefit of, persons carrying on a business or profession in the State, guarantees, in connection with the export, manufacture, treatment or distribution of goods&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should have thought that we would be concerned only in the giving of guarantees in respect to the export and distribution of goods when exported and not for manufacture and treatment here at the source of origin.  Perhaps, the Minister will give us some assistance on that.</P>
    <P>In regard to the point raised as to the amendment of Section 12 of the Insurance Act of 1936, I have read these documents.  I am sure that most if not all of us have received a copy of the Act.  I have a perfectly open mind on the points that have been put forward.  Certainly it would seem to me that the Minister should tell us something as to his view when the matter is raised.  It may be, indeed, that he should give this power.  If he does give this power I have the feeling that nobody will ever seek to apply to be given power to issue that particular form of insurance.  Certainly those who would combine for that assurance can have no claim to sympathy should their organisation fail.  They will be a mutual insurance society and will have nobody but themselves to blame should <Col N="508" /> their society fail.  Therefore, the Minister will have no responsibility should he put into the Act an obligation on him to give that particular certificate to people that carry on that form of insurance.</P>
    <P>I would say that we should consider very carefully what power we are giving the Minister in Section 2.  We are empowering the Minister to give that person or body whom he may think fit to receive a guarantee to carry on his export trade and at the same time we are not asking him to take on the obligation of giving that assistance. We are giving him the right to do exactly as he wishes without on the other hand imposing any obligation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like the other speakers, welcome this Bill.  It is as it were a step-child of the Dollar Export Board of which I had the honour to be a member.  As that board dealt purely with hard currency problems, it is quite natural that its proposals would be confined to the dollar area.  I think the Minister will remember that the Federation of Irish Manufacturers sent him a memorandum some years ago covering the point in relation to soft and hard currency insurance risks and also covering the suggestion for the creation of an export credit corporation.  This latter proposal is something which I should have liked to see coming before us together with this Bill because they are complementary to each other.  The Bill does not fill the requirements that would be laid down under such an export corporation but, such as it is, we welcome it.  I should like to reinforce the arguments put forward by Senators Douglas and Summerfield that this Bill should apply to areas other than the dollar areas because it will be quite a long time before we will be in a position to develop the dollar area to the extent we would like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder whether the amount of the guarantee is effective at any particular time?  The total amount is limited to £2,000,000.  I can visualise the position arising when, at any given time, the amount needed for insurance will be greater than £2,000,000.  If this is a risk against political liability, as apart from commercial risk, we shall <Col N="509" /> have to have two sets of premiums to pay.  I am not quite clear as to what the exporter will have to pay in regard to the liability which the Minister takes on his behalf.  At the moment the Government comes along and says to the exporting public: &ldquo;We are prepared to guarantee you against political liability up to the limit of £2,000,000.&rdquo;  Beyond what is contained in sub-section (7) of Section 2 I do not see it stated how a premium is to be paid, who is to pay it and to whom it is to be paid.  If there is such a premium to be paid for a political risk I hope it will not affect the business sales content of the exported article so as to preclude it from the market.  If you are paying a premium on a political as well as a commercial risk it would be very high.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to hear the Minister talk about insurance against promotional risks.  That is one of the propositions that was made by the Dollar Export Board.  While I agree with the whole idea behind it, I do not see how it is going to work out nor do I see how it applies at all in this Bill.  The idea was that if a firm was enterprising enough to seek a foreign market it would be recompensed for any losses made in research in that foreign market.  Candidly, I fail to find in this Bill where such is stated, unless it may be that the Minister has powers himself to decide that such a risk is of the nature of an insurance risk and that consequently it should be treated as such and the cost should be repayable to the promoter.  But that is not stated exactly in the Bill, and I would like to hear more on the point.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Reilly that this Bill gives extraordinary powers to Ministers, but it does not seem that it is giving more extraordinary powers than were given before to other Ministers. I do not see who could make a decision on Section 2 except the Minister. We must have faith that in so far as the Minister can determine&mdash;and he is fallible, as we all are&mdash;he will decide in a fair way.  The House cannot lay down in a statute all the conditions governing an application which the Minister might or might not reject. I am sure Senator O'Reilly as a <Col N="510" /> lawyer will agree that it would be impossible to draft a Bill covering all the points coming under Section 2.</P>
    <P>It has been the habit of both Houses to give Ministers extraordinary powers &mdash;I am not speaking now on a political level; I do not care what Government is in power&mdash;to define the rights and wrongs of a case.  The Minister will not misunderstand me, as it is a matter of principle, and there is nothing personal in it.  In so far as powers of decision have been given to Ministers under various Acts, what is the use of quarrelling about it now?</P>
    <P>Would the Minister let me know, if there is a premium for a political risk, what it would roughly amount to, how it would affect the selling price of the article and what proportion it would bear to the cost; and if he could tell me the same for the commercial risk?</P>
    <P>Again, I would like to know if the Minister considers the £2,000,000 sufficient, or if he would ask for a larger amount, and if he would give consideration to the questions raised by Senator Douglas about the outside dollar areas.</P>
    <P>As regards the case Senator Summerfield and Senator Douglas mentioned, an insurance scheme for motorists, it seems to me that these people just want to insure their cars for a limited number of risks, and I understand that outside those risks other insurance companies are prepared to take on third party insurance at a reduced rate, which is an important point.  I understand that motor insurance firms are losing on the very risks which this group is asking powers to create a company for and that they are not losing as much on third party.  If that is so, the Minister might give these persons who want to lose money an opportunity to do so.  I do not see how it could be otherwise under Section 12.</P>
    <P>This is the first effort by any Government here to make a serious gesture towards firms who want to develop an export trade, and I am quite certain that not alone will Senators appreciate this insurance proposal, but that the manufacturing community will avail of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to welcome the Bill, having had some experience as <Col N="511" /> a member of the Irish Fresh Meat Export Committee in exporting to both dollar and sterling areas.  I may say that the sterling area tends to show some improvement as a market and sterling, as a currency, has shown increased strength during the last year or two.  I would ask the Minister not to put off the question of covering risk to the sterling area if good sterling markets could be got for this country. Other competing countries may strengthen their position in the sterling market, and we may find, when it is desirable to approach this market, that we have foreign companies in a much stronger position.</P>
      <P>I was very interested in many of the things the Minister has said.  I presume that by political risk he means the imposition of quotas and embargoes and increased tariffs that may not be foreseen when these goods are being prepared or processed for export.  There is another risk I would ask the Minister to consider doing something about&mdash;this applies particularly to the export of meat&mdash;namely, the disease risk.  Certain countries, particularly the United States, are very much afraid of disease, such as foot-and-mouth disease, and if there is any suggestion or suspicion that anything like that appertains to a country like Ireland, they would probably put an embargo on immediately. It would be necessary to have that point clarified, to see if it is covered by what the Minister describes as a political risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point which I think the Minister ought to cover&mdash;it is the period in which these goods are being manufactured or processed for export. He should be able to cover that.  By the time these goods are finally manufactured, the firm may find it impossible to export them.  I presume that the Minister, in conjunction with Córas Tráchtála, is covering goods leaving an Irish port for a foreign port; but losses may be involved in the manufacturing or processing of these goods and they may have to be diverted at a loss to another country at a later stage.  While the Minister is putting this Bill through the House, if he thinks there are any points in the <Col N="512" /> questions I have raised which would be of help to exporters, I would ask him to consider putting in a sub-section covering them.</P>
    <P>With regard to mutual insurance, if there are certain groups of individuals who would like to engage in mutual insurance, the Minister should give them any assistance he can.  It is a desirable thing, and if they can run it efficiently and can reduce overhead costs, it is all to the advantage of business.  Insurance, particularly in distributing trades, is rather a heavy item, and it is tending to become a greater overhead than it was some years ago.  If these people by their own efforts can in any way reduce the burden even on their own businesses, they will be doing something to help reduce the overheads and so in some way help to reduce the cost of living.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Reilly said this is an enabling Bill, but I do not think he read very carefully the wording of Section 2 to ascertain what it enables the Minister to do.  It enables the Minister to make arrangements for giving to persons carrying on business in the State guarantees in connection with the export of goods and sub-section (2) makes it clear that this may include agreements with insurance companies for the reinsurance of guarantees given by them.  There is certainly no provision there, nor is it intended there should be, enabling the Minister to decide to whom insurance cover should be given.</P>
      <P>The Bill enables the Minister to make arrangements with insurance companies under which they will give insurance cover against political risks to exporters to dollar markets and reinsure these risks with him.  The position will be that anybody desiring to get that type of insurance cover will go to this group of insurance companies and negotiate with them.  The insurance companies will reinsure the risks with the Minister and remit to him a proportion&mdash;90 per cent. or whatever it may be&mdash;of the premium income.  So far as commercial risks are concerned, the risk will be carried by the insurance companies entirely and the premiums will be fixed and retained by them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister expect that they will be at a similar rate to those prevailing elsewhere?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should think so.  The Senator appreciates that, in Britain, for example, they have from time to time varied the rate according to the circumstances prevailing in particular external markets and sometimes apparently for the purpose of discouraging people from exporting goods to particular markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And presumably the same will be done here.  The position will be that both types of insurance cover will be given by the insurance companies&mdash;one on their behalf and at premiums fixed by them and the other, as agents for the Minister, or at least under an arrangement by which they can underwrite the risks with the Minister, at premiums to be fixed by the Minister.  The schemes have not been worked out in detail.  In so far as the extent to which political risks will be covered, I think it is reasonable to say that the scheme will provide for covering every type of risk that experience shows exporters want to have covered.  Initially, the scheme will be extended to cover the risks which our experience and the experience of Córas Tráchtála show it to be necessary to provide against, but, as time goes on and as new circumstances arise, the scheme can be extended to cover other risks as well.</P>
      <P>May I explain also that it is not intended that insurance cover will be available to manufacturers only?  It will be available to any person undertaking the business of trading in goods to dollar markets and the particular wording of sub-section (2) is intended to cover not merely an insurance scheme against the political risks of exporters but also the joint venture arrangement to which I have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have considerable sympathy with the point of view expressed by some Senators that the scheme should not be confined, even in its initial stages, to dollar markets.  Nevertheless, it would be, I think, difficult to initiate <Col N="514" /> the scheme generally at present.  I doubt if it will ever be practicable to have such a scheme in respect of trade with Great Britain, or ever necessary, and it is far better to start off on the basis of confining it to dollar markets, and to add other countries as the need becomes apparent and as other possibilities open up.  It is because we contemplate the possibility of the scheme being ultimately extended to other markets that the Bill has been framed in its present form so that the extension can be effected without further legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Douglas mentioned the possibility of difficulty arising in distinguishing between commercial and political risks as I have defined them. So far as I am concerned, that distinction will be made very largely by the insurance companies.  Anything they are prepared to cover themselves, they will be free to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>They never take anything that they can put on somebody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They have indicated a reluctance to insure against political risks, mainly, I should imagine, because they cannot themselves assess how great these risks may be and, therefore, in respect of these risks, they want reinsurance with the Government.  May I say also that that is the attitude of insurance companies in almost every country?  If, however, they want to extend the area covered by their own insurance scheme, there would be no difficulty, so far as the Government are concerned.  If they were prepared to give insurance on their own behalf against political risks, the Government would not have to come in at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>What I really had in mind was the difficulty of deciding, in the case of a firm which cannot get currency, whether it was entirely due to the political action of the Government or to a fault on the part of the firm concerned, and of seeing that the exporter was covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In every case, the aim will be to protect the firm here against <Col N="515" /> loss and then to use all the diplomatic and other means open to us to salvage the amount involved.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Donnell asked if the £2,000,000 limit fixed in the Bill was not too low.  I do not think it is.  The Bill provides that the aggregate amount of guarantees outstanding at any one time must not exceed £2,000,000.  That would cover a very substantial amount of business&mdash;much more than we are doing at present.  The view, however, is that if there is such a considerable extension of business that the limit proves too low, it would be as well to come back to the Oireachtas with amending legislation and report that situation.</P>
      <P>I have seen this circular sent to Senators about a scheme for mutual insurance of motor-car owners against risks other than third party risks.  It is true that the Act of 1936 made possible the granting of licences to mutual insurance associations of two kinds&mdash;an association of property owners insuring themselves against fire and of employers insuring themselves against employers' liability.  I do not know if the House is aware of our experience in respect of such associations. There were two&mdash;one in respect of mutual fire association and one for mutual employers' liability&mdash; associations which failed with serious repercussions, and so far as the employers' liability association is concerned, they are not finished yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my recollection that the provision was made in the Act of 1936 because these associations existed at the time.  The general intention of the Act was to provide that no body could embark on this business of insurance against fire, employers' liability or other risk, unless they had a minimum subscribed capital of £100,000 and had made a deposit in the High Court of the prescribed amount as a final guarantee to the people effecting insurance with them that their claims could be met.  These two associations to which I have referred were in existence at the time, and they were exempted from this provision and they failed.  On that account, I will be slow <Col N="516" /> to consider an extension of the Bill to cover any mutual insurance association without very careful examination.</P>
    <P>I am, if anything, still further intimidated by Senator O'Donnell's assumption that this association is going to take off insurance companies a losing end of their business.  I just do not believe that&mdash;the catch there is too obvious.  It is not untrue to say that many mutual insurance associations are run for the benefit of their officials, and, before we extend the Act to permit of a new type coming in, we should examine it carefully.  I do not want to be taken as prejudging the proposal made.  I feel that we should consider it carefully and give the Association of Insurance Companies ample opportunity of expressing their views on it, and that, if we are going to extend the law in that regard, we should do it as a separate measure. While in no sense indicating a final decision on the matter, I must say that I would resist a proposal to rush through an amendment to the 1936 Act at this stage in this Bill.  The matter has not been examined nearly enough, nor have all the interests been given an opportunity of expressing their views upon it.</P>
    <P>It was not by reason of an oversight that I did not refer to the matter in introducing the Bill.  I was not aware of the intention of Senators to raise it, although I knew they had been canvassed on behalf of those promoters connected with the proposed association.  That is all I have to say.  We have had certain experience arising out of the 1936 Act which would warn us to go cautiously.  The proposal has to be examined very carefully in the light of possible implications and insurance companies must be given ample time to express their views.  On that account I would urge the Seanad not to agree to amend the 1936 Act which itself was framed very carefully after a great deal of deliberation and which took a long time to pass through the Dáil and certainly not to amend it by a casual provision in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  It gives me great pleasure to be in a position to move this Private Bill because since my first acquaintance with local bodies over 30 years ago, this question of the inability of local bodies to repair certain roads has been a great source of discontent and hardship to many people in rural districts.  I have no doubt whatever that the short little Bill which is designed to enable local bodies to upkeep certain roads not regarded as public roads but roads of local utility will do a great deal of good for the Irish countryside.</P>
      <P>While the necessity for this Bill is not so apparent in the Midlands and parts of southern Ireland, in the West of Ireland, the north-west and southwest particularly, we have numerous roads not now classed as public roads, and local bodies have tried for many years to repair such roadways.  In County Roscommon, where I come from, we did for a number of years decide that certain roads were roads of public utility.  For a number of years local government auditors allowed it to pass, but then after several years an Order came along which said that the county managers should be surcharged for making these roads.  The result in one year was that £4,000 was added for that work, and form that time none of the roads has been repaired because managers have been afraid to do this work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This short Bill, introduced by a Deputy from County Roscommon, Deputy McQuillan, has already got the approval of the Minister for Local Government, so that I do not think there should be any hesitation on the part of the Seanad in accepting this measure.  It is a simple measure, enabling local bodies to declare certain existing roads to be roads of public utility.  The great objection will be that it may entail a good deal of extra expenditure; that may be, but the people who live on these by-roads are surely entitled&mdash;they pay their share in taxation for the roads&mdash;to have provision made for the roadways over <Col N="518" /> which they have to travel.  I am quite certain that, although it may mean some extra expenditure by local bodies, they will be careful as to what roads they will declare to be public roads. That will be their responsibility, but I know local bodies and I do not think there is any danger they will overwhelm ratepayers with a great burden of taxation.</P>
    <P>Assuming the Seanad adopts the Bill it will, even in one year, be of great benefit to the people in backward areas.  We hear a great deal of talk about the flight from the land and, undoubtedly, the hardship which people in backward districts undergo has forced many persons to leave holdings and emigrate.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure the Seanad, with its usual generosity and sense of fair play, will adopt this measure.  It is a private Bill and, as far as I am concerned, it deals with a matter which I have always advocated.  I know the hardships which people in backward districts have to go through and I feel certain that the Seanad will approve of this measure.</P>

Over the years the maintenance of these roads has become the responsibility of the ratepayers and in a good many cases the roads are a danger for the class of traffic for which they are used.  I trust that the Seanad will have no objection to accepting the proposal made by Senator O'Rourke.</P>

      <P>This Bill, which was initiated by Deputy McQuillan in the Dáil, will be welcomed by most representatives and particularly by those from rural areas, because it proposes to do something which we have all been looking forward to for a great many years.  The whole question of cul-de-sac roads has been a headache to most of us for many years.  In fact, it has been a headache since the passing of the 1925 Act, which took these roads from the authority of the county councils.  Whether or not that was a wise step at the time, it was a fact that up to the passing of the 1925 Act these culs-de-sac were mainly leading to the houses and lands of the landlord classes.  The Government then wisely decided that they should no longer be the responsibility of the county councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="520" /> At the time that they placed the cul-de-sac roads and the responsibility for their maintenance on the landed classes they created a problem for other people who lived in these culs-de-sac.  That position had continued throughout the years and it became a greater problem still when land was divided by the Land Commission and the majority of those who got the lands were then placed in the position of having to reach their homes and the land over the cul-de-sac roads.  In certain cases when the Land Commission were making these cul-de-sac roads they could easily have carried them on to make them link or connecting roads which would have come under the maintenance of the county councils, but they did not do so.  The result was that the people who got the land were burdened with fairly high valuations and high rates and got very little return for the rates they were paying because their cul-de-sac roads did not come within the road maintenance system.</P>
    <P>On many occasions efforts were made to bring about a change in that condition, but these people had to continue paying their rates and seeing their neighbours who were living on the county council roads enjoying the benefits of them.  The councils could undertake the maintenance and care of link or connecting roads but they could not do it with cul-de-sac roads and that problem has remained until the present time.  Whether this Bill is going to meet that situation remains to be seen. It has, however, done one good thing and that is that it has taken away that part of the 1925 Act which prevented the local authorities from taking over these roads.</P>
    <P>At the same time we have to bear in mind that the maintenance of these roads will put a heavy burden on the local authorities, and that is the objection I have to the Bill.  The local authorities are already overburdened and in my own county last year there was a rate of 36/- in the £ and this year it is quite likely that it will be 37/6 if they have to take over the roads as provided for under this Bill. That would place them in the position of imposing rates which would be <Col N="521" /> beyond payment at all.  I know the people on these roads are entitled to the same benefits as their more fortunate neighbours living on the county council roads, but at the same time it is questionable whether they are prepared to pay the increased rates which the provisions of this Bill might cause.</P>
    <P>It is amazing how much money can be involved when it comes to the question of construction and maintenance of cul-de-sac roads.  We have seen that time and again when it came to a question of asking for grants for the repair of such roads and very often when the applicant saw the size of the grant compared with the full cost he was scared of the idea of the work. The amount of the money which the county councils would have to provide in the rates for the construction of these roads would be quite sizeable and the return from 1/- or 2/6 in the £ on the rates would not provide for a very big mileage.  The county councils would have to construct foundations for these roads, many of which have not been touched for over 50 years.</P>
    <P>That is one of the problems I see. If the Government will agree to some arrangement whereby they could pay a certain percentage towards the construction of these roads as well as maintenance, it would ease very much the burden on the ratepayers who are being asked at the present time to foot the greater percentage of the bill.</P>
    <P>This matter was approached by the Mayo County Council some time ago when they sent a deputation to the Government.  They got a sympathetic hearing to their suggestion that the Government should pay a percentage of the cost of these roads each year, but later the council received a letter from the Minister for Finance saying that until Section 25 of the 1925 Act was taken away or modified he had no power to deal with the matter in any way.</P>
    <P>Last year at the General Council of County Councils, a body of which other Senators besides myself are members, this problem was raised again, as in many years past.  The representatives of practically every county there were unanimous, first, that something should be done about it at this stage and that <Col N="522" /> the people living on those roads were entitled to the benefits enjoyed by people who were living at the side of the county council roads.  They were practically all unanimous also that the burden should be made as light as possible on the already overburdened ratepayers.  A suggestion was put forward from representatives of upwards of a dozen county councils that legislation should be introduced whereby the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance would empower the county councils to meet the applicants' portion of the contribution and to do the roads under the rural improvements scheme.</P>
    <P>The idea was to introduce a Bill to enable each county to levy 1/- in the £ and collect £8,000 or £10,000 or perhaps £12,000 and to hold that fund practically entirely for the construction of those roads.  Maintenance was not asked for because we felt it would be possible to have a rotational scheme of seven years so that at the end of that time practically all cul-de-sac roads in need of construction would be constructed, and then the councils would be able to reconstruct the first roads at much less cost.  Everybody knows that it is far easier to reconstruct roads repaired seven years previously than to put a foundation on a road that has not been touched for over 50 years.</P>
    <P>That was our idea and before this Bill goes through I propose to put down an amendment to see if it is possible to get some help for the ordinary ratepayers rather than throw practically the entire burden of these cul-de-sac roads on them.</P>
    <P>I will say this much in favour of this Bill and of the Deputy who introduced it: it is a Bill which we all welcome. It is an opening up of something that was an eye-sore over a considerable number of years and is even more so now because we have got more modern in our methods.  People who have mechanised farms along those cul-de-sac roads are just as entitled to have a good road leading to their doors as anybody else.</P>
    <P>My only fear is that this measure will come as too much of a burden on the ratepayers who are already overburdened in every county in the <Col N="523" /> Twenty-Six Counties.  The people on all sides grumble.  Representatives of the General Council of County Councils say that the ratepayers can stand no more.  This year every county has increased the rates to meet the increases under all the different headings and it is a bit too much now to ask councillors and ratepayers to meet the entire cost of those roads.  That is the fear I have&mdash;that the good intended by this Bill will not be achieved.  I would much prefer to see a Bill introduced whereby a certain burden would be placed on the State for the construction of those roads, even if the entire maintenance cost would be left to the county councils afterwards.  We know that a mile of roadway leading into a group of houses will cost much less in maintenance than a mile of roadway that is a link road, the property of the county council.</P>
    <P>At any rate I will try to amend the Bill.  I am doing it in all sincerity because my fear is that this will be too big a burden for councils all over Ireland to accept.  We are told, of course, that there is no obligation on the councils, that they can accept or throw it out.  But we all know that it is something that is wanted in every county.  I think it would be better if we approached this matter properly and got some financial assistance from the State other than that which they will give us in the ordinary course for maintenance of our roads.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. P. O'Reilly Mr. P. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret very much that I have not the enthusiasm for this measure that has been shown by Senators O'Rourke and Lynch, my neighbours from Roscommon.  Indeed, we are inclined to think that this is, in fact, a Roscommon Bill.  Like Senator Commons, I am a bit fearful of the results of this measure.  The position, as far as I know, is that prior to the 1925 Act the local road authorities were quite free to declare any cul-de-sac road to be a county road, and to maintain it as such.  It was under the 1925 Act that that power was taken away, as far as I know.  But when the county councils had that authority they did not display any great desire to take <Col N="524" /> over such roads.  Perhaps that was because people, before the 1925 Act came into operation, regarded those cul-de-sac roads as private property; four or five or six or even two people travelling those roads regarded them as a common right of way and would have objected to the local authority taking away what they regarded as a right of way or an easement over those roads.</P>
      <P>I am prepared to agree that there is something in the point made by Senator Commons in so far as you may be removing private rights.  This measure, I think, means that all boreens can become the responsibility of the local authority.  I argue that those roads are private roads in many cases, owned by the people who have the right of way across them and by nobody else, and I think those people, if they wished, could object to the county council invading their territory.  Having regard to the outlook in this, and, I suppose in every other country in the world, I do not suppose that that is likely to happen.  But the 1925 Act laid down the principle that a road to be declared a county road would have to join existing county roads and be at least 11 feet in the clear.  I may be wrong&mdash;I am quoting from memory&mdash; but I think that principle is laid down in the 1925 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would it ever happen&mdash;I am not old enough to know&mdash;that there was a demand from county councils which brought about the position that this was laid down?  As I say, I can offer no opinion on that.  The Board of Works, under the Special Employment Schemes Office, did a good job of work over the years and spent more, in my opinion, than county councils could afford to spend to alleviate the position of those living in long boreens or cul-de-sac roads, but the roads were still not public roads.  They were private roads, owned by the people who had the right to go along them.  Anybody who has anything to do with the activities of the Board of Works and the Special Employment Schemes Office will have to admit that the money spent on road reconstruction by the Special Employment Schemes Office was much more than that spent by any county council acting as a road <Col N="525" /> authority in maintaining a county road.</P>
    <P>In my county the average we spent on county roads would be 1/- to 2/- a perch, and because of the bad condition into which the cul-de-sac roads were allowed to go by their owners, the cost of reconstruction of these roads would be a heavy burden on county councils.  When the county council takes over a road under the 1925 Act it is empowered under Section 25 to maintain that road&mdash; whatever about the reconstruction. I am putting another viewpoint. It is not that I am against the Bill, because I am not; but, having regard to the many other services for which local authorities and county councils are responsible, I wonder if county councils are in a position to raise still further revenue to give this added service since there is a fair attempt already to give that service by the Board of Works.</P>
    <P>What will happen?  I think it will relieve the Board of Works and the central authority of the responsibility they have taken on themselves.  We are going to take it from them.  We are going to take that responsibility over without having examined what it will cost.  That is my opinion.  It is not that I am against the Bill.  It seems lovely on paper, but I am afraid that in practice it will be just slightly different. In some counties you have long cul-de-sac roads.  That is typical of West Cavan.  You have the roads joining existing county roads such as in Leitrim, Roscommon, Mayo or West Cavan.  Once we take this power there will be a clamour for this additional service.  How can a local authority justify taking one road and not another?  Will there be a question of patronage in this regard?  Who will be the determining authority unless authority is vested in the county engineer to take the best or the worst? It would be quite impossible for county councils to take over all those roads at the one time, construct them and then maintain them if they were properly constructed.  It might be possible to maintain them for 2/- a perch, but without that reconstruction I could see the cost for that additional service working out in <Col N="526" /> the manner suggested by Senator Commons.</P>
    <P>Since that aspect has been raised, I would like members of this House who have considered that aspect to tell me what this will mean to the county councils.  This is still further vesting private rights in public authority.  I still maintain that those roads are private roads.  Once you remove from those people any responsibility for these roads you are destroying the very desirable principle of self-reliance in people.  Once those people have not to put up a very small fraction of the money under a rural improvement scheme the taxpayers generally are responsible.  In other words, the State or the local authorities are responsible for the construction and maintenance of those roads, and once the people who are responsible for those roads have not to put up anything for them they will have no regard for the roads.</P>

      <P>While I realise the good points in the Bill I am a bit uneasy about one thing that has been touched upon by some of the speakers and that is the extraordinary power given to the local authority.  Section 2 states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;a road authority is hereby empowered to declare any road which is not a public one to be a public road.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That really empowers them to declare any road to be a public road.  I wonder can we reconcile that with the preservation of private rights.  I really feel a <Col N="527" /> bit uneasy that a public authority will be empowered to take over anything that appears to be a public road. Surely there should also be power to &ldquo;depublicise&rdquo; a road, where it is decided, after the course of time, that it is no longer of great value and that the expense of its maintenance as a public road should not be continued?</P>
    <P>Thirdly, there seems to be no appeal under the Bill.  Someone with a claim to a private way may lose it as a result of a local authority's action.  Can he do nothing about it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielORourke" hpid="Mr. O'Rourke Mr. O'Rourke">

      <P>I want to ask the Minister how it is proposed to finance the Bill.  If it is not financed by the State, it will be a heavy burden on the rates. One of the greatest forces in local politics is that of having the neighbour's boreen repaired.  Strong pressure will be brought to bear on county councils to apply this Bill in full.  It will be a source of &ldquo;log rolling&rdquo;&mdash;to use an expression found in other countries&mdash;and it will be a case of &ldquo;I get my boreen and you get yours&rdquo;. It will be a fruitful cause of increasing rates.  One safeguard I suggest is that the Minister should limit the area of charge for cul-de-sac roads, as that would be one way of protecting the general body of ratepayers.  Otherwise, town dwellers may have to pay for miles of boreen roads for which they would never have any use.  We have received no estimate as to what this Bill will cost.  With the present outcry about high rates, we ought to move slowly and not at all until we safeguard the various interests concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHartney" hpid="Mr. Hartney Mr. Hartney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hartney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am convinced that the principles of this Bill are praiseworthy. In certain parts of the country&mdash;I speak as a ruralist&mdash;five or six farmers may live off a road maintained by public funds and may have contributed their share to it.  In days gone by those roads were considered <Col N="528" /> good enough, but there has been a big change in the past 30 years and rural conditions have been revolutionised. The road which was good enough for the donkey and cart will not do now for the lorry, which the people want.  The man on a public road can have a lorry any time he likes, but the poor man using a boreen &mdash;to whom the market is of the same importance and who may be a producer of even greater magnitude than the man with all the facilities&mdash;finds that the lorry cannot travel into him. The combine cannot travel in to cut his corn, the binder cannot come in, then the thresher cannot come in and he has to shift the corn for threshing, which means wastage and extra expense. The lorry cannot come in to take live stock, although he is paying as much for the public road.</P>
      <P>The expenses under this Bill cannot be colossal.  Roads are not going to be done on an expensive scale.  They will not be rolled, anyway.  They will not cost as much as one would think at first sight.  If the trenches on each side are cleared and the water taken off, it would not take much to put them in decent repair for ordinary traffic.  At the time of the Land Acts, maybe our grandfathers &ldquo;missed the bus&rdquo;: if they had paid the extra rent, the road would have been improved for them, but they said: &ldquo;Give us the use of the land as cheaply as possible and God is good for the roads.&rdquo;  If the people now do not want repairs done, no county council will force them.  There will be no interference with private ownership&mdash;that can be taken for granted.  We must realise that every public body, whether in Mayo, Cavan or Roscommon, is composed of sensible men, and if they do not think a certain road ought to be done they will not do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill will be of benefit to us, and we should be broadminded and think of what some men have been suffering over the years.  A few hundred pounds might make a road for seven or eight people and the maintenance cost would be light, as there would be no buses on it.  How many times has a public authority sunk a pump for seven or eight people, only to find no water, <Col N="529" /> or bad water, and the £300 or so has gone west, with no more about it?  You pay £2,000 or £3,000 to put in a water supply to a village and there are incidental costs afterwards.  When you start the road, however, you know when you put the spade to it that it is a job that can be done and you are taking no chances.  Is it a greater crime to give a poor man on the mountainside the benefit of modern conditions than to bring modern amenities to a small village?  Let the people fortunate enough to be on the side of the road put themselves in the position of other people for one week; then they would be loud in their demands to the county council.  It is only when you live in those conditions that you realise it.</P>
    <P>Let us not become such terribly conservative guardians of finance all at once, just because a couple of people on the mountainside have to be dealt with.  Everyone there has a right to object, and all protection is there for them, so, in all fairness, I am prepared to support the principles of the Bill, because I see the necessity for it without going outside my own county.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterLynch" hpid="Mr. P.T. Lynch Mr. P.T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. This matter of cul-de-sac roads has been a bone of contention for 20 years amongst members of the council of which I am a member.  The Minister, when Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, certainly did a lot for this class of road when he introduced the rural improvements scheme, under which many fine roads into the backward districts of County Roscommon were provided.  In that county, with a view to improving the conditions of the people living in the mountainy districts, the local body put aside 6d. or 7d. in the £ every year, but we have found that some of these culs-de-sac were constructed in the old Grand Jury days, and it was legal to do work on them.  They were made for the benefit of privileged people, but we found also that we could not legally spend money on a road into a remote but populous district because it was not done in the Grand Jury days. Many people in County Roscommon and County Leitrim have left these <Col N="530" /> counties because there was no accommodation road to enable them to get to the highway, and in many cases they had to plough knee-deep through fields to get to the main thoroughfare on their way to the town or to the church.</P>
      <P>The people in County Roscommon who spoke loudest about the Government which would not give them permission to attend to these roads, or to strike a rate for their maintenance, were the Clann na Talmhan Party. Members of the Party in the Dáil brought in a Private Bill dealing with the problem, but, having done some shadow-boxing, they ran away from it when they found it was going to be costly from the rates point of view.  It is time that the people in the backward districts who are paying for fine roads for the high-powered motor-cars of to-day were considered.  These people are paying for the making of footpaths, the provision of water supplies and many other amenities which people in the towns enjoy, while they have no way of getting to their own homes.</P>
      <P>The Bill is long overdue and its introduction is a credit to the man who has brought it forward.  The Minister also is to be congratulated for accepting it. I am surprised that a Senator like Senator O'Reilly, coming from County Leitrim, should oppose it.  I know parts of Leitrim and I know what the people there have to suffer in getting to the highway to go to Mass.  I also know parts of Cavan and I am sure that the people there will congratulate the Minister on his acceptance of the Bill.</P>

      <P>This is not my Bill&mdash;it was introduced by Deputy McQuillan&mdash;but it deals with a matter about which I have been worrying a lot over a long number of years.  I must confess that I could never see the problem as other people seemed to see it, but, at the same time, I was prepared to admit that the part of the country I knew best did not seem to have exactly the same problem as this Bill was designed to meet.  But not knowing what the problem was, I made my recommendation to the Government and the Government authorised me to accept the measure.  The Bill is not going to <Col N="531" /> have any of the implications which some Senators seem to fear.  County councils, especially since the introduction of the managerial system, have been asking for extended powers, for the right to make up their minds on certain matters, and they have complained vehemently from time to time because that right was denied them.</P>
      <P>Section 25 of the Act of 1925 gave certain power to a local authority to take over a particular type of road.  It could not take over a cul-de-sac road but could take over a road which was an accommodation road joining two county roads.  While the local authority could do this, it was a managerial function.  When Deputy McQuillan came forward with this measure, he said that all he was asking was that the law should be amended to enable a local body to deal with a cul-de-sac road in the same way as Section 25 authorised a council to deal with accommodation roads connecting two public roads.  He said: &ldquo;I am not talking about money or expense. These are matters which can be debated after and members of councils will make up their minds whether a particular road should be taken over or not.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As I say, this is not my Bill, but I thought the proposal was reasonable, and, in accepting it, I proceeded in Committee to amend the parent Act so as to provide that the decision to take over a road would be a decision made not by the county manager but by the members of the council who would have the responsibility of endeavouring to make provision for their reconditioning and maintenance after.  There is nothing to be feared on the financial side, other than what the members of a council may decide to commit themselves to.</P>

      <P>It appears to me that a number of Senators do not realise the facts of the situation.  Somebody said that the roads which it is intended should be taken over are private roads. I hold that they are not.  Many of them were dealt with by the county councils and later on a surcharge was imposed. I do not think this matter of interfering with the rights of private property <Col N="532" /> can arise, because, before a council can take over a road, they have to publish notice of their intention in two papers and any person who wants to object may do so.  I can assure the House, from 30 years' experience, that a council is not going to try to take over any road if there is objection to the proposal.  I quite agree that it is going to be expensive, but will Senator O'Reilly or any other Senator say that the people living in backward districts, who pay rates to maintain the roads in the county and pay taxes to maintain roads throughout the country, should not have a right of access to the public road as well as anybody else?  I thought Senator O'Reilly spoke more as the representative of Lord Leitrim than of the ordinary people of his county.</P>

      <P>This will involve a demand on the rates.  We are a mixed council in County Roscommon and, as a matter of fact, there is no Party with a majority, but we did recently decide to put aside in the contingency account about 6d. in the £ for these roads, proposing to do a certain number each year.  While Senator Commons' fears may be justified, no council will swamp itself with the upkeep of roads and they are sensible enough to decide wisely. There is no getting away from the fact, however, that these roads are not private in any way; they are repaired by the Board of Works, under the rural improvements scheme, or under the minor improvements scheme.</P>
      <P>There are a few areas in County Roscommon where the minor improvements scheme has done pretty well, but in the vast majority of cases there is no provision made by the Board of Works.  You are always met by this contention, when you put it up to these people doing work under a rural improvements scheme, that they are paying as much rates as other people in the county and they do not see why they should have to pay contributions which the people along the public roads have to make; nobody, of course, can disagree with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="533" /> The Minister has made his case fairly and I do not want to say anything more on this matter.  I was reared in a place which was reached by a cul-de-sac road.  Since I was a boy other roads were made in the area which are now public roads.  Surely, at this time of day, we are not going to leave thousands of people in the same position as their families have been over the generations.  There is enough money available, considering all the moneys which have been spent on grandiose schemes.  Surely there is no greater necessity than providing a means of access to the public roads for those people living in backward districts.  This Seanad would be failing in its duty if it did not accept this measure.</P>

      <P>This Bill is virtually identical with that introduced in the Dáil on 19th July, 1950, and referred (on Second Stage) to the Standing Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills on 6th December, 1950.  The Committee had not completed examination of the Bill when the Dáil was dissolved in May, 1951.  The original Bill thereupon lapsed and the opportunity has been taken, in preparing the present Bill for reintroduction, to adopt any suggestions recorded by the Committee for textual alterations to ensure closer identity of the substance with that of the original statutes.  The way is therefore clear for the new Joint Committee, if it should so decide, to take up the work of examining the Bill at the point where the former Committee left off.</P>

      <Col N="534" /> That it is expedient that the Fisheries (Consolidation) Bill, 1952, be referred to the Standing Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills and that a message be sent to the Dáil acquainting it accordingly.</P>
    <P>In moving that, I would like to pay this small tribute to the work done by the Committee in the previous Seanad. on this Bill.  Some of the Committee members are not Senators now and I should like to go on record our appreciation of the work achieved by them up to the time of dissolution.</P>
