      <P>There is a small query I would like to raise about the use of the words &ldquo;sea coast&rdquo;.  Normally, to the ordinary man, &ldquo;coast&rdquo; implies land rather than the water, but here the waters are defined as &ldquo;that part of the sea coast&rdquo;.  Is it the normal phrasing?  It seems to be a little odd to define the sea coast as waters and not the land bordering the waters, but I may be wrong.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to extend the normal life of local authorities from three to five years and to postpone accordingly to 1955 the local elections which, under existing law, are due to be held this year.</P>
      <P>The Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, which established county councils provided that the whole membership of each council should be elected in every third year.  By 1920 this system had been extended to borough and urban district councils and town commissioners, replacing the rotational system under which one-third of the members went out of office every year.</P>
      <P>The system of triennial elections has not been a success.  The undesirability of holding local elections at such frequent intervals has been recognised on all sides and has been demonstrated by the number of postponements since 1922.  The local elections due in 1922 were postponed four times and eventually held in 1925.  The elections due in 1926 were postponed to 1928.  The elections due in 1931 were postponed to 1934.  The elections due in 1937 were postponed three times and held finally in 1942.  And the elections due in 1948 were postponed to 1950.  In brief, the Oireachtas has found it necessary to postpone the so-called triennial elections no fewer than ten times since 1922.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="100" /> The result is that instead of having had ten local elections since 1922, we have had six, and the average interval between them has been something over five years instead of three years.</P>
    <P>The Local Elections Bill of 1947 proposed that the normal statutory period between local elections would correspond more closely with the real frequency of such elections, namely, every five years.  That Bill went through both Houses of the Oireachtas but two amendments made in this House had not been dealt with by the Dáil before the dissolution in 1948. That Bill proposed also&mdash;and logically &mdash;to postpone the elections of local authorities from 1948 to 1950.  After the change of Government in 1948 only the proposal to postpone the 1948 local elections was proceeded with. They were postponed to 1950 by the Local Elections Act, 1948.</P>
    <P>The County Councils General Council and the Association of Municipal Authorities have asked that legislation be enacted to provide that local elections be held quinquennially. Early this year the Executive Committee of the Association of Municipal Authorities asked me to have the election of members of local authorities deferred for two years, and I have received numerous other representations to the same effect.  I accepted these recommendations and this Bill is based on them.</P>
    <P>The Bill comprises 13 sections, the majority of which are consequential on the main provisions which are contained in Section 2.  Section 2 provides that an election of members of every local authority shall be held in 1955 and in every fifth year thereafter, and extends the term of office of existing members of local authorities to 1955. Local authorities are defined in Section 1 as county councils, county borough and borough corporations, urban district councils and town commissioners. The actual dates for elections to the local authorities will be fixed by the county councils and county borough councils under the provisions of the Local Elections Act, 1927, and the City Management Acts, and must lie in the period between the 23rd June and the 1st July in each local election year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="101" /> The section contains a saver for the Minister's present powers under Part IV of the Local Government Act, 1941, to fix dates for new elections in the case of local authorities whose members are removed from office.</P>
    <P>Some local authorities in anticipation of this Bill becoming law have omitted to make any arrangements for the holding of local elections this year between the 23rd June and the 1st July, as they are required to do by existing law, and instead they have appointed dates for annual or quarterly meetings in that period.  Sub-section (5) of this section was introduced by way of amendment in the Dáil to protect these authorities and their officials by making such omissions or actions lawful on the passing of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Sections 3, 4, 5 and 7 make consequential amendments in the Acts relating to school attendance committees, vocational education committees, committees of agriculture and harbour authorities, so that the years for elections or appointments to these bodies will correspond with the local election years.</P>
    <P>Section 6 amends Section 45 of the Local Government Act, 1941. Section 45 provides that where the members of a local authority are removed from office a new election of members shall be held at such times as the Minister may fix within three years from the date of removal (except where such period ends within one year of the date on which other local elections are due to be held, in which case the new election may be held on that date).  It is proposed to substitute five years for three years in Section 45.</P>
    <P>Section 8 will extend to 1955 the current period of office of members of bodies which are required by law to be appointed by a local authority following an election of the members of such authority.  It is designed to apply, for example, to boards of public assistance, joint drainage committees, and the Dublin Fever Hospital Board.  It will not apply to bodies whose appointment is not connected by law with the election of local authorities, for example, bodies which are appointed annually, such as joint mental hospital committees.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="102" /> Section 9 preserves from disqualification existing members of local authorities who may cease to be local government electors for the area which they represent between now and 1955.  Section 10 provides for the necessary adaptation of other statutes and statutory instruments to enable them to have effect in conformity with this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 11 was introduced by way of an amendment in the Dáil and is intended to get over a difficulty which may arise if a local authority has stood on the letter of the law as it is.  In a non-election year local authorities must fix a date between the 23rd June and 1st July for their annual or quarterly meetings&mdash;that is, the meeting at which the mayor or chairman is elected.  At the moment local authorities are under no obligation to arrange for this meeting but as soon as this Bill becomes law they will be required to do so.  As the time is so short it was considered desirable to provide that, where a council has not by the 23rd June fixed the date of its annual or quarterly meeting, the county secretary or the town clerk shall fix a convenient time for such meeting within the statutory period&mdash; which ends on the 1st July.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>As has been pointed out, the Bill before us does two things &mdash;it extends the life of local bodies for two years, as it postpones the election for two years, and it also extends the life of future bodies from three to five years.  The Minister gave a very interesting history of local elections, by which it appears that there was always a certain reluctance to hold local elections.  One wonders how there ever were elections at all, since all kinds of people were reluctant to have them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two parts of the Bill should be separated.  Before taking the decision, of which so many are in favour, of making the period of office five years, there should be an election.  The argument for a five-year period would also appear to carry with it the argument that before you embark on a change of that kind you should have an election to these local bodies.  The <Col N="103" /> Minister also mentioned some time ago that amendments are contemplated to the County Management Acts.  One would imagine we would have all these amendments together and then proceed to deal with the whole matter as one business.  Certainly, before the new five-year period is put into operation there should be an election.  Local bodies are of very great importance, spending a great deal of money and, as the Bill shows, they have a great many ramifications into education, agriculture and other spheres.  They have been used a great deal as a school for legislators, where people who later become members of the Dáil or Seanad get a great deal of experience of estimates, committees and debate.</P>
    <P>There is one thing about local bodies which the Second Stage of this Bill might give an occasion for stating. The Minister mentioned the British Act of 1898.  That was the first British Act which gave any degree of democratic control in Irish affairs to any part of the Irish people.  Until 1922 these local bodies were the only legal organism in Ireland which could give expression to Irish views.  For that reason these local bodies were used for political purposes and, in my judgment, were legitimately so used, to express opinions about Home Rule and such matters.  Local bodies helped in the compulsory Irish campaign in 1908 and 1909.  They were used by Sinn Féin; they were in fact captured by Sinn Féin and were a very important part in the operations against the British Government from 1918 to 1921.</P>
    <P>The situation altered radically when an Irish State came into being.  It was desirable then and it would be desirable now that national politics should be kept out of local bodies.  The Minister's Party disagreed with that view and persist in disagreement.  They still do their best&mdash;and have brought everybody else to take the same line &mdash;to see that local bodies are elected on purely political lines.  That is a very bad thing for local authorities and for the country.  National politics should be kept for the Dáil and Seanad <Col N="104" /> and not pushed into the affairs of local authorities.  The present Government Party have always conducted these elections on rigid Party lines, they have gone in for complete Party control of these public bodies, and of course, Party control of whatever patronage they may have, either directly or indirectly, of any character whatever.  That is an unwise proceeding. We would get better representatives and a better type of local body if we could avoid bringing the rigid Party line into these elections.</P>
    <P>With regard to the managerial system, which is very important also and about which one might say a word on this particular Bill, it was begun as an experiment for Dublin and Cork but the present Government Party introduced it all over the country, for all the county councils, as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We did not extend it to Limerick or Waterford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but to all the county councils.  I think it was done very hastily and before sufficient trained personnel were available.  It has worked in a rather curious manner.  Administration, which is often more important than legislation, has been carried out in such a way as to make the county manager in nearly everything subject to the Custom House, subject to central control about even small matters.  It has been argued&mdash;I am not highly skilled in these matters myself&mdash;that local bodies actually have legally more power than they exercise and that managers have more independence than they actually assert against the Custom House.  It is undesirable that the whole of local government should be centralised and that for a comparatively small thing sanction must be obtained, by people in Galway; Roscommon or Tipperary, from the Department in Dublin.  If we are not to achieve a form of local government which will leave initiative and responsibility to local people, it will be very difficult indeed for us to make a success of national politics in Dublin.  For that reason, we would look forward with great interest to an amendment of the County Management Act which would be very much improved <Col N="105" /> if we could come to an agreement that we would leave Party politics&mdash;using &ldquo;Party&rdquo; in its strictest and worst sense&mdash;out of local affairs.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Bill itself, I am inclined to think that the Minister is entirely right in fixing a five-year period as the term of office.  But before that action is taken, there should be an election, so that the people would be conscious that they were electing representatives who would stay in office for five years.  On that basis, from the point of view of its postponing the election and so prolonging the period of present bodies, I think the Bill is a bad one.  Otherwise I am not in disagreement with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>The majority of the ratepayers and more particularly the public representatives throughout the country will be grateful to the Minister for having introduced this measure, postponing the elections for a period of two years and extending the term of office in future to five years. Already the Dáil and this House have accepted the principle of a five-year term of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unconsciously, I expect, Senator Hayes made the best case that will possibly be made in this House for the Bill.  He referred to the introduction of the managerial system.  Since then, we have had a number of elections. Particularly, I think, during the period of the 1948 General Election, one particular political Party made it almost the chief plank of their election platform that, if returned to power, they would seek the abolition of the managerial system.  A member of that Party was placed in the responsible position of Minister for Local Government.  No doubt, the Bill he proposed to introduce had to be curtailed somewhat more than he would wish, but a Bill was introduced, and that Bill never became an Act because of the intervention of a general election.  The previous Government also had a Bill which passed through this House and, as the Minister has pointed out, as a result of minor amendments made here, the Bill was returned to the Dáil and, in the meantime, a general election was held.  Now, two Governments decided <Col N="106" /> that the time had come when certain amendments were necessary in the local government administration.</P>
    <P>That being so, I think Senator Hayes's proposal that the Minister should proceed now with the local election cannot be justified&mdash;and that, having held the local elections, whatever changes are found to be necessary could be incorporated in a Bill which should be introduced and passed, a Bill which could not be given effect to until a period of five years had elapsed. I am sure members would then argue that the persons elected to local authorities at that general election were elected under a particular set of local government regulations and that it would not be fair that a new measure in regard to local government should be introduced and foisted on those elected members.  I think the same. The more responsible thing is what the Minister proposes to do&mdash;to give a term of two years in which to have this question of local government fully examined and, in that period, putting a Bill through the Dáil and Seanad and then, whatever may happen, holding the local elections.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes disagreed with introducing politics into local government. Sometimes Senator Hayes has a very short memory.  I think that the introduction of politics into local government was a matter that was forced on the country more by the Party of which Senator Hayes is a member than by any other Party in this country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>At the 1934 local elections, a very serious attempt was made by the Party with which Senator Hayes is so very closely associated to use the local elections which were being held at that time for a political <Col N="107" /> purpose and, a more serious thing, to capture representation on the local bodies with a view to the stoppage of the payment of rates which, if it had succeeded, would have resulted in very serious consequences for the country.</P>
      <P>We hear a lot of talk about politics in local government.  I think that if we could encourage more people to take a keener and a better interest in politics, both local and national, we would do a great service to the country. If political Parties did not take an interest in local elections, it is very doubtful whether, in many cases, you would have the proper type of person going forward as candidate.  For that reason, I think there is nothing wrong with political Parties contesting local elections.  When the election is over, the Party elected to a majority, in whatever council it may be, is faced with the responsibility of carrying on the work of that council.  They face up to that responsibility or otherwise the Minister, whoever he may be, will probably take very serious and drastic action to ensure that they will do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If national Parties, for one reason or another, decide that the matter of local elections is no further an interest of theirs, then you will have various types of people going forward for what, probably, are not the very best of motives at all times.  So far as local government in this country is concerned, and particularly so far as those people who are associated with any of the larger political Parties are concerned, I think it can safely be said that they have been very clean in their administration.  Therefore, I consider that the Minister has taken a very wise step in postponing the elections that are due to be held now and, in the meantime, giving careful consideration to such amendments as are found to be necessary in our local government administration and then bringing a Bill before the Dáil and the Seanad. When the time comes when a new election must be held, the persons then going forward for election will know the code of rules and regulations they will be expected to administer and the electors will also be aware of the <Col N="108" /> position when they are making their choice as to the people who, in their judgment, should be elected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that this Bill should be introduced at this time. I do not think the Oireachtas should be invited to pass this measure which, in my view, is thoroughly undemocratic. I believe that its purpose is to save the Government from having to hold local elections at the present time. Apparently the Government are not prepared to face the consequences of such elections now.</P>
      <P>I hold the view that, at the moment, the local authorities are thoroughly unrepresentative of the feeling of the country.  I think it would be a very healthy thing if the country could be given a chance to reconstitute the local authorities.  They were elected for a period of three years and their term of office has now expired.  The people who elected them ought to be given an opportunity of saying whether these local authorities have effectively discharged the obligations which were put on them but, under this measure, the people will not be permitted to do so.</P>
      <P>The argument has been advanced that certain groups have urged that this legislation should be passed.  Who are the groups?  Whom do they represent, in the majority?  Surely, this whole matter is purely a political decision.  The ministerial authorities or other people ask for an extension of the period of office of local authorities. They do not want an election now.  I suggest that that is because they look on it entirely from a political angle. It is really unfortunate that that is the sort of way this country has to face up to discharging its responsibilities in local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept the point of view put forward by Senator Hawkins.  If the Custom House and the Minister and his advisers are going to amend local government legislation&mdash;and, Heaven knows, it requires emendation and clarification at present&mdash;they should have thought about that some time ago.  If this measure came along at a time when we could see proposals for the amendment of local government <Col N="109" /> legislation, and could see what the new set-up was going to be, then one could ponder over that situation.  I do not think there is anything whatever in the argument that the position has to be studied and that the new legislation should be introduced and tried on the old dogs before new members get a chance of functioning under it.  No matter what any member on any side says, that is the real truth about why the measure is being introduced.</P>
    <P>In a way, perhaps, it does not matter a great deal in the present set-up of local government who is there, because the fact is that members of local authorities have so little power&mdash;and I speak with some knowledge of this&mdash; that most of them do not know where they stand.  There is not a thing the members of county councils can do with regard to any member of the staff.  All they can do is to make the appointment of a rate collector and it is not the county council that will do that but a caucus outside the county council.  That is the only power local authorities have to-day in regard to any official whom they employ.  They are all merely planted on them and to a certain extent&mdash;and this is the very humiliating situation, a situation which is dreadfully bad for local government, for national government and for the morale of our people&mdash;we have reached the point at which many of the officials are the masters of the elected representatives. It is a fact that we have reached that stage and members of county councils to-day find that the things they ought to be able to do as representatives on public bodies, they have no power whatever to do.  If they want information, they must go around from one official to another and they are almost afraid to speak of these matters at meetings of their councils.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Minister and his advisers think about this situation. It may be very desirable in certain circumstances for certain people, but a change will come and they will look on it as very undesirable then.  I have the feeling about all this that local government is either going to crumble or going to be given more responsibility. Senator Hayes has said that <Col N="110" /> you can have two types of people going forward for places on local authorities. You can have people going forward out of a sense of citizenship, who are prepared to serve the people to the best of their ability, who want to mete out justice to all, doing their best for the poor and for the ratepayers within their ability, and generally trying to serve as good citizens, people who will desire to see that men who have executive responsibility and who are paid out of the ratepayers' money will give decent service to the people whose money they take and spend.  You can then have another type&mdash;the people who will go forward, and, in that humiliating way of which we see so much to-day, do all the kow-towing that is being done, going from one official to another in order to secure rights for the people in their districts, rights to which they are perfectly entitled and which would be secured to them if these people were manly enough to see that the officials did their duty in a responsible way.</P>
    <P>We expect people paid by the ratepayers to discharge their obligations to the ratepayers.  I do not say that the officials of our local authorities are not doing their best, but I do say that the whole set-up is wrong and faulty. We have a whole set of officials costing in some counties more than £100,000, and no member of the local body has any authority whatever with regard to the work of these people or in regard to what they are paid, and if you have not got something to say about how much a man is paid, he will not mind very much about what you say about him afterwards.  It is just an impossible situation.  The county manager must keep in the good graces of the Minister.  If the Minister wants something done, it must be done, regardless of what the members of local authorities or the ratepayers think. There is a complete lack of understanding and harmony in our whole local government set-up at present, and a great deal of it undoubtedly is bred in this political atmosphere which unfortunately surrounds the administration of public affairs.</P>
    <P>I can say from my own experience that the great majority of local representatives <Col N="111" /> to-day, regardless of their political beliefs, want to do the right thing, and it is at times more than exasperating&mdash;it is rather tragic&mdash;to see men on local authorities having to defend something which is a political decision which they feel they must defend, something which is against reason and common sense and the best interests of the people they represent. I wish we could try to extricate ourselves from this position.  It is imperative for the well-being of local government and of national government in the future that we do so.  I disagree totally with the managerial set-up&mdash;I do not want to say very much about this, although I might say a great deal &mdash;and, as Senator Hayes has said, we developed this system without any effort having been made beforehand to develop the type of executive necessary to work the system.  You cannot get men to pop up every day to take charge of the administration of local affairs where £800,000 to £1,000,000 is being spent.  In my own small, poor county, we are spending around £800,000 to-day &mdash;in Meath the expenditure is probably over £1,000,000 &mdash; and the authority which one little man has in relation to the expenditure of that tremendous sum is rather frightening.</P>
    <P>The whole position with regard to local government is thoroughly unsatisfactory. It is extravagant in the extreme and there is in it the sort of divided control and responsibility which is very bad for local government itself and terribly bad for the people in it who are trying to serve.  I do not know that the Custom House itself is above reproach.</P>

      <P>I do not want to be critical of any of our departmental organisations.  I know many of the people in them individually and I have the greatest respect for them and for their ability but had the Minister introduced&mdash;he knows a good deal about local government, a knowledge which I am not denying to him, and he has been long enough associated with it to be able to tell us what improvements he would suggest in the legislative set-up as it is&mdash;a framework for the reorganisation <Col N="112" /> of local government, we would then see if there was a justification for the introduction of this Bill.  I, perhaps, would have a different point of view about it but one point which puzzles me is why decisions cannot be reached earlier in local government.</P>
      <P>In our own county, only a week ago, we had a decision with regard to an amendment of the rate which reduced the grants but which, in addition, was notified at such a time as to cost the county council hundreds of pounds in relation to altering its demand notes and making changes in the preparatory accountancy necessary for the issue of the demand notes.  If you have such things happening with regard to a decision on the distribution of the rate for the current year and people cannot make up their mind about it in time, one wonders when we are going to have an amendment of the local government legislation in the country which is required so badly.</P>
      <P>I do not say that the question of the extension of the life of local authorities to five years is a matter which is not open to discussion, but I think the approach is wrong.  I feel the local elections should have been held and the Minister should have come to the Oireachtas with a comprehensive Bill amending local government legislation generally, letting us see in the amendment of that legislation, apart altogether from this question of the decision to extend the life of the county councils, what other authority he was going to give back to the local representatives that would enable them to exercise control in local affairs which they do not exercise at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether people who have no experience of local government are appreciative of the set-up as it is at present or not, but in the old days, before we had all this effort to amend legislation, all of which, I think, has been retrograde, you had the board of health, and you had the whole health organisation and the whole health set-up debated by people who were on the board of health and were actively interested in health matters.  There is a great deal of discussion in different places about public <Col N="113" /> health to-day, but there is very little discussion on public health at any county council meetings.  There are many people here, on both sides of the House, who have experience of the work of county councils.  I never see the county medical officer of health. Since I went on the county council I have never seen, except on one occasion, the county medical officer of health, the director of medical services. I do not know what happens everywhere else.  Perhaps Senator Fitzsimons could tell us if that is the case in Meath.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>You have a set-up where the county manager is in the position to take a decision on a technical question in regard to roads in contradiction of what he is advised to do by the county engineer.  Similarly, the same county manager can take a decision with regard to a medical question, and contradict what he is advised by the county medical officer of health is the thing that ought to be done.</P>
      <P>This situation requires study and frank discussion.  The people with experience on public bodies who go to meetings month after month do their best with problems that they think they have some obligation to discuss. The position that confronts these people now is such that I do not think in the future you will be able to maintain an interest in the right sort of people to go forward for election to local authorities.  In addition, it is an impossible system to try to maintain that a county manager can administer the affairs of a county almost totally on his own responsibility.  It cannot be done to the satisfaction of the people of the county, and it certainly cannot be done to the satisfaction of the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we had been able, as I say, to encourage men with training, experience and education over a long period and put them into local administration, I might believe that they could be of considerable assistance, but I would never dream of having a situation, as we have at the moment, where the county manager is everything and does <Col N="114" /> everything, and the local representatives who are elected by the ratepayers can hardly determine anything except the level of the rate which they must strike, and what can they do about that?  They are given a demand, and if they decide that is to be reduced to a level which is within the competence of the ratepayers to pay, and if the manager is not satisfied, he can come in and tell them at another meeting that he is not satisfied and that he is going to fix the rate himself.</P>
    <P>No matter what others think about this Bill, I am not satisfied with it.  It is thoroughly undemocratic and no matter what authorities are quoted for having postponed elections in the past, I do not think it is a justification for the introduction of this Bill now. There is only one reason for it.  If the Minister had produced something else to show us what his thoughts about this were, I would perhaps have some more kindly feelings about it.  As it is, it is certainly not a measure I would support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelColgan" hpid="Mr. Colgan Mr. Colgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister at the outset on the introduction of this Bill.  While we have not so far had what I term the rather dishonest arguments in this House that were used in the Dáil about the Fianna Fáil Party being afraid to face the electorate, I have not been convinced by the arguments used by either Senator Hayes or Senator Baxter.  In spite of these arguments, they are just as anxious to avoid elections, either local or national, as we are and I feel there is a certain amount of dishonesty in using these arguments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was rather intrigued by Senator Hayes's statement that we should keep politics out of local councils.  I feel, and I have discovered over the years, that when Parties are not in a position to maintain a certain strength on a council, they immediately raise the cry that politics should be kept out of the councils.  Provided the Party is in a position to maintain a substantial number of members on a council, possibly a majority, there is never any question of keeping politics out of the council, but as soon as the numbers <Col N="115" /> diminish the cry is invariably raised that politics should be kept out.  Then you have people, disguised politicians, who come in as ratepayers or something else.</P>
    <P>I supposed from Senator Baxter's remarks that he had County Cavan in mind.  I sympathise with both him and the Minister if he has painted a fairly accurate picture of the state of affairs in Cavan.  He pictured a number of sycophantic county councillors who went, hat in hand, to the officials of the county council looking for any crumbs that might fall from these officials, including the manager himself. I am speaking as a member of the Dublin Corporation, and I see nothing fundamentally wrong in the working of the managerial system in Dublin.  You must remember the managerial system was introduced by the old Cumann na nGaedheal Government.</P>
    <P>I was rather intrigued when I heard Senator Hayes speaking about local government control.  That control has always been there.  As a matter of fact, the Dublin Corporation kicked against that control in 1924 and was suppressed for six years.  We had a foretaste of what might happen when three commissioners were appointed to run the city.  The managerial system was not in vogue then.  That was the forerunner of the managerial system.  These gentlemen were put into the city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>They ran it very competently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelColgan" hpid="Mr. Colgan Mr. Colgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>
      <P>They did.  They went to Germany for people to build houses and to France for people to sweep up the streets.  That was done at the expense of the people.  They ran the city efficiently but at the expense of the people who should have been employed in the city.  That is how they ran it, and that cannot be denied.  They brought Germans to build houses and Frenchmen to sweep the streets.  That is the position.  In spite of all the criticism, Dublin Corporation is the biggest employer of labour in Dublin. All the money that is collected is spent in the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="116" /> The manager in Dublin has certain rights and functions.  He very rarely uses them without the advice of the councillors in general.  There was some difficulty in regard to markets and he set up a marketing committee to advise him.  He took the advice of the marketing committee.  That is the way the system is run in Dublin.  We have no objection to it.  He does his job well and he does not do anything without consulting the councillors and in the main we are a fairly happy family in the corporation.</P>
    <P>I was rather intrigued when Senator Baxter said that the present councillors were not representative of the people. I want to know what authority he has for that.  Why should he say these people have lost the confidence of the people who elected them?  In effect, he stated that they were no longer representative. That was one of his arguments why there should be new elections to the county council.  The point he made, of course, was that the manager was dependent upon the good grace of the Minister for Local Government. That applied when the Dublin Corporation fell out of grace with the Minister for Local Government in 1924 and they were promptly suppressed. You cannot have a county council or a corporation working without some control from the Custom House, if you like.  Someone must have the last word.</P>
    <P>As a member of Dublin Corporation, my experience is that we are facilitated to a very great extent by the Custom House.  The Custom House is not the bogey to us which it appears to be to Senator Baxter.  It is about time that this question of the five-year period was settled.  The election to Dublin Corporation was every three years and if one aspired to aldermanic dignity he was elected for five years so that the period of five years is nothing new, nor is there anything sacrosanct about the three years.  A period of five years is a fair period.  In regard to Dublin Corporation, I have seen the extension from 1939 to 1945 of the life of the corporation.  I have seen it extended from 1945 to 1950.  That also was a five-year period.  I heard no argument then in this House that this suggestion was undemocratic.  It was accepted as a <Col N="117" /> normal and natural thing.  We should have a five-year period.  Everybody seems to agree with that.  The only argument is that there should have been an election beforehand.  I think the argument is futile and cannot be sustained.  I think the Minister is doing right and I congratulate him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to the proposed postponement of the elections or to the extension of the period of office of the present councils.  The present councils were elected for three years and at the end of that period the people should be given an opportunity of electing new representatives.  I express that view very strongly.</P>
      <P>After very careful consideration, I consider the fact of having local elections, electing councillors and paying travelling expenses to councillors to attend meetings is the greatest waste of ratepayers' money that ever took place in any country.  I challenge the Senator who has just spoken to deny the truth of the following statement. There are 45 members on the corporation and there is a Lord Mayor and all of them together have not sufficient power to appoint a chairman.  I cannot understand with the Management Act as it is why county councillors are elected at all.  They have no power. The only power they have is that they can strike a rate as demanded and they can appoint a rate collector.  Other than that they have no more power than a lot of children attending school. After a quarter of a century of experience in public life I defy contradiction of that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The county manager has complete authority.  I say with all due respect to whoever is responsible, it is an insult that the people in whose hands is the power of electing a Government responsible to the nation should not be given power to elect local representatives. On the other hand, a lot can be said for the managerial system. Anything I say is no reflection on the managers I come in contact with. Nevertheless, I hold that county councillors and corporators as they are to-day are only a cloak for the manager. If he did wrong he can always say that they advised him to do so.  The <Col N="118" /> manager should be given responsibility and he should be made manage the affairs and see how far he would go. It is a stupid idea to bring councillors 30 or 40 miles and pay them travelling expenses to listen to the manager giving orders.  That is really the most ridiculous thing in the present set-up.</P>
    <P>I am 100 per cent. in agreement with every word spoken by Senator Baxter. The whole system of local government as it is to-day is an insult to the Irish people.  I would make it one way or the other.  I would appoint a county manager and I would have him a county manager to manage affairs.  I would not tolerate this idea of having the name of holding elections.  The Lord Mayor and members get robes for themselves with the manager's consent. The thing is really stupid.</P>
    <P>I do not very often have to disagree with Senator Hayes, but I do say that I am in favour of people being elected on a political issue.  I had experience of both sides and I will say this much, that if there is any hope of getting clean, good, local administration, it is from the political Parties, because after all they are not free to do what they like and have to answer to somebody, at least to their own political Party.</P>
    <P>I am not opposed to people being elected on political issues.  I am sorry to say that when people were elected on different methods and not tied to political Parties, things were not as good as they are now.  That is my point of view which I hold very strongly.  I feel that the whole system as it is to-day is wrong.  If the people are good enough to elect Dáil Deputies to form a Government, they should be capable enough to elect local councils to administer the affairs of the county. If the county managers are to remain with the powers that they have, in complete authority, it is absolute waste of public money to hold local elections at all.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Recently.  &ldquo;It was his intention as soon as possible to introduce certain proposals in regard to the managerial system&rdquo;, said Mr. Smith, Minister for Local Government, replying in the Dáil to the debate on the Second Stage of the Local Government Bill.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister referred to many matters of dissatisfaction with regard to that Bill when he was speaking in the country, and that he referred rather pungently in Nenagh to the costs of local government.  Be that as it may, he now proposes to take an additional two years, and I would like to ask him and his Department to use those two years in trying to give us a more mature and more developed form of local government than we have at the present moment.</P>
      <P>The public representatives are given the minimum of power.  We have attained political freedom in this country, but that freedom is of little benefit when our people are not allowed to use it; and unless our young men are encouraged to go into public bodies and allowed to perform functions of some benefit to the nation, you are not going to encourage them to be responsible citizens.  When they reach their manhood and their maturity they ought to be asked to co-operate in the government of the country.  At present the manager is almost all-powerful and even a unanimous decision of a council cannot upset the wishes of the manager.  I suggest to the Minister that when he is going to bring in these proposals a two-thirds majority or a unanimous decision of a council ought to be a sufficient safeguard for the ratepayers, and that with such a majority or unanimous decision it should be mandatory on the manager to give effect to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter in which we understood that the councils were all-powerful, and that was the provision of money, but recently I have been informed that the manager can direct the appointment of an official, and even if the council hold that that official is not necessary it will be <Col N="120" /> mandatory on them to provide the money.  That is going a step further in reducing the power that the councils were supposed to have.  At one time we understood that when we came together to strike our rates we could give the manager the amount of money which we wished to strike and indicate where a reduction was to take place. Now even if we indicate that reduction, if the manager says he wants an official he can bring in an order and have the official appointed, send it to the Local Appointments Commissioners and we will have to appoint him afterwards.</P>
    <P>Without going into detail, I would like the Minister to try in the next two years to give us a system that all the people in the country will have more respect for.  I am 21 years a member of a public body, and I think that many of the Minister's Party are as dissatisfied with the County Management Act as we are.  Everyone believes you must have certain safeguards, but still if local government is not going to be a sham you must have responsibility. Otherwise we will be no more than children, and that would not make for good citizenship.</P>
    <P>I want to reply to a couple of statements that were made.  One of them was made by Senator Colgan, who said that Dublin Corporation was the biggest employer of labour and that its money was well spent because it was all spent in the city.  I hope he did not mean that the spending of money was in itself a virtue, because if he does I must disagree with him.  There are hundreds of people in this City of Dublin, widows and others, some of them living on pensions, who would spend that money much better.  That money is a tax on industry, and would allow an industry to reduce its production costs and sell its goods cheaper if it did not have to carry that additional overhead.  But I presume he did not mean that.  I have heard people in public life talking about the spending of money in this way, but I think it is very unsound economics.</P>
    <P>I also wish to point out to the Minister something which he also said in the reference I quoted earlier:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="121" />&ldquo;Continuing, the Minister said that when one has regard to the enormous extension of the services it was surprising that the increase in the rates should only amount to 140 per cent. as against an increase of 216 per cent. in national taxation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I saw recent figures taken from one of our statistical abstracts and it showed that since 1932/33 local rates have increased enormously&mdash;from £3,500,000 in 1932/33 to £15,250,000 in the present year.  That is an increase of almost 500 per cent.  It shows conclusively to me that the County Management Act has not been in any way effective in seeing that we get good value for the money that is spent.</P>
    <P>In the final analysis, the people who pay the rates are the best safeguard of public expenditure.  Officials tend to make a rather soft existence for themselves. I believe that the working hours of local officials in this country are probably the shortest in the world. I found out recently that one of the most powerful countries in the world that has representatives here has working hours from nine to six on five days a week and I found that some of our local authorities' officials work from ten to five, five days a week, with a half day on Saturday.  These are very short working hours.  Some of those officials enjoy as much as 40 days' holidays in the year.  It is no wonder that we would have an increase of almost 500 per cent. in our local expenditure when that is happening and the managers have not been effective in curbing that expenditure.  I think I have developed these points adequately.</P>
    <P>As Senator Baxter said, the Minister has had years of experience as a public representative and also as Minister for Local Government.  We believe that he is aware of the necessity to improve the present system.  I believe he would like to give back a considerable amount of the authority which the local representatives had in the past.  One of the greatest things a man can have in this life and that improves his character and makes him a good citizen, is responsibility.  The County Management Act stands indicted; it removed from our young men who went into local affairs that <Col N="122" /> sense of responsibility which men had in the past.  For that reason, the County Management Act, in the widespread state in which it came in, in 1934, has been a dismal failure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been said here that the Minister had not been asked by anyone in any responsible position to extend the lifetime of public bodies.  I have been a member of the Association of Municipal Bodies for a number of years and I know that in 1951 they passed a resolution asking the Minister to introduce legislation to extend the term of office to five years.  They were afraid that he was not going to give effect to that resolution, so in Fermoy last year they again requested the Minister to take immediate action, as the local elections were due in June or September of this year.  I take it the Minister has so acted because of that request.  Because he has acted, certain Senators have said that he should not give any effect to the terms of that resolution.</P>
      <P>I take it the members of the association have some experience in the public life of this country.  Most of them have been in public life for 30, 20, or at least ten years.  The General Council of County Councils has passed a similar resolution.  Wherever I went &mdash;whether they be members of the Association of Municipal Bodies or of the General Council of County Councils, they were really glad that the Minister was going to give effect to the resolution that they passed over a long number of years.  The people who have responsibility in administering local affairs know very well that the period of three years is too short.  Very few councillors have served for three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister has said, from 1925 to 1928 there was a three-year period and then you had no election from 1928 to 1934.  A certain amount of progress was made during those six years. We know that from 1934 to 1942 we had no local elections.  We must admit that a big lot of progress was made during those eight years.  We cannot be blind to the fact that during those eight years, because of the experience gained by councillors, something like 40,000 or 50,000 houses were erected. If we had elections every three years <Col N="123" /> between 1934 and 1942, would we have made such progress?  I think we would not.  We had elections in 1942 and that brought us up to 1945.  I wonder if the Minister could give us some indication &mdash;he may have some figures&mdash;of the progress made between 1942 and 1945. After the elections in 1945 we had none until 1950.  I reckon that the Minister could show that in those five years between 1945 and 1950 there was more progress than between 1942 and 1945, simply and solely because the councillors administering local affairs were getting in on the system of local government that appertains in this country.</P>
    <P>No matter what anyone says in this House and no matter how they may get away from the Bill, I cannot see how they can do anything else, when they discuss the Bill and the Bill only, but compliment the Minister for implementing the request and the resolution of the Municipal Bodies Association and of the General Council of County Councils.  He is doing that and I wish to compliment him on doing it.  No matter what has been said, the members of those associations know the Minister is doing the right thing.  I am certain that the people who spoke against the Bill to-day are not speaking their own minds and that if they were at home in their own councils they would say what I am saying here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference of opinion on this Bill seems to turn on one matter only.  It is agreed that a five-year term is desirable, and the question seems to be whether an election should be held before the Bill is implemented or not.  Senator Baxter said that the Government's decision was purely a political one.  Senator Colgan very rightly pointed out that we are all in politics here, and to dismiss a Bill or a decision as purely political is meaningless for a politician.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want, with your permission, Sir, to deal for a moment with the two levels of politics that are involved in the discussion of this Bill.  I studied the debates in the Dáil and I came to certain conclusions which I venture to put before the House now.  It seems <Col N="124" /> to me that in the debates in the Dáil and in our debate here up to the present one can discern two distinct levels of politics.  One we may call statesmanship. Politics at this level thinks and works simply in terms of justice and the greatest good of the greatest number.  We are all here, I am certain, except the most cynical or the most hypocritical of us, trying at least to hold this as an ideal before ourselves in all that we do.  It was the ideal that stirred Pearse and O'Connell as much as it stirred Thomas Davis and Grattan.  If we in our debates in the Seanad and those who are debating in the Dáil lose sight completely of this higher level of politics we shall have cause in this country to be very sad indeed.  Seriously, many people in this country are, I think, beginning to feel sad about the condition of national politics.  That is why I speak like this now.</P>
    <P>That is the higher level.  The question then before us at that level is: Is this Bill a just Bill or is it not?</P>
    <P>Now, there is another level.  Only a very innocent person would deny that there is another current in Irish politics, another strong undercurrent that is tending to sweep us off our feet in the Legislature of this country.  This is the politics of the struggle for power.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong simply to call it Party politics.  There is always a temptation for an Independent to speak slightingly of Party politics.  It would be wrong.  We Independents are just as much involved in this struggle for power in our way as the Party politicians are.  In this lower level, ambition, pride, anger, envy, spite, misrepresentation flourish.  Some honourable men withstand the temptation and are withstanding it in our Legislature. But the constant pressure of this undercurrent is engulfing men in this House and in the other House at present, who, I feel, were never engulfed in it so deeply before.  Other people feel that, too.  At its best, however, this lower level can be an honourable one.  It is an honourable enough thing for men, who believe that they are the best men to govern the country best, to believe that they should get power and hold power.  That is honourable enough.  That is what every <Col N="125" /> Government is determined to do&mdash;to get in and to stay in as long as they legitimately can.  We might as well be realists about that and recognise it. There is nothing dishonourable in it. We must consider the Bill before us in the terms of that realism too.</P>
    <P>Is this Bill justifiable at the higher level?  Is it reasonable?  Is it not unusual at the lower level?  These are the questions which I ask myself.  I think the question of justice is not quite clear here; but to judge from what has been said about resolutions of the various local government conferences, it seems just enough.  The real question, then, is: Is it unusual for a Government to choose the time that suits it best for passing a Bill like this?  I assume, for the moment, this is the time that suits Fianna Fáil best to pass this Bill.  That assumption may be wrong.  But even granting that, is it unreasonable, is it unusual, for any Government to put a just Bill through when it suits it best?  I think not. Every Government in its time has done exactly that and nothing else.  Only a Government of saints, for saints, by saints would do anything else.  Perhaps the House will consider for a moment what it would be like in the Dáil if we had a Government of saints, for saints, by saints and a similar Opposition.</P>
    <P>Imagine the gentlemen on the right of the Chair competing in humility, deference, reverence, patience and charity, with the men on the other side of the Chair.  Actually, politics would probably tend to break down under the strain but it would be a welcome change for a while.  Unhappily, it is a vision unlikely to be realised. Speaking seriously, it is tragic, the contrast between our Christian professions and our national politics in this Leinster House&mdash;and people are feeling it more and more.  There is a mood coming over the country on that account which I think is a dangerous mood.  How can it be stopped?  How can we move towards this Government of saints, for saints, by saints?  I will say one thing on that point and I mean it.  It will not come by Oppositions demanding generosity, demanding <Col N="126" /> charity, from the other side.  Saintliness or even godliness or generosity never comes by demands.  It will only come when either the Opposition or the Government, spontaneously and deliberately, act generously, magnanimously and charitably.  I want to insist on that.  I am utterly tired of reading in the debates of the other House demands from the Opposition for generosity from the Government, demands from the Government for generosity from the Opposition&mdash;but never the suggestion: we will deliberately give you this example of magnanimity or generosity; will you follow us?  Our national politics will have to do something like that.  There will have to be a giving of example, not a demanding in this matter.  May I simply quote one example&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>Dealing with the Bill and keeping very closely to the spirit of the debate.  During the war a submarine went down off the coast of America.  A very difficult diving operation was necessary to recover the bodies of the dead and some valuable instruments in the submarine.  It involved an extremely perilous diving operation.  The captain of a certain ship was asked to choose some of his men to perform that difficult diving operation and he was given a week or so to decide.  It was clear that there was a fifty-fifty chance of death or life for these men&mdash;about half and half. After a week, the captain decided that he would go down himself first&mdash;and he went down.  That is what some of our politicians have to do.  They will have to take that fifty-fifty chance of going out of office through generosity or magnanimity or sooner or later the country will face utter despair or frustration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To sum up, and to return more closely to the Bill, I say that this Bill at the higher level is just.  We all agree to that.  I say that at the lower level it is simply what every Government has done in the past and will do in the future unless an unusual magnanimity so badly needed comes <Col N="127" /> into our politics.  It would be more generous on the Government's part to grant an election first.  I would insist on that: it would be more generous. But we cannot demand generosity, and I simply say we will have to leave it. We have to hope that this Government or the next Government, whatever it may be, will set that necessary example. Otherwise the state of national and local politics will become&mdash;I suggest with all deference&mdash;almost desperate.</P>
    <P>On the whole then, I would support the Minister's Bill as a gesture of confidence that in future either his Government or some other Government will take that lead in magnanimity which is so badly needed in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very tempting to follow the last speaker, but I am not going to take the risk of having an argument with the Chair. I may, however, be allowed to mention that the Opposition in this case agreed to take all the stages of this Bill to-day &mdash;so it may be that things are not quite as bad in Irish politics as Senator Stanford thinks.  I cannot follow him on the higher and lower levels, nor do I agree that it is usual for Governments to take Party advantage in relation to local elections; but it seems to me that, so far as this Bill is concerned, Senator Hayes was right when he said there were really two issues involved.  One deals with the immediate present and the other with the future.</P>
      <P>So far as I am personally concerned, I think the principle of making long extensions of the period of office of persons in local government or national government is bad, and generally theorists on democratic principle have taught and emphasised that it is highly undesirable, where a set of persons are elected to a public body for a period of time, that period should be extended, except in case of an emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If my memory serves me aright, that principle is clearly accepted in our Constitution which provides that the Dáil cannot extend its own life, except for a short period&mdash;I think, for one <Col N="128" /> year&mdash;in case of an emergency.  In so far as there is a clear principle, it is, I think, that elections should not be postponed, unless there is an extremely good reason, and, where there is an extremely good reason, it should be for as short a period as possible.</P>
    <P>I completely disagree with Senator Fitzsimons in his contention that the people who should be consulted and whose opinion is most important in relation to a matter of this kind are the people already elected and who would have to stand for election again. They are exactly the people who should have no say in the matter.  If we are accepting responsibility here, we should not be interested in the fact that most members of local bodies&mdash;I think it applies to all, irrespective of Party&mdash;have no particular desire for an election this year, or next year, or possibly in 1955, if you want to know the truth.  I think, therefore, that it is a bad principle.  I do not attach the same importance to it in the case of local elections as I would in the case of the Dáil, but the principle is bad, and I think we should register our opinion that it is bad.</P>
    <P>So far as the term of office is concerned&mdash;I am now speaking for myself and giving my own opinion&mdash;I am strongly in favour of a long term of office for members of a local body. We have to remember that their services are voluntary, and that, if they are to give good service, they must have a certain amount of experience, and I do not think that it makes for good government to have too frequent elections, in so far as the individual is concerned.  Therefore, I am in favour of a five-year, or possibly a six-year period&mdash;I think I would prefer six years&mdash;for members of local bodies, but the drawback in that is that it does not give any adequate chance for the ratepayers or electors to express their opinion on matters of considerable importance which might arise in relation to local affairs.  It would be a far better system if, say, in the case of Dublin, the various wards or constituencies which elect members to Dublin Corporation were divided into three and if every two years one-third of these constituencies elected a member. <Col N="129" /> That would give every member of the corporation a period of six years and would provide for some measure of expression of opinion by the public and would not give any particular area too many elections.  Whereas it is not the system we had before, it is something well worth considering because it would serve the two purposes of providing for a long enough term for a member to gain experience and responsibility and providing an opportunity of an expression of opinion by the electorate.</P>
    <P>It would appear&mdash;and, no doubt, Senator Stanford is convinced&mdash;that the position at the moment is that one of the large Parties wants an election and the other does not, but I suggest that that really has nothing whatever to do with the Bill.  No matter what they want, they should not be entitled to it, unless it is just and wise and proper, and I suggest that it would have been better and wiser for the Government to have allowed the elections to be held and, at the same time, to have introduced a Bill providing for a longer period.  One of the drawbacks of the Bill is that it is brought in rather hastily and is obviously piecemeal. We have to deal with it in a hurry because the elections are due and I do not think that it has had, as a matter of principle, the consideration it should have had.  It would have been very much better to have held the elections or to have postponed them for three or four months, if it was inconvenient to hold them immediately, and to have let a measure of this kind dealing with the future be debated at length in an effort to find the best possible system.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes expressed the view that it was a pity we had Party politics in local elections.  So far as I can recollect, in 1922, at the time of the first Constitution, there was a very strong desire expressed on the part of a number of people that we should try to cut ourselves away from what was more or less the practice in Britain and that it should be possible to have local bodies who were concerned only with local politics.  Be that as it may, we have to face the fact&mdash;I do not much care who is to blame; I think all sides are a little to blame&mdash;<Col N="130" /> that it would be extremely difficult suddenly, except by a very general conviction on the part of all Parties, to get rid of members who owe allegiance to Party politics.  I do not at all agree with Senator Tunney that the great virtue of that is that the people cannot act according to their own convictions.  That, I would say, is one of the drawbacks, if it be true. I do not share his views in that regard at all, nor do I share the views of Senator Colgan who has some objection to persons whom he calls politicians disguised as ratepayers. I want to suggest to him that a politician may be a ratepayer.  I happen to be one myself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRuane" hpid="Mr. S.T. Ruane Mr. S.T. Ruane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the principle of this Bill, extending the life of local bodies from three years to five years, is concerned, I am in full agreement with it.  I am in agreement with it, because, from an experience gained over a quarter of a century, I have come to the conclusion that in many cases&mdash;there are exceptions, of course &mdash;new members of local bodies are only beginning to become familiar with procedure and able to take a useful and constructive part in the various discussions by the time the council has reached the end of its term of office. For that reason, I approve the principle of extending the life of councils from three to five years, but I do not approve of the intention of extending the life of the present councils for many reasons.  I know that in the past, extensions similar to that now proposed have been given, but I submit that conditions are not now similar to the conditions which existed in the past.</P>
      <P>Certain matters of legislation are going through the Parliament at present in which the electors are taking a very deep interest, and I am quite satisfied that they would like to have an opportunity of interrogating or sounding prospective candidates for election to the new councils as to what their views are on this contentious legislation at present going through the Houses of Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the statements which have been made about the attenuated <Col N="131" /> powers of local bodies, I do agree that if the local bodies had more power, they might attract people of greater administrative ability than they do at present.  At the same time they have power at least to register a protest. No matter how people on local bodies may be divided politically, there are issues where you can almost have unanimity amongst them.  Eventually an impression could be made on the Government by such agreement to bring in changes which would give an extension of power to local bodies.</P>
    <P>I feel that at certain meetings, especially the estimates meeting, from the very large amount of correspondence that is put before the council members, they would need almost the qualifications of a counsel to discuss these in a manner that would bring about desirable improvement.  There was a time in the past&mdash;and I do not know who brought about the change&mdash; when a publication known as the <i>Quarterly Statement Book</i> used to be brought out by the different councils. That was a very informative publication and it gave to the various members of the council an idea as to activity and expenditure and the responsibilities of the various officials. Since that book ceased publication&mdash;I do not know whether it was as a result of an Order from the Government or a managerial order&mdash;councillors have been left with far less information as to the working of the different officials concerned, and therefore, unable to comment on the work performed.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, a term of five years is short enough for any local body but I would like an election to take place through which the electors would know they were electing a council that would last for five years. The present members of county councils are people who went before the electorate giving them to understand that at the end of three years they would be able to render an account of their stewardship.  They ought to get an opportunity of doing that.  For that reason I do not agree with the suggestion of extending the life of the present councils before an election is held. <Col N="132" /> Therefore, I do not approve of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcGee" hpid="Mr. McGee Mr. McGee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I was a guilty party in supporting a resolution on a particular occasion asking for this Bill. However, listening to some of my colleagues, I begin to think we were taking part in some disreputable action, coming in here to ask the Government to implement a Bill to keep county councillors in the job they are in for a further period.  I would not be at all surprised if some of us would desire that legislation were introduced that would keep us in office for 25 years more.</P>
      <P>I do not think the position is healthy in regard to local government and I think it springs from the fact that public bodies have suffered at the hands of the Department of Local Government over a number of years. I would be delighted if I could say it was all Fianna Fáil work, but my conscience is worrying me and I think Fine Gael sometimes showed its disrespect for public bodies.  The general idea is to kick them about anyway at all; they will come up again because they have a good job and are very fond of it.  The Department of Local Government is failing in its responsibility and has not shown the respect it ought to show to public bodies practically since the State was founded.  Nobody can do anything right except the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGee</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it perfectly clear I am not limiting my remarks to the last five or ten years. It is quite a common thing to hear an official saying: &ldquo;The Minister says&rdquo;. Public bodies should be allowed to do their job irrespective of what the Minister says.  I think the Minister should wait until he is asked to say anything.  If the Minister is going to keep the county councils going just as they are it would be a good idea to put them to the public every couple of years and it might enable us to dispense with some of those managers we also have who are the ruination of the country.  Because of the system which is operated, the rates in every county are much higher than they ought to be. I am very pleased to say that sometimes <Col N="133" /> able people are appointed.  A great deal needs to be done in many matters connected with local administration. We must build many more houses and there are other needs calling for attention.</P>
      <P>Greater freedom should be given to the members of local bodies.  There is no necessity for a policeman at every meeting of a county council and that is really what some of them amount to.</P>
      <P>The more I dwell on this Bill the more I am inclined to think that it is a terrible intrusion.  It would be just the same as if the members of the Dáil brought in a Bill to have their term of office extended or if we in the Seanad brought in similar legislation. The system which operates in the Ireland of to-day, would not be tolerated 30 years ago.  It does no credit to either of the political Parties. I wonder what would our President, Mr. Seán T. O'Ceallaigh, or Mr. W. T. Cosgrave think of the present set-up if they were in political life?  They are men who were in public life with me 40 years ago and neither of them would ever dream of such a situation.</P>
      <P>Again, let me say that county councillors should receive more respect from different Departments.  In this regard I am not speaking about any Minister in particular.  I must say that whenever I asked any Minister to look into any matter or to grant a reasonable request, immediate attention was always afforded or a very good reason given if a request could not be acceded to.</P>
      <P>I deplore this idea of saying: &ldquo;Give me another two years of office and I will be a good boy and do the right thing.&rdquo;  This Bill should be let run its course and the elections that were to have been held should be held.  I do not think they should be side-tracked because one political Party or another would be beaten.  I do not blame the Fianna Fáil Party or the Fine Gael Party.  There are plenty of independent men in the country who would go forward for election whether they are ratepayers, farmers or labourers.  The people would be keen to see that the right men got in and that the job hunters were sent about their business.</P>

      <P>Certainly this discussion has covered a very wide field.  I thought this was a very simple measure but discussion upon it has covered every phase of local government.  I admire the members of this House because of their capacity to cover the course in the very same sort of way as it was covered in the other House. Those who offered criticism of these proposals said their little pieces nicely. They came very near to agreeing with the Bill.  It was the same in the other House.  A five-year term was a reasonable term.  In other words, what they said in this House on the matter and what they said in the other House was: &ldquo;Well, now, this has happened ten times before in the last 30 years. Ten times before the election was extended from three to five years&rdquo;. They want to say now that every Minister who was responsible for bringing in a Bill to extend the period from three to five years was wrong and should not have done it and that they would have expected better from me in that I should not follow the bad example of my predecessors.  That is a bit of a tribute to myself and I suppose I have to be thankful for it. Really, I would never think of expecting a gesture such as that.  Senator McGee in his innocence&mdash;he is an innocent man, of course&mdash;suggested that since this Bill had dragged on so long on this particular occasion we should let things rest.  It dragged on in the very same way in 1948.</P>
      <P>In 1948, Senator Hayes proposed a special resolution which called upon the President, who was at one time the occupant of the office which I have the honour to occupy now, to sign a Bill to do the very same thing in 1948 that I am doing now.  In as plausible a way as I can, I ask the Seanad to go through in 1953 the same performance so that the instrument we are trying to mould will be available to achieve the purpose for which it was forged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not use the occasion of the introduction of this proposal to proclaim to the House that I was doing so in order to introduce other legislation. A Bill was promised in 1948. I think that on every one of the ten previous occasions when this law was <Col N="135" /> amended a reason such as that given in 1948 was given, that some Bill dealing with local government matters was on the stocks and would be introduced. I said in the other House that I did not want to do that.  I have always believed in the idea of a five-year period for local government bodies.</P>
    <P>I came into the Dáil and said that the local government bodies had asked me for this&mdash;the representatives of the Municipal Authorities Association and the members of the General Council of County Councils.  Senator McGee can regard the request made by these bodies as a mean, contemptible sort of a request inasmuch as they were asking for something which would extend their own political or representative lives.  You may attribute any motives you like to them, but I am not going to quarrel with you.</P>
    <P>As far as the provision of this simple measure is concerned, I agree that the life of a local body should be five years at least.  I always believed that.  When the then Minister for Local Government introduced a Bill which passed through all stages, with the exception of the presentation of its Final Stage in the Dáil after it had been amended in this House twice, I was one of those who induced them to include in that Bill a provision that the life of the local bodies would be five years.</P>
    <P>Without going into any argument or performing the political tricks that were performed here and in the other House, I say I am standing over this question of extending the life of local bodies, the ones now in existence and the ones that will be elected for the years to come, to five years.  Not only am I relying upon the requests that have been made to me by the bodies cited, but I know full well that in doing what I am doing I am meeting what is the common request as far as the people in the country are concerned.</P>
    <P>I said before, and I will say it again, because I think this is what the ordinary man and woman in the country believes, elections are necessary. Elections are important and should be taken seriously.  The people <Col N="136" /> should participate in elections, whether national or local, but you can overdo elections, and it is not a good thing to have elections every other day.  It is not necessary for the preservation of democracy.</P>
    <P>Members of this House will remember that when the Management Act was extended to Cork City in 1929 provision was made that one-third of the members of the council went out each year and were replaced each year.  That was thought to be a safeguard.  The people who provided that system of election thought that that was a suitable and useful innovation.  It was found a few years afterwards that it was unworkable because the people were tired of elections every year.  I do not want to go into that, and I do not want to adopt a sort of parrot-like approach to this measure by saying that this principle is right, but it is not right now, or that it was right in 1948, but it is not right in 1952 or that it was all right in 1924 or in 1926, and so on.</P>
    <P>I must say that that form of approach and that type of argument, in my view, will get us nowhere.  I stand over this proposal, I believe in it, and it is supported by members of local bodies who are not a bit afraid of the electorate, because those sponsoring this measure have gone before the electorate on quite a number of occasions and, strange to say, many of them have been far more successful than some of those who would have you believe it is cowardice on our part to introduce these proposals now.</P>
    <P>I have been told that if I had introduced some more comprehensive proposals in so far as local government matters are concerned it might have had a better reception, and I suppose that had to do with the attitude of those who spoke along those lines to the managerial system.  In this approach, too, I think that public men and especially members of the local bodies are not doing themselves justice in always whining about this managerial system.  You have heard some of the history of it, and if I repeat it, it is not because I want just to push over the introduction of the principle on some political Party that is in <Col N="137" /> opposition to me over the years, but in order to show that Cumann na nGaedheal introduced the management system in Cork and Dublin and we extended it.</P>
    <P>Senator McGee was in error when he said that the President, who was then Minister for Local Government and who had a long association with local bodies, was not in any way responsible for the introduction of this principle. As a matter of fact, I am sure that the President was Minister for Local Government when the managerial system was extended&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When the managerial system was extended from Cork and Dublin to Limerick, the President was then Minister for Local Government. I say it was introduced by Cumann na nGaedheal, extended by us, and at a later period extended to the whole countryside.  At the time of its extension to the countryside I was a member of a local body, and there are members of my own Party who will be well able to recall what my attitude towards extension of the system was at the time.  I had no enthusiasm in the world for it.  At the same time I did not see how local government could be carried on unless some improvement was effected in the method of local administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I saw from my own experience that local services were extending at the time.  The boards of health were responsible for the public health services. I saw that the expenditure of vast sums of money on public health schemes of all kinds, water, sewerage, building of labourers' cottages and so on, was in the hands of ten men, unpaid, who had to look after their own business, busy men who had to meet sometimes once a week to make decisions on very important matters. You know what some of those ten men would face.  You know that you find <Col N="138" /> in local bodies some who will give their services in a whole-hearted way and some in a very partial way.  Some will attend meetings, sign the book and disappear.  Some will attend meetings and sit until the meeting is concluded, until all the business is done.</P>
    <P>As a member of one of those local bodies I found myself with a few others&mdash;sometimes with two, sometimes with less than a quorum&mdash;working into the late hours of the night making decisions upon questions affecting the ratepayers and taxpayers to the extent of thousands of pounds. Much and all as I would be hesitant when a question arose of relieving the local representatives of their powers and responsibilities, one would have to ask the question: &ldquo;Can this thing continue having regard to the way in which these services are expanding?&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>When I hear men who are members of this House and of the Dáil and of local bodies talking about the managerial system as if it has been clamped down on them by some set of men who are wedded to it, they are not doing themselves the simplest justice.  I am asked here by Senator McGee to disregard entirely the advice tendered to me by the municipal bodies and the General Council of County Councils when they passed resolutions dealing with the extension of their own political life in a representative way.  But when those bodies pass a resolution demanding an extension of their powers, which affects them just as intimately as the other, then according to Senator McGee I am to flout the expression of opinion in the one case and to follow it in the other.</P>
    <P>This proposal represents the solid thought of the people of the country. If one were to sit and listen here to the arguments advanced and to regard those arguments as in any way helpful to any person seriously wishing to make a contribution to giving local bodies and their members all the power and dignity and responsibility they should have, consistent with their capacity, having regard to all the other circumstances to discharge that responsibility, one would be very disappointed, <Col N="139" /> because you have that conflict of thought; and so much of it is based upon political reasoning and the desire to effect a score.</P>

If I did mention in the course of the discussion in the other House the fact that it was my intention to introduce proposals to amend the Management Acts it was not with the intention or desire of cajoling the House into believing that it was for that reason I was asking for extension of the life of the councils. These proposals will come to the House, and my challenge now to the members of local bodies who are members of this Seanad or outside it is this: The Management Acts are there, with the division of function as between the manager and the local bodies set out&mdash;the reserved functions and the managerial functions.  Would it not be a far more constructive thing if on some other more suitable occasion members of this House such as Senator McGee, who has been for many years the chairman of his own county council, and the councils themselves, would sit down some day and examine the Acts and point out what particular managerial functions they would have transferred by an amendment to be reserved functions? That would be something that would help the Minister to get ultimately a division as between the executive authority and the representative body.</P>

      <P>Surely, Senator McGee is aware of what happened in 1929 in the case of Cork when there was provision for an election every year and after three or four or five years that was amended.  It is only as a result of experience that an amendment is put into effect.  There may be a number of things about which Senator McGee and myself might be in doubt, and it is only by trial that the doubt will be resolved.  Those who introduced the managerial system first knew that, in the form in which it was introduced, it would have to be amended.  It has been amended since, and the chances are that it will be amended now.  In fact, I have decided on that, but only in a limited way.</P>
      <P>If there is any body of public opinion or any group of public representatives who, instead of belittling themselves and their responsibility in this House on other occasions, will settle themselves down to what the law is now and show the House the way in which they think that law should be amended and bring in the amendments to effect that, they will be making a far more useful contribution than by simply whining here and in other places about these things &ldquo;that are designed by political Parties&rdquo; and so on.  Political Parties have not only to face local bodies and meet their criticism but they have also to think in terms of the ordinary elector. The ordinary elector, when the managerial system was extended to the country, thought more enthusiastically about it than those of us who had more experience about its working in the city areas and of the disappointments that that change would bring when extended to the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to increase the amount that may be advanced to Bord na Móna to carry out the development programme which they have undertaken.  Under the existing legislation, there is a limit of £8,270,000 to such advances and it is proposed to raise that limit to £14,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other provisions of the Bill are designed (1) to make additional provision for the board's housing schemes; (2) to provide for the making of a contract of service with the managing director of the board, and (3) to provide for the introduction of pension schemes for the board's staff and whole-time members.  Senators are probably aware that Bord na Móna were directed to undertake schemes for the development of bogs for fuel, each designed to achieve a target of 1,000,000 tons per year production at the end of a ten-year period.  The first programme, which was launched <Col N="143" /> in 1946, is due to reach that level of production in 1956.  The additional funds are required for the completion of that programme.  The estimate of cost originally prepared has, of course, proved to be inaccurate by reason of the higher cost of materials and the higher wage rates now prevailing and also because a greater degree of mechanisation has been found practicable than was contemplated when the scheme was being prepared.</P>
    <P>For the second development programme, the provision in the 1950 Act only covered initial expenditure.  It was fully recognised that new legislation to raise the limit of advances would be required before that programme would be brought to its full development stage.  Originally, that programme was also designed to secure an annual production of 1,000,000 tons of sod turf by 1960 but it has been modified in the meantime and the aim now is to secure an annual production of 2,250,000 tons of milled peat by that year for the power stations which are being built by the E.S.B. in the vicinity of the board's bogs.</P>
    <P>Of the additional provision which this Bill proposes to make, a sum of £1,480,000 is required for the first development programme and the balance of £4,250,000 to complete the provision required for the second programme.</P>
    <P>The board has been constructing houses for its workers and it was entitled to draw, and was drawing, from the Central Fund grants towards the cost of these houses.  Under the 1950 Act, however, the grants were limited to £180 per house but it was intended that they should be supplemented by grants of £400 per house from the Transition Development Fund.  As it happened, that fund was wound up before the board were able to avail of its provisions and this Bill is designed to authorise the board to receive grants of £570 per house in respect of every house built by it&mdash;that is, those already built as well as those yet to be built&mdash;which is adequate, with some assistance from the board's <Col N="144" /> own funds, to enable these houses to be let to their workers at reasonable rents.</P>
    <P>As regards the provisions of the Bill which relate to the board's own organisation, there are two things to be said. The present managing director of the board is an officer of the Department of Industry and Commerce who, however, has been seconded almost continuously to Bord na Móna for this work since 1934.  The view is that the time has come to regularise his position, to establish him permanently as managing director of the board and to enter into a contract of service with him in the normal way.</P>
    <P>The view is also held that the time has come when it is desirable to have pension provisions for the board's permanent staff and for the managing director of the board.  The board is now a large organisation which is operating successfully on a project which is of great national importance and it is desirable that its permanent staff should feel that security in respect of the future which the establishment of a pension scheme will give.</P>
    <P>So far as the managing director is concerned, the provisions of the Bill are permissive.  A scheme may be prepared and brought into operation, subject to its being submitted to both Houses of the Oireachtas.  So far as the other members of the board are concerned, the Bill proposes to make it mandatory on the board to prepare such a scheme and to submit it to the Minister for Industry and Commerce who, subject to the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, may approve of it and submit it to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The position as regards the work of Bord na Móna is that the production under the first development plan is proceeding in accordance with expectations. The quantity of sod turf produced from the bogs developed under that plan last year was 568,000 tons. It will be, it is anticipated, substantially larger this year and there is no reason to think that an annual output of 1,000,000 tons will not be realised by 1956.</P>
    <P>In the case of the second development plan, it is, of course, to be understood <Col N="145" /> that none of these bogs is yet in production, but the development work on the bogs is proceeding satisfactorily and again there is no reason to anticipate that the production anticipated will not, in fact, be achieved. The board is now in the position that its operations are yielding a profit. The board had to take over certain debts due to the State by its predecessor, the Turf Development Board, and these debts, on the transfer date, amounted to £434,561.  By 1st April, 1952, that debt had been reduced to £261,713 and it was then arranged that the sum outstanding would be funded and repaid by means of half-yearly annuities over a period of 25 years.  The first of these annuities was paid on 1st October, 1952.</P>
    <P>Under the legislation which established it, the board was exempted from the obligation to pay interest on advances made prior to 21st June, 1951. That exemption from interest charges has now expired and the board is liable, since 1st April, 1952, for interest upon all advances made to it.  Interest payments amounting to £109,042 have already been made.  The board was not merely able to meet these charges and effect payment of the annuity for the wiping out of the inherited debt and make reasonable appropriations to depreciation and other reserves, but also to announce a reduction in the price of its product early this year, which would probably, in any event, have been necessitated by reason of the fall in coal prices about that time.</P>
    <P>The board is also engaged in the production of peat moss.  Its experience in that regard was that the market which it had opened in the United States of America was proving less remunerative than it originally was, mainly due to higher shipping freights and to growing competition from continental countries who, in the board's opinion, must be selling at less than production cost in their desire to get dollars by any means, or are enjoying the advantage of lower shipping freights than are possible here.  However, against the difficulties in the dollar market for peat moss litter, the home market is expanding very rapidly and also markets in the Six-County area and in Britain, and there is every <Col N="146" /> expectation that the board's output and sales of peat moss litter this year will be higher than in previous years and will continue to grow as the market expands.</P>
    <P>The importance of the work of Bord na Móna in providing fuel for power stations is perhaps best emphasised by the fact that the maximum development from water power which is now thought to be possible in this country will provide about 1,000,000,000 units annually which is less than our present consumption.  The plans of the E.S.B. made in conjunction with Bord na Móna involve the establishment of a number of new power stations using either sod or milled peat and coming into production to meet the growth in the demand between now and 1960, being adequate, but no more than adequate, by that year to meet the anticipated consumption.  It is, however, not easy to expedite the rate of development of bogs for fuel production. A period of three years is normally required for draining a bog before production can start at all and the development of the bog from that on must be carried out in accordance with its characteristics.  There is no means by which the output from a bog could be increased beyond that which the board has planned because of these characteristics of the work.</P>
    <P>With these new power stations, however, coupled with the water power stations which are being constructed or planned and the existing installed generating capacity of the board, it is anticipated that output will keep ahead of demand, even though one would prefer to see a wider margin during the period between now and 1960.  The board has not yet attempted to make plans for the period after 1960 in view of possible technical developments which may take place during that period.  It is necessary for the E.S.B. to have its construction programme settled more or less five years ahead, so that before the beginning of 1955 consideration of the programme after 1960 will have to be undertaken.</P>
    <P>So far as the board's housing is concerned, it has constructed to date 366 houses and has let most of these to its <Col N="147" /> employees.  The aim of the board is to have houses to spare in each area if it can.  The idea is that suitable workers can be attracted to permanent employment in the board's service in these areas if housing accommodation can be offered to them, and for that reason the board has aimed at keeping its housing programme in advance of its actual allocation of tenancies.  In some cases local authorities have pressed the board to transfer to the board's houses workers employed by the board at present occupying county council houses, but the board have resisted that pressure believing that there is no reason why they should provide houses for workers who are already comfortably housed in the locality of their employment.</P>
    <P>The idea behind the board's housing schemes is that they should make facilities available which will attract workers into the area in which there is employment.  The county councils have, of course, been reluctant themselves to provide houses solely for the board's employees because of the fact that most of these bog schemes are estimated to have a life of about 25 years and the normal provision for financing county council housing schemes requires a longer period for the repayment of the loans.  There are at present 104 houses under construction.</P>
    <P>The board is maintaining an experimental station at Droichead Nua, County Kildare, a station at which all problems connected with the production and utilisation of turf are investigated and from which close contact is maintained with developments in other countries of interest to it.  Its aim has been, of course, to mechanise the work completely and it has already made considerable progress in that direction.  Through mechanisation economies in manpower are possible and the work becomes more attractive to those engaged in it.  Drainage operations have been almost completely mechanised and work is constantly proceeding at the experimental station in the design and construction of experimental machines of various types <Col N="148" /> to cope with the problems which are experienced on the board's bogs.  The station has given particular attention to methods of securing the most economic and efficient utilisation of turf for industrial purposes.  A number of Irish manufacturers have, as a result of cooperation with the board, succeeded in introducing domestic turf-burning appliances which are not only highly efficient but attractive in design and finish.</P>
    <P>Recently the station has designed a special method of burning turf in industrial installations and several factories have installed it.  Those factories which installed it have confirmed the board's belief that not only have these installations secured a high degree of combustion efficiency but also have made possible a saving in fuel costs as compared with installations using coal or oil.  That achievement is one on which, I think, the board and its staff deserve to be congratulated.</P>
    <P>The economic advantage to the country of Bord na Móna's activities is obvious.  The social advantage should be equally obvious.  As a result of the board's work and the decision to develop the peat resources of the country for fuel production, employment has been introduced into areas of the country where the need for it was greatest and where other economic activities did not seem likely to succeed.  When the full programme of the board and the associated programme of the E.S.B. have been completed, it will have produced very considerable results in the social circumstances of many of the areas of the country, midland and western, which at one time seemed to offer difficult problems.</P>
    <P>The effect should also be to encourage what is the Government's desire, the decentralisation of industry, and the availability not merely of electric power but of cheap fuel where electric power is not suitable in the bog areas, should in the course of time tend to attract new industrial activities there. The work of the board has secured universal approval and for that reason I can with some confidence recommend this Bill to the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a measure which is acceptable to every side of the House and every Party in the country and so it is easy to debate.  For myself, I welcome this measure.  I think the proposals which it contains in regard to provision for housing for the staff and provision for the future of the employees in regard to superannuation are to be welcomed.  They will give a sense of security to the people employed in this scheme in regard to the superannuation which, I think, is of the utmost importance because the morale of people working in a scheme like this is something which it is essential to maintain.</P>
      <P>There are times when we hear the sound of our own voices and when we listen to the voices of our opponents and we feel disposed to be rather depressed about our own achievements and our hopes for the future.  Yet I think it is only mere justice to us on both sides of the House to say that we have certain achievements to our credit and to the country's credit which it is time we would all speak of with pride.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know I cannot say it of the Minister specifically, but there were days when the effort of Mr. McGilligan, as Minister for Finance, in the Shannon scheme was something which was decried. We know that there was very little notice taken of the first sugar-beet factory erected by the late Deputy Paddy Hogan when he was Minister for Agriculture, and we know that there has been considerable criticism of the efforts to develop our peat resources.  I have had the privilege of being in opposition, I might say, when all those efforts were being made, and I am glad to be able to say that to each of those in their day I gave my ardent support.  I think it is of importance to us and to our future that we would try to visualise the significance of each particular development in a new field from the national point of view and make what contribution we can in our discussions to ensure that that development will be along healthy lines, to be critical in <Col N="150" /> such a way as will ensure that good will come from our criticism of it, but that we wish it well and will do what we can to give it the measure of support which public men ought to give to every new effort when we are satisfied that the country as a whole is going to benefit therefrom.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was here on a previous occasion with legislation for Bord na Móna I felt in the position of being able to give it my support and to express certain views in regard to this development which to my mind were of some significance.  The ramifications of Bord na Móna to-day are very considerable and their effects on the life of the country are of great significance.  The Minister's successor in office in the last Government carried on the work that had been started by Mr. Lemass, and it does not matter what change may come about in the Government of the country, the development of our peat resources is something which has been embarked upon on a national scale and from which we can retreat only by admitting incapacity on our part to do the things every good nationalist must do in his country if it is going to make progress.</P>
    <P>I have seen the work of Bord na Móna on a number of occasions.  I saw it in its early life and somewhat later and I have seen it quite recently.  I welcome the developments that are taking place and I have been glad to see them.  It would be a helpful thing if those members of the Oireachtas who have not yet had the privilege of seeing the work being done on the extensive bogs now in possession of Bord na Móna could see it.</P>
    <P>The houses which have been erected down there are very attractive.  They are a considerable addition from the point of view of building up family life in close proximity to the source of employment.  In so far as this Bill will make provision for additional housing I am all in favour of it.  Men ought to live as closely as possible, or reasonably close, to their work.  I do not want to build houses in the middle of the bog.  That would not be wise and it is not being done.  The plan devised and executed there is very good indeed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="151" /> Obviously it is essential in a big organisation like Bord na Móna to make provision for the future of the employees.  It is not an easy thing to get men to go into the heart of a bog and start the sort of development which had to be undertaken down there.  Bogs are all right for those of us who spend a few weeks in midsummer in them and go off then to various activities on the farm.  They can be very attractive places, very friendly places; but when you have to build up a personnel who have to live most of their lives on the bogs it is not always so attractive.  They are remote from civilisation.  The wild birds may pass from one point to another but in the heart of a bog where these men work they are not as near to the amenities of life that many people say are essential to the rural community if we are to keep the rural community where they are.  Those amenities are not available to these people so something must be done to ensure that you will keep the sort of people you want in an organisation like that.</P>
    <P>The development of this organisation demands a type of pioneer which it is not always easy to buy.  To a certain extent, this is pioneering work.  If you are to have trained personnel, it is not good enough to train them and then permit them to go away into other occupations when they reach the stage where their knowledge, capacity and executive ability should be available. That is a very important aspect of this measure.</P>
    <P>With regard to the whole general problem of the development of electricity from our peat resources, with regard to the problems of the sale of electricity by the E.S.B. and the other problem which is part of it, which the Minister dealt with elsewhere a week or so ago&mdash;the utilisation of peat for the growing of grass&mdash;I want to suggest to the Minister, inasmuch as all these three activities are under his direct control, that the time has come &mdash;I said something like this in the debate on the legislation for the grass meal project at Bangor Erris, but I <Col N="152" /> want to expand a little on it now&mdash;in my opinion, from the overall point of view of the best utilisation of our resources, when some authority, some commission, some body should be got together to study the utilisation of these resources anew.</P>
    <P>If you discuss this with Bord na Móna and the people who have the task of developing electricity from peat, they have one point of view.  It may very well be that if you talk to the people in the E.S.B. they have a slightly different point of view about the utilisation of peat for power resources.  There is, however, a new development of the utmost importance, perhaps more important to the country's future than the development of electricity from peat, and that is what Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann have started beyond Ballyforan, between Roscommon and Galway.  It is clear to anyone who has gone there and to people who make an effort to study the proper utilisation of soil resources, that there are possibilities for the cultivation of our peat soils that we have not dreamed of in the past.  My view is that we have reached such a stage of development now that the whole situation ought to be considered anew.</P>
    <P>Obviously, there are contracts between the E.S.B. and Bord na Móna. The people in the E.S.B. have the responsibility to sell power, to sell light and heat.  They are concerned, as we are all concerned, about the price at present and the cost in the future.  We are concerned about the cost to-day and it is not inconsiderable in any home.  In fact, many of us think it is rather too high.  We hear complaints about the cost.  I have been told elsewhere&mdash;and the Minister has told us too, I think&mdash;that the electricity being developed to-day from peat is costing less than what is developed from imported fuel.  That is very welcome news indeed.  If the cost of electricity can be brought down, so much the better.  The aim should be to bring it down.</P>
    <P>It is most important for all of us to realise that many services in this country cost too much to-day.  While it may be a very meritorious thing to try to provide employment, the aim <Col N="153" /> must not be to provide employment at any cost.  If the service is too expensive, it may indeed have the effect of denying the possibility of employment in another field.  Because one service may be too expensive, the possibilities of providing employment in another field may be denied.  From that angle, therefore, the cost of electricity is, in the first instance, the intimate concern of the E.S.B.  Definitely, there should be a linking-up of these two bodies.  Here again, however, in surveying our electricity needs and the possibility of supplying these needs out of our peat resources, you cannot leave aside consideration of the possibility of the development of our peat resources for new purposes. From what I have seen of the developments that are taking place under Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, I think that perhaps these are to-day coming to the point where they may be of even greater importance to the nation than the development of electricity from peat.  I hope I do not shock the Minister or the people in Bord na Móna or the enthusiasts or pioneers who did so much to get this going.</P>
    <P>It is true that power in every country is a terribly essential service.  Power commands, controls, orders the way of life of the civilised world.  But there is something which is all important, which creates power and which we in this island can never lose sight of: I refer to the possibility of the power to produce more food here.</P>
    <P>In our recent developments here in peat I see possibilities of producing immense quantities of food that we have not dreamed of heretofore.  My view is that before we go much further in extending the area to Bord na Móna for the development of power we ought to set up a body of people to study how the nation will best be served.  I do not know.  As I see it, the problem of providing food for the world is going to be a much more difficult and complicated job than the problem of providing power.  I think it will be possible to provide power when it will not be possible to provide food.  Perhaps I may put it in another way.  It may very well be that from an acre of peat, the resources of which would be <Col N="154" /> properly developed, you could provide much more power.  You could provide yourself with something which, when exchanged, would buy something that would create much more power than the development of these resources directly in the form of electricity.</P>
    <P>I am convinced, as I said, that the food resources of the world are not going to be equal to or adequate for the needs for the world's population in the future.  Because of that, I urge the Minister, now that a certain stage of development has been reached and before he goes very much further, to study this aspect of the problem.  I do not want to cramp or hamper anything that Bord na Móna visualises as being its responsibility and its need to provide the power for our electricity authority in the future but it seems to me that our most immediate need is the proper utilisation of the surface resources of the country.  I have no hesitation whatever in saying that future generations will praise the foresight of the man who will see the necessity now, before we go too far in any particular direction, of trying to get such a balance in our total economy as will ensure the best development, from the point of view of the future of the nation, with the resources that are available to us.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in Athlone, or outside it, that there were 1,000,000 acres of peat which could be turned into good soil.  I think there are much more.  You have a very strange problem in this country from the point of view of the area of land available for distribution.  You have the problem of congestion in the West&mdash;and that is where you have your peat resources. Somebody may say: &ldquo;When the bog has supplied the power you will have what remains and we can turn that into good and fruitful soil.&rdquo;  I should hope that will be done.  The Minister may recall what I said on a previous occasion when another Bill of his was under consideration in this House.  I was on the Kildare bogs within the past few weeks.  I was rather surprised to see how much of the bog is still left.  If we must wait until we cut the top turf away, and wait for the cutting that is left to make farms, then I fear <Col N="155" /> that new generations will be dead before that point is reached.  That is what struck me about it.  I do not want to see that happen.  I have the feeling that before that time comes we will have new and probably unheard sources of power available to us and at our disposal.</P>
    <P>I think that the biggest job before us at the present time in this country is to see whether we can get another 1,000,000 or 2,000,000 acres of land.  We talk about winning back that part of the Province of Ulster which we have lost but we can win here, within our own territory, millions of acres of land for our own people.  I saw grass growing on the bogs outside Ballyforan last week and no grass in the County Cavan is as good as it from the point of view of its fruitfulness.  An immense and expensive task of reclamation was undertaken there but I submit that that task represented buying new land and buying it with Irish labour, with Irish resources within our own country and with our own currency.  When you think of the other problem that confronts you and the cost involved in taking 200 or 300 acres somewhere in Leinster and exchanging with a 200-acre man in Connaught; bringing him up to Westmeath, Louth, Dublin or County Meath and then trying to distribute his 200 acres in Connaught amongst 30 or 40 ten-acre men down there, you cannot but realise the truth of what I say.  You see the vast expenditure which is involved in establishing a few new homes or building up a few of the old ones.  I suggest to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that there is an immense problem there to be tackled.</P>
    <P>The Minister has never pretended to know much about agriculture.  I should say that externally he is interested in it and I am quite satisfied that he could make himself up on it very well, if he gave it a little attention, and, as I have said before, it would not do the country any harm, if he did.  We would perhaps get a better balance in our economy.</P>
    <P>It is of the utmost importance that he should do so and what I am speaking of is not just something that <Col N="156" /> strikes me because I am enthusiastic about the project the Minister has put before us.  I speak of it because of my knowledge of soils and of what soils can do with proper treatment and management and because I am convinced there is a vast scope and immense possibilities for ourselves there, if we have the courage to face them. I urge this type of development because it is something like this a country wants to-day to capture its imagination, to turn its mind a little away from itself and perhaps a little away from the narrow stream into which we have tended to drift, to the country's detriment and not to our own advantage.</P>
    <P>I urge very strongly that the best interests of Bord na Móna, of the E.S.B. and, above all, of the people of the nation will be served by giving attention to the point of view I have expressed.  I am absolutely convinced that I am not alone in this opinion. There are not many people in the country who have interested themselves in this, but there are people of some authority and with some knowledge who are satisfied that such a survey as this is now urgent and that if it were tackled by the Minister, we would get a new picture, a new plan of an approach to the development of this nation's resources.  Even to-day, I believe we are on the way, through the development of our peat resources, to influencing the climate of this country. The drainage which has taken place and which must take place as a result of development under Bord na Móna and other bodies will do a great deal to dispel the &ldquo;mists that do be on the bogs&rdquo; and I hope we will make an effort to dispel these elsewhere, too.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>The development of the peat resources of this country was one of the main planks of the old Sinn Féin policy and it was only natural that, when Fianna Fáil became the Government of the country in 1932, they should take immediate steps to set up an organisation charged with the undertaking of the development of such resources.  As Senator Baxter stated, these suggestions were received with grave doubts, and with more than doubts in many cases, as to their desirability  <Col N="157" /> or their chances of success, but, despite that opposition, the board then set up and the Bill we now have before us must satisfy each and every one of us that the confidence the Minister then had that the work which he charged this body with doing could be done has been justified.  We have the proof to-day in the great development work that has been carried out over a number of years.  It is true that the war years intervened and that the board's activities had to be directed not to the purposes for which it was set up but rather towards the winning, or helping in the winning, of a sufficient supply of fuel for home and factory use.</P>
      <P>When we look back at the progress that has been made and find that the Bill before us makes provision for an additional sum of something like £15,000,000 for future development work and for guaranteeing to the workers engaged in this very important industry a certain sense of security, it is gratifying to those of us who supported these projects at the time.  The board undertook the erection of houses and this has proved very beneficial in attracting workers to the remote parts of the country where these works are carried out.  As time went on, the proposal came before this and the other House that the E.S.B. should be charged with the setting up of generating stations and Bord na Móna with the provision of fuel in the shape of turf.  There were also grave doubts expressed then, and, when the Bill came before this House, we had questions asked from all sides as to the advisability of the project, as to whether there had been tests, whether it had been proved a success elsewhere and so forth.  Now that the project has been gone ahead with, we find that not alone has it lived up to expectations but has surpassed the expectations even of those who were most enthusiastic about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some months ago, we had here another Bill making provision for generating electricity from milled peat and we had further questions as to what steps had been taken to ensure that, if the work was undertaken, it would be a success.  While all these questions were being asked, the board <Col N="158" /> went forward with their projects and we are all glad to see that they have all been successful.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter referred to the scheme carried out by the Irish Sugar Company in Gowla, outside Ballyforan, and I think the Sugar Company, and particularly the manager, deserve the best praise the country can give. They have undertaken a project which may prove to be even more beneficial to the country than that carried out to date by Bord na Móna.  It is because of the confidence the Minister and the Government had in the development of these resources that this scheme is possible at all.  We all hope it will meet with every success.</P>
    <P>While there is no provision in regard to it in this Bill I want to thank the Minister for announcing the proposal to erect a generating station in the West of Ireland.  Here we have a large area of bog which has been found suitable and it is proposed to fire the station by hand-won turf.  This will give much-needed employment to our people there.  It is a type of work which deserves the most serious consideration and the Minister has the best wishes of all sections and classes of the people of the district in his decision to have the generating station situated there.  In order that the scheme may be a success, however, the people in the district are very anxious that the drainage and other necessary preparatory work, together with the erection of the station, should be undertaken as early as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few scattered remarks about the policy involved in this Bord na Móna Bill.  I think we may well congratulate the Minister and all concerned on the success of the activities of Bord na Móna, but I think we must also agree with the general point of view of Senator Baxter that the development of our peat resources should be pursued within the framework of some overall view of the economy of the country as a whole. We must bear in mind that Bord na Móna is competing with other economic activities for scarce resources of capital and labour and that it is <Col N="159" /> in the national interest that the most effective use should be made of all our available resources, human and other.</P>
      <P>From that point of view I welcome especially the fact that many of these Bord na Móna enterprises are likely to be situated in the congested districts. I think I heard the Minister state that it is intended to place some of them, at any rate, in areas which hitherto have been known for congestion and have been for many generations centres of depression.  In that case they will make a real contribution to the employment of people who hitherto have had to migrate to other countries in order to obtain a livelihood.</P>
      <P>It also happens that some of these Bord na Móna enterprises are situated in the Midlands and near very good agricultural districts.  The Bog of Allen is surrounded by good quality agricultural land and, to my own personal knowledge, it has happened that Bord na Móna has attracted away to their enterprises labour which might conceivably have been doing a better job for the country though not perhaps for themselves if they had continued working as agricultural labourers. In other words, there has been an intensified scarcity of agricultural labour in certain parts of the Midlands because of the attractions of work on the bog carried on by Bord na Móna. I rather think that the rate of wages paid is a real attraction to these people because in spite of the substantial increase in the wages of agricultural labourers, the wages and other amenities of work on the bogs are definitely better and more valuable than wages associated with agricultural labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how far it is possible to guarantee continuity of employment for a uniform volume of labour in these Bord na Móna enterprises throughout the whole 12 months of the year.  From a social point of view it is very desirable that it should be possible to guarantee such continuity of labour and such reasonably civilised conditions of living as will enable them to develop into an organised and happy community of rural workers.  I believe you <Col N="160" /> have there the possibilities of developing a highly desirable form of communal life and it should be something which will enrich the lives of people taking part in the work on the bogs and also add to the variety and interest of the lives of the farmers and others living in the immediate neighbourhood of the Bord na Móna enterprises.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the expected life of any given Bord na Móna enterprise was a matter of perhaps 25 years.  Therefore, any houses that are built to accommodate the workers might reasonably expect to be no longer needed when the bog is exhausted.  But surely it is the case that when all the turf that we want or that is available has been exploited, what is left behind will be in many cases the makings of quite good agricultural land.  Some of the best land in the country is what people call cut-away bog.  I should be very much surprised if such land has not got the makings of first-class agricultural land, even after the peat has been removed. That being so, I think it would be possible to continue these colonies of workers in the houses that have been built, no longer, perhaps, after 25 years, as cutters of turf but as exploiters of the new agricultural land that has been created.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter expressed the view that there is competition between the possible use of bogland for growing grass by the Sugar Company and for cutting turf by Bord na Móna.  At the moment we have such a tremendous amount of available land for either the Sugar Company to experiment on or Bord na Móna to cut turf on that there is no real danger of exhausting that resource in the foreseeable future. Therefore, so far as that is concerned the two can go ahead and each will find a place where they can usefully operate.</P>
    <P>With regard to the production of peat mould from the bog, I know a case where a certain farmer had been a grain farmer until the last of his workers went off to work for Bord na Móna; then he had to content himself with being a grass farmer on an intensive scale.  He went in for the modern technique of growing grasses and preserving <Col N="161" /> them in the form of silage and fed 30 or 40 cattle in sheds in the winter with the produce of his intensive summer production and conservation of grasses.</P>
    <P>The one necessary thing which any person feeding cattle in houses must have is something to absorb the animal manure and in the ordinary way that is straw.  However, another of the Minister's enterprises provided an alternative market for straw, so that this farmer had some difficulty in acquiring straw in competition with that industrial enterprise in Athy.  He did not have it on his own farm, because, as I said, the last of his workers went off to work for Bord na Móna and he was in a serious difficulty in trying to acquire the means of bedding the animals, 30 or 40 of which he was feeding in the sheds all winter.  He would have liked to substitute for straw the peat mould produced by Bord na Móna at Kilberry, but on making inquiries he found the price of that commodity was so fantastically high that it was quite uneconomic for him to use peat mould in that particular way.</P>
    <P>In a case like that where, owing to one cause or another, including the policy of Bord na Móna, farmers are unable to use straw for making manure, it would be highly desirable that they should let such farmers have peat mould at a price which would enable it to perform the function which normally straw performs, at a price which it would be worth their while to pay.  I think that matter requires looking into by all concerned and it is very important that the manure which results from feeding cattle in the winter time should be available in convenient form to be put back into the land for future cultivation.</P>
    <P>There is only one other point and that is that this whole business of the maximum advantage to be obtained from our peat resources is largely a question of applied science.  I gather that there is some kind of experimental station at Newbridge, but I am not quite certain, from what I heard of the Minister's remarks, whether that implies a chemical research unit into the various possible ways of using our peat <Col N="162" /> resources.  For example, I speak as one ignorant of the chemical considerations involved but it is conceivable to me, at any rate, that it might at some stage be more economical to distil the peat on the bogs and pipe the resulting calorific gases from the bogs to places where it would be used instead of laboriously bringing it many miles to the centres of population.</P>
    <P>In other words, it might conceivably be possible and even desirable at some stage to treat peat as a source of inflammable gas in the same way and by the same methods as we treat coal in order to produce coal gas.  In that case there would result from such distillation various chemical substances, of which I do not even know the names, and it is conceivable that some of those substances might be of considerable industrial and economic importance, I think we should maintain in connection with Bord na Móna's activities a chemical and scientific research unit designed to investigate the possibilities of making the most effective use of our peat resources in one way or another.</P>

      <P>As ceantar móna mé féin agus b'fhéidir gur fearr a thuigeann mo leithéid an dul chun cinn sin ná daoine nach raibh baint riamh acu le cúrsaí móna.</P>
      <P>Is cuimhin liomsa go maith sa bhliain 1932 nuair a bhí móin á dhíol ar 8/- an tonna, ba shuarach an luach saothair sin do na daoine bochta a bhí ag obair ar shábháil na móna.  Deireadh na filí go mbídís ag obair fadó ar raol agus breicfeast mar pháigh.  Ní mór fairis sin a bhí ag na daoine bochta seo.</P>
      <P>Ba thrua iad agus tháinig cuid againn le chéile agus d'iarramar ar an Rialtas teacht i gcabhair orthu.  Thánadar. Do chuadar in urrús air go bhfaighidís a dhúbailt sin ar a laghad. Ba mhór an dul chun cinn é sin. Ansan cuireadh na cumainn móna ar bun agus is astu san d'fhás Bord na Móna.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cheapadar san tar éis tamaill gur <Col N="163" /> ró-mhall mar ghléas an sleán.  Dheineadar scrúdú ar an scéal agus cuireadh daoine amach go dtí an Eóraip ar lorg eolais.</P>
    <P>Deineadh céim mhór ar aghaidh nuair a cromadh ar mhóin a shábháil le hinnill.</P>
    <P>Ina dhiaidh sin chromadar ar aibhléis a ghiniúint le cumhacht na móna. Ach is dóigh liom féin gurb é an dul chun cinn ba mhó ná an beartú a dhein an Aire, monarchana beaga a chur ar bun sna portaigh bheaga.</P>
    <P>Má cuirtear na monarchana beaga ar bun is féidir an mhóin d'úsáid go díreach in aice na bportach.  Sin é an rud is tábhachtaí ar fad agus is mór an chabhair é sin do na feirmeoirí beaga.  In ionad ganntanas beidh siad compordach&mdash;agus is mó duine mar sin sna ceantair ina raibh na portaigh bheaga.  Beidh siad neamhspleách agus ní bheidh siad ag braith ar dheontais ná aon rud eile.  Beidh siad ag tuilleamh airgid lena gcuid oibre féin.</P>
    <P>Rud adúirt an Seanadóir Baxter, chuir sé áthas mór orm&mdash;faoin rud ar a dtugtar an &ldquo;cutaway,&rdquo; an athchalla. Is mór an úsáid a baintear as sin thiar mar a bhfuilimse.  Chonaic mé an móinfhéar is tiorma agus an féar is fearr atá le fáil san Iarthar ar na portaigh seo, agus barraí breátha prátaí.  Chonaic mé leis barraí biatais á mbaint agus á sábháil ar na portaigh seo.

In áiteanna nach bhfuil na húdaráis go teann, éiríonn leo an mhóin a chur amach agus an gual a chur ina háit. Is mór an náire é sin.  B'fhéidir nach mbaineann sé seo leis an Aire féin ach b'fhéidir go gcuirfeadh sé cogar i gcluais Aire eile gur cheart smacht éigin a bheith ann, d'fhonn go bhféadfaidís an mhóin d'úsáid nuair a bhíonn sí le fáil.</P>

Ní bheadh sé ró-dhona dá mbé gual na hÉireann é ach is baol liom, do réir mar a chuala, gur gual é a tugadh thar sáile.  Is iontach an scéal é agus is mór an náire é más fíor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand Senator Baxter's idea it is that a stage may be reached at which the various possible uses of our turf resources will come into conflict and that we should now plan ahead to avoid any such situation.  I think Senator Johnston is correct in saying that there is no real danger of a conflict of that kind.  A few statistics, I think, may help to settle that.  We have about 3,000,000 acres of peat bog in this country. Bord na Móna has secured 80,000 of these and is working on about 50,000 acres.  It is true that a large part of that total acreage would be mountain blanket bog of the kind that Bord na Móna could not work with its present methods and it has acquired control over a large number of the areas of deep bog; but nevertheless there is I think sufficient area of bogland available to permit us to say to everybody who has ideas for its use, &ldquo;go ahead and try them out&rdquo; without risk that they will come into collision with one another after a time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Baxter that the work done at Gowla Bog is of very great significance and holds out the possibility of a very wide area of hitherto derelict land being brought into cultivation.  I feel confident from the results already obtained that the sugar company's experts are going to bring about at Gowla the development they anticipate and which I hope will be brought in Mayo through the work of the new grass meal company.  That does not really raise any issue so far as the availability of peat for fuel purposes is concerned, because they do not use the peat.  It is true that they cultivate it.  They drain it, fertilise it and plant and get crops off it, but the peat is still there if ever we should <Col N="165" /> need it for fuel purposes.  Bord na Móna uses the peat and will leave behind a cutaway bog which will be either adapted for agricultural cultivation or used for forestry centres.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnston is quite right in his view that the working out of the bogs does not necessarily mean an end to employment in those areas.  Bord na Móna are confident that as far as the midland bogs are concerned they can be used for agricultural purposes and that the western bogs can be used for afforestation purposes, activities which will give an equivalent amount of permanent employment.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnston raised the wider question of Bord na Móna being in competition with the other activities for available resources of capital and labour.  That is hardly a problem that arises specifically on this Bill.  At some stage it may be necessary to apportion those resources to the most profitable uses, but I do not think that we have reached that stage yet.  It is true that Bord na Móna's activity in some districts has created a problem in relation to availability of agricultural labour, but taking the situation as a whole, there is still labour enough to fill the needs of all the undertakings which are now proceeding; and changes are taking place in agriculture which I think will prevent any problem of that kind arising for some time.  I mean the increased use of machines in agricultural production which to some extent replace labour and also make possible the payment by agriculture of wages comparable to those obtainable in other employments.</P>
    <P>The possibility of using peat as a basis for a chemical industry has recently been the subject of an investigation under a technical assistance project. The investigation was carried out under the auspices of an expert committee and the report of that committee is now being prepared.  I understand that I will receive it in the very near future, when it will be published for general information.  I remember years ago a very distinguished Irish professor who was interested in the possible use of peat for the production of chemicals telling me that I would live to see the day when I would be <Col N="166" /> passing a law prohibiting people from burning turf because it would have been discovered that it was of much greater value for other purposes.  I do not know if we will get to that day in my time, but there are, no doubt, possibilities there.  How strong those possibilities are from an economic point of view may be made clear by the report of this Technical Assistance Committee to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>It is true that in the case of the bogs which Bord na Móna are working nothing has yet been done to bring into cultivation any part of them.  That is because the work has not proceeded far enough.  So far as the midland bogs which are being worked for the production of sod peat are concerned, areas will become available in the course of time on which Bord na Móna intend to work either with a view to their development for agricultural uses or for afforestation purposes, and they are already giving attention to that matter; but there is no area available yet because the parts of those bogs from which the turf is being removed are still in use as drying ground.</P>
    <P>As far as the western bogs are concerned, from which milled peat is being produced, I understand that the bog will be worked out simultaneously over the whole area.  In any event, it is afforestation which is contemplated there, which would require a very substantial acreage before effective work could be done.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna has not got responsibility in connection with hand-won turf, and I am anxious to maintain that situation.  During the war when it was necessary to organise the production of hand-won turf on an extensive scale Bord na Móna was conscripted for that purpose.  It operated its own hand turf production schemes in County Kildare, and after the war it had passed over to it the various schemes which had previously been operated by the county councils.  It was never intended, however, that Bord na Móna should remain in a position in which they would have responsibility in regard to hand-won turf.  Its job is the mechanisation of turf production, production of the cheapest possible type of fuel from turf mainly for <Col N="167" /> electricity generating purposes.  It was because we recognised that the passing of the fuel scarcity and consequently the reduced demand for hand-won turf would create temporary problems in the areas into which an exceptional degree of prosperity was introduced by wartime conditions that we decided to establish these small electricity stations, to be based upon hand-won turf.</P>
    <P>As Senator Hawkins has said, the E.S.B. have been asked repeatedly by me to get ahead with their plans for their erection as quickly as possible, although it is inevitable that it will take a couple of years to get them into operation.  The purpose of these plants is primarily to help conditions in those areas.  It is recognised that they would not produce electricity as cheaply as the larger stations in the Midlands, but our justification for proceeding with them nevertheless is that other forms of Government aid to rural areas do not really apply in those districts. Guaranteed prices for wheat, or farm grants of one kind or another, and the various types of aid which the community gives to agriculture in the country as a whole, would produce less effective results in those isolated areas, and consequently there is justification for supplementing them in some way, and this appears to be the best way.</P>
    <P>The most obvious of the local resources is peat and by ensuring a market for a substantial quantity of that peat at a reasonable price you can introduce in these areas a flow of money which is bound to have beneficial social results.  But, apart from that special effort, the intention is that hand-won turf will get back to the prewar position in which the producers would seek local markets and expect to get them because of the lower price of their product as compared with prices of other fuels in these markets.</P>
    <P>Our estimate is that approximately 230,000 tons of hand-won turf will be purchased this year and that it will not be much below, if at all, the quantity purchased last year.  Last year, a substantial portion of the hand-won <Col N="168" /> turf produced was not, in fact, sold and, in accordance with the guarantee given, was taken up by Bord na Móna for resale to the E.S.B.  That guarantee does not operate this year and we have been at pains to make it clear to the local turf producers that they have to rely upon local markets and that they should limit their productions to what they think the local markets will absorb until these new stations are operating and prepared to take their output.</P>
    <P>It is true, as was stated here, that there were doubts originally as to the practicability of developing peat fuel on the scale on which we are now doing it.  These doubts have been resolved in time and, as Senator Baxter said, the idea of going ahead with the development of our peat bogs for fuel purposes has now the support of every section of the community.</P>

      <P>An Order was made under the Control of Imports Act prohibiting the importation, except under licence, of rayon cloths manufactured to resemble woollen and worsted suitings, containing more than 85 per cent. by way of artificial silk staple fibre which exceed eight ounces in weight per square yard and which are not less than 37 inches in width.  Subsequently it was found that these cloths were being imported at less than 37 inches in width and that the quota Order was being evaded in that way.  This amending Order was made so as to extend the scope of the quota on spun rayon suitings to cloths of a width of more than 18 inches.</P>

    <Title>Land (No.2) Bill, 1952&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Derrig) Thomas Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, as the long title indicates, proposes to amend and extend the Land Purchase Acts.  It is complicated by numerous references to existing provisions in those Acts but this is inevitable as the object of the Bill, I think I may fairly and truly state, is to make modifications which experience has shown to be desirable rather than to introduce any new basic principles.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to permit the creation of land bonds bearing a higher rate of interest than 4 per cent.  The Land Bond Act, 1934, under which the Minister for Finance periodically creates series of bonds for the financing of land purchase, prescribes a maximum rate of interest of 4 per cent.  That Act also requires the Minister for Finance, when fixing the rate of interest for a series of bonds, to have regard to Stock Exchange quotations with a view to fixing a rate which would secure that the market price of the bonds would remain at or near par for a reasonable period after creation of the series.  As this requirement and the 4 per cent. maximum are no longer compatible it is proposed to remove the interest limitation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each Land Bond Order made by the Minister for Finance specifies a period <Col N="170" />&mdash;usually a calendar year&mdash;and the bonds created by the Order are available for payment of prices agreed upon or fixed during that period.  The latest Land Bond Order created 4 per cent. bonds for prices agreed upon or fixed during the year 1952.  Pending the enactment of the present Bill the Minister for Finance has not made any Land Bond Order for the price fixation period which commenced on the 1st January, 1953.  The result is that since the beginning of this year there have been no bonds available to enable prices to be agreed upon or fixed for land which the Land Commission propose to acquire and resume.</P>
    <P>When the land bond interest limitation is removed on the enactment of section 4 (1) of the Bill the Minister for Finance will be in a position to create a series of bonds bearing such rate of interest as will maintain their market price at or near par for a reasonable period.  It will then be possible to resume price negotiations and fixations.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed, in Section 5 of the Bill, to substitute the new bonds in pending cases where prices have already been agreed upon or fixed but the relevant 4 per cent., 3½ per cent. or 3 per cent. bonds are not issued before the new bonds become available.  In addition to these pending cases, it is proposed to extend the scope of the Bill to land which has been taken over by the Land Commission since the Bill was introduced.  It would not, however, be practicable to substitute the new bonds in those particular cases as 4 per cent., 3½ per cent. or 3 per cent. bonds have already been issued. Accordingly, Section 6 is designed to bring about approximately the same financial result as if new bonds were substituted.  It is proposed in the case where bonds have already been issued, to achieve this by the issue of additional bonds in the form of a &ldquo;bonus&rdquo;; the determination of the appropriate bonus percentage is left to the Minister for Finance as it is a matter related to the rate of interest borne by bonds for which he is also responsible.  The Minister for Finance fixes the rate of interest.  The bonus bonds will bear the same rate of interest as the bonds <Col N="171" /> originally issued in each case.  The principal cases in which the additional bonds are to be issued are those in which the Land Commission have taken possession of the lands since the 11th December, 1952.  That is the date on which leave was granted by the Dáil for the introduction of the Bill and it has been selected as the most appropriate date after full consideration of the circumstances.</P>
    <P>So far I have been mainly concerned with the rate of interest payable on land bonds.  There is also a rate of sinking fund for each series of bonds. The sum of the rates of interest and sinking fund represents the rate of annuity.  Since 1923, the rate of annuity has been 4¾ per cent.  The interest element has varied, according to the particular issue of land bonds, from 4½ per cent. to 3 per cent. and the balance of ¼ per cent to 1¾ per cent. has represented sinking fund in repayment of principal.  To cover interest and sinking fund for future bonds, it is necessary to provide for the possibility of a higher rate of annuity; this entails adaptation of existing statutory references to the rate of 4¾ per cent. and the matter is dealt with in the Schedule to the Bill, which effects the required adaptation and other consequential amendments.  The annuity rate will continue to be fixed by the Land Bond Order creating each series of bonds and will apply to lands purchased by means of bonds of the series; the halving of new annuities under the Land Act, 1933, will also continue.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill do not in any way affect annuities already set up.</P>
    <P>To summarise, where the land bonds have already been issued in what I may describe as pending cases, cases that have been dealt with since the introduction of this legislation, the purpose is to issue bonus or additional bonds bearing the same rate of interest as those already issued for the transaction. We do not know where the bonds originally issued may be&mdash;they possibly have changed hands and are no longer in the hands of the vendor to the Land Commission&mdash;and, in order to avoid complications and to have the same <Col N="172" /> order of bonds dealing with the particular transaction, we have arranged in the Bill that, where the bonds have already been issued and where we are now proposing to increase the amount to bring it up as nearly as possible to a suitable market rate of the bonds, we are adding these bonus bonds.  The determination of the percentage additions will be a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>If no bonds have been issued, the new series created at a new rate of interest by the Minister for Finance will be available and the whole transaction will be covered in a single item by the issue of bonds bearing the new rate of interest, whatever that may be, under the new series and that will be done by the Minister for Finance making an Order under the 1934 Act.  That is the chief purpose of the Bill&mdash;to see that those who sell land to the Land Commission are not penalised by having to take bonds which are very much lower in market value than they might properly be expected to be.  We are trying to adjust that position.</P>
    <P>We are also increasing the total amount of land bonds that may be created under the 1934 Land Bond Act which limits the amount to £10,000,000. Although there is a balance of more than £3,000,000 still available which would enable land purchase to be financed for some years to come, the present opportunity is taken to raise the limit by a further £5,000,000.  The necessary amendment is effected by Section 7 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is also an important provision relating to a concession in regard to certain prices.  The Land Act, 1950, which laid down market value as the basis of the price of untenanted land, provided for redetermination of prices fixed before the passing of that Act in cases where the Land Commission had not taken possession of the land before 1st December, 1949.  The period allowed for lodgment of applications for redetermination does not appear to have been sufficient and to avoid hardship, Section 11 of the Bill proposes to give eligible persons a further opportunity of making applications.</P>
    <P>The remaining provisions of the Bill <Col N="173" /> are matters of detail which can be gone into, if necessary, on Committee Stage.  They are designed to secure uniformity of procedure and consist largely of amendments to remedy drafting imperfections in previous Land Acts.</P>
    <P>As I have already explained, the price fixation machinery of the Land Commission has been at a standstill since 1st January last bringing about an inevitable hold-up in the intake of new land for land settlement schemes and the House will therefore appreciate my anxiety to have this Bill enacted as early as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. S. O'Donovan Mr. S. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann requests the Government, as a matter of urgency, to take all possible steps to eliminate the enormous damage being caused to our cattle by warble fly infestation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="174" /> This motion was placed on the Order Paper in the first week of March.  A considerable period of the year has gone by since and to some extent the urgency of the motion is negatived for this year.  However, I propose to deal with the motion on the lines indicated in the text and refer first to my reason for asking at the time that, as a matter of urgency, the Seanad should request the Government to do these things.  My approach to the matter is entirely personal and is the result of the experience I had as a veterinary officer inspecting carcases after slaughter during that period in February when I, with others, were appalled by the prevalence of warbles and the damage caused to carcases, and especially to hides, so early in the year, in the month of February.  Nobody could look at that damage without feeling that one should do everything possible to bring it to the notice of anybody and everybody who could do anything to secure a solution of the problem.</P>
    <P>That is my introduction to indicate why I put the motion down as a matter of urgency then and I hope that, regarding it still as a matter of urgency even in June, the result of the debate will be to impress on the Minister and the Government the need for taking all possible steps to mitigate the damage which this infestation is causing to our cattle and consequently to the whole economy of the country.</P>
    <P>I believe that the early prevalence of the warble in the hides this year and the consequent damage being so disastrous is due to the fact that we had a very mild winter after a very satisfactory summer for the country and for the people generally.  It was a warm, dry summer and this fly was laying eggs on cattle, consequently there was a considerable increase in the infection of cattle.  With the mild winter following and the warble developing prematurely, so to speak, we had so early this year this extraordinary prevalence of it in the hides. Again, it was this extraordinary prevalence and the damage being done which prompted me to put down this motion and by the efforts of the members of the Seanad to convince people in <Col N="175" /> authority that it is a matter of vital necessity that some steps should be taken as quickly as possible to mitigate this damage.</P>
    <P>For this discussion I suppose it would be necessary to give a short summary of the life history of the warble fly to show how he causes this damage to the unfortunate cattle whose hides he invades.  There are two kinds of warble flies but I do not think that is material to this debate as, in fact, the results are the same and the damage they cause is equally extensive.  Every Senator, be he city man or country man, will probably at some stage have seen cattle gadding in the summer and early autumn.  Those members of the farming community will appreciate that it causes extensive irritation to cattle and a loss of progress in flesh and general effectiveness of the animal, whether it be for the production of meat or for the production of milk.</P>
    <P>Gadding is caused by the buzzing of the warble fly in the vicinity of cattle. The fly does not sting or bite; it simply lays its eggs mainly on the legs and the quarters of the cattle.  It is a curious thing that cattle are by nature apparently cognisant of the fact that this buzzing insect is an enemy which is going to affect him.  The herds or individual animals will run wildly over fences into obstructions often causing serious injury to themselves in the wild rush to evade the striking of this fly.</P>
    <P>The fly does seem to have some aversion to water because you will see cattle standing in a river or running towards water to stand in it.  Normally that should not affect the fly in striking unless the water reaches beyond the parts of the animal's body in which lays its eggs, the hocks and thighs. Yet they can stand quite comfortably in water of a low depth, so it seems definite that the insect does not like to fly over water or in the vicinity of water.  Naturally the instinct of the animal is to seek refuge by standing in water or in another place of refuge, the shade of trees.  The warble fly likes to remain in the warm sunny atmosphere.</P>
    <P>The warble fly has struck with disastrous results in the past year; the little <Col N="176" /> grub that hatches out penetrates the skin and during the autumn and winter travels along by various routes until he finally gets to the predilection site which is along the back and loins of the animal.  Every man who is used to the country or has seen any cattle will know that he can see in the late spring and early summer these big lumps, numerous warbles, on the backs of cattle, resulting from the grub that has developed from the eggs which the fly has laid during the previous gadding period.</P>
    <P>That is the life history of the warble fly from the time it lays the eggs to the time when these repulsive larvae develop on the animal's back.  As it develops it requires to get a breathing opening.  It bores through the skin on the inside till it punctures completely through it and when this breathing hole has been made in the skin of the animal you will see on the animal's back nodules of pus and dried serum.  People may think that this is terrible cruelty to the animals.  Naturally we cannot record how cruel this is or how much pain the animal feels.  The pain is not so much for the animal, but it certainly must be great discomfort apart from the other effect which it has in destroying the tissue of the back.  I think the actual pain is not so great, because we know that the skin of the animal is not so sensitive. You know how animals can be beaten by sticks and pricked with the goads used in driving them.  But people not accustomed to cattle would feel that the poor animal must have suffered intense pain by these numerous lesions along its back.</P>
    <P>That is the history.  The fly lays its eggs, develops the grub, and the grub gets out on the back and causes this destruction which is the subject matter of our discussion now.  Having grown to full size it pushes its way through this puncture of the skin and falls on to the ground, be it grass, road or something else.  One would think that there is such a chance of its dropping in the wrong place that the number of larvae that would subsequently develop into warble flies should be very small, but there is such <Col N="177" /> a big number of larvæ that even a comparatively small percentage developing will provide numerous flies to carry on the generations from year to year.</P>
    <P>I have brought specimens which I displayed in the anteroom during the day, and any Senator who has not seen them yet might examine them and see the damage caused to the hides. In this bottle I have specimens of the larvæ of these warbles, repulsive looking things, and one visual examination of these things might create an impression on Senators' minds that they would not forget when they come in contact with the problem during the years to come.</P>
    <P>When the grub falls to the ground, in a short time, estimated to be something like two months, it develops into an adult fly and the process starts again.  The fact that we have so many warbles affecting so many cattle to such an extensive extent this year indicates that they must be getting prevalent.  Their effects would be more obvious if the weather were warm and sunny, but the continuity of the propagation of the species goes on and that is why I would like to discuss it in the Seanad so that some steps can be taken even during this period to lessen the damage that the attack of warble fly causes.</P>
    <P>To come to the loss and damage done by these enemies of ours, as far as the farmer is concerned he does not realise the damage because he is only cognisant of what happens to his cattle during the gadding period.  He may see his cows running for shelter under trees or in whatever pond or river they can get to, but perhaps he will escape having a casualty from an animal running into a gate or falling into a dyke.  Unless he has experience of such a casualty he does not feel that this warble fly is doing him immense damage, and that is one of the objects of this discussion&mdash;to try to bring home to the farming community, through the Seanad, the fact that the injury, small though it may be to them, is indeed of immense damage when the stock travel to the other agencies&mdash;to the butcher, to the tanner and subsequently to the harness maker or the <Col N="178" /> boot maker who utilises the leather got from his cattle.  The farmer loses even through loss of milk, especially if there is a warm day.  He will find there is a big loss of milk, and that there is a loss in the development of his young stock not easy to estimate&mdash;and of course again he may have loss through casualties.</P>
    <P>When it comes to the butcher and the exporter the damage becomes very apparent.  It was at this stage that I became aware of the disastrous results early this year.  I have brought in specimens of the hide of a badly infected carcase.  There are two exhibits&mdash;one hide in which the warbles have punctured right through, making holes like a sieve right through the leather, and the other a specimen of what we call blind warbles, where the warble has not pushed its way right through and has produced no puncture in the leather, but instead he causes defects in the texture of the leather on the inside and protuberances on the outside of the hide.  When badly affected the hide is more or less useless for any manufacture.</P>
    <P>Besides these two specimens which I have for Senators to look at there is further damage caused because an animal that is affected by the warble fly this year and is not slaughtered this year is further damaged.  The lesions caused by the warble coming through the hide heal and that little puncture is mended, so to speak, during the remainder of the year if it does not get a second attack, which usually does occur; but those little lesions are healed by scar tissue and that scar tissue can be seen as defects in the hide.  So you have defects caused by the puncture and the grub coming actually through, partial puncture by the grub, and even then the healing of the lesions after the parasite has passed through.</P>
    <P>In all three cases there is immense damage done.  I have got figures this year which I would like to mention.  I asked a Dublin butcher what were the losses through the damage caused by warbles in his hides and he showed me a receipt for four first-class hides, or what should be first-class hides, from four heifers which he got.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="179" /> The total of the four hides, according to the price of 1/- per lb., should be £11 6s.  He received £7 2s. 3d., which is a loss of £4 3s. 9d. on the four hides or almost exactly a guinea a hide. That is an immense loss to be occurring and to be recurring from day to day and from week to week in the beef trade.  The butcher individually was at a loss of four guineas, almost, on four hides.  I took a note that one of the hides weighed 60 lb., so that the normal price would be £3; but the loss is averaging in those cases a guinea a hide.</P>
    <P>The skin men have a gradation of price on the number of warbles affecting the hide.  For first warbles, they pay 9d.; second warbles 7½d.; third warbles 6d.  For a hide that is badly affected with the warbles the butcher only gets half the price that he should get.  Instead of a 1/- a lb. he gets only 6d.</P>
    <P>Later in the season, after about March, these prices were increased as follows: first warbles 10d.; second warbles 8½d.; third warbles 7d.  Therefore, the skin and hide men increased the price by just about 1d. per lb. Senators will get a picture there of the immense loss to the butcher&mdash;and to the country, through the butcher&mdash;by the damage caused by this warble infection.  Likewise, of course, the hides of animals that are commercially slaughtered in the factories will have a lesser value also.</P>
    <P>Then I might refer to the damage to the carcase itself.  We have developed a magnificent export trade of carcase beef now and it is a pity to see the results of warble infection on so many carcases.  The warbles will not be on the carcase, as they will be adhering to the hide, but the result of the warble infection is quite apparent on the surface tissues of the back and sirloin.  It causes a serous exudate or, in ordinary parlance, what might be called a scum on the surface and flesh and gives it a dirty green appearance.  Once that is there, there is no satisfactory means of treating it. You just cannot pare it off or wash it off or sandpaper it off.  Once it is there it has entirely interfered with the <Col N="180" /> grading of the best nourished and the fattest animal.  In that case again we are facing an immense loss through the damage caused to the carcases of those animals so affected.</P>
    <P>I took a note here of the loss to the consumer.  I am sure some Senators have had the experience, when tasting the nicest steak on his plate, of finding that the part that gives our steaks their reputation is really the fatty juicy surround, which is actually the fatty tissue from the loin of the beast. Some Senators at some time may have got from that little fat, which gives the steak its juicy flavour, a repulsively bitter taste.  I have got it repeatedly, I know, and many Senators may have got it but did not know the cause of it.  That bitter, nasty taste comes as a result of warble infection, where that flavour has remained even through the cooking.  It gives it that nasty taste and anybody not knowing what it was would think the meat was rotten because of that flavour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to make everyone as interested as possible in this matter and I brought in the consumer because I feel that some Senators may have had that experience, in getting that bitter taste.</P>
      <P>The warble affects the farmer in his product, it affects the middle man, the butcher, the skin and hide man and the tanner, and it affects the consumer as I have shown.  That is why I put this motion down as a matter of urgency in the first week of March. I still regard it as a matter of urgency that the Government, through its Minister, should take all possible steps to eliminate the enormous damage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning to the steps which could be taken, I will suggest some.  Some Senators may suggest others.  Since this motion was put down, considerable steps have been taken by the Department, as a new Order was issued, dated March.  Whether it was after my motion was put down or not, I do not know.  The new Order is not much different from its predecessor <Col N="181" /> Possibly this motion on the Order Paper evoked sufficient interest to have the Order brought up to date.  In addition, several advertisements have appeared in the Press, both the daily and weekly Press throughout the country, and the radio has been used as well.  I was listening myself in this building to a discussion on the radio on this warble fly question.  Some activity has been brought about in the public service through the issue of the new Order, the several advertisements in the Press and also the radio debates and discussions in this matter.</P>
    <P>The wool merchants at the same time started a campaign in connection with tar on the wool and we had magnificent advertisements in the Press.  They were very well produced, trying to influence the farmers and sheep-owners not to allow tar in the wool.  I was shown an advertisement prepared by the butchers.  I have a copy here in the rough.  They were prepared to subsidise the preparation and distribution of posters throughout the country, to help to interest people in attacking this problem of warble fly infestation.  You have wool merchants anxious to deal with tar in the wool and you have also people who are so cognisant of the warble damage that they are prepared to contribute money to eradicate the warble fly.</P>
    <P>I thought of suggesting this theme song to the stock owners&mdash;the farmers and the farming community&mdash;in connection with the subject of this discussion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Don't let the tar get in your wool,</P>
    <P>Don't let the warble get in your hide.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It might be well to suggest that to farmers because the greatest publicity possible will have to be given about this matter.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has handed me a note to the effect that no Order was made recently.  It is not an Order.  It is a leaflet and if I used the word &ldquo;order&rdquo; I was wrong.  I have in my hands a Department of Agriculture leaflet, No. 75, on the warble fly.  The word should be &ldquo;leaflet&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;order&rdquo;.  A <Col N="182" /> new leaflet was issued in March, 1953. It was not an Order but a Government Publications leaflet.</P>
    <P>I come now to Press publicity and radio publicity.  With regard to Press publicity I would ask the members of the Press who are present to come and examine these samples which I have. If they do so they will be very impressed because visual evidence is better than any description that could be given in regard to this matter and it is necessary to get as many people as possible interested in it.</P>
    <P>Through advertisement and publicity in their own journal the veterinary surgeons have helped.  I might say here that all this is entirely impersonal as far as the veterinary profession is concerned.  They gain nothing whatsoever by inducing the farmers to make use of this treatment.  As a matter of fact, if the casualties due to the warble fly were eliminated it might mean less practice for veterinary surgeons.  They have publicised the matter in their journal just the same as it was publicised in the Department's journals.</P>
    <P>My next suggestion is that every agricultural instructor, every county committee of agriculture, every branch and practically every member of Macra na Feirme and Muinntir na Tíre should be written to jointly and severally to publicise to the farming community the importance of taking steps to lessen the damage of this infestation. Another important body are the co-operative creameries and co-operative agricultural societies.  Their members could give great help in this publicity work.  I may repeat that, as far as this year is concerned, the treatment is late.  However, it is a question of preparing the ground and trying to get as much publicity and information promulgated as quickly as possible so that we will be prepared next spring to begin on a proper attack on this enemy of ours.</P>
    <P>Then there are the agricultural shows.  Exhibits have been on display at various agricultural shows of a hide infested with warbles.  I have seen them at Ballsbridge and I think they may have been at other shows, but every agricultural show should have an <Col N="183" /> exhibit as well as a poster and advertisement to bring to the notice of every individual farmer and farmer's son or workman attending the show the necessity for this treatment.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I would mention the vocational schools.  I am not going to include primary schools because everybody who has a fad about education says that such and such a thing should be taught in our primary and vocational schools.  Vocational schools are spread throughout the agricultural districts and there could be publicity by way of posters and exhibits of various kinds at these vocational classes.</P>
    <P>That accounts for advertisement and publicity.  What, now, is the Government going to do about it?  That is a question that is often asked, I suppose, of Ministers.  One day we people say: &ldquo;We do not want Government interference&rdquo;, and the next day we hear somebody saying: &ldquo;What is the Government going to do about it?&rdquo; We had warble fly regulations before and we had inspectors trying to enforce those regulations.  Personally, I think that any compulsion in this respect is practically useless when you are trying to deal with the farming community.  I appeal to Senators and to the Government Department, by every means in their power, to publicise this matter and appeal for the voluntary support of the farming community to eradicate this pest.  Inspectors are just useless, as things are, because they cannot know whether or not an animal has been dressed&mdash;and this is an important point which I would stress now to the Parliamentary Secretary.  When the Government were endeavouring to enforce this Order before, I examined warbles on the backs of live animals but I could not know whether or not they were treated with warble dressing which is a derris powder preparation.  Your only means of finding out would be to bruise out one of these repulsive-looking things and see whether it was dead or not. That is a very dangerous thing to do extensively, but I did it myself on a few occasions for my own information. The point I want to make is that inspectors going around trying to get farmers to dress the animals on the <Col N="184" /> first day of each of the months, March, April, May or June, or at monthly intervals during these months, are handicapped because they cannot know whether or not the animals have been treated.</P>
    <P>My suggestion is that the Department investigate further the use of some pigment in the warble dressing&mdash; any pigment without being a sort of too blatent red, white, and blue.  It could be a nice orange pigment.  That pigment could be mixed with the derris dressing so that, in the ensuing few months, it would be quite apparent to the farmer's neighbours and to everybody else that he had dressed his cattle.  Somebody may suggest that he could dress the skins of his animals with the pigment without applying the derris powder.  My answer to that suggestion is that if a farmer is willing to go to that much trouble he might as well put the extra few shillings into the purchase of derris powder and do the job properly.  My suggestion to the Parliamentary Secretary is that, by the addition of a pigment to these proprietary dressings, it would at least become apparent that the animal had been dressed.  We could have a system of checking at sales and markets to ensure that animals exposed for sale had been dressed, and I should say that the numbers of non-co-operative stockowners or farmers who would substitute a simple pigment for the pigmented derris dressing would be very small.</P>
    <P>The one outstanding point I want to impress on the Seanad is that there must be co-operation, right up from the producer of the calf or yearling into the fattening lands of Meath and on up to the sales.  There must be co-operation by every individual stock-owner, and, if we cannot get that, any oppressive compulsion will not succeed. The farming community are just as patriotic as any other section and if they can be got to realise the magnitude of the problem and the importance of the eradication of this infestation, they will co-operate.  If they can be got to realise the damage involved for themselves and for the subsequent dealers in their product, resulting ultimately in immense loss to <Col N="185" /> the nation, they will be only too anxious to co-operate.  There will be the non-co-operative or recalcitrant individual, but the criticism of his fellow-farmers will have the effect of making him toe the line more quickly than any compulsion by the Department. I have heard the question asked: &ldquo;Why does the Government not prohibit the sale of these animals in the market, so that the butcher will not have to buy them?&rdquo;  but these things are impossible.  With the co-operation, however, between the various sections who have to deal with this problem, we can secure a means of getting rid of the problem.</P>
    <P>Finally, I hope that when the Government&mdash;any Government or whatever Government&mdash;takes this matter up it will not be regarded as a Party or an inter-Party problem of a political nature.  It was a pity politics were brought into it before when it was a matter of whether one Party would have warble fly inspectors and the other would not.  It was a warble fly war rather than an effort to rid our live stock of this disastrous infection. It was a political infection rather than a warble fly infection.  We here are a non-political House but I hope that the non-politicians and the politicians in the House would regard this not as any Party issue but as a problem in respect of which the farming community, the graziers, the cattle feeders and everybody else should be appealed to on a national basis.  If we had a three years' plan to eradicate this infestation, a plan which was undertaken with wholehearted co-operation, I believe that instead of having hides perforated as the hide I have shown the Seanad is perforated we would not have two hides in a thousand with holes in them.</P>

      <P>I second the motion and I agree with Senator O'Donovan that this is a matter of extreme urgency.  I am glad to have the opportunity of seconding the motion.  I have seen it estimated that the damage due to warble fly each year amounts to about £3,000,000.  I regarded that as an overestimate but, having listened to Senator O'Donovan, <Col N="186" /> I believe it is not an overestimate at all.  The damage to the hide is considerable; the damage to the meat is considerable; and during the process of infection and while it is infected an animal does not thrive as well as it would in the ordinary way, so that there is considerable loss in that regard.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Donovan referred to the warble fly inspectors and said that they were treated in a political way. That may be so&mdash;I do not know&mdash;but I know&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that they were regarded as being as much a pest as the warble fly.  Things are different now, however, and the time now is more opportune than it was then, because the prices of cattle are very much better and the farmers would be in better humour to deal with the warble fly in the way in which it ought to be dealt with.  Prices are better and are likely to continue to be better. From what I have seen of the new trade agreement, there will be a good opportunity for our live-stock raisers and cattle producers for some considerable years to come.  I have seen hundreds of cattle from time to time and very rarely does one see an animal free from warble.  I do not know whether anything could be done in the matter by the Young Farmers' Clubs or by Muintir na Tíre, by the Beet Growers' Association or even the Countrywomen's Association, but we recently had a good deal of propaganda with regard to tar in wool, propaganda which did an immense amount of good, and if we had the same propaganda in connection with warble fly&mdash;and the dead meat factories might take a hand in the game, as the wool merchants did in the case of wool&mdash;it would help a good deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This discussion here ought to be followed up by a substantial measure of advertising by the Department.  I have no doubt that good results would flow from it.  I suggest that if a dressing suitable for application in winter could be made available, it would be more satisfactory from the farmer's <Col N="187" /> point of view, because it is a more leisurely period of the year for the farmer and many of the cattle are housed at that time, so that it could be more easily and better done.  I am in entire agreement with everything Senator O'Donovan has said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only right that we should congratulate Senator O'Donovan on his very instructive speech.  I do not think anybody will disagree with me when I say that he is about the only man in the House who is really fitted to deal with the particular subject and it was quite evident to anybody listening to him that he has made an intensive study of the whole thing and knows it from beginning to end.</P>
      <P>I think it is regrettable that the political bluefly had hit so many members of the House and that there were not more people here to listen to Senator O'Donovan's speech.  I believe that it is only by intensive propaganda that results will be got as far as this warble fly is concerned.  I am a great believer in effective propaganda, and while notices have been put in the newspapers by the Department of Agriculture I believe that they were not effective.  The trouble in connection with the warble fly is that the farmer who is selling a beast will get the same thing for the beast with the hide infected with warble flies, or practically the same thing, as for a clean hide. Unless it can be brought home to farmers individually that they are going to lose money, I do not think you will get anywhere.  I understand that there is some slight difference between the price paid for what Senator O'Donovan calls a clean hide and a hide infected with warble flies.  I do not know exactly what the difference is, but probably it is not sufficient, and I think that the type of propaganda which you would want to get would be something in the nature of lantern slides or, if possible, a sort of picture in the local cinemas in rural villages or provincial towns showing, as Senator O'Donovan has pointed out, the terrific disadvantage of allowing the warble fly full scope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the amount of money <Col N="188" /> lost as a result of this is really staggering, but it is very difficult to bring that home to individual farmers.  I believe that a considerable amount of money can be spent advantageously in propaganda, and I would ask the Minister or his officials to go into the possibilities of using lantern slides or having some pictures on the screen in cinemas in the country villages and the provincial towns.</P>
    <P>I must say that I could not follow the line of argument which said that the warble fly was connected with politics.  That is a matter I did not hear anything about before to-night; everybody else seems to understand it except myself.  I think there was some talk by the ex-Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon&mdash;and nobody takes much notice of him&mdash;who said that the warble fly inspectors were all Fianna Fáil supporters.</P>

      <P>I think we should all congratulate Senator O'Donovan on his very interesting speech, and I hope that members of the House who were not here will at least read the speech from beginning to end.  I believe that if we can get a campaign going with the whole-hearted support of every section of the House and possibly of every section of the other House, to get people talking about it, we will eventually get to the stage where any farmer would be ashamed to bring cattle into a fair unless they have been properly looked after and treated.  If a farmer has a horse and the horse has got warble fly&mdash;for horses can be affected, though not so much as cattle &mdash;he would not go to bed at night until he got rid of the warble fly and took every step to deal with it.  If he were unable to deal with it himself he would have a veterinary surgeon because of the disastrous effect it would have on the horse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as cattle are concerned, particularly when it comes to the harvest or hay saving and that kind of thing, if somebody suggests: &ldquo;We will have to do the cattle for the warble fly to-day&rdquo; and if there is hay to be saved or corn to be looked after the tendency, I am afraid, is to let the warble fly <Col N="189" /> look after himself.  Until we can get people to look into the thing from the national point of view, I am afraid it is hopeless, and the only way that can be done is by more and better propaganda.</P>

      <P>I so seldom find myself in agreement with Senator Quirke that I cannot refrain from saying that I agree with him that Senator O'Donovan deserves congratulations, but I think that there my agreement with Senator Quirke concludes.  Senator O'Donovan gave us an excellent exhibition of this warble fly and of what happens when the warble fly gets into an animal and how resultant damage is done to the animal to the loss of the farmers and of others.</P>
      <P>I would like to congratulate Senator O'Donovan, and I think Senator Quirke, upon having abandoned the idea of compulsion and come over to the idea of persuasion preached so much by this particular side of the House for years, and I suppose we are to be satisfied that that is a certain amount of progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard about this warble fly before in the Dáil in listening to long debates on agriculture, about which probably there is much I never was able to understand.  The discussion on various matters about warble flies was one of them.  The thing I do not understand, even at present, is that if the farmer can find out whether the warble fly is in the hide or not why he does not take steps or be made to take steps to remove the warble fly.  For example, is it necessary really to show slides in village halls or films about warble flies?  I understand that the warble fly may be there in the animal at certain periods of the year, particularly in the spring, and that everybody knows what the remedy is.  Surely, instead of spending money on propaganda, if you could convince the farmer that he would get less money for a hide that had warble fly and more, as I think Senator Quirke suggested, for a clean hide, you would have accomplished everything, because his own self-interest would surely carry him far enough on that.  I know that the warble flies' damage does not <Col N="190" /> appear until afterwards.  It struck me when Senator O'Donovan was talking that in that respect the warble fly resembles Fianna Fáil legislation&mdash;it is only when it gets going for a bit that you realise the bad effects of it.  They are not apparent at first.</P>
    <P>I entirely agree with the motion that there should be propaganda with regard to the harm done but I do not know why one should spend a great deal of money on it.  I am informed that it is easily felt on the hides of cattle, that the farmers know that damage is being done, that where it gets into milch cows it reduces the amount of milk they give; and it seems to me quite clear that if the cattle were worth more to the farmer he would surely adopt the obvious and easily obtained remedy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I intervene to point out that that is the difficulty as far as the farmer is concerned? There is no loss in the sale of the animal because it has warbles as compared with the sale of the animal with no warbles.  As far as the farmer is concerned he knows the warbles are there, but it is of no material concern to himself because, unfortunately, he will get the same price for the animal with the warbles as for the animal without them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Then give more to the farmers.  It seems to me that you will find it very hard to do any propaganda with them if you cannot prove it is in their interest, because they <Col N="191" /> would not worry.  However, the situation is that there is very considerable damage done.  Persuasion is the only thing that can help farmers.  I was very glad that Senator O'Donovan did not make any suggestion of resumption of Orders, compulsion and inspection. He demonstrated very clearly that inspection is not practicable because it is not possible to prove whether the treatment has been given to the animal or not.</P>
      <P>I would like to say seriously that Senator O'Donovan is to be congratulated on having made this matter so clear.  It is one of the things about which there could be no difference of opinion, but it is not so simple to find a remedy because if the situation is that it does not make any difference to the farmer's personal interest whether he worries about this matter or not, then it will be very difficult to spread propaganda that will make him in his busy season take certain steps. Although Senator O'Donovan and Senator Quirke both tell me there is no difference, I have been told that animals which suffer from the warble fly give less milk and are in danger of hurting themselves at certain seasons of the year when gadding.  If that is so, there should be an appeal not only to the farmer's national spirit, which he has always displayed a great deal, but also to his personal interest.</P>
      <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary and the Department will find a method of doing some propaganda of a different kind than the issue of rather dull leaflets.  I would like to suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that if politicians did their propaganda for by-elections and general elections the way the Department does its propaganda for farmers, they would not get in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I just rise to join with others in congratulating Senator O'Donovan in having brought forward this motion and for the attention that it will probably focus on this very important subject and also to correct some illusion from which Senator Hayes suffers when he refers to compulsion. There was never at any time any compulsion in relation to this <Col N="192" /> warble fly.  In an attempt to do what Senator O'Donovan asks on this motion should be done, a former Minister for Agriculture suggested and set up an organisation to have persons appointed who would call on farmers and advise them that the necessary steps to take to have this warble fly removed for good and all should be taken and instruct them in dressing, and so forth. These instructions were given, as far as I recollect, through the various county councils or committees of agriculture. The war intervened and for one reason or another that method was abandoned.  It is not a question of being converted over to voluntary effort.  The effort at that time was expected to be just as voluntary as it will be in any inducement that will be held out in the future through propaganda from any source.</P>
      <P>My view on it is that it is not entirely correct to say that farmers suffer nothing in relation to the sale of the stock.  The tanners in deciding on a price to pay for a hide, must take into consideration in the fixing of that price the number of hides and the great loss that will occur as a result of the damage caused by this fly; whereas if they were assured that each hide would be approved, they could offer the farmer a greater price.  That is one angle together with the losses that may be sustained otherwise by the farmers in their everyday running of stock.</P>
      <P>The one thing I do not like about the motion&mdash;while I agree with Senator O'Donovan&mdash;is that its appeal is on the style of appeals we hear every day: the Government must do something. We have various organisations throughout the country, the Young Farmers' Clubs, Muintir na Tíre and other organisations.  I believe it is a question of educating the young farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It also concerns the people dealing with shoes, boots or leather.  They are the people who can rectify this position by insisting on obtaining proper hides.  I agree with Senator Quirke that that is the right form of appeal. Whether it is an election campaign or anything else of that kind I believe that the best propaganda is in the form of a picture that would strike the people and arouse their curiosity. <Col N="193" /> Therefore by engaging a good artist it should be possible to put before the farmers a picture of the great national damage that is being done by this fly.</P>
    <P>We had recently a campaign carried on by the wool buyers, and if the butchers, the tanners and other people interested in the hide business came together they should be able to put into the field an organisation that would allow the necessary propaganda to be distributed throughout the country.  In that way, more than by Government action and more than by saying that it is a Fianna Fáil, a Fine Gael or any other Government scheme, it will be done by those interested in agriculture for the agricultural community.</P>

      <P>I have pleasure in supporting the motion proposed by Senator O'Donovan.  In doing so I would like to remove what may be a misapprehension in regard to the statement of Senator Hayes.  He points out that the infection is obvious to the farmer when he sees the warbles on the backs of his animals and that it is quite easy to remove them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I want to make: that at that stage it is not at all easy but, as Senator O'Donovan has said, it is dangerous even to attempt to remove them.  They can be treated and have been treated and I think most intelligent farmers treat them at the present time.  However, I think Senator O'Donovan wishes to make the thing universal, and by so doing to exterminate as far as possible what he seems to regard as public enemy No. 1&mdash;the warble fly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no need to make a long speech on this.  Everbody who understands anything at all about cattle would understand the necessity there is for a remedy.  However, with regard to compulsion I would like to remind the House that there is in another sphere of farming activity a very strong measure of compulsion in force for a great many years; that is, the compulsory dipping of sheep.  You <Col N="194" /> cannot expose sheep for sale on the market at certain periods of the year without producing a document proving that they have been dipped, and if a somewhat similar Order were made making it an offence to expose cattle for sale which have not been treated, it would go a long way towards bringing the laggards into line with the more progressive farmers.</P>
    <P>Another thing that could have been done was pointed out by Senator O'Donovan, the contribution of propaganda by butchers.  Let them contribute to more effective propaganda by giving a better price for the animal that has obviously a clean hide than for the one that has the warble.  That would be the most effective type of propaganda because the people who are dealing in cattle from the early stage to the stage when it reaches the butcher will be mindful of the fact that a clean hide commands a higher price than an infected hide.  That would bring home to everybody the necessity of eliminating as far as possible this warble fly which does such irreparable damage at certain seasons of the year, when the animals can be seen for a great number of hours every day galloping around the fields and even across ditches and often injuring themselves because they have no adequate protection against this pest.  They stampede when they hear this fly coming.  I agree with Senator O'Donovan that every possible step should be taken to try to get this fly eliminated if it is humanly possible to do so, but I do hope it does not become immune to the treatment that is at present being applied.</P>
    <P>A great many other pests have become immunised after a period of years.  We would like, if possible, to coax the people into treating their cattle as they have to treat their sheep.  They are compelled to treat their sheep.  I do not know whether it was under Senator Hayes's Government that that was brought in or not, but I think it was really older.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Bartley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express on behalf of the Minister his regret at being unable to be present to deal with this motion. I can tell Senator O'Donovan that the Minister accepts the motion and can subscribe very fully to the case which he has made in support of it.  There is general agreement about the need for dealing effectively with the warble fly infestation of cattle.  The only aspect of the question, therefore, that I need refer to is the best method to achieve that desirable end.  Compulsion is not contemplated, as the Department is not satisfied that it can be so applied as to have the desired effect.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Grady drew an analogy with the compulsory sheep-dipping regulations to indicate that a method might be found there.  The Department, however, feels that sheep and cattle are not quite comparable for treatment for disease or infestation of that sort.  First, you have a very much greater number of cattle in the country than sheep and generally it is more convenient to bring flocks of sheep to a central place for their dipping than it would be to gather all the cattle of the country in a similar way for treatment.</P>
      <P>The question of bringing home to the farmer the loss which is suffered by the sellers of hides which are warble fly infested is the difficult kernel of the problem.  As Senator Quirke has said. the farmer does not suffer any loss in the sale of his animal whether the hide is infested or not.  It is the man who flays the beast who has to stand the loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan suggested a treatment pigmented in some way which would indicate to the buyer at the fair that the treatment had been applied, but I understand that is something the farmer would object to very strongly, as animals displaying these coloured patches on the hide would receive, the farmer would expect and <Col N="196" /> believe, a much lesser price than if the animals were not so marked.  These are examples of some of the difficulties which arise when it comes to finding a practical solution.  The question as to the best method of bringing the matter home to the farmer is being tackled most energetically at present.</P>
    <P>I should inform the Seanad that in February last the Department convened a meeting of interested bodies to discuss what publicity measures might be taken.  Those present included representatives of the hide and tanning industries, the Irish Fresh Meat Exporters' Committee, the National Executive of the Irish Livestock Trade, the Dublin Master Victuallers' Association, and the manufacturers of warble dressings.  It was decided that a combined advertising campaign should be undertaken and a sub-committee was formed which met early in March and again in April to co-ordinate publicity measures.  Representatives of Macra na Feirme, Muintir Na Tíre and the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society were also present at the sub-committee meetings.</P>
    <P>The Department undertook the following propaganda and educational programme this season:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Press: A display advertisement and a Press notice were issued in March and April and Press notices have been repeated since then.</P>
    <P>Radio: A broadcast discussion and a broadcast talk were arranged during March-April.  Periodic announcements are also being broadcast reminding farmers of the necessity for dressing warble-infested cattle.</P>
    <P>Lectures: Special reference to the need for dressing warble-infested cattle was made in the course of the veterinary lectures given at centres throughout the country during the early months of the year.</P>
    <P>Educational exhibits: A special warble fly exhibit was arranged for display at the R.D.S.  Spring Show and other local agricultural shows this year.</P>
    <P>Circulars to farming organisations: County committes of agriculture, young farmers' clubs and guilds of <Col N="197" /> Muintir na Tíre have been circularised with a view to enlisting their co-operation in urging farmers to dress warble-infested cattle.  The Irish Agricultural Organisation Society has also circularised creamery societies in the matter.</P>
    <P>Leaflet: A special leaflet on the warble fly is being distributed by the Department.</P>
    <P>There is an outline of the activities of the Department and of all the various organisations and groups likely to be interested.  This has all been brought about at the instance of the Department.  Senators can rest assured that the Department is quite alive to the need for dealing with this problem as effectively as possible.  It would be well to await the results of this campaign before any steps of a compulsory kind would be applied.  I take it that compulsion really would be the fairest way if you had an easy and readily applied system of compulsion that would not be harsh.</P>
    <P>It would be fairest for the reason that it would apply to everybody.  The trouble about the voluntary method is that the person who is blind either to his own interests or to the national interests in this connection simply does not react to the voluntary appeal and that only the good citizen does.  That is one of the shortcomings of the voluntary system.  Nevertheless, taking into account our experience of the compulsory method applied in the past, the Minister for Agriculture is satisfied that the present campaign of publicity and of education should be tried out to the fullest.  He is confident that, with a bit of patience and continuous effort over a period&mdash;not too prolonged &mdash;the desire of the Seanad, as expressed in this motion, will be achieved.</P>

      <P>I wish to express my thanks for the complimentary remarks of various Senators but I feel that they are not justified because, as far as I can make out, some of the speakers did not comprehend or grasp what I said.  I do not want to say that Senator O'Callaghan was not listening to me but it is quite definite that winter dressing is an impossibility <Col N="198" /> because the warbles are not there in the winter.  You have to wait until warble develops and you have to wait until the aperture, through which it ultimately comes out, develops.  The derris powder must get into the little hole to affect the warble.  Therefore, you cannot have winter dressing.</P>
      <P>I hate the word &ldquo;propaganda&rdquo;: it sounds too much like Fine Gael.  The Parliamentary Secretary used the word &ldquo;education&rdquo;.  I am glad to find that he has mentioned most of the organisations which I mentioned and I may say that I am sorry that I did not mention the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society.  I suppose that if Senator Baxter were here he would criticise me for not mentioning it.</P>
      <P>Senator Quirke mentioned one further method of publicity which I had a note of but which I did not mention and that is through the picture houses and particularly the picture houses in rural areas.  I think that that would be very effective.</P>
      <P>Mention was made of the sheep-dipping Order.  It is in print that those forms presented at fairs and markets are not worth the paper they are written on and the same thing would apply if you made a regulation providing that every person bringing cattle to a fair would have to declare that they had been treated.  D.D.T. has eradicated scab more than the other dipping operations.</P>
      <P>I am not against compulsion.  I believe that, notwithstanding all our efforts and education to bring home to the people concerned the necessity for treating our cattle for personal and national interests, you will necessarily require some degree of compulsion in respect of the recalcitrants.  The warble fly does not mind over whose fence it flies.  If ten farmers in a townland decide to treat their cattle so as to ensure that they will be free from the pest, and if a few others in the same vicinity do not do so, then the efforts of the ten farmers will be well-nigh in vain.  Therefore, you must have communal effort and you must have compulsion to some extent.  I repeat that there should be a compulsory system as far as its control at public sales and public markets is concerned.</P>

      <Col N="199" /> With regard to a three-year publicity campaign, I think that the Minister or the Government will require some degree of compulsion to ensure that all our efforts through education and through appeals to the community will not be negatived by people who will say: &ldquo;It does not matter to me.  I am not going to do it.&rdquo;  The only way to ensure success is to have a definite Order that cattle must be dressed and that they are liable to supervision to ensure that they are dressed.</P>
    <P>I still do not agree with the view that we could not get a dressing that would be recognisable to prove that the animals had been dressed.  The present position is that nobody can say definitely: &ldquo;You did not apply the dressing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>My last point is in connection with the attack on the fly.  The new leaflet issued by the Department says that, so far, any attempts at attacking the fly have been ineffective. <Col N="200" /> D.D.T. and Gamexane have practically eradicated sheep scab.  The Department should further investigate the advisability of a solution of D.D.T. and Gamexane for application to the legs of cattle, be they milch cows or dry stock.  It may not prevent the warble fly from laying the eggs because when it wants to lay them it comes like a streak of lightning but it would prevent it from laying further eggs.  I appeal that further investigation be made in respect of attack on the fly.</P>
    <P>So far, all the discussion has been on the attack on the warble before it becomes a fly.  However, as it is now ten o'clock, I will ask the House to adopt this motion and, as the Parliamentary Secretary has agreed to accept it, I think we will have unanimity.</P>
    <P>Motion agreed to.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10 p.m., <i>sine die.</i></P>
