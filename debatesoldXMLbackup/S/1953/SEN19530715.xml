      <P>It is proposed that No. 2 on the Order Paper be taken at 7 o'clock, immediately after the tea recess, and that No. 3&mdash;Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Bill, 1952, (Committee Stage)&mdash;be not taken until next week.  The motions will not be taken to-day.</P>

      <P>Perhaps at 7 o'clock or the next sitting there might be some information given to the House as to the amount of business which will remain to be transacted before the Recess, because it is very difficult at the moment to discover what precisely we are being expected to do or in what conditions.  Perhaps if I gave notice now, the Senator opposite might be able to give us some information.</P>

    <Title>Finance Bill, 1953&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the Financial Resolutions passed by Dáil Éireann following on the introduction of the Budget. The relevant sections covered by those Resolutions are Section 1, which provides for the charge of income-tax and surtax at the rates already in force, Section 4, which relates to the new scale of entertainments duty, and Section 12, which is designed to combat <Col N="216" /> evasion of the stamp duty by means of the exchange of lands of an unequal value.</P>
      <P>A further matter covered in the Bill, which was referred to in my Budget speech and which did not call for a Financial Resolution, is that dealt with under Section 14.  That section provides for the refund of stamp duty in certain cases where persons paid on conveyances or leases at the rate of 25 per cent. and subsequently ascertained that they were Irish citizens at the time of executing the instrument and accordingly need have paid only at the lower rates.</P>
      <P>Advantage has also been taken in the Bill to provide for certain other financial matters.  As the Bill is very simple and, I think, does not require any discussion of a general character, it would be better if I were briefly to review the purposes of the several sections. I have already referred to Section 1 and I assume that the purpose here will be self-evident to every member of the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Section 2 increases the rate of relief in respect of premiums on insurance policies taken out after the 21st of May, 1953, with any insurance company or friendly society registered, managed and controlled in the State.  The rate of relief in such cases will be up to two-thirds the standard rate of income-tax, instead of the former maximum of half the standard rate.</P>
      <P>Section 3, which will operate within a very narrow field, authorises the granting of a measure of relief in respect of foreign income of certain persons who, though formerly resident outside Ireland, have settled down in this country.  The proposed relief is confined to foreign incomes where, in any case affected, the total tax both here and abroad on the foreign income is shown to be greater than the tax which would have been payable on it had the taxpaper been solely resident in the country of origin of the income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already referred to Section 4, but I may say here that this section, as will be seen, gives effect to a new scale of cinema entertainments duty in lieu of the scale now in operation. The current scale is highly anomalous at several stages in its graduation. The new scale, while removing these <Col N="217" /> anomalies, avoids increasing the duty on any current admission charges, and, in fact, affords some relief on the lower levels of charge.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for exemption from entertainments duty on amateur exhibitions of basketball and cycle roller racing, promoted by the respective controlling bodies or affiliated clubs.  This exemption, of course, is confined to amateurs and is already enjoyed by many other amateur sports.</P>
    <P>Section 6 relates to entertainments duty payable in respect of cinematograph performances.  In this case it provides for the repayment of one-half of the entertainments duty paid in respect of entertainments which are wholly cinematograph performances and which, while not qualifying&mdash;that is the important feature of this&mdash;for the existing exemption in respect of films which are wholly of an educational character, can be said to be educational in the sense that they encourage the study of languages or facilitate it.  It provides for that relief where at least one-third of the entertainment consists of films in Irish or where at least one-half of the entertainment consists of films in, for example, a continental language.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is designed to alleviate a hardship arising from the fact that in certain areas the last census indicated that the population in certain rural areas has increased.  It provides, accordingly, that where exemption from the entertainment duty in rural areas ceases to operate by reason of a change in population, such exemption shall not cease abruptly on the publication of a new census but shall be continued for two years more.  It will be seen that in the present case the two years will run from the 1st September next.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for the extension of the special reduced rate of duty in respect to tractors used for haulage in connection with agriculture to tractors used by hospitals, schools and religious institutions which own farms and work them.</P>
    <P>Section 9 extends for a further period of three years the temporary exemption from corporation profits tax which has hitherto been afforded to certain public utility concerns like <Col N="218" /> docks, canals or undertakings which operate railways and to building societies and the Agricultural Credit Corporation, Limited.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for the postponement of the payment of income-tax on foreign income where the income-tax payer is unable, because of currency restrictions in the country where the income arises, to remit the income to this country.  Section 11 is merely a construction section dealing with that particular part of the Act.</P>
    <P>Section 12, to which I have already referred, is designed to combat the evasion of stamp duty by means of the exchange of lands of unequal value, the difference in value being paid over in cash.  Under the existing law, a transaction of this nature is not a conveyance on sale and consequently escapes the increased rates of stamp duty imposed some years ago.</P>
    <P>Section 13 extends to all receipts for wages, salaries and similar payments the existing relief from the 2d. stamp duty which is limited at the moment to receipts for wages and salaries under £4.</P>
    <P>Section 14 is another section to which I have already referred.  It provides for the refund of stamp duty in certain cases where persons have paid stamp duty on conveyances or leases at the 25 per cent. rate, that is, at the rate which is payable by persons who are not Irish citizens and where they have subsequently ascertained that, as they were in fact Irish citizens at the time of executing the instrument, they need have paid duty only at the lower rate in force for Irish citizens.  This section is necessary in order to enable the Revenue Commissioners to refund the duty which has been paid under an erroneous conception of the taxpayer's position.</P>
    <P>Section 15 relates to the Capital Services Redemption Account which was set up under Section 22 of the Finance Act, 1950.  It was intended to give effect to the arrangements under which borrowings for certain voted services, classified as &ldquo;capital,&rdquo; were to be amortised for a period over 30 years so as to involve no permanent addition to the national debt.  The purpose of this section is (1) to adjust, <Col N="219" /> for the remaining 29 years, by reference to actual expenditure, the provisional annuity for the 30 years fixed on the basis of the estimate for voted capital services last year and (2), to fix provisionally a new annuity, also payable for 30 years, in respect of estimated expenditure on such services in 1953-54.  The general arrangements provided for are similar to those in operation in previous years.</P>
    <P>Section 16 has been drafted to enable effect to be given to a condition which formed part of the terms on which the last National Loan was issued.  In the prospectus for that loan, the Government undertook to arrange that stock of the loan would be accepted at its face value, with due allowance for any unpaid interest thereon, as the equivalent of cash in satisfaction of death duties, subject to certain conditions.  This section implements that undertaking.</P>
    <P>Under Section 2 of the Public Revenue and Consolidated Fund Charges Act, 1854, the latest date for presentation to Parliament of the Finance Accounts for the previous financial year is the 30th day of June, if Parliament should happen to be sitting on that date, or, if Parliament be not sitting, then 14 days after the next meeting of Parliament.  It has been found, year after year, that it has not been feasible to prepare the accounts by the 30th June and it has been customary to present them to the Oireachtas in &ldquo;dummy&rdquo;.  It is proposed to depart from that practice and it is hoped that, by extending the date for submission to the 30th September, the true accounts will be presented by the due date.</P>
    <P>Section 18 is the customary section placing the taxes and duties under the care of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Section 19 is the section dealing with the title, construction and commencement of the Act.</P>

      <P>If a visitor from another country, who happened to know enough English to understand the Minister, were here to-day, he would surely get from the Minister's speech a most absurd idea of what the Seanad is being asked to discuss.  This <Col N="220" /> is a Finance Bill in much the same terms as last year's Finance Bill, which added enormously to the burden of taxation on the people and which had serious effects on the economic and social life of the people.  The Minister chooses to deal with it on the Second Stage to-day by giving us, in an undertone, a number of routine Civil Service explanations of various sections as if this were the simplest thing in the world and as if the Bill had no meaning except that it was necessary to introduce it and as if it had no significance for the people at all.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that Section 1, which deals with income-tax, is &ldquo;self-evident&rdquo;. Surely it is self-evident. But what is self-evident about it, and about the whole Bill, is that last year the Minister imposed an immense burden upon the people: that was in 1952.  The Finance Bill which we are now discussing&mdash;the Finance Bill of 1953&mdash;leaves that burden untouched and unlightened in every shape and form.  What is self-evident, apart from income-tax which is surely self-evident, is unemployment.  An immense rise in prices is self-evident.  A lack of relief in this Budget for the people who were hit by last year's Budget is self-evident.  The restriction of credit that resulted from last year's Budget, and from the Minister's policy, and the restriction of enterprise are also self-evident. For anybody living upon a fixed income, and indeed for every class of citizen, the reduction in purchasing power resulting from the Minister's policy and last year's Budget&mdash;which this Budget leaves untouched&mdash;is surely self-evident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister, instead of dealing with these sections as if we were in Committee and were asking for an explanation of their terms, might have given us something in general terms on the Second Stage of this very important measure.  This Bill is the legislative form of the 18th Budget introduced by the Minister or by one of his colleagues on behalf of the Party to which he belongs.  In practically every single one of these Budgets from the beginning, demands made were higher than the demands in the previous one.  Every Budget was <Col N="221" /> introduced into the other House with the same claptrap&mdash;which the Minister did not give us to-day&mdash;about the corner to be turned, the immense plans that the Fianna Fáil Party have for development&mdash;plans which, if the Party is left in office for another year, will surely come to fruition and bring prosperity to everybody and so forth. Always, of course, you have, in every single one of these Budgets, a discussion on the iniquity of those who do not agree with them.  If you agree with them, all other things are added unto you.  You get a national record, an understanding of finance and a completely sound national position.</P>
    <P>Everything that has been said in the other House this time last year was said on many occasions before.  There are always plans verging on fruition. There is always employment to be given in the future.  Always, costs are to be reduced some time&mdash;but, of course, not now.  The truth is that this Budget places the seal, the eighteenth seal, if I may mix my metaphors, upon an immense record of failure.  At the same time, that failure has been accompanied, and is accompanied in this Finance Bill, too, by an increase in the national burden on the people.</P>
    <P>I am old enough to remember the Minister's first Budget and his naïveté, his ignorance of the functions of the Bank of Ireland and of the simplest things in the Finance Bill placed before him.  Then, as now, he blamed his predecessors in office.  He tells us that he was never in favour of Marshall Aid, although he did not object to it when it was brought before the Dáil. It should be emphasised that this is the eighteenth Budget introduced by the Minister or his colleagues, that the burden of taxation is an immense one, that it has had the effect of increasing the cost of living upon everybody, of increasing unemployment and of leaving every one of our national problems unsolved.</P>
    <P>Every single thing that we hoped for one time in the Sinn Féin movement from an Irish Parliament has been left worsened by these years of Fianna Fáil Government.  Employment has not increased and emigration has not been stemmed.  Neither has our national spirit been improved by the <Col N="222" /> curious partisan methods which the Minister and his colleagues have adopted.  Surely we should be able to say that, with this enormous expenditure&mdash;the biggest expenditure ever presented to an Irish Parliament&mdash;we are on the way to solving some of our problems; that our agricultural production was increasing.  That is not so. The great claim is made that there has been an industrial drive.  There has been an industrial drive, but for every person put into employment in industry a person has gone out of employment in agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Look at how they went out during the Coalition period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>They went out during 18 years of the Fianna Fáil Government.  There is no doubt at all about that.  They are going out still, and they are going out in spite of the fact that the Minister is in office and that his Party have been in office for 18 years and always had plans which were going to bear fruit.  We are not more prosperous, more settled, more united or even more Irish now than we were 20 years ago.  The Bill contains some provisions about films, which are to be educational, and which are to affect the Irish language and continental languages.  I wonder is the Minister satisfied with the progress made with regard to education and the Irish language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to put it&mdash;it is the only point I want to make&mdash;that, having placed enormous burdens on the people, having given us immense loads to carry, the Ministers who have been responsible for Government in all that period have not succeeded on any front &mdash;agriculture, employment, production, cost of living, education or anything else.  The Minister has not even succeeded in achieving one of his greatest ambitions which at one time was to have his political opponents spat upon. They have not been spat upon; they are waxing in strength, so that, even there, the Minister has not succeeded. There is no ground for treating this Bill as a routine Bill and preventing the people from understanding that sorry story and the miserable condition of things which indicate a mismanagement <Col N="223" /> of our financial and economic affairs and which leave us in the position that our only hope is the removal of the Minister from office.  The sooner that is achieved the better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree with Senator Hayes that this Bill cannot be treated as a routine Bill.  It is fashionable nowadays for the Budget in every country to be a grand inquiry into the whole financial and economic position of the country.  The debate in the Dáil ranged over such a very wide area that I think we are entitled to touch on a few of the matters dealt with in that debate here.  So far as I am concerned, I propose to touch on very few aspects of the many matters which properly arise in connection with this annual review of the taxation system of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fashionable in other countries to-day to regard the Budget as the regulator of the economic system. Almost in the way in which a tap can be turned on and off, activity can be generated by deficits and checked off by surpluses.  That talk is very fashionable everywhere to-day.  I think it is important to point out that that type of programme has only a very limited application in the circumstances of this country.  A new adjective has been coined in recent years to describe this type of programme, after the name of the inventor or populariser of it, namely, the late Mr. J.M. Keynes. That adjective is Keynesian.  I suggest that Keynesian programmes are not particularly relevant in Irish circumstances. The essence of the Keynesian programme is to generate new incomes to provide a demand for unemployed resoures.  The problems in this country are not problems of unemployed resources so much as problems of undeveloped resources; these problems are not so much financial as physical; the type of unemployment we suffer from is not so much cyclical as what might be called structural. Therefore the generation of money incomes by means of Budget deficits and checking off of incomes by Budget surpluses is not so relevant as in other <Col N="224" /> countries where there is a much greater development, far more resources, a greater state of progress and &mdash;as I will come to point out in a moment&mdash;far less constant preoccupation with the external balance of payments than we have.</P>
    <P>The Keynesian programme became well known during the depression in the United States in the 30's.  There is no question at all that the Keynesian policy and the Keynesian analysis were appropriate in that country, where there was a great depression and no preoccupation of any kind with the balance of payments; but the programme put forward by the Keynesians of the United States in the 30's has been seized on by inflationists all over the world and has been publicised and advocated in countries and in periods far different from those in the United States in the 30's.  Inflation is always a popular policy, a policy for which politicians like to have a justification, and one of the troubles about the Keynesian analysis is that it does seem to provide some sort of respectable justification for inflationary policies even in times when these policies are not appropriate to the situation.</P>
    <P>I have said that the characteristic of the United States economic system in the 30's, and still more to-day, is that American statesmen are free to make their programmes without much regard to the balance of payments.  I should like in that connection to quote from what is generally recognised to-day as the most important and authoritative annual economic report, the Report of the Bank for International Settlements for the year 1952-53. On page 38 of that report, great emphasis is laid on the point I am trying to make now, and, in order to give stress to what I am saying, I propose to quote a paragraph from that report.  That paragraph reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;One thing which is often forgotten in connection with Keynes's analysis is that this analysis presupposes the conditions of a &lsquo;closed economy&rsquo;.  When a country is as large as the United States (and moreover has ample monetary reserves) it may not be too unrealistic to assume that these conditions are <Col N="225" /> present; but if European countries were to base their thinking on the subject of investment on this assumption, it is quite certain that they would overlook very important aspects of the programme.  Thus, those who argue that a credit expansion leads either to the utilisation of &lsquo;unused economic resources&rsquo; or, if such resources do not exist, to an inflationary rise in prices are only too often leaving out of account one further possibility&mdash;namely, that the increase in monetary purchasing power may produce a gap in the balance of payments.  Where this happens the additional monetary purchasing power may well be drained off through the purchase from the Central Bank of the foreign exchange required to pay for the surplus imports, and in these circumstances there may be no rise in prices nor, in the end, any undue increase in the volume of money.  If the fiduciary credit expansion is not compensated by loans or grants received from abroad, the country's monetary reserves are bound to be reduced, as has been shown by the experience of so many European countries in the years since the war. That this should be the case is only to be expected; investment, whether in buildings, plant or equipment, or in stocks, uses up both raw materials and labour; the employment of additional labour will lead to an increase in the demand for consumer goods, and neither these goods nor the raw materials needed can be made to appear just out of the blue; they have to be provided either out of that part of the current national product which is not used for current consumption (i.e., from savings in one form or another) or out of resources obtained from abroad or from reserves&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I suggest that that quotation is one that ought to be borne in mind when dealing with the Irish financial system, because it has been characteristic of this country ever since the Treaty, with the execption of the few years of the war, that our balance of payments has <Col N="226" /> been either barely in equilibrium or out of equilibrium.</P>
    <P>It is fashionable to-day to talk about the repatriation of our external assets.  We have already debated this so many times in the Seanad that I do not feel justified in taking up the time of the House in arguing the matter again.  I will simpy say that there seems to be a general agreement amongst all Parties that such a process of liquidation of external assets can be justified only in order to build up productive investments yielding an equivalent return.  A country which gradually uses up its external assets without replacing them by truly productive investment at home can be, I think, likened to the man who gradually eats into his inherited fortune.  At the beginning of his life his income from investments provides a considerable part of his total income.  As he gets older he liquidates his investments bit by bit and he has to rely for a larger part of his total income on his current earnings.</P>
    <P>That is precisely what is happening in this country, which has been paying for a smaller proportion of its total imports from dividends drawn from abroad.  In that way it becomes more and more imperative for it to rely upon its current output and exports to pay its way.  In connection with this point, I should like to refer to an article in the <i>Financial Times</i> on the 12th May, based on an impor tant study by a well-known original thinker on financial matters, Mr. A.H. Abbati.  The point of this study is that, owing to the liquidation of its external assets in the course of the war, Great Britain has now to rely to a much greater extent than it did before on the current earnings of its own population.  All the generalisations in this article are equally valid for our own country.  It points out:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Now it is a matter of elementary economics that the possession of overseas assets not only benefits the direct owners of those assets but also the economy at large of which those direct owners are members.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Well, Mr. Abbati is out to measure the number of people we, in the not so very different circumstances on this <Col N="227" /> island, have been able to support because we use the income from our overseas investments to pay for food and raw materials.  Disraeli wanted to destroy the idea of two nations, Mr. Abbati, heads one of his chapters: &ldquo;The Concept of Two Populations&rdquo;; one population we support by using indigenous food and raw materials; the other relies on imports, part of which are &ldquo;free&rdquo; imports.</P>
    <P>The article then goes on to give figures showing that, owing to the loss of external assets, the section of the population which can rely on dividends drawn from abroad which used to be something like one-fifth of the total population of Great Britain, is now something like one-eighth.  Similar calculations in this country would give a similar result and would make us pause before we embark on a policy of balancing out current accounts by the dissipation of the savings of past generations.</P>
    <P>There is a certain amount of misunderstanding on this matter caused by the way in which it is frequently discussed.  To advocate the retention of the savings of the past is not to urge that our savings should be lent to a foreign Government at 1 per cent. as the matter is frequently put.  The alternatives are not between having the assets and having consumption. The consumption very largely depends on the possession of the assets.  If the assets are not available the consumption must fall.  It is only a very small part of our external assets which is lent to anybody at 1 per cent.  Part of the assets held in the commercial banks and a greater part of the assets held in the Central Bank are invested in the London Money Market in securities which are so liquid that the rate of interest is very low.  Those securities form an essential part of our external reserves.  They are not only necessary for our liquidity, but in the long run, for our solvency, and to dissipate those assets lightly simply in order to pay our way from year to year would be to swap one asset for another and not necessarily for a better asset.</P>
    <P>There is a passage in the report of <Col N="228" /> the Bank for International Settlements on this matter which is so cogent that I make no apology for quoting it:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Consequently, when domestic saving is inadequate and the deficiency is not made up by foreign loans and grants, the new investment, ostensibly &lsquo;financed&rsquo; by credit expansion is, in reality, paid for by drafts on the monetary reserves.  The country concerned has merely exchanged one type of asset for another.  Only very rarely can such a course be advisable, for the purpose of &lsquo;reserves&rsquo; is, after all, that they should be kept in store to help withstand the exceptional financial strains which may occur in connection with the accumulation of commodity stocks and to provide for unforeseen circumstances in addition to meeting the demands resulting from ordinary seasonal disequilibria. Should the reserves be so slender that their further reduction could prove prejudicial to the maintenance of confidence in the currency or adversely affect the regular rhythm of trade and production, then there can be no doubt that the loss in reserves will more than outweigh the advantages derived from the possession of a few more public works or whatever other investments have been built up by means of the drafts made upon them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wish to come closer to the actual Finance Bill which we are discussing. What I have been attempting to suggest is that inflationary policies will produce disequilibria in our balance of payments, those disequilibria will lead to the loss of external assets and that the loss of the external assets in the long run is a process not to be endured.  That brings me to consider whether the current Budget is inflationary or deflationary in its general tendency.  Is the taxation imposed by the Bill now before the Seanad calculated to produce a pressure on the balance of payments of a kind which registers inflation in this country?</P>
    <P>I think we can say right away that the Budget is not deflationary.  The 1952 Budget was deflationary.  I am not going to enter into any of the controversial questions as to whether if it should have been deflationary, <Col N="229" /> how deflationary it was.  We are all agreed that it was a deflationary Budget.  This Budget is not deflationary. It imposes no new taxes.  It reduces no subsidies.  It does nothing to raise interest rates to a higher level. Assuming that the consequences of the deflation of last year's Budget have now worked their way through the system&mdash;and, I think, that is probably correct&mdash;we can say that the situation confronting us as a result of the Finance Bill is certainly no more deflationary that it was before.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to say whether it could be described as inflationary.  Perhaps the correct description would be to say that it has a potentially inflationary effect.  To the extent to which it is unbalanced, of course, it tends to be inflationary.  To the extent to which any deficit which it may provide for is not made up by new savings, it tends to be inflationary.  The question we really have to ask ourselves is: to what extent is the Budget probably unbalanced?  One could reasonably say that one is entitled to regard it as unbalanced until certain questions are asked.  The first question is: are these economies which have been promised by the Minister in the Dáil really going to take place?  The £3,500,000 reduction of expenditure still remains somewhat nebulous.  The public, I think, would like to have some further details of where these economies are going to be made.</P>
    <P>Another question on which the House is entitled to an answer is the future course of public expenditure. Legislation is at present proceeding through the other House which, if it passes, will, in its very essence, impose an additional burden on the taxpayer and on the ratepayer.  Finally, we are entitled to be informed to what extent the capital programme envisaged in the Budget is truly productive in the sense that it provides the means of its own repayment and will not involve the country in any further deadweight debt.</P>
    <P>The capital programme must also be examined in regard to its effect on the export position.  Looking at the programme contained in the Budget speech&mdash;I do not want to weary the House with figures, but merely to <Col N="230" /> quote a few&mdash;I see that the total amount in the capital Budget is roughly in the neighbourhood of £40,000,000.  Looking over the main items of that, I see the first item is housing, over £10,000,000.  This is a form of expenditure which, whatever its justification may be, does nothing to help exports.  It is also only fair to say in passing, although it may not be strictly relevant to my argument to-day, that it is the most inefficient of industries.  Housing is an industry which has been least mechanised, least brought up to date.  If a certain volume of resources is to be spent in any direction, housing is the direction in which the Exchequer probably gets the least good value.</P>
    <P>In this list, the only items that could be described as helping exports are: agricultural development, £4.7 million; turf development, £1.2 million; afforestation, £.6 million; fisheries, £.1 million; transport £4.4 million; and electricity, £8,000,000.  Adding them all up, the total of the investment which may have a good effect on exports is about £19,000,000, roughly speaking, half the total.  From the point of view of the balance of payments, that is a position that seems to require some justification.</P>
    <P>That brings me to a matter which I dealt with in this House earlier this year, the necessity for a greater degree of control and planning of State investment.  The Minister dealt with this matter in his Budget speech in the Dail&mdash;if I may say so without any disrespect&mdash;rather summarily.  At column 1199, Volume 138, of the Official Debates of 6th May, 1953, the Minister stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Before leaving the subject of capital investment, I think it is necessary to deal with a certain proposal of which you have been hearing a lot of late.  It relates to the establishment of a board to decide investment priorities and watch the effect of total investment on the balance of payments.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He then goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Against our economic background, in which the basic limitation on national development is the low level of current savings, it is <Col N="231" /> surely a misplacing of emphasis to give pride of place to a proposal for controlling and disposing of the nation's savings when the true national need is to induce our people to save as much as possible.  From that point of view, indeed, the introduction of a formalised control of investment would be harmful; for interference with the investor's freedom of choice would discourage private saving.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further on the Minister says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Apart from interference with the freedom of individuals and firms to use their own moneys according to their own desire, we may take it that directives would be issued to banks, insurance companies, building societies, etc., as to the manner in which they should hold their assets. I cannot think of anything more calculated to discourage savings and to undermine confidence in the institutions through which savings are accumulated.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The comment I would like to make on that statement is twofold.  In the first place, I suggest that there is a certain confusion in the whole of this discussion between the volume of saving and the direction of investment. Everybody is agreed that the total volume of savings in this country is insufficient.  As I said earlier, savings are discouraged by the system of direct taxation.  The volume of saving seems to me to be a matter which is related very slightly, if at all, to the existence of the type of investment council which I had in mind when I spoke on the matter before.  I did not envisage that people should be controlled in the use of their own savings or that companies should have to seek permission from anybody for investing their savings in their own business.  I did not even foresee the possibility of private investors and borrowers having to submit to Treasury permission before going to the market.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to admit that at the present stage in regard to the investment of private savings by their owners, whether the accumulators or the borrowers, the test of profitability in a free market may still be the <Col N="232" /> correct test for the best type of investment. However, what was in my mind and what was certainly in the mind of the Banking Commission in 1938, where this matter was discussed, is some more conscious and deliberate control of public investment than that which takes place at the present time.  A larger and larger part of the total investment in the country takes place either through the Government or through Government-controlled corporations. At a time when the absolute volume of savings is scant, when private investment leaves a great deal to be desired, when the rates of taxation are so high as to discourage the production of risk capital, when the margins left over from the very large national Budget are getting smaller and smaller every year, it seems to me that investment by the Government should be very consciously directed towards improving the balance of payments situation.</P>
    <P>I do not think that anybody who knows me in the Seanad or elsewhere could accuse me of having socialistic leanings, but I do think that the most extreme individualist at the present time must concede that every country with balance of payment difficulties must exercise some control over the nature of investment with an eye to keeping the balance of payments right. I suggest that the passage in the Budget speech which I have quoted does not dismiss the necessity for this degree of control.</P>
    <P>This whole discussion regarding investment would, of course, be quite idle and quite pointless if the savings were not present to finance the necessary volume of investment.  The connection between balance of payments and the maintenance of an adequate flow of savings is becoming more and more understood in every country to-day.  On this matter I would like to refer to an article by an Irish writer of authority which has appeared in the <i>Three Banks' Review</i> of June 1953 and I would like to put on record the passage which is so relevant to our affairs.  Talking about deficit financing, which I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, it says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="233" />&ldquo;Thus, it may not be too optimistic to hope that in process of time each country can work out the particular mixture of plan and compensatory finances most congenial to it.  For this to be successfully achieved, however, two things are necessary: first, international equilibrium must somehow be ensured in the sense that major balance-of-payments crises can be avoided; and secondly, equilibrium between the present and the future must be secured in the sense that a sufficient volume of savings will be engendered in the economic system, not merely to maintain the national capital intact, but also to ensure that the accommodation does not fall behind in the race for the application of new techniques.  These two necessities are obviously interdependent, in the sense that a failure as to the second would continually endanger the first.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is true of this country.  The failure of sufficient savings to enable our agriculture and our industry to keep their costs down to the point where they could compete in the modern world would push our balance of payments into a permanent disequilibrium. Therefore it is a matter of the most extreme urgency now, at a time when foreign aid in any form is no longer available and when there is general agreement that the liquidation of external assets cannot be indefinitely tolerated, that savings at home should be encouraged to the maximum degree.</P>
    <P>A great many people think that the present system of income-tax which is repeated in the Finance Bill will not have this effect.  The Minister has at least conceded part of the claim which was made in this House in December, when he was asked to inquire into the system of income-tax.  In the Budget speech he stated that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Arrangements are being made to set up a committee to consider the question of the incidence of direct taxation on production.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a statement which we must all welcome.  But while welcoming it, I think it is only fair to say that there <Col N="234" /> are other aspects of income-tax in this Finance Bill which will not come within the terms of reference of this committee but which nevertheless call for a certain amount of inquiry and revision.  I do not wish to repeat what I said in December, but in general I wish to remind the Minister that, owing to the very small section of the population on which this tax falls and the differential method of assessment on different classes of the population, the fixed income groups bear more than their fair share of the burden of the tax.</P>
    <P>There are two grievances in connection with income-tax.  The first grievance is its purely economic effects on savings and production.  The second grievance is the injustice which it imposes on certain classes of the population. The inquiry which the Minister proposes to set up may tend to remedy the first evil of the tax, but there is nothing in the terms of reference to remedy the second evil of injustice on a small section of the population.  I quote from a memorandum which, I understand, the Minister has already received from the Conference of Professional and Service Associations, where this point is pungently made:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The hardships which an iniquitous and anomalous tax code imposes on heads of families and their dependents does not, apparently, deserve priority of investigation to the incidence of direct taxation on the capital requirements in industry itself.  One wonders what influences were brought to bear on the Minister to convince him of this, and is his decision in the matter another example of political expediency taking precedence over human rights and civic justice?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now the reason I mention this matter is that I think it is peculiarly the function of the Seanad to draw attention to the anomalies in the income-tax code because the very essence of the injustice of the tax is that only 1/17th of the population pays it and that therefore any attempt to improve the situation will attract only 1/17th of the population and may arouse the suspicious of 16/17ths.  The number of people who pay tax is only 1/17th, <Col N="235" /> therefore the number of people who could benefit by any change in the tax system is only 1/17th, so that the 16/17ths of the population who do not pay tax are always liable to find themselves worse off as a result of any change.  Therefore it is a matter in which there is no expectation of popular clamour.  It is not a matter in which there is a great deal of voting strength, and it is because of these very peculiarities that I consider it the duty of the Seanad to repeat these matters over and over again whenever we have the privilege of the Minister's presence in the House.</P>
    <P>It may be said that the present Budget does not make things worse, that there is no change, that it is neutral; but if you have a disease which is slowly eating into the system the fact that there is no change from year to year in its gradual corrosion does not necessarily say that the treatment is neutral.  A mere policy of no change where there is injustice is not neutral. It is perpetuating injustice, perpetuating an injustice that ought if possible to be repaired.  However, as I have said, my principal reason for referring to income-tax is its effect on saving and on the balance of payments. I know that it is a fashionable theory in other countries to-day, although it is going out of fashion slightly, that private savings now can be very largely dispensed with and their place taken by forced savings of one sort or another.</P>
    <P>In the Soviet Union, savings are obtained by a high purchase tax and by compulsory loans.  In other countries, they are obtained by high direct taxation and Budget surpluses. These are the fashionable methods of providing savings for production in countries where, owing to egalitarian policies and a reduction in the standard of living of the richer classes, the flow of private savings can no longer be relied upon to provide enough capital for industry.  On that, I would like again to draw attention to the Report of the Bank for International Settlements, where this matter is discussed. I will not quote the whole paragraph, but simply refer to page 68.  The report points out that Budget <Col N="236" /> surpluses tend to be spent on current consumption, that Ministers of Finance who find themselves with Budget surpluses, instead of using these surpluses for the repayment of debt or for true capital investment, tend to be pressed by their followers and politicians to increasing the national expenditure.  It also points out that Budget surpluses can only be obtained by high direct taxation.  This taxation undermines the flow of private savings, which are a much more desirable source of the finance of investment.  The forced saving which results in Budget surpluses may simply transfer purchasing power from one pocket to another without providing any new funds for investment at all.</P>
    <P>The outstanding aspect of our direct taxation, which is perpetuated in this Finance Bill, is the high system of progression. That high system of progression has been inherited from British models and these models in their turn have been based on various rather outworn social philosophies which have not been widely adopted in other countries in Europe or elsewhere. We have taken over high progressive taxation almost as something which is self-evident.  We have assumed, ever since the beginning of this State, that direct taxes&mdash;income-tax, surtax and death duties&mdash;should be levied at a rate which brings about a considerable equalising of distribution of income of the population.  That is a principle which is not self-evident.  It is widely adopted in Britain to-day as a reflection of a long inheritance of socialist policy; but the rate of progression in our taxation system is a great deal higher than that in almost every other country to-day.</P>
    <P>All I want to suggest is that, whether this progression is justifiable or not, it must not be taken for granted.  There was recently an event in Czechoslovakia which aroused considerable comment. There was an exchange of a new currency for the old and the exchange was on a basis that wealthy people obtained a smaller amount of new currency in exchange for old currency than the poorer people did.  In other words, there was a differential calculation in regard to people's rights, <Col N="237" /> according to the amount of wealth they possessed.  That transaction has been regarded with horror by commentators everywhere in the free world; yet I myself fail to see in what essential respect it differs from what the Minister for Finance in this country is doing every year in his Finance Bill. The people of this country are being taxed at different rates simply because some of them have the misfortune&mdash; shall we say?&mdash;to be better off than others.  That may be a valuable principle of taxation; it may be one which, on the whole, produces good results; but it is one that seems to me to require a further justification than the mere fact that it has entered into the philosophy of a British egalitarian socialist mode of thought.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister, if he has a moment, to study the paper by Sir Roland Nugent, the ex-Minister of Commerce in Northern Ireland, read before the Statistical Society, in which he pointed out that the whole system of income-tax taken over from Great Britain is inappropriate for Northern Ireland conditions, that the system of forced saving which this tax is meant to effect may be all right in Great Britain, where the Budget surpluses are used for the repayment of debt and in that way provide real savings, but that it is quite inappropriate in Northern Ireland, where Budget surpluses go elsewhere.  This gentleman went so far as to say that the whole system of income-tax in Northern Ireland requires fundamental revision.  If that is so in Northern Ireland, may I suggest that it is equally true in this part of Ireland?</P>
    <P>Before I leave income-tax, I want to refer to one other small matter, that with which I dealt last December&mdash;the income-tax allowances for disease, illness and operations.  I wish to congratulate the Minister on one section in the Finance Bill, where the principle of remission of taxation for life insurance policies is carried rather further than it was.  That is definitely a step in the right direction.  I suggest that insurance policies against illness might receive a somewhat similar differential rate of tax.  The urgency of this matter has become greater <Col N="238" /> since I spoke here before.  If the new Health Bill passes into operation, people with under £600 a year will receive certain benefits free, which people with over £600 a year will still have to pay for.  If people in the higher income groups could receive some sort of income-tax concession for the provision that they themselves make against the risk of illness, the pressure for the widening of the classes included in the Health Bill would be, I suggest, considerably reduced.  As it is, the people with over £600 a year who are income-tax payers will now have to pay more than they did before in order to help to provide the benefits for the favoured classes in the Bill. I suggest to the Minister that there is a case for consideration there.</P>
    <P>There are two small matters to which I would like to refer before I conclude. The first is a certain amount of concealed taxation which is going on at the present time.  I am not referring to the rise in postal rates.  I think it is right that the Post Office should pay its own way.  I also think that that principle of the Post Office paying its own way might be extended to Radio Eireann.  A small increase in the licence fee would produce such an additional revenue that Radio Eireann would be entirely independent financially. That, I think, would be from many points of view a move in the right direction.</P>
    <P>The concealed taxation to which I refer is a payment which is still exacted from large classes of women, of 9d. a week for widows' and orphans' pensions.  The Social Welfare Act enables the Minister to exclude certain classes of people from its operation and he has, in fact, done so to a very large degree; but there is one payment which still remains even on the excluded class and I have been asked by certain people who suffer from it and by their representatives to raise the matter to-day.  A great many classes of women lose their employment on marriage and for those women&mdash;civil servants, national teachers, local authority officials, bank and insurance officials&mdash;to have to pay 9d. a week for a risk which is exceedingly remote, really amounts to a form of concealed <Col N="239" /> taxation.  It is very severely felt by the organisations representing these professional classes and I have been asked to raise the matter and to call the Minister's attention to it.</P>
    <P>I come now to the matter of the Civil Service award.  As I understand the Minister's position, his refusal to implement the award in the course of the last financial year was based on his ignorance of the amount of money that would be available.  He stated that, in these circumstances, it was &ldquo;in the public interest&rdquo; to withhold the implementation of the award.  The point I want to make is that every Exchequer and every Minister for Finance must always, to some extent, be in the dark regarding the future course of revenue.  If ignorance of that kind could always be pleaded as a reason for not giving effect to an arbitration award involving additional expenditure, it seems to me that there would be no point whatsoever in having any type of arbitration between the Government and its own servants.  It could always be pleaded that the award could not be brought into operation because the Minister did not know the future fiscal position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Senator has overlooked the fact that the scheme of arbitration does not provide for the automatic implementation of the award and that the question as to whether or not the award will be given effect to has to be considered in relation to the Exchequer position? That is part of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely agree that it is not automatic.  I will not press the matter any further except to suggest that, in relation to the general Exchequer position, it can always be termed in such a way as to justify the postponement of implementing the award.  As the Minister is the sole judge in the matter, perhaps it is slightly unfair to the other party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Minister's judgment may be questioned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>A general rise in State expenditure is not a reason for inflicting hardship on individual State servants.  The argument that the general burden of expenditure and, therefore, taxation is rising, is no answer to the just claims by people who derive their income from the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>I do not accuse the Minister of holding two opinions which are held by certain people and that are very wrong and very unjust.  The opinions I refer to are that civil servants, because they are paid out of taxation, should accept less than the current rate of payment for similar services rendered elsewhere.  Another opinion which is current, is that because civil servants derive their revenue from the Exchequer they should, therefore, cheerfully contribute to the Exchequer by means of direct taxation.  I do not suggest that the Minister shares those views but they are views that many people hold.  All I suggest is that they are not sound views and they are views which, if they were held by the Minister, could lead to a great deal of injustice.</P>
      <P>The Government must always not only do justice but must appear to do justice.  Any action which causes discontent or disappointment or disgruntlement in the Government's own servants is not in the national interest. I should like to point out that the award of which I am now speaking affected a number of people other than civil servants, in the narrow sense of the word.  The Civil Service organisations argued the case and the civil servants bore the brunt of the day, but other classes of persons have reaped consequential gains arising out of that award.  It was stated in the course of the debate that the award would cost the Exchequer £2.4 million a year. While not questioning that figure for a moment, the whole of that £2.4 million does not go to the extra pay of the civil servants.  I am informed that the civil servants derive about £1,000,000 and that the other £1.4 million is paid to other people who benefit by the award.  Therefore, the suggestion that the Civil Service is costing the country £2,500,000 more as a result of the award is misleading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="241" /> I apologise for having kept the House so long, but on the rare occasions on which we have the privilege of the Minister's presence, I think we must take every opportunity we can of stating our grievances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to follow Senator O'Brien over many of the interesting issues which he raised.  I should like him to clarify some of the points he made, but I find myself in the position that I have to deal with the Minister's Budget speech and the Minister's tax policy.  I have something to say on this measure which I want the Minister to hear, because I want to hear his replies.</P>
      <P>I do not think that the Minister, any more than any other member of his Party, can feel particularly happy about the policy of taxation which he and his Government have pursued since they returned to office.  There is much evidence in the country of dissatisfaction. The nonchalant manner in which the Minister introduced his Bill this afternoon would tend to give one the impression that we had peace, order, progress and contentment all around us.  We know quite well that that is not the situation and that, underneath, there is a considerable degree of tension, dissatisfaction and lack of confidence in the present and the future.  A great many of our citizens, and very worthy citizens, are not quite clear as to how they stand and as to what the outlook is.  I suggest that that situation has been brought about by the Minister's Government and especially by the Minister himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister came back to office, he made a number of very foolish speeches.  When he introduced his Budget last year, of which this Budget is a repeat, he imposed considerable burdens on the country as a whole.  The types of speeches he was making about the plight of the country and about its being almost on the border of bankruptcy, so disturbed the minds of a great many people, that there has been a slowing down in the velocity with which money was circulating and, in addition, there has been a considerable drawing-off of money that could wisely be spent in the country. <Col N="242" /> That contraction is showing itself in every walk of life in this country to-day. The Minister could not walk half a mile through any of the streets of this town without running against dozens of people who are affected by his policy. What is most regrettable about the whole situation is that there is no sign of appreciation on the part of the Minister, or the Government, of the situation, and no evidence of any change of policy or any hope for the future.  I am quite convinced that that is why the country is expressing itself as it is in the ballot boxes when it gets the chance.</P>
    <P>One of the urgent problems to-day, according to ministerial statements, is unemployment, but Senator Hayes told us, and rightly so, that ministerial declarations always point to the sunshine around the corner.  We just have not reached it yet, but there is always relief in the distance.  There are a great many people hoping for relief quickly and we see nothing in governmental plans to give them justification for confidence.  There is considerable unemployment in the country.  There is unemployment in the cities, but it is to be seen in the country towns as well and I propose to speak frankly about it.  Perhaps I do not know as much about it as people living in the city, but I am trying to observe.</P>
    <P>I believe that the present Government's policy in relation to this whole question of unemployment from the beginning was unsound.  They introduced a policy of unemployment assistance years ago when they came into office and it did more to create unemployment than any other single act of any Government since the State was founded.  They have produced a situation to-day in which there are a great many people unemployable who would have been good workers if their original policy had never been introduced. I have a good deal of sympathy with the Government in this matter. I believe they were originally at fault and I do not see them, in regard to the administration of the plan as it is, making any effort to make amends.</P>
    <P>They are suffering to-day and the country is suffering for their sins of the past, but when one looks at the <Col N="243" /> situation all over the country at the moment, one sees that there is an attitude towards work in the country which will have to be changed if the country is to survive.  The Government did a great deal to disorganise working people and when I speak of working people, I refer not to people in cities or towns, but all over the country.  We have a situation now in which work apparently is available for able-bodied men not at their own doorsteps, but they are not prepared to go out and take it.  That whole situation is very deplorable and very regrettable, but my judgment is that that situation has to be faced up to.  It is not a very popular thing to say and it is not going to be a very easy problem for a political Party to resolve, but unless the political Parties in the Parliament face up to the situation which is being created by wrong judgment in the past, I do not think we are going to get thousands of people working for whom work is available to-day and who do not want to work because they can find something else.</P>
    <P>The net result of all that is that taxation is pressing very heavily on the number of citizens who are producers and who, in the main, as primary producers, have to find the wherewithal from which all others pay their taxation.  The number of producers is nothing like the number of consumers we have, but the number of people who are to-day burdened with taxation out of proportion to what they ought to bear is entirely different from what it might be if the citizens faced up to their obligations as they ought.  When I was the age of some of the young men in the country to-day, I was out in the fields between 6 o'clock and 7 o'clock in the morning. I came into my breakfast after 8 o'clock and went back to the fields.  I came back to my dinner and finally came back from the fields between 6 o'clock and 7 o'clock in the evening. Many of these people are not prepared to do this sort of work to-day and when we hear complaint about the burden of taxation, we have to take cognisance of the fact that the people who work have to find the taxation which these people are paying when <Col N="244" /> they smoke cigarettes or attend the pictures, despite the fact that they are not producers at all.</P>
    <P>This sprang originally from the policy pursued by the Government and there is no sign of our facing up to that situation.  Until we do, this country is not going to be able to enjoy the standard of living which many of our people want for themselves and which some of us are entitled to have, but cannot have, because the burdens of taxation which the Minister imposes on us who work are out of all proportion to what we ought to carry because there are so many others who will not work.  I think it was the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who said recently&mdash;I am sure the Minister for Finance has said it too and, if he has not, he will say it before this debate has concluded&mdash;that we are practically out of the wood, that he has straightened out finances and that the bankrupt situation which he inherited when he came into office has now been put behind him, due to his wisdom and careful handling of the nation's resources.</P>

      <P>I did not hear what the Senator said.  I do not think that any speeches we make here on the Minister's taxation policy are of real value, unless we can hitch them up to the concrete everyday problems which confront the nation in its ordinary affairs and in its task of trying to balance production with the purchases we require for our everyday needs.</P>
      <P>Some figures were produced recently which indicated that 75 per cent. of our total exports last year came from agriculture.  The Minister can contradict that statement, if it is not a fact, but I think it is.  I want to suggest to the Minister that I do not regard the prospects for the coming year as being anything like as hopeful as they were in the past year.  Senator O'Brien referred to the position which we are maintaining of equilibrium in the balance of payments and I should like to have heard him applying his mind to this and analysing it to see what he thinks of the prospects of the future. I regard this as all-important and I ask Senators to keep in mind the figure I have given of 75 per cent. of our total exports coming from agriculture. Here is what the Minister says about it in his Budget speech dealing with the potentialities of agriculture:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Government have provided incentives in a more direct and useful way by guaranteeing high prices for agricultural produce, by arranging markets, by draining, reclaiming and fertilising the land, by making credit available for the purchase of stock and machinery and by providing educational and advisory services.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am quoting from the Minister's Budget speech of the 6th May, column 1185 of the Dáil Debates. I do not think we are doing anything like enough in this matter at all.  What prices have we guaranteed?  We have guaranteed the price of wheat.  There is some guarantee in regard to the <Col N="246" /> price for barley for malting, but not for any other kind of barley as far as I know.  There is a guarantee for the price of cattle, pigs and pig meats exported to Britain.  If the British Government go back to private trading again, have they stated in this agreement that there is no guarantee that the prices written into the agreement will be paid to us?  I understand that is the position.  In another 12 months they hope to have meat derationed and go back to private trading.  When that stage is reached, apparently we will have no security as to what price we are going to be paid.  I am not surprised at the British acting like that. That is what they have always done. They have not signed the International Wheat Agreement.  They have their reasons for that.  What is our attitude in that matter?  Have we signed that document?</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear that that is so.  As far as I can see, the British are pursuing a policy to break agricultural prices all over the world. If there is evidence of more meat being available on the world market this time next year, I do not think we can be quite sure that the prices which were written into the last trade agreement are going to be paid to us.  Even if they are, the prices that were there were made by the Minister's predecessor in office with some slight change.</P>

      <P>There is not an article changed in that except the 6d. per cwt. additional which we are supposed to get in regard to the differential price between our cattle and what is <Col N="247" /> sold in the Six Counties or Britain. Actually, the prices to-day are above the prices fixed in the agreement, so that that is of no great consequence at all.  I am pointing to something that I regard as serious and dangerous for the future.  Earlier in his speech, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Last year, for the first time, exports exceeded £100,000,000.  The actual total was £101.5 million or £20,000,000 more than in 1951.  Of the rise in value, only £2,500,000 can be attributed to higher prices; most of the increase was due to greater volume.  Cattle, dressed meat, tinned beef and the products of new industries, such as sweetened fat, showed the largest increases.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>These were the figures he gave in regard to 1951.  He said there were increases in volume more than in value. It is true that there were increases in value, too, but the Minister says there were increases in volume.  I want to suggest to the Minister that he is not going to have as much available for export this year and that the volume available to him was the product of what his predecessor in office had left for him.  We cannot quarrel about that. That is the fact, as the figures will show.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to urge on the Minister very strongly that this is what I fear the country will be up against and that it imperils our position very greatly in regard to the balance of payments. <Col N="250" /> The Minister may choose to ignore that, but he will do so at his peril.  I am quoting from column 1183, Volume 138, of the Dáil Debates of the 6th May, 1953, where the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Cattle, dressed meat, tinned beef and the products of new industries, such as sweetened fat, showed the largest increases.  In the last quarter of 1952, however, the rate of expansion slackened.  Nevertheless, there has since been no falling back and, indeed, exports in March of this year were the highest ever recorded for a single month.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that those exports of March of this year are exports which probably we will not see again.  This is a serious prospect for our balance of payments.  A very big proportion of those exports went to the United States of America, for which we received dollars.  That market is gone.  It will not be available to us in the coming March, nor perhaps again for a very long time.  Anybody who is following the immense rise in the figures of the cattle stocks in the United States of America and in Canada is quite clear about that.  As far as I can recall, our exports to the United States of America were something over £3,500,000.  A great deal of that was shipped in the month of March last year.  There are other people in the House who can speak with, perhaps, more knowledge and authority than I and they will agree that this will raise rather serious problems in regard to our capacity to purchase from the United States of America.</P>
    <P>There is another problem which seems to me to be a very urgent one in regard to the whole question of our exports of live stock in the future.  I am glad to see Senator O'Donovan in the House.  He can speak with more authority on this than I.  It is a number of years since he raised this question first, and I have to confess that I did not realise the significance of the problem then as he saw it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

    <Col N="251" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps that is how it looked at the time.  What I want to draw the Minister's attention to is that in Britain to-day&mdash;by Britain I mean Scotland, England and Wales&mdash; there is an intense drive going on for the eradication of T.B. in their herds. I am quoting from the <i>Farmers' Weekly</i> of some weeks ago, of which I have not the date.  They say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;By the beginning of April 41.4 per cent. of the 9,000,000 cattle in the country were in attested herds compared with 34.3 per cent. a year ago.  More than 500,000 cattle have been brought into the attested herd scheme during the year, bringing the total to 3,855,738.  Attested herds have increased from 79,500 to 100,000.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is much more said here on the subject, but I need not read it.  It is sufficient to bring the attention of the Minister and the House to the kind of problem with which we will be confronted in the not too distant future. The Minister, in part of his speech, drew attention to the increased number of store cattle which we exported last year.  I have given some evidence to indicate that the number of stores available for export this year will be fewer.  I doubt if the price will be as high as it was last year, and unless we can increase the number of cows we will not have more stores either for export or for building into mature beef for export.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a much more serious situation when you realise that in a very short time 50 per cent. of the cattle in Britain will be in attested herds and no beasts will be brought on any of those farms where this stock is unless they are free from T.B.  Will the Minister tell us what we are doing about that?  Will we be up against the situation in a very short time that when our farmers bring their stock to the fair unless they can give evidence of the cattle being free from T.B., they are not going to be exported out of the country or will only be exported to so delimited an area in Britain as to depreciate seriously the value of the stock, because there will not be competition for them? <Col N="252" /> That is an urgent problem about which I do not see the Minister or the Government taking any action.</P>
    <P>There is no progressive farmer who can have confidence that the Minister and his colleagues have a policy which will enable us to get the greatest production out of the land.  I see no evidence of that question being tackled as it should be.  Perhaps some of the farmers here have a slightly different point of view.  My view is that the full utilisation of our land, the maximum output from every acre, is what the country wants if we are to maintain equilibrium in the balance of payments.</P>
    <P>I know there are some people here who will have a great deal to say about tillage and its value.  I have never disputed the value of tillage.  On the farm on which I was brought up, and in my own county, the people whom I knew were always concerned about doing a fair share of tillage.  There are certain crops we could grow and there are those which we could not grow properly.  Tillage is important, but we must realise that no matter what the Minister does by filling the fields with inspectors, by going down to the farmers and coaxing them, or by raising the prices sky high, there is a limit to the area that you can have tilled in this country.</P>
    <P>There are many reasons for that. There are problems of climate and the type of soil; there are problems with regard to labour, with regard to technique in doing the job and with regard to capital equipment available. There are all sorts of considerations which decide and determine for a man what he is going to do on his farm. What I think is right for us to do is to aim at getting the maximum production out of every acre.  I have here a copy of a lecture delivered in March, 1953, at the Royal Dublin Society, by Professor William Davies, Director of the Grassland Research Station, Berkshire.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting from <i>Agricultural Ireland,</i> April, 1953.  He gave <Col N="253" /> figures of output from an acre of land utilised in different ways, and the first he gave us of the yield per statute acre at the grassland research station where he worked was from an acre of grass. From the acre of grass there was a yield of 74 cwt. of dry matter.  The starch equivalent was 44.4 cwt. and the protein was 8.9 per cent.  Now an average good lea will produce 24 cwt. of oats.  The straw will be 36 cwt. That means that you have from the crop of oats 19.4 cwt. where from the crop of grass you had 44.4 cwt.  A 25-ton crop of kale will give you 43.9 cwt. A crop of potatoes, a ten-ton crop, will give you 36 cwt. of starch equivalent. A crop of swedes will give you 28 cwt. and a crop of mangolds of 20 tons will give you 30 cwt.</P>
      <P>There you have that whole table of an acre of land used in a different way for different crops and the heaviest yield of starch equivalent from any crop is from the acre of good grass. What I want to urge on the Minister is this, and I have tried to urge it in this House before, that no matter what we do I cannot see us passing the 3,000,000 acres of tillage, or 3,500,000 at the most, and there are 8,000,000 acres of grass left after that.  That being so, I would like if the Minister and his colleagues, or some successor of the Minister and his colleagues, will apply their minds to that problem of full production from the land.  They have got to concentrate upon the production of grass, and what are they doing about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Something else has to happen after that.  You are not going to go in for that high production of grass, that high cost production of grass, to feed it to the 1,150,000 cows or their progeny.  You want 2,150,000 cows, at least, and their progeny to eat that grass.  There is no problem to resolve in regard to equilibrium in the balance of payments if we face doing that job, and that is what the country requires. I have to confess that I have never seen much effort on the part of the Minister to have a proper appreciation of that side of the economic life of the country, but that is not going to be <Col N="254" /> done without something else being done too, and the problem of capitalisation of agriculture in this country to-day must be tackled forthwith.</P>
    <P>I cannot go out to spend £4 or £5 per acre on the purchase of artificial manures unless I have got the capital or the credit.  I know that the Minister will tell you, and I think he told you in this House on a previous occasion when I raised this matter, that the farmers have the money in the banks.  Maybe some of his own farmer supporters will answer that query.  I am sure that there is a considerable sum of money deposited in the banks in the names of farmers.  That is probably the hard earnings of their sons and daughters who were working on the farms, the unpaid sweated labour of their sons and daughters.  There are farmers, I have no doubt, with money in the banks in this country to-day, and that money could be much more profitably utilised on their own land. It is not being done.  I ask the Minister &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>You know what is said about the ordinary farmer&mdash;how cautious he is, how wise he is, how shrewd he is and all the rest.  If the farmer knows that £200 which he has in the bank will yield him 10 per cent. if he puts it into manures to put into his land, why is he taking £2 out of the bank interest on leaving it there?  Say a man may have £200 and he has nothing due to his son or daughter.  Why does he leave it there?  In my opinion he does not know the return he can get from investing it in his land.  That is the real reason.  It has not been brought home to the farmer yet how important is capital investment in his own land, even for a man who has got it.  It has been brought home to some of the others and they have not got the capital and they cannot find it.</P>
    <P>That is an urgent problem and the immediate problem confronting us, and the Minister and his colleagues may say, as he said in his speech, that by providing educational and advisory services, that is going to be done.  You have not merely to increase these educational and advisory services but you have to face up to the problem of agricultural  <Col N="255" /> education and research in a way which is not being done at the moment.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will tell us what is happening with regard to the plan that is gone to America, whether that plan has been approved or not?</P>
    <P>I come to my final point.  I said at the beginning that the Minister made, in my opinion, a number of foolish speeches.  He frightened the lives out of people; even the conservative farmer who may have had money to put into his land was so frightened by the Minister's speech that he decided the best thing he could do was to hold on to what he had.  When no one knew what was going to happen after the things the Minister was saying he felt that he might be left without anything in a short time.  I am convinced that the Minister impressed these people, rather conservative, cautious-minded people on the land who might have kept money in circulation if the Minister had been more cautious in what he said.</P>

I am absolutely satisfied it is the sort of speech the Minister delivered in the early days of his office that has created that situation for the businessmen in town and country.  I want to say, finally, that the whole problem of providing capital for agriculture has to be faced anew.  I suggest that we should send some group of people to a country that is very little talked about in this country and of which we know altogether too little, and that is Portugal.</P>

We are trying to copy other people who have an economic and cultural attitude of mind and all the rest different entirely from us, and we are not succeeding, and if we looked around the corner again it might possibly be useful to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to misrepresent the Minister at all, but I am ready to say this and I think it is of profound interest to him because I know what the rates of interest are in the East and I have met people and talked with them and they have said about Portugal &ldquo;if only we could copy that.&rdquo;  He said that, looking at this <Col N="257" /> map, we can immediately see that £16,125,000 sterling is destined to go to agricultural investments, which will be made up under three heads&mdash;agricultural hydraulics, afforestation and internal colonisation.  Long-term credits are afforded to the farmers through the agricultural credit banks which are at present part of the Caixa General de Deposit.  At present these total about £12,500,000 at 4 per cent. interest on easy repayment terms. These facilities will continue in the same way.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister very proud of his achievements, when the Agricultural Credit Corporation&mdash;as was given in some answer or statement recently on the number of applicants turned down out of the total applications made&mdash; have turned down so many that probably only about 35 per cent. of the people applying there get loans&mdash;and they get them at 6 per cent.?  That is the sort of problem confronting us.</P>
      <P>We are not facing any of these problems at all.  We have the unemployed there because of things we did in the past.  I have pointed to facts which I believe will be responsible for bringing down the volume and the value of our imports in the days ahead.  I have indicated the way in which, in my view, we should face up to land utilisation and the things we require to do to make that policy effective.  My belief is that we ought to go out with faith and with teachers to the farmers of Ireland and indicate to them how best they can use the land for their own sake and the nation's sake and provide the machinery to use it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister tells us in some place that taxation lies lightly on the land. I do not know about that.  Senator Summerfield might give us some figures of the sales of tractors and agricultural machinery which we have been buying and what these cost to run and to maintain.  The Minister's statement, of course, is not representative of the position at all.  The Minister's policy has left the country in a frame of mind in which it does not know what the future holds.  The Minister's land policy is such that none <Col N="258" /> of us know just what exactly we ought to do to-morrow.  The figures showing the fall in the number of milch cows indicate clearly the reason why we had to pay £2,000,000 to the New Zealanders last year for butter, although in the previous year we spent only £1.5 millions for the import of it. We will have to go on doing that if we do not face this situation in a realistic way.  I do not know whether the Minister is the person to do it.  I do not think he is.</P>

      <P>As Senator Hayes pointed out in opening this debate, the reliefs given by the Bill we are discussing to-day are as little as they were last year.  It was stated that the 1952 Budget was modelled on the English Budget, though conditions in the two countries are entirely different.  The Budget in Britain this year brought certain reliefs to the people there, so much so that many were optimistic in this country that if the 1952 Budget followed on the lines of Britain the 1953 Budget here would follow on the same lines and bring similar reliefs. People who felt in that way have been sadly disillusioned.</P>
      <P>It was also stated last year by several that the Budget was drafted on the suggestions of, or on the lines laid down by, the Central Bank.  Those of us who had contacts with people identified in the fight that brought about the freedom of this country felt that freedom meant more than actually having the harp substituted on our stationery for the crown.  We felt that we would have freedom in financial matters and not have the finances of the country in the stranglehold of the banks, that the Government would be able to utilise our finances for the development of our own resources and not place huge sums of money at a small interest in the banks to be used by foreign Governments for the development of their own resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Central Bank in its report for 1951 also recommended the removal of subsidies.  It pointed out that the removal of food subsidies would naturally mean raising the cost of living, but they also said it compensated in another way, in that it would reduce consumption&mdash;which was tantamount <Col N="259" /> to a statement that the people were eating or consuming too much in this country.  Anyhow, whether the Government followed the advice in that report or not, whether the following was a coincidence food subsidies were removed.  In my own county last year, during the by-election campaign, certain speakers of the Opposition warned the people from the platforms as to the consequences of supporting the Government candidate, saying that they had got a very severe Budget and that it would be still worse by the removal of the food subsidies the following July.  I myself heard many speakers on the Government side, among them a Parliamentary Secretary, giving the lie to that assurance, saying: &ldquo;Surely you do not imagine that the Taoiseach would be guilty of such a cruel action as to remove subsidies that are making essential articles of food cheaper for the people?&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">

      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>People had only to wait for a few days to find out that they were disillusioned.  The Central Bank also recommended a change in the wage policy, saying that wages were too high.  Though the removal of food subsidies would naturally make food dearer and therefore necessitate higher wages, that report was more or less followed in some cases.  I think it was a most disedifying spectacle last Sunday, as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> and other papers on Monday, to see a Parliamentary Secretary addressing his constituents and referring to some of the sins of commission of the inter-Party Government, stating they were responsible for agreeing to the setting up of an arbitration committee whose findings resulted in increasing the salaries of civil servants and other servants of the State and thereby adding to the present Government's financial difficulties.  It is not necessary for me to point out that if those people who benefited by the findings of the arbitration body were in a position to resort to the means by which organised bodies in the labour movement agitate for wages commensurate <Col N="260" /> with the higher prices that obtained&mdash; that if those bodies whose scanty increase was objected to by a Parliamentary Secretary were in a position to apply the same means as were adopted and as could be adopted by organised labour bodies&mdash;they would certainly come out of it better than being denied half of the increase to which they were legitimately entitled.</P>
      <P>The Government have gone out of their way, since they resumed office in 1951, to justify the very severe impositions that their policy has inflicted on every section of the community.  They have attributed their policy to the spendthrift policy of their predecessors, to their incompetence and to various other causes.  It is unnecessary for me to point out that the people at large do not believe those charges and, when all is said and done, in the long run it is the people who count.  I am quite satisfied that when the people get an opportunity they will indicate their views in no uncertain manner, as they have done in the constituencies in which by-elections were recently held. The people do not believe that the present high cost of living is justified or that the policy adopted by the Government is a proper one for this country and when they get an opportunity of expressing an opinion on the matter they will do so in a way that cannot be misunderstood.</P>
      <P>During the debate on this Bill last year, Senator O'Brien said that the Budget is a powerful weapon to influence the economic life of the country&mdash; for good or evil, I expect, because you have good Budgets and bad Budgets. He also spoke about a Budget being an instrument of progress and said that there are two criteria by which a good Budget or progress can be gauged.  He said that these criteria are a higher standard of living and an increased population.  Judged by either of these two standards, or by both, I am quite satisfied that the present Government has come very badly out of the test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHartney" hpid="Mr. Hartney Mr. Hartney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hartney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that we can all agree on one thing, and that is, that if the Budget were extracting less, every section of the community and every <Col N="261" /> individual would prefer it; it would be fine for all of us.  It is very easy to say that there has been no relief in the present Budget but everybody who has said that has failed to mention one heading under which relief could have been given.  The Minister could have cut the Budget by £10,000,000 if we were prepared to slash services.  It is a pity that somebody did not mention what services might usefully be slashed. For instance, could you take £2,000,000 off education where the people engaged in it, even after getting the increases, are still underpaid?  Other people in the service of the State consider that they are underpaid and that they are entitled to more.  Must we go back, as a last resort, and take it from the old age pensioner, as was done in days gone by?  If you want services you must pay for them, and if you reduce your services you will have less to pay. That is clear to anybody.  One need not be a master of finance to understand it.</P>
      <P>There has been much talk about a restriction of credit, but I fail to see evidence of it.  I have not heard any complaint about it in my own county, and I have not heard any complaint about it on any of the public bodies of which I am a member.  I see no evidence of a restriction in credit.  The credit is there for any farmer who is creditworthy.  Better still, we have reached the happy position in which fewer of our farmers require credit.  I think we can be proud of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could spend a month debating increased production because many aspects of it must be examined.  Perhaps certain suggestions for increasing production could be put forward that might be very badly received by members of this or the other House.  For instance, one way in which we could increase production would be by reducing the size of a lot of the farms in the country.  The ten-acre and the 12-acre man is producing much more per acre than the 200-acre, 250-acre and 300-acre man.  Consider the number of people who were migrated from the western seaboard to Meath and Westmeath.  If the production <i>per capita</i> of the land which they work in Meath and Westmeath <Col N="262" /> were compared with the production before these migrants got that land, I think it would make very interesting reading indeed.</P>
    <P>We have heard talk about the price of money, and the Agricultural Credit Corporation was referred to.  Undoubtedly, we should all like to get money at a cheaper rate.  Money was very cheap when the Agricultural Credit Corporation came into existence and one would think it would be natural to say that money would be made available at about 3 per cent., which was very far from being the case.  Most of us will remember the spring of 1924 when appeals were made to the then Government and the then Minister for Agriculture to relieve the people who had suffered losses.  Certain types of societies were set up in the South through the creameries.  You paid £1 and the Government paid £2 against that.  The interest charged in 1924, when money was very valuable, was 5 per cent.  If 5 per cent. was justifiable in 1924, surely it is justifiable now, and a good bit with it, considering the change in the value of money?</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter suggested that we should increase substantially the number of dairy cows.  We must examine the two sides of that statement and its implications.  If we have a surplus of butter, what will we do with it?  We must sell it for whatever price we can get on the British market.  Are we to go back to the source of all our evils in this country and have the Minister for Finance subsidise it?  Either one thing or the other would have to be done.</P>
    <P>For the past 20 or 30 years the number of cows in this country has been approximately 1,250,000.  Sometimes the figure is a little higher and sometimes it is a little lower.  In 1936, during the economic war, we had the greatest ever production of butter in this country.  Owing to our economic conflict with Great Britain at that time, facilities were made available for the purchase of calf heifers, and so forth, with the result that a great many of our people engaged in dairying in spite of themselves.  The output was a bit down in 1937.  The economic <Col N="263" /> war ended in 1938 and a lot of people got rid of the cows and went back to store cattle and beef raising.</P>
    <P>In my creamery area last year, although the second half of the year was very bad for the production of milk, because it was too dry, we were substantially up on the previous year. Limerick may be taken as the premier dairying county and I speak for one of the biggest creameries in the county when I say that we were well up last year, according to our balance sheet, in the number of gallons supplied and pounds of butter manufactured, on the previous year.  Things were no better in that area and no easier than they were anywhere else, and, looking at it from that point of view, there is no terrible decline in the number of dairying cows.  If we consumed as much butter to-day as we consumed 20 years ago, we would not need to import a pound of butter from New Zealand, but the whole market has expanded&mdash; it is very fine that it has&mdash;and that is why there is a necessity for the provision of so much butter.  It is something we might well be proud of.</P>
    <P>So far as tillage is concerned, no Minister expects everybody to turn up every acre of his land, but the reason we have not as much production as we might have from tillage is that not everybody enters into it in the spirit of producing a fair amount.  If everybody produced a fair amount, the national pool would be very substantial, and, until it is approached in that way, we cannot expect to get results. Prices are reasonably good&mdash;far better than in any other country&mdash;for wheat, beet and such commodities and, so far as price inducement is concerned, it cannot be argued that it is inadequate. Manures are a product over which we have very little control, but nevertheless I heard a farmer in Limerick saying: &ldquo;We gave £3 a ton for slag and we got 3½d. a gallon for milk.&rdquo;  You can work out from that whether slag is worth its price to-day.</P>

      <P>He gave £3 a ton for slag and got 3½d. a gallon for milk.  I <Col N="264" /> leave it to anybody else to work out whether slag is abnormal to-day or not.  These are matters over which we have very little control because we must take them at the price fixed by the gentleman who sends them in.  We hope we have reached the peak of national expenditure and that, if any change comes, it will be in the taxpayer's favour.  The point, however, is that there is a demand for increased services.  It is the people who are demanding these increased services and you cannot have your loaf and eat it. If we want the services we think we are entitled to, we must be prepared to pay for them.  If we are prepared to do without them and to have a lower standard of living, that can be done, but it is a policy which would find very little support in this or in any other country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister replies, I should be glad if he would say a little more about the committee which it is proposed to set up.  He may have made some other references to it in the Dáil which I have overlooked, but, so far as I know, all the information we have about the committee is to be found in his Budget statement, in which he said that it was contended that the present incidence of tax</P>
      <P>&ldquo;constitutes a deterrent to the modernisation and extension of productive capacity...the Government have decided that the matter should be fully investigated.  Arrangements are being made to set up a committee to consider the question of the incidence of direct taxation on production.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I should like to know if it is his intention to have very narrow limits to the terms of reference to that committee, or will they be wide and give a good deal of discretion as to what the committee may report on.  I should also like him to give us an idea of what type of person is to serve on the committee and when is it likely to be set up.  There is a good deal of interest in the committee and many members of the public would be pleased to have further information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="265" /> On at least half a dozen occasions over the past ten years, I have urged the setting up of a committee to deal with the income-tax problem.  I do not propose to repeat the arguments but I have again and again expressed my conviction that the tax, as it affects industry and commerce, is unfair, not because it is a tax on income, but because it is so arranged that it is not a tax on income only, and the effect of taxation, as stated by Mr. Hall in his survey, has meant that very few indeed of our commercial companies, whether distributive or manufacturing, have maintained their capital intact during the past ten years.  I am therefore very interested in the setting up of the committee, but I am still of the same opinion as I was at the time when I dealt with this proposal in detail, that it is not practicable or wise to deal with that aspect of income-tax alone.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that if you attempt to confine it entirely to the direct effect on production, it will be impracticable because of its close relation to the tax on individuals who take part in production, and who may be the workers in production.  I am also very much afraid that it will be impossible to get any Government to deal with income-tax on business profits alone, in view of the intense resentment which may be felt by individual payers of tax who have real or imaginary grievances, but grievances which are genuinely felt, and who may think that some unfair preference is being given to business.  I have never advocated anything in the nature of a preference to business profits, but I have advocated that the assessment of tax on business should be on real profits and that profits should be properly measured. At the same time, I do recognise that there is a danger that if you deal with this alone and completely ignore what seems to be the inequities in the application of income-tax to individual incomes, you may have resentment and may fail to achieve your purpose.</P>
    <P>I therefore urge the Minister to think a second time and see whether it would not be in the public interest, and whether it would not be wiser, to <Col N="266" /> give considerably wider terms of reference to the committee.  It is an investigating committee which presumably will have nothing to do with Party politics, as such.  It will be a committee for the provision of information for whatever Minister may deal with future Budgets, whether of this or of any other Government.  It seems to me that it would be very wise indeed, when we are spending the money and going to the trouble of having an investigation, that its terms of reference should not be confined so narrowly as the Minister seemed to confine them in his Budget speech.  His speech was vague and it may be that he did not intend them to be as narrow as they seemed to be.</P>
    <P>One of the Deputies who is most regular and dependable in his support of the Government, speaking on the vote of confidence in the Dáil, said: &ldquo;I do not think there is any doubt that the people are dissatisfied with the Government's economic policy.&rdquo;  I do not think there is any doubt whatever that, rightly or wrongly, people of all kinds, rich and poor, are thoroughly dissatisfied and feel that, somehow or other, it should be possible, by means of a changed economic policy, to ease the state of business depression and the consequent unemployment which exists at the moment.  It seems to me that it is not enough in a democratic country to have your taxation fair and equitable; you must have your taxation devised so that the people will feel that it is fair.  That is another reason why I would urge the Minister to widen the terms of reference of the committee.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I ought to say that, having given a certain amount of study to income-tax law, I am personally by no means convinced that a great many of the grievances felt by the public will, in fact, prove to be justified.  I think some of them will, but I am convinced that there is a real underlying feeling of resentment and dissatisfaction which can only be met after a full and public investigation by people of a representative character who to the mind of the people will be detached from any Party politics.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to follow, even if I <Col N="267" /> were competent to do so, Senator George O'Brien in detail, but there is one thing to which he referred and which has always interested me and which I think should be included in any revision of our income-tax code. He urged that there should be some provision to cover insurance for health. It seems to me that it should be possible to devise some scheme by which the tax would be eased on persons who make adequate provision for their own health and, therefore, to that extent relieve the State of liabilities.</P>
    <P>There is one particular suggestion that I wanted to make in the hope that it might possibly be dealt with as what the Revenue Commissioners call a concession, perhaps, not this year but next year.  I came across a letter in the Press not very long ago&mdash;and I have since heard of one or two other cases &mdash;concerning a person suffering from infantile paralysis who was sufficiently well to be again able to earn a livelihood, but owing to the fact that that particular person is unable to walk there is a heavy expense in getting to and from work.  The cost of travel to and from employment is something which, I think, is part of the cost of earning the income, and I have always thought that it should be allowed as expenses.  For various reasons which I can appreciate, mainly administrative, no Minister has ever been prepared to concede that point.  I would like to suggest that it might be possible to allow some discretion.  It is said that hard cases make bad law, but these are not simply hard cases. They are a number of persons who through disability of one kind or another have abnormal expenses in getting to their work.  It should be made easy for them to work.  I think at very small cost to the State a concession of that kind might be made. Sometimes, when a matter of this kind is mentioned in public, it has led to an alteration.  I put this forward as something which I seriously think might be met apart altogether from any general inquiry.</P>
    <P>One matter upon which I do not entirely agree with Senator George O'Brien is in regard to the Post Office. <Col N="268" /> There was a time when I thought it was an excellent idea that the Post Office should be made pay its way.  I have changed my mind as far as that is concerned.  It seems to me that in a country of this kind we must maintain some uneconomic postal services and that if we are to adopt that principle, which may or may not be suitable for the railway, in relation to the Post Office, and make it pay its own way we would have extremely unsatisfactory service in many parts of Ireland. The Post Office is not simply a business service.  It is a human relationship service to-day and is of considerable value.  I do not think it could possibly be put on an entirely paying basis.  Whether that be so or not, the fact is that the increased postal charges are very considerable.  They are paid to the State by means of stamps purchased.  The fact is that the public will regard postal charges as a form of taxation whether it is put on by means of stamps or whether it takes the form of increased income-tax, petrol tax or any other tax.  From a political point of view it always seems to me unwise to increase postage more than it is necessary.  A friend of mine said the other day that he had a very heavy postal bill and every time he put on a stamp he thought of the Government and that he was paying a 20 per cent. increase.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has a grievance if one says that the increased charges are taxation.  I am quite willing to concede him that point, but am strongly of the opinion that postal charges cannot be based entirely on the departmental costs.  It will have to be paid as part of our general taxation in whatever form you put it on.</P>
    <P>Before I sit down there is just one other matter which has been on my mind.  I think it is pretty generally admitted that the annual Budget has more effect not only in its taxation but in its general policy on the life of the nation than any other type of legislation. I should like to draw the attention of the House to the fundamental difference between the way in which the two types of legislation are prepared.  I am not, of course, criticising <Col N="269" /> any Party or any particular Minister.  The system has been exactly the same as far as I know all along. When it is intended to introduce ordinary legislation the Minister approves of the idea that a Bill for a certain purpose may be introduced.  It goes to a number of civil servants who prepare the proposals.  These are sent to every other Department which may possibly be concerned in order that in the public interest we may have the best possible legislation.  Considerable time is spent in investigation and eventually a scheme reaches the Minister. It then goes to the Cabinet. Probably it will also go to a meeting of the Party which supports the Government or at any rate the main outlines will.  Once a Bill has reached the Dáil it is criticised by a very large number of persons.  There is public debate and it is liable to be amended and frequently is amended.</P>
    <P>I want to contrast that with the procedure in respect of a Budget.  Because of the need for secrecy, the Minister can only consult a small number of trusted officials.  If he proposes to tax a new commodity he, of course, has for his information all which the officials can give him, but that is all.  It is not possible to send down proposals to all the Departments for criticism.  If my information is correct, it is only almost immediately before a Budget is introduced that it goes to the Cabinet. As far as a Party meeting is concerned, I think the Parties supporting the Government know as little about the Budget on the day before as their opponents.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the system we have at present, I do not see any way out of it.  I would suggest, if not immediately before at any rate immediately afterwards, that where a tax is being put on a commodity such as petrol it should be examined as to its complete effect on business, railways, individuals, etc., before it is finally passed.  This is a matter of considerable difficulty and intricacy and I put it forward as something that ought to be considered.  It might be that it could come within the terms of reference of an expert committee that would be set up.</P>

      <P>I find it very hard to speak on this matter having descended from the Olympian heights of Senator George O'Brien to the rather Dantesque inferno of other Senators in this debate.  It seemed to me sitting at the back of the House that if someone came from another country he would be rather amused at the angelic qualities possessed by the people on this side and the demoniacal qualities of the opposite side.  We seem to lack a great deal of balance in this House and instead of dealing seriously with a matter of fundamental importance our minds are to a great extent clouded by purely Party political viewpoints.  The presentation of a Bill of this nature is of such great importance that we should not lose sight of the fact that it affects every part of our economy, every phase of our existence and that politics in the Party sense should not enter into it at all.</P>
      <P>If I were asked whether I approved of the policy which the present Government carries on, both financially and economically, I would say that I did not.  This is the only opportunity I can get to give the reasons why I disagree with that policy.  It is quite obvious to anyone who does not want to delude themselves that an extraordinary recession has set into this country over the past two years, a recession of spirit as well as in money, a recession of the defeatist character in which the people say that there is nothing to live for, that there is no future for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to Senator O'Brien, I got the impression that he spoke about money and credit as if it were an inflexible thing, something that must be related to itself only and not related to human beings.  I was rather astonished at his point of view.  The whole object of life is being misinterpreted by our politicians and our Government to-day.  After all, the purpose of our Government and of money and credit is to see people live a full and happy life.  If the Government brings into being a state of society which does not afford to people, so far as they can have it, that full and happy life, they <Col N="271" /> have failed in their duty.  While I would agree with a great many of the economic objectives of the Government, I cannot agree fundamentally with its financial directions.  When one disagrees with financial direction one must disagree to some extent with the amount and form of taxation.</P>
    <P>It does not need argument of mine to convince people that that particular recession of spirit, as I described it, has come to a great extent from the financial policy of this Government. Mere abuse will not solve the problems confronting us and the mere fact of my saying that Mr. MacEntee's black is not as good as my white does not solve the problem either.  The time has come when we must get down and discuss our different viewpoints upon this fundamental matter of financial control in this country.  I hold my viewpoint. Mr. MacEntee at one time held my viewpoint.</P>

      <P>I do remember him standing at Capel Street corner, more or less making the same speech as I am making now.  I am not trying to prove now that Mr. MacEntee is any of those demons that I spoke about.  He is still an archangel to me.  I do not intend to abuse him for changing his mind. He has a perfect right to do that.  It is a very poor man who cannot change his mind at times.  However, this matter is of much greater importance than Mr. MacEntee's opinion or mine. It affects the whole life of the country and our whole economic progress.  This matter of financial direction and financial policy has been so twisted and misinterpreted that a person can hardly express an opinion in a straightforward way without being misquoted and without being abused even by the Minister and his associates.  Such people would go so far as to call us crackpots, but it must be remembered that the crackpots of to-day are, as always, the geniuses of to-morrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that the Minister in his present policy is helping to solve <Col N="272" /> the country's problems.  We have a growing unemployment problem.  Is the Minister going to defend that? Can he explain it?  Is there any reason for it?  Is money and credit so inflexible that we must have these demonstrations in Dublin streets.  I do not care what Party is in power. To me human beings are more important than mere terms of money, bank and credit.  I am quite sure that we in this House are doing what Nero did, fiddling while Rome is burning around us.  I hear a lot of speeches on this side of the House and on the other side which seem to be a waste of time; we are thinking in terms of Party politics and I hope that one day soon the country will wake up and throw all the politicians out.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that business, at any rate, is suffering a great deal as a result of the Minister's policy. Industrial production and industrial employment have not increased.  I am not going to abuse the Minister for carrying out that policy, if he thinks it is the right one, but I certainly do not think it is.  Let me put it as a Dublin lad puts it: &ldquo;Nobody is paying nobody&rdquo;.  From the bootmaker up to the parish priest &ldquo;nobody is paying nobody&rdquo;.  There is no money in circulation.  It applies not alone to the man in the street but to members of this House and for all I know to members of ministerial rank.  There is a complete absence of funds for some extraordinary reason.  Where has it gone to?  We hear the Joint Stock Banks Committee saying: &ldquo;The Government did not tell us to restrict credit.&rdquo;  Does anybody seriously believe they have not done so or that that restriction of credit has not had a very serious reaction in the country? It has had a very serious reaction on employment and upon industrial production and from what I understand from Senator Baxter it is affecting agriculture as well.</P>

    <Title>Imposition of Duties (Confirmation of Orders) Bill, 1953&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The House is, I think, aware that Orders made by the Government under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act require to be <Col N="274" /> confirmed by the Oireachtas within eight months, and this Bill, which is similar in form to other Bills produced for the same purpose, was framed to confirm 11 Orders made since last December under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act.  Most of those Orders altered the scope of existing duties so as to cover additional lines or to amend definitions, two of them imposed new duties, and one reduced an existing duty.</P>
      <P>An explanatory memorandum has been circulated with the Bill which will have given Senators a general indication of the purpose and scope of each Order, but perhaps it would be desirable that I should run through them briefly to indicate the reasons for making them.</P>
      <P>The first Order on the list relates to stainless steel couplings.  The manufacture of stainless steel couplings was commenced by a Dublin firm during the course of the past year, and it was clear that they were not likely to make progress in securing a market for their product because of the strength of existing trade connections.  To give them an opportunity of getting hold of the market here, which is not very substantial, they required the assistance of a customs duty and accordingly a rate of duty of 50 per cent. full and 33? per cent. preferential was imposed on these couplings and also on plug cocks, joints and similar fittings for use with tubes and pipes.  The extent of the market for these goods is not very great and it cannot be regarded as a major development in our industrial production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second Order relates to television sets.  The position was that a duty of 75 per cent. full and 50 per cent. preferential had applied to television sets for a number of years, but the practice had developed of allowing the duty free importation of such sets to traders requiring them for experimental purposes and not for resale. That practice was open to objection on various grounds and it was thought desirable to reduce the duty&mdash;which, as the House will realise, is mainly operative for revenue purposes&mdash;to half the old rate and then to withdraw <Col N="275" /> the provision of duty free importation under any circumstances.  The position now is that any person can import a television set on payment of the reduced duty.</P>
    <P>The next Order relates to combs and hair slides.  The Order achieved two purposes.  First of all, it excluded from the existing duty certain classes of combs&mdash;combs made from metal, glass, wood, stone or mother of pearl &mdash;combs of that character not being made here, and there being no point in keeping the duty applying to them. The practice had been operated of granting duty-free licences for these classes of combs, in any event.  The position is that in future they will not be liable to duty and free importation will be possible to anybody.  The second purpose of the Order was to extend the duty to plastic hair slides, which are manufactured in conjunction with plastic combs, by the same firms.</P>
    <P>The next Order relates to tarpaulins. Tarpaulins and similar covers were subject to duty under an old Order when impregnated with pitch or tar. Latterly, tarpaulins have been imported which were impregnated with other chemical substances.  The effect of this Order is to extend the scope of the duty to all tarpaulins whether impregnated with pitch or tar or any other chemical substance.</P>
    <P>The next Order, which relates to woven tapes and webbings, imposes a new duty upon cotton woven piece-goods not exceeding two inches in width, that is to say, cotton tapes, bindings and webbings.  The Order was made because representations were made by the home manufacturers of these goods that they were finding difficulty in disposing of their output. The market for these classes of goods is comparatively small and the wide variety required to meet the market needs places our manufacturers at a slight disadvantage as compared with manufacturers in a larger market.  It was considered desirable to give them an opportunity of achieving greater efficiency by having the whole of the market reserved to them and that is why this Order was made.  How it is working out is a matter on which I am making some inquiries.  There has <Col N="276" /> been a reduction of prices here since the duty was imposed, but there is a position there which requires to be kept under examination, because the expansion in output which was anticipated when the duty was brought into operation does not appear to have been fully realised.</P>
    <P>The next Order relates to artificial silk piece goods and its effect was to bring within the existing duty applying to artificial silk goods, goods between 1/6 and 1/3 per square yard in value.  The old duty applied only to goods exceeding 1/6 per square yard in value.  In future, goods down to 1/3 will be subject to duty.  It also reduced the width limit prescribed in the original Order, from 60 inches to 53 inches, in the case of patterned piece goods.  The home manufacturers of artificial silk goods claim to be able to meet the full market requirements of the classes of goods to which the duty applies, that is to say, artificial silk piece goods excluding patterned piece goods, less than 53 inches in width, velvet or velveteen and rubber-proofed goods.  The reduction in the width limit was consequent on representations made from manufacturers of damask ticken that the protection originally afforded to them was being nullified by imports of rayon damask ticken which was not subject to duty or to quota restrictions as it contained less than 60 per cent. cotton.  That material was not caught by the original duty on rayon goods because it was less than 60 inches in width, in patterned colours other than stripe.  The position was rectified by an amendment to this Order so as to remove the limit under this Order from 60 inches down to 53 inches.</P>
    <P>The next Order refers to certain sanitary wear.  Representations were made by the linen and cotton textile manufacturers that the effect of the quota restrictions upon cotton woven cloth was being nullified by the importation of these articles fully made.  The Revenue Commissioners had ruled that they were not liable to duty as clothing.  Consequently, their free importation was possible.  It was an unsatisfactory position in that, while the woven cloth was liable to <Col N="277" /> import restrictions, the goods made from it were not so liable.  The effect of this Order is to make them liable to duty.</P>
    <P>Cotton ply yarns: Last year, quota restrictions were placed on single cotton yarns.  The next stage in the development of the yarn spinning industry was the doubling of cotton yarns.  As that stage had been reached by the principal firm engaged in this activity, it was felt that the time had come to impose a duty upon doubled yarns.  The producers claim to be producing a range of doubled yarns within certain counts sufficient to meet the full demand here.  That, by itself, justifies the imposition of the duty.  It will still be necessary, I think, to permit free importation of certain types of yarn which are not being produced here and which are required by other manufacturers in the country.</P>
    <P>Iron and steel bars and sections: The steel mills at Haulbowline have been extending the range of their activities to the extent of producing rods, rounds, squares and flats slightly larger or slightly smaller in size than those caught by the old duty.  There is a desire to extend the range of activities there in order to maintain the output of the firm.  Consequently, the duty was amended to bring within its scope all the various sizes of bars, squares and flats which the company is now in a position to produce.</P>
    <P>Unprinted paper: This was one of the Orders which gave the most difficulty and which required the most careful consideration.  The effect of the Order is to bring within the scope of the existing duty paper weighing more than 9 lb. per ream.  The duty applied previously only to papers weighing 12 lb. per ream or more.  It is proposed also to remove from the list of papers excluded from the scope of the duty certain classes of paper including imitation art paper, printing paper containing mechanical pulp, featherweight esparto printing paper, tinted printing paper, writing paper, cream wove bank paper, twin wire cartridge duplex paper, pasting paper, tinted bank paper and manifold bank paper.  The original duty was imposed in 1939 on a limited range of writing and printing papers, the manufacture of <Col N="278" /> which in this country commenced in that year.  The companies concerned were naturally handicapped by the difficulties which developed immediately afterwards from the war situation and, since then, they have been having difficulty in maintaining their output.  In fact, one of the larger concerns engaged in the production of printing paper was closed down for a period during last year.  The desire is to give to this industry sufficient protection to ensure its development and, at the same time, to interfere to the least possible extent with the development of the printing and other industries which depend upon them for their raw materials.  I do not know that we have solved the problem yet. There is still a possibility that a difficulty will emerge in keeping the paper-making industry in full production and, at the same time, meeting the requirements of the printing industry. I hope that all of these difficulties will be resolved in time.</P>
    <P>One of the conditions under which the Government agreed to make this Order was that technical experts would be engaged to examine the production methods here and to see what changes or developments therein would assist the expansion of the industry.  I think it is well to say that the intention is to develop this industry and that that intention will be persisted in.  We are passing through what may be described as a transition stage in its development now and it will be necessary to keep in very close touch with it to ensure that everything works out as we would hope.</P>
    <P>Root crop knives: A customs duty operated before the war upon certain edged tools.  It was suspended during the war.  Representations were made for its restoration and it was urged that, when being restored, it should be extended to include these root crop knives.  That is why this Order had to be made.</P>
    <P>As Senators probably know, this industry is located in Wexford and it appears to be quite efficiently carried on.  In fact, all the evidence available to me suggests that the prices at which these goods are produced are lower than the prices of comparable <Col N="279" /> imported articles.  It was not easy, therefore, to understand why imports were continuing but, in any event, the situation is one in which the restoration of the old pre-war duty could be undertaken without much apprehension as to the consequences.  There is a manufacturing capacity equal to the entire requirements of the country and every evidence of efficiency in the firms concerned.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that I have given a very brief sketch of the considerations which led to the making of these Orders, many of which were considered for a long time before being made. However, if any Senator wants additional information I shall endeavour to supply it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Regardless of what side of the House a Senator may sit, he is always rather hesitant about criticising the imposition of a duty which will help in the building up of an Irish industry.  Earlier to-day we had a discussion on the Finance Bill and we expressed our views very frankly in regard to the Government's policy of taxation.</P>
      <P>We have an additional Bill here, or at least that is how it looks, and what I would like to have from the Minister &mdash;he ought to be in the position to know the workings of all these industries, the selling prices of the products and the results of the imposition of a particular duty&mdash;is an indication of what the result of the imposition of this duty is going to be.  Will the consumers have to pay more for the resultant product as a consequence of this duty or are our industries being put in the position of getting support against the foreign product being dumped here, a product which is no better than our own?  On the other hand, are some of these industries going to produce the raw material for some other industry the increased price of which in the final result, is going to be passed on to the consumer and which will cost more than it costs at the moment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first Order imposes a duty of 50 per cent. and 33? per cent. on articles of stainless steel which are <Col N="280" /> plug cocks or couplings.  I do not know enough about these terms to know exactly what they stand for.  Are these things which are being used or which are going to be used in sanitary schemes, water supply schemes and so on?  Does this mean an additional tax, an additional expenditure in some social service which we are at the moment in course of implementing? There are a number of other matters in which I might raise a similar question. With regard to the Order which relates to steel bars, rounds and rods and squares, have any of these to do with our agricultural industry or agricultual machinery, and, if they have, what will the result of it be?</P>
    <P>The final Order relates to root crop knives.  Are these what we know as ordinary pulpers or are they to be manufactured as replacements in larger machines, machines which might be foreign machines?  It is a duty of 25 per cent., and if that means that farmers must pay 25 per cent. more, we should know that that is what it does mean, because we will have to pay it, if we buy these machines.  The Minister tells us that he has assurances, and is going to see that they are carried out, that the farmer will get an equally good instrument at a price no higher than that of the foreign article.  If that is so, the farmer has no reason to be dissatisfied.  While the farmers ought to have some liberty in the selection of the kind of machinery they will use on their farms, I do not think that, on the whole, our farmers have a prejudice against the Irish article, if they find it as good, but if it is a matter, from the farmer's point of view, of having to pay 25 per cent. more for the home manufactured product as against the foreign manufactured article, it is definitely a handicap on production and the sort of thing that should not be imposed upon us. It is putting the farmer in the position of feeling that, if he has some money to spend, he must have 25 per cent. more in order to get the machine which is more efficient and economical for him.  I do not know whether that is the position or not.</P>
    <P>Generally, I do not think the Minister has any cause for complaint as to <Col N="281" /> the attitude of the Seanad in regard to any of these Orders.  At the same time, I think it is very important that any of us who have views on these matters should express them and ensure that, when we make the concession of giving a protective tariff to a native industry, that industry will feel an obligation on it to do its job efficiently and well and that the workers in it will do their job as well and as efficiently as the foreign worker. There is no reason in the world why our people should not face up to their responsibilities in that matter, as they must.</P>
    <P>In the last analysis, when the Minister gets the support of Parliament for Orders of this kind, the responsibility is on him to see that we are not creating a situation in the development of new industries in which the man or woman going into work there can get as much money for a lower output as a foreign worker gets in his own country.  That is a doctrine that has to be preached and we must see that it will be practised.  I feel that, at times, we have, perhaps, been more silent on this matter than we ought to be.  I do not know how much exactly all this adds up to.  It may be that, in the total sum, it might not be any considerable addition to our living costs, to the costs of these articles, but it is important that the Minister should give us some indication as to whether this will mean more money out of the taxpayer's pocket or not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether there are any qualification clauses attaching to these Orders.  I presume that there is a licensing clause attached to the Order relating to artificial silk piece goods. I should like to know if the Minister got any report from trade organisations or secondary industries as to the effect of making that apply to cloth less than 53 inches in width, patterned in colour.  The reason I mention that &mdash;Senator Mrs. Dowdall will understand this&mdash;is that ladies' frocks are generally made out of cloth 54 inches wide and this provision would severely affect a secondary industry. Our Irish mills generally do not sell a <Col N="282" /> cloth patterned in colour.  They usually sell plain cloths and are doing quite a good job, but there are certain types of cloth which they are still not making and I take it that, in view of that, a licensing clause has been incorporated in that Order, as well as in the Order relating to cotton ply yarns.</P>
      <P>The position in that regard, as the Minister knows, is that there are several firms&mdash;again secondary industries&mdash;manufacturing goods for export who are using cotton ply yarn.  These firms cannot pay the existing prices for the cotton ply yarns produced here &mdash;that industry is in the early stages of production and I understand its prices are a certain percentage&mdash;not very big&mdash;higher than the imported English yarn.  The firms concerned are firms which export a very big percentage of their production to the English market, and, if they are to hold that market, they will have to get cotton yarn, even at a difference of 4 per cent.  It is a very keen market and I hope that if they make an application for a licence, it will be granted.</P>
      <P>With regard to the reduction of duty on television sets, the position is somewhat peculiar because what has happened so far it that a tariff has always been raised.  This is the first time a tariff has been lowered, and I understand that several importers, who, in an adventurous spirit, imported television sets, find themselves in a rather bad financial way as the result of a sudden decision of the Government to reduce the tariff of 75 per cent. or whatever it was by half.  I know it is not the Minister's function to grant a rebate to them or to help them in any other way, but if it could be done, it would help these importers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot conclude my remarks without referring to the extraordinary speech made by Senator Baxter.  He stood up and made a speech on the famous lines of the article being &ldquo;as good and as cheap&rdquo; as the imported article about which we have heard so often.  Irish industry is not to get any protection, unless it can make an article as good and as cheap as the imported article.  The Federation of Irish Manufacturers have on many occasions discussed this attitude of mind and this attitude of speech, an <Col N="283" /> attitude which is not confined to Senator Baxter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I misinterpreted the Senator, but I want to defend Irish manufacture against the suggested idea that, because an industry gets a tariff, its product must consequently be much dearer than the imported article.  When any type of industry is established it is necessary to train the workers.  It very often happens that in the initial stages the product is dearer but that is due to the lack of technical knowledge and probably to the lack of modern methods of production.  I know Senator Baxter is wearing Irish tweed, Irish shoes and hosiery.  I have no fears at all but that the factories which have to-day been protected by the Minister will justify themselves entirely.  I hope the idea will not get abroad that if a tariff is imposed some poor farmer will have to pay to keep the industry going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister how he reconciles the policy enshrined in these customs duties with the major recommendations of the I.B.E.C. report.  Summarising these recommendations in about two statements they amount to this, that our national policy should be to concentrate upon increasing our agricultural production and on developing in the main those industries which depend for their raw materials on agriculture and that in general our industrial policy should be that in choosing industrial ventures the Government of the day should proceed with rifle selectivity rather than with shotgun diffusiveness.  I do not know whether there is much selectivity in having protective duties which include such miscellaneous things as plastic hair slides and squares and angles of steel and various kinds of cotton yarn and about half a dozen different types of commodities not to mention art paper.  The Government's traditional policy is to proceed with shotgun diffusiveness.  I had hoped the Minister had learned better.  He should <Col N="284" /> go on developing agricultural production and industries that arise out of home produced agricultural raw materials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly did not intend to intervene in this debate. But I should like to support Senator Baxter in what he says.  I speak as a person who has to buy a good many of those things mentioned and no matter what Senator O'Donnell says I think it is clear to the meanest intelligence that the effect of these duties will be for the present at any rate to raise prices.  If our Irish manufacturers could compete without protective tariffs there would be no need for the present protective duties.  We will have to pay more for these articles.  We must face that fact.  I think we must make it quite clear to our fellow countrymen that we buyers are aware that we are paying a considerable price for Irish articles to promote employment and industry in Ireland.  It is no use trying to persuade us otherwise.  We will not be persuaded that we are not paying for them.  We are, and there is no doubt at all about it.  I think we will possibly have to do so with considerable reluctance; but do not let anyone deceive himself into thinking it is not going to cost us more money.  We will have to pay more money for certain articles as a result of this for the present. Presumably it is with an eye to the future and if it succeeds in building up industries which in the future will produce articles at a genuinely competitive price in comparison with the price in the world market, excellent. But would the Minister reassure an ordinary buyer like myself by mentioning one or two cases where this kind of protective tariff really has produced Irish manufactured products at a genuinely competitive price?  I mean where the material had to be imported from abroad.  I am not thinking of things like Guinness' stout for which we can produce most of the raw material ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sympathise very considerably with Senator Johnston in his disquiet about this general policy.  We are bringing articles from abroad into this country and processing them here, whereas the <Col N="285" /> rich material we have at our disposal in the fields, the woods and the waters of Ireland are being neglected and are deteriorating.  The employment that is so badly needed in the fields is coming to the cities as a result of these protective tariffs.  I think Senator Johnston's point must be emphasised very strongly.  There is a radical danger in that policy for this country. I should like some reassurance from the Minister on the point that in a good many cases these protective tariffs have really produced industries which can sell us goods at prices truly competitive with world prices.  I should like to support what Senators Baxter and Johnston said on this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickSummerfield" hpid="Mr. Summerfield Mr. Summerfield">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought this Bill was going to have a speedy passage through the House.  I was shocked at the tenor of some of the speeches we heard and I can only characterise them as being built on the ignorance of those who spoke.  I think it is lamentable that people should get up and make statements assuming, as Senator Baxter did, that when an industry is protected the poor farmer has automatically to pay 25 per cent. more because certain articles described in this little Bill are protected by a 25 per cent. tariff.  I think no one can challenge my right when I get up to speak on industry.  I can testify to the fact that there are in this country industries which by reason of the volume of their products are underselling the imported article.  There are many of them, thank God.  Why should the whole of Irish industrial activity be criticised in the way it has been criticised in this House in the past few minutes?  This is a House of public debate where speeches are recorded. Some of the Senators who spoke have spoken from the depths of their ignorance and that ignorance has compelled them to use a phrase that will not only be harmful to Irish industry but to the economy of the country.  That is what I resent.  Certain suggestions have been made about shotgun legislation. That is a harmful phrase.</P>

The Senator may know a lot about his own particular subject but on this matter he is not at all qualified and to use a phrase such as he did can only be harmful.  The Senators who spoke adversely on this matter ought to realise that great care is taken by the Government to see that when protection is given to an industry there is some reasonable hope of success.  Certain articles described in this little Bill come in from the cheapest world market, Japan, and the finished article will cost less here than the native would have to pay for the new material.  Do you want to employ people in Japan and have our own people idle in this country?  I think Arthur Griffith said that the country without an industrial arm was like a man with one arm That is true to-day. Thank God, since we got some degree of freedom, we had Governments that provided that industrial arm.  We are talking about unemployment. We have had a great deal of it to-day on the Finance Bill.  How much more unemployment would there be were it not for the industries established under this much attacked form of protection?</P>
      <P>It is time we dropped all pretence in this matter if we want industrial activity and if we want industrial employment. I hope we will not always regard it in the same way as some people do that unless any industry can produce articles meeting world prices, it is no use.  There is no country in the world that has not given some degree of protection to its own people and its own country from the effect of these world prices about which we are being told so much.  I want to make it perfectly clear that there are in this country industries some of which I am associated with, which, because of the output being big enough, are supplying not merely the home market but I am bound to say, have an export trade at highly competitive and world prices.</P>

However, because I am saying these things it does not mean that every industry can operate without protection against the effects of dumping from outside where the conditions are in any way comparable to those obtaining here.  You must have volume and you must have a tradition for skill and you certainly need to have a little more common sense than is evident in some of the speeches we have heard here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFOReilly" hpid="Mr. P.F. O'Reilly Mr. P.F. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.F. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Although we have had here already to-day an important Bill, this Bill is, in my opinion, almost as important as the Bill of which the Minister for Finance is in charge.  It is only proper, therefore, that we should give this Bill a reasonable amount of attention.  This is a Bill not merely to impose new duties but to confirm the imposition of duties that were first imposed almost a year ago temporarily.  Now, instead of having to reduce the protection, the Minister thinks it necessary&mdash;I am sure he is perfectly satisfied it is necessary &mdash;to seek to impose those duties permanently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether it is justified or not, the view prevails that we, in this country, pay considerably more for an Irish-produced article than we would have to pay for a foreign-produced article, and the view to some extent also prevails that the Irish article is not of the standard that it should be.  I am not unaware that the Minister is concerned with seeing that in cases in which he imposes duties, the producers of the goods which he protects should provide goods up to a certain standard. I am quite satisfied he has made his view perfectly clear on that and that <Col N="288" /> as far as he can he seeks to have expression given to that view.</P>
    <P>The fact remains, however, that the public, our fellow countrymen and women feel that following the imposition of protective tariffs they must in the future pay more for goods which are not as satisfactory or as well produced as goods that they might otherwise be able to obtain.  I am not opposing this Bill but I take the opportunity that has been presented to me to express the view that the industries concerned should make every effort to reciprocate the goodwill which the Minister shows to them in obtaining protection for them.</P>
    <P>I am also certain that our industries have produced good quality goods and that industries here can undersell the foreign article, but I want to make it clear that there are very few articles produced here which can undersell a foreign article.  It would not be possible for the Minister to name more than a dozen home-produced articles that would undersell the foreign-produced article.</P>
    <P>Some people have complained that speakers here have attacked Irish industry.  It may be said that I have attacked Irish industry.  I do not think I would be fairly interpreted as having said anything against Irish industry and I would not like it to be said of me that I am in any way antagonistic to its success.  I do feel, however, when we are passing a Bill of this kind to make permanent provisions that the Minister thought necessary a year ago to make only temporary, we should indicate to the people who are getting the benefit of these tariffs that we expect them to go out of their way to show their appreciation to the Minister's Department and to Parliament and thus justify the views that have been expressed from time to time by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Unlike Senator Summerfield I speak perhaps from an abysmal ignorance on the matter from the industrialist's point of view.  Nevertheless like most members of this House I have some little knowledge from the point of view of the consumer and it is as such I speak.  I do not think anybody can <Col N="289" /> really say that people here have been unfair to Irish industry.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donnell referred to the duty in regard to television sets.  It must be borne in mind that this Bill is seeking to make permanent provisions that have been in force for a considerable time.  I do not think there can be any grievance on that. My view would be that the higher rate of duty on television sets is better for our people.  We have nothing to learn from television.  If I were the Minister I would impose a prohibition altogether on the manufacturer of television sets here and I would impose a prohibition Order to ensure that we did not allow any into the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I hate to disagree with Senator O'Donnell in a matter of detail, particularly in a matter of ladies' dresses, but I do not think the Minister need worry unduly about the width of 53 inches.  Any information I have is that it will not be disastrous. However, I did not rise for the purpose simply of disagreeing with the Senator.  I rose because I think it is incumbent on me as a man who spends by far and away the greatest part of his time in Irish industry and who is in certain respects a critic of the Government, to say that I have a pretty good knowledge of the staff and officials of the Department of Industry and Commerce and that I feel it is only right to say that there is established there a very efficient section which deals with the various proposals for tariffs.</P>
      <P>If any of my friends here think that they can walk in and get a tariff for the asking without proof of efficient production&mdash;nobody can prove for the future, but you have got to give mighty near proof before the Minister will even hear of the proposal&mdash;they are making a very great mistake.  I think it is right that I from this side of the House should say that I have noticed no difference since the change of Government in the way in which these matters are dealt with.  We have now established in the Department a very efficient examination process, and a not perfect, but reasonably efficient supervision of the operation of tariffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="290" /> I think that Senator O'Reilly is correct when he says that the public still think that because there is a duty prices must be higher.  Now those of us who are in industry know that that is not necessarily a fact.  It may be a fact in some cases, but I think it is because of speeches made from time to time that the people still think it is generally true.  It is sometimes true, it is often not true; but general debates such as we always have in this House&mdash;and I think we are not different from the other House&mdash;on Bills of this kind do not really help to clear the position.  Obviously it would not be particulaly desirable to have a detailed debate on any particular tariff or Imposition of Duty Order.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Reilly is under one misapprehension. He thinks that these were put on as temporary duties.  They were not.  The practice, of necessity, is that if a tariff has to be imposed or an Order made imposing a duty, it must be done promptly.  There cannot be publicity beforehand, and I can see no better method than we have at the moment which gives the Minister in power for the time being the right to impose a duty by Order, and make him come to the Oireachtas within, I think I am correct, nine months.  During that time he must get the approval of Parliament. That does not mean that an Order is not intended to be permanent. It is only temporary in the sense of its having been made under temporary powers given to the Executive.  It is permanent in the sense that they are intended to be permanent duties and the industries concerned would not have proceeded except on the basis that they were as permanent as anything of the kind can be.  All duties are subject to revision and they are intended to be in force for long enough to achieve their particular purpose.</P>
    <P>I think it is rather important that all Parties should realise that a country of 3,000,000 which has decided&mdash;and it is a decision accepted all round&mdash;to develop its industrial arm must, of necessity, have certain difficulties which a country ten or 20 times its size and population would not have.  If the Government did not put a tariff on goods which are produced here even though the price is just as low as the <Col N="291" /> imported article the manufacturer would not sell it in sufficient quantity to make it a paying proposition.  I also am interested in the retail trade, which I know something about, and I am not running down that trade when I say that there is very keen competition and that the greatest part of that competition is to get variety.  Variety is more important even than price.  If you can buy a variety of 20 or 30 articles from several different countries your public will be delighted.  The prices may even be dearer from outside if you have sufficient variety.  Without that variety an unprotected home industry in a country of our size cannot get the quantity and its prices cannot be competitive. It is for that reason that to my mind tariffs are essential particularly in the opening stages of an industry.</P>
    <P>Senator Stanford said that it was clear to the meanest intelligence that when we put on tariffs we are paying for them.  I think I know what he meant by that though I may or may not have the meanest intelligence. What he meant was that inevitably a certain price had to be paid.  Of course, but nothing like the price you would pay if you had more people unemployed and had to maintain them. You have got to examine each tariff and each industry on its own merits if you are going to judge its value to the country.  Just because it happens to be an Irish industry is not proof that it is of value.  If, on the other hand, it produces goods in general use which are good quality and at the same time employs people who would not be otherwise employed, then it is of itself contributing substantially to the economy of the country which would have to be paid for in some way or another.  I am no blind protectionist, and I do not think you can create a millennium simply by putting on duties, nor does the Minister.  He has always shown himself most critical&mdash;it is not for me to defend him&mdash;he can defend himself better than I can.  It is, I think, only right for me to say that my experience is that there is a pretty thorough investigation and that it is not just a matter as perhaps it may <Col N="292" /> have been some years ago of asking for a tariff and saying: &ldquo;I want to start an industry.&rdquo;  I think it is very important in the interests of Irish industry generally that this fact should be appreciated and if it was understood people would be less afraid and there would be much less of the general talk that when you buy an Irish article it must be dearer.</P>
    <P>For my part I have advised my staff in most cases not to mark their goods Irish.  They sell better on their merits. If you feature them specially as Irish, as used to be the case, you may have people wanting to buy an imported article with the completely false idea that because it is imported it is cheaper or better.</P>
    <P>As far as this one point made by Senator Stanford is concerned I think it would be undesirable if some of us who are interested in industry were to give lists of goods which are exported, but I will just say this, that I have been connected with an industry now for 30 years and all that time it has done an export trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to say that the statements of Senator Baxter and Senator O'Reilly were in the old tradition that we used to remember before the industrial revival got any kind of impetus in this country.  I remember that this price and quality business has always been used against Irish products here in Ireland, particularly by a section of the people who did not believe that we could revive industry or provide an industrial revival here.  I can well remember times, when, if you presented an Irish article to a customer in a shop, he would ask you bluntly for an English article, and I can say that in the early days, 20 years ago, when industries were being started in this country, it was quite a common practice to state that the articles being produced in our factories were of inferior quality and that they were taking advantage of tariffs in order to increase the prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have particular knowledge of it from my own town of Clonmel.  I would like to give an instance just to show how things were 20 years ago, the time I am talking about.  I remember that about a year or two <Col N="293" /> after a shoe factory had been established in Clonmel a member of the Fine Gael Party on the Corporation of Clonmel stated publicly that the factory was one in which slave wages were paid and in which child labour was exploited.  I think it was intended with that particular complaint to insinuate that the factory could not produce a good quality article or an article which could be sold in competition with articles which were imported.</P>
    <P>I remember attending the official opening of that factory, which was perhaps a year after the factory had actually opened.  The Minister was present.  The chairman of the company at that time was an Englishman, and he made this statement at that meeting, that he was astonished to discover that the article produced in this factory after the short time in which the operatives had an opportunity of acquiring the skill required, was as good as the articles which were produced in his English factory which had been in operation for many generations</P>
    <P>Another thing that might interest Senator O'Reilly and Senator Baxter is the fact that the shoes made by that factory were exported to England in great quantities in the past couple of years.  I remember seeing in some of the English papers a form of protest at the fact that these shoes were being sold there cheaper than comparable shoes manufactured in Britain.  Perhaps Senators Baxter and O'Reilly spoke in good faith, and I believe that is so.</P>

      <P>The point I want to make is that this type of talk is definitely hurting Irish industry.  It is reviving the impression which was there 25 years ago when it was customary for people to refuse an article of Irish manufacture.  I remember when I was a member of the Dáil one Deputy bringing in some cloths and tearing them to show we could not produce a good quality.  I remember also a man bringing in a spade handle and breaking it across his knee to prove the poor quality.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to intervene, but having listened to some of the speakers, I could not remain silent.  After 30 years of freedom, listening this evening to the type of speeches that have been made, it was running across my mind whether such speeches would be heard in the Parliament of any other nation.

      <P>There is a prejudice against Irish-manufactured goods.  Why would there not be, what can you expect from the ordinary people in the street, when the elected representatives of the people carry on this type of propaganda?  They tell us they are not prejudiced against Irish manufacture. If not, why do they lend themselves to this campaign?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is only doing his duty by this country in keeping to the principles laid down by every patriotic Irish writer of the past, from Dean <Col N="295" /> Swift to Arthur Griffith.  He is doing only what is being done in every other country.  What nation is there that is not giving protection to its industries &mdash;even the greatest of them?  The United States is one of the most highly protected countries in the world and has built its greatness on protection. Great Britain itself has protected its industries over a great many years.  It was clamouring for free trade when it was the largest manufacturer in the world.  We are only a small nation, new to the manufacture of a great many articles, and for that reason our new industries require protection at least until they get on their feet.</P>
    <P>It is only fair to let it be known that many of the articles that are produced here are as good as those produced anywhere else.  Take cement: does not everyone in the building trade know that Irish cement is at least equal to any in the world?  In my native town of Ennis we have a much derided industry, the manufacture of plain, humble bootlaces, an industry which was laughed to scorn when it was being established.  It now employs a couple of hundred hands and is producing an article that can compare favourably with that produced in any other country.</P>
    <P>I hope this is the last discussion of this type that we shall have here.  I hope that every Senator, regardless of Party, will put Irish interests first. Instead of hampering and hindering Irish industry when he comes to speak, I hope he will say as little as he can against it and everything he can in favour.</P>

      <P>I can only say that I did not get notice of that question.  A lot of heat has been engendered in this debate.  I have been interested in Irish industry longer than I can remember and my family were interested in Irish industry before we had any protection in this country and maybe at that time lost a considerable amount of money in Irish industry. We ought to be able to discuss it objectively.  Some time or other there must be things about Irish industry that we want to criticise and we should not be too thin-skinned about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a director of three companies selling Irish goods, some of which are protected and some of which are not.  Some of these companies are able to export goods to Great Britain and other places against all competition, but I do not always feel when there is a discussion about industry here that somebody has a big tag on the seat I am sitting in and I am going to be hurt immediately if there is a free, fair and frank discussion.  I think Irish goods generally are able to sell on their merits.  If some of them are not, it may be the fault of the people who are manufacturing them.  Most of the goods that are manufactured in this country can hold their place in any market in the whole world and that is an enormous achievement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="297" /> What Senator Douglas said about variety is one of the greatest difficulties. Manufacturing for only 3,000,000 people, we have that enormous difficulty. There is one company in which I have an interest, not a very big company, which sent goods into the North of Ireland and which is able to sell them there; but there is a factory also in the North of Ireland and they are able to come in here over a 25 per cent. tariff and sell goods against us, because the public like something different.  That is a difficulty and it is a difficulty which the Minister has in imposing a tariff because, as Senator Douglas says, the public want something that is not quite the same.  Anybody who has approached the problem knows that that is so.</P>
    <P>I think we ought to give the Minister this Bill.  If there are any articles which are not now manufactured in this country and that bear a duty I think the Minister ought to have them removed from the list.  If I am not mistaken, he told me last year that he would.  I know of one or two articles that are not manufactured or assembled in this country.  It causes a considerable amount of inconvenience in business when parts are required for these goods.  Refrigerators are not being manufactured or assembled in this country&mdash;I understand that they are not; the refrigerators themselves are not being assembled here.  It may be that the cold stores, or the compartments or the doors are being made in this country but the actual machine itself is not being manufactured in this country.  I understood some time ago that the Minister was going to remove refrigerators from the list of goods for which one would have to receive a licence to import free of duty. I know that, in perishable industries, it causes a certain amount of inconvenience now and again when parts are held up at Collinstown Airport or at the port of Dublin, Limerick, Cork, and so forth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>During the past 20 years or so there have been many debates upon the merits of industrial development and the policy of protection. Senator Loughman said that <Col N="298" /> some of the speeches made here this evening were in the old tradition. Whether or not that is true, I think there has been a great change in their tone and scope since I first came into public life and participated in such debates.  I think we may as well face the fact that a change has taken place, a change which, I think, is significant.</P>
      <P>There is no likelihood of this Bill being seriously opposed in the Seanad any more than it was opposed in the Dáil.  In fact, I think it would not be unfair to say that the approach to it is even less critical than it might conceivably be because there is, nowadays, a hesitation about appearing to be critical of proposals of this character.  In the early days of the controversy, a Bill of this kind would have led to long and heated controversy, punctuated by repeated divisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection whatever to a critical approach to industrial development.  I think Irish industrial policy is now so firmly established that it can stand it and that criticism, provided it is directed towards helping it rather than stopping it, is useful.  It was the shotgun diffusiveness of Senator Stanford's attack which stung Senator Douglas into replying, rather than myself.  I think Senator Douglas has effectively corrected Senator Stanford's mistake. Senator Stanford assumed that a tariff was always imposed on imported goods because the Irish goods were dearer, and with the aim of offsetting that price disadvantage.  That may be true in some cases and for some time but, as Senator Douglas pointed out, there are many and often much more serious disadvantages felt by an Irish firm endeavouring to enter for the first time into a market previously supplied by outside firms.  Variety is one of the factors.  Every firm likes to be able to show goods which no other competitor in the same town or district can show. That possibility is reduced when a tariff is imposed and their purchases are directed to Irish firms.  When they are dealing with a much larger number <Col N="299" /> of firms producing goods in Great Britain they can make these arrangements which ensure that goods of the same type or the same brand will not be available to other traders in the locality.</P>
      <P>The importance of established trade connections should not be underestimated, either.  Traders believe that sometimes it is desirable to maintain these connections because they may lead to some advantage later on.  It is a fact that confidence in the quality of Irish products is not yet as firmly based as it should be.</P>
      <P>When I had to leave for the division in the Dáil, I was supporting Senator Douglas in his reply to Senator Stanford and pointing out the correctness of his assertion that protection is needed in many cases not solely because of price disadvantage of an Irish firm, but because of other possible disadvantages. It is not generally true that the effect of a tariff is to require the public to pay more for the article to which the tariff applies.  That may be so in some cases, either permanently or for a period, but it is not unusual to find that the effect of a tariff, by making production more economic in the Irish concerns, is to secure a reduction rather than an increase in the price.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister quote examples in cases where the raw materials have to be imported?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to mention one or two cases of that kind, because the best evidence, in my view, that the industrial policy is working out as we anticipated is that many of the firms which were new firms 10, 15 or 20 years ago, getting over their teething troubles, are now successfully engaging in export business.  I had the pleasure of seeing a report from a firm in this country, a well-known firm which manufacture ropes, binder twine and other forms of cordages, and which was regarded perhaps more doubtfully than some others when started, than many of the other new industries of that time, that some 60 per cent. of its business in the present year will be export business, and in that case the raw <Col N="300" /> material is entirely imported.  It is true that we have that disadvantage compared with other countries, that most of our industrial raw materials have to be imported and that was the point stressed in the I.B.E.C. report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>That raw material has to be imported into Britain and Northern Ireland as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Precisely.  Many of the successful industries in Britain are those working on imported materials, and, as compared with them, we are at no disadvantage whatever.  It is true that the best type of industry to have is one that works on native materials, but I do not know that Senator Stanford was correct in saying that these materials are being neglected.  I do not know even what he had in mind in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I was thinking simply of agricultural products&mdash;the fact that agriculture has not kept step with industry, which is the really serious point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as agricultural products can be made the raw materials of manufacturing industry, it is being done to an increasing extent. I suppose the development of the processed meat industry is the biggest development of that kind that has taken place for many years.  In every case where a new tariff is proposed or the extension of an existing tariff urged on us, the possible effect on prices is naturally the main factor taken into consideration.  In some instances, the tariff is imposed or a higher tariff brought into operation because of unusual circumstances operating to an extent which constitutes unfair competition with Irish manufacturers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is in the case of some materials a two-price policy at present operating in Great Britain.  The raw materials of certain industries are sold to British manufacturers at a lower price than they are sold for export and, consequently, goods made from these raw materials can be shipped here at a lower price than that at which our firms could produce.  We have met the situation by increased <Col N="301" /> tariffs in the belief that it is only a temporary situation which is bound to end.  When Senator Baxter asked me if any of these products which are affected by the Orders to be confirmed in this Bill are dearer than similar products elsewhere, that is one of the considerations I have to take into account before replying.</P>
    <P>Steel is the most difficult subject of all to deal with.  The British home price is much lower than the world price.  Consequently it is not fair to make any comparison between the cost of steel goods produced here with British home prices.  A comparison can be made with continental prices.  Our prices compare with continental prices.  How long the two-price system will operate in Britain I do not know. At the present time the O.E.E.C. are discussing with the British authorities the desirability of retaining it.</P>
    <P>There are other instances where if we are to have development at all we must be prepared to accept a higher price.  I would be very slow to afford protection to any industry if the indications were that we would have to accept a higher price permanently.  The development of production here must necessarily be more costly until full economic output is achieved or until workers are fully trained.</P>
    <P>Steel couplings, for example, are goods which were never previously made in this country.  A very competent and long-established Dublin firm has commenced to manufacture them.  I made a comparison between the prices at which they were selling and the prices at which they could be imported shortly after manufacture had begun and in some ranges of these goods the prices were below the British prices and in other cases they were above the British price.  Whether that position prevails now I do not know.  It is an attractive industry in that about 60 per cent. of the ultimate selling price is represented by labour costs, an unusually high percentage in present circumstances. There has been an increase in wages during the present year in that industry and whether that increase operates in Great Britain I cannot say.</P>

      <P>So far as edged tools are concerned, I do not think Senator Baxter need have any apprehension about the price.  The position there was that the duty was completely suspended and there was no particular reason for restoring it until the present year when imports of these goods appeared to be taking place on a scale which was difficult to understand. We then decided that the time had come when the pre-war duty would have to be restored and the Order in regard to root crop knives was an extension of the previous Order which applied to practically all edged tools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They are hand tools. There are licensing clauses in respect of all these goods.  I do not think that Senator Johnston is quite fair in saying that these Orders were imposed with shotgun diffusiveness.  These Orders were made over a period of eight months and averaged two a month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsequent to that.  I claim that they were made with rifle selectivity.  I think you can use a <Col N="303" /> rifle 11 times and get the bull's eye each time.  If the Senator takes the trouble of reading the precise definition of the goods to which the duties apply he will understand there is no such thing as a hit-or-miss approach.  In fact, many of the amended Orders which I have had to make recently were due to the fact that the original Orders were too selectively drawn&mdash;the definitions were too narrow to prevent the possibility of evasion of the duties.  For that reason importers found a way of evading the duty by slightly altering the articles to which the duty applied.  It is true, as Senator Burke said, that some of the duties imposed before the war have not been effective in producing the results anticipated.  A revision of the duties is proceeding with a view to amending definitions so as to make them achieve the purpose aimed at or get rid of them altogether where they are no longer required.  Some of these Orders were for that purpose.  In the case of the duty relating to combs the effect of this Order is to take out of the duties types of combs which were never made even though the duty applied to them.</P>

      <P>I do not know if there is any other point that I need necessarily refer to at this stage.  As Senator Douglas said all these matters are subject to very careful investigation in the Department before any action is taken at all and there is a continuous follow up in the Department to ensure that developments are working out as was anticipated when the Orders were prepared. We are now carrying out a systematic review of the position in every industry mainly to consider the possibility of extending it but also to make sure that the results actually achieved are those at which we aimed. In a few cases we will be forced to <Col N="304" /> recognise that we did not succeed in achieving the development we wanted and that the project will have to be abandoned for the time being.</P>
      <P>The assumption that we just put on a duty and let anything happen after that is completely incorrect.  There is a continuous follow up and I hope that will always be so.  Any firm assisted in this way may incline at some stage to sit back and take the profit arising at the stage of development it has reached and not be prepared to go further.  It is our job to keep pushing them further as well as to ensure that they are doing an efficient job as far as they have gone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>On Section 1, could I ask the Minister a question? Suppose there was a specific complaint that prices had been increased as the result of some protective tariff, what machinery is there for dealing with that complaint?  To whom should it be addressed?  Should it be addressed to the Department or is there any public body for dealing with it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the Prices Advisory Body which deals with these complaints in a general way.  There may be price Orders applying to the goods in which case the question of whether the Order was being evaded or not would arise.  In the case of most goods, however, there is an arrangement with the manufacturer as to the price that he should charge or as to the margin he will take.  If there was any complaint there would be an investigation through the Prices Advisory Body as to whether that arrangement was being broken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, or in some cases a price arrangement.  If it is not a price question of that kind then it is the Department of Industry and Commerce which will investigate the situation. <Col N="305" /> We will frequently accept as reasonable an increase of prices due to the increase in raw materials cost, wage levels or some other factor of that kind.  We might discuss with the manufacturer ways and means by which these costs could be offset by other economies but the aim would be to ensure that the industry was being carried on as efficiently as it could be in all the circumstances prevailing at the time, rather than insisting on comparisons between their prices and prices elsewhere.</P>

      <P>I want to get a little more information from the Minister.

It is not generally known that manufacturers are under the strict control of the Prices Advisory Section of his Department.  It is a most efficient section.  Anybody who can survive the rigours of the Prices Advisory Tribunal and the income-tax <Col N="307" /> regulations and still make a profit is a very good man indeed.  I merely stand up to pay a tribute to the officials of the Department who deal with industrial matters.  It is very seldom we get an opportunity of paying a tribute to civil servants.

    <P>
      <Col N="308" /> Bill reported without recommendation and received for final consideration.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be returned to the Dáil.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>On this stage I am not going to say very much by way of attempting to reply to some of the speeches on that side of the House which were made in reply to speeches which were supposed to be made on this side of the House but not made.  I have heard people over there addressing themselves to this Bill and I am positive that some of them did not read the Bill and did not know what it contained.  I stood up on this Bill to get information.  I approached the matter as I thought reasonably, in a fashion anyone ought to with a sense of responsibility and tried to get information as to the amount of employment all these duties were going to give for people in the country.  I think it is entirely wrong for any member of this House or the other House to take the attitude that when a measure like this comes before us we are not to say anything that is in our minds as to the policy or what the Bill contains.</P>
      <P>I think that the people who are doing the most injury to Irish industry and its further and fuller development are the people who take up that attitude. You cannot defend Irish industry and have the exposition of the situation except the Minister in charge is given an opportunity to address himself to it, and unless there are people who are questioning and who are not afraid of the kind of epithet that can be hurled across the House, charges made that I was unfriendly to Irish industry and to anything that was Irish when what we were trying to get was a clear statement with regard to Irish industry and what has been accomplished since this State has been set up; and you cannot get that unless there are people to ask questions. That was why I got on my feet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know why I should be confronted with people who think that Irish industry is something that cannot survive except under conditions that are impossible for consumers in <Col N="309" /> this country.  I did not suggest that and I am not suggesting it now.  I did say this and I am repeating this, and repeating it not in relation to Irish industry alone but to every industrial effort we make whether in field or factory or anywhere else, in the Seanad, the Dáil or the Civil Service&mdash;that unless people who are paid for service in this country give a good output of work there can be no hope of raising our standard of living.  If all the people crying out for cheaper products, cheaper consumer goods and all the rest, would concentrate some of their attention on giving better output in the day everyone in this country would be happier.</P>
    <P>The worst service you can do to Irish industry is to proclaim its efficiency and the return people are giving for the money they are paid.  I really do not think it is true.  There are quite a number of our country towns where there are industries with people getting a wage for the labour they give and it is very far out of relation to the service they could give to agriculture just adjacent to the town and the return we are getting from what they are paid for their services is making the nation very unhappy and is making things hard for our farming community. We must preach the doctrine, we must see that it is implemented, that wherever there are industries established and people working in them they must learn that they have a responsibility to the consuming public of their nation, and that is to give good service and to give good products and to give them as cheap as they can be got anywhere else, and I say finally it is a confession that we are an inferior race if we are not able to do that.</P>

      <P>I would like to add one word to this lively debate.  It has been suggested that the interest and enthusiasm for Irish industry is a new thing in this State, just over the last 30 years.  Might I remind the Senators that two occupants of this House before the Oireachtas were intensely interested in fostering Irish industry?  The Duke of Leinster towards the end of the 18th century was particularly interested, and he <Col N="310" /> held balls and parties in this very room in which all the guests were to come dressed in Irish manufactured clothes; and his successor in this House, the Royal Dublin Society, was no laggard body in promoting Irish industry.  It is not an entirely new thing, and I think that we who are the present occupants of this House should remember that fact.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I can quote figures. The Minister says that I am making a disgraceful assertion, but I can only quote the facts in reply to that.  If there is one thing from which this country suffers it is a fall in consumer purchasing power, and that is plain to everyone.  The figures of unemployment are continuously increasing.  The percentage is increasing.  In January of this year the percentage of increase over January, 1951, was 32 per cent., and without going through the various months the percentage of increase as against this month in 1951 is 31.  The gradual percentage of increases in unemployment goes like a step-ladder from 32 to 42, 53, 60, 71 per cent.  The Minister said that I made a misstatement of fact.  I say to the Minister that there is the proof of the facts in what I am saying.  How are we going to increase consumer purchasing power?  Why are many of our industries at the present moment under-worked and under-developed?  For the same reason that consumer purchasing <Col N="311" /> power is falling&mdash;financial policy is to blame for that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Rourke asks me how, and he probably is a man lucky enough with his bank manager in Roscommon, but if he questions industrialists and businessmen about the present position in regard to their relations with their bank managers I think he will find that they are in a very bad way.  If Senator O'Rourke also asks me why this has happened it is quite obvious that if there is restriction of credit&mdash;and Senator O'Rourke presumably will agree with the wisdom of the restriction of credit and finance&mdash;surely it is quite evident to him that consumer purchasing power has fallen and it is developing like a circulating decimal.  If it has fallen, somebody at some time is going to go out of work&mdash;that is the obvious inference&mdash;as a result of that policy.  You had now 67,000 people out of work in June of this year.  I am not saying that this is a country of untold wealth, but I say it is a wealthy country.</P>
      <P>I am quite certain the Minister is just as anxious as I am, in fairness to him, and I will read here a statement of his which he made in the Dáil, Volume 44, column 2078, on a Supplementary Estimate in 1932.  This is what the Minister said and I am satisfied that he would agree with this to-day:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We believe that it is better if people have to be taxed, and if people cannot find employment, that instead of being maintained by the community they should be maintained in work rather than in idleness.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister said that in 1932, according to the Official Reports.  Does he say it to-day?  Does his policy carry the proof of what he said then?  I am stating a fact.  So far as I am concerned, it is not a Party matter, and I very much deprecate, as a businessman, that there is unemployment, and I am sure everyone does.  My interpretation of the reason for that unemployment is the financial policy of the Minister or of the Government which he represents.</P>

      <P>I am discussing a different thing, and I am saying that this position is the result of the financial policy.  I may be quite wrong; I am not going to be adamant about it. I believe it, and that is what everyone is now saying.  As a result of this financial policy we have increasing unemployment and as result of the financial policy, whether directed by the Minister or not, we have had a continuous deflationary policy by the banking authority over the last two years.  As a further result we have the unemployed demonstrating in the streets of Dublin to-day, and we have unemployed in the countryside, and there is considerably reduced purchasing power.</P>
      <P>I would not disagree with most other aspects of the policy of the present Government, but I say that when the fundamental policy is wrong&mdash;and the financial policy is the foundation of our whole economy&mdash;something should be done about it.  I believe that the Minister might reconsider what he said in 1932, that what applied then applies to-day.</P>
      <P>I am very glad to see that, even at this late hour, he has agreed to appoint a commission to inquire into the incidence of taxation on industry. Many of us have been crying in the wilderness for many years that it would not be possible to compete with imported goods and carry out greater production, without an allowance for wear and tear on machinery and a competitive allowance comparable to that of Northern Ireland on our buildings and general depreciation.</P>

      <P>I am speaking about something that Senator Hartnett knows nothing about.  If we have to develop export trade we must keep the machinery at top notch and if we must do that, we must give a greater allowance to the industrialists in the depreciation write down.  In America to-day they write off machinery in four years.  Generally here, our machinery write-off is as high as 20 years.  In some cases the percentage allowance on machinery runs as low as 5 per cent., though in some cases it runs as high as ten.  I will get the reply that normally there is an obsolescence allowance also.  That is true.  That is when the machine runs out and you are making a full replacement.</P>

      <P>As a man who always missed a free kick, I give Senator O'Rourke full credit there.  If you go to replace machinery and even get the obsolescence allowance, you cannot replace it at anything like the price at which it was bought four, five or ten years ago.  I would ask the Minister to consider seriously doing something in the next year or two in this matter of machinery and buildings.  Industry here cannot compete or develop unless there is some help in that direction. The blatant fact is&mdash;as is known to any person with his eyes open&mdash;that there was never such a depression as there is at the moment.  Can anyone tell me of anybody he knows who has money to spend, money to buy with, or money to pay?  Have we not got everybody with debts they owe to everybody else? <Col N="314" /> I referred at the beginning to the Olympian heights of Senator George O'Brien; there may be others who are hoping to go as high as him and claim that position also.  So far as I am concerned and so far as people in industry are concerned, we cannot get payment of our accounts.  Many have difficulty in selling their goods, and the retail market is extremely bad.  Anyone can tell you that.  I hold in my hand a newspaper showing a very large advertisement of a sale by a big retail firm.  Look at the prices at which they are selling these goods.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is the slightest doubt as to the accuracy of Senator O'Donnell's remarks regarding the position of trade in this city and throughout the country in general for the last two years, nor do I believe there is the slightest doubt that the present Minister for Finance and his colleague in the Government and those who supported their policies, are responsible for the depression in trade and for the hardships which have been imposed on people in Dublin and elsewhere by that policy.  Other Senators who are members of the legal profession, Senators who are active in business circles also, well know that it is a fact that there has been more business done in the Irish bankruptcy offices and bankruptcy courts in the last two years than was done in the decade before that.  That is due to the activities of the present Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt whatever that the present Government's policy has brought about this depression in trade and has resulted in large-scale unemployment. On this evening's <i>Evening Herald</i> we read a statement by a Senator who certainly is not unfriendly to the Minister and who, I think, has always supported the present Government's policy in this House.  I quote now from this evening's <i>Evening Herald.</i>  Senator McMullen, President of the Congress of Irish Unions, speaking at the annual conference which opened in Killarney, is reported as saying:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The deflationary effect of the Budget changes of 1952 in sharply raising prices and reducing the purchasing value of wages had confronted them with a situation in which effective demand for commodities had fallen off....&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="316" /> I think that in that phrase lies the explanation of the advertisements which Senator O'Donnell displayed here a few minutes ago&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...effective demand for commodities had fallen off, with resultant unemployment on a larger scale than they had experienced for many years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the opinion of the President of the Congress of Irish Trade Unions&mdash; a Senator who has consistently supported the Government group in this House.</P>
    <P>This is an opportunity which Senators get for reviewing the work and the policies of the Government in the past 12 months.  In his recent Budget and in his Budget statement, the Minister reimposed, in their full savagery, the taxes which were imposed in the Budget of 1952.  During the past 12 months there have been a number of significant facts in the political scene &mdash;in the sphere of policies and in the sphere of politics.  We have seen, as other Senators have mentioned, marching feet in Dublin.  It was not the march of the nation.  We have seen Irish civil servants marching through the streets of Dublin in protest against the treatment meted out to them by the present Minister for Finance, who is in charge of the Irish Civil Service. More recently, we have seen the march of the unemployed in Dublin.  We have seen men marching in protest against Government policies which have put them into the position that they cannot find work.  In that connection, I think it might be well to refresh the Minister's mind on the provisions of the Constitution drafted by his leader and adopted by the people of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 45 of the <Col N="317" /> Constitution concerns directive principles of social policy.  Paragraph 2 of the said Article 45 of the Constitution states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The State shall, in particular, direct its policy towards securing</P>
      <P>(i)  That the citizens (all of whom, men and women equally, have the right to an adequate means of livelihood) may through their occupations find the means of making reasonable provision for their domestic needs.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Would it not be as well for this House and for the Minister to examine the policy which he has pursued for the past two years and, in particular, for the past 12 months, side by side with that provision of Article 45 of the Constitution? Is it not a fact that the financial policy pursued by this Government, whether deliberately or not, has had results diametrically in conflict with the pious aspirations of paragraph 2 of Article 45 of the Constitution? Is it not quite clear that many thousands of our people not only in Dublin but throughout the country may certainly have the right to an adequate means of livelihood but, by reason of Government policies and by reason of the policy of the Minister for Finance, have not at present an adequate means of livelihood?  They have not, through their occupations, the means of making reasonable provision for their domestic needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a time when foodstuffs, clothing and other articles were obtainable at reasonable prices.  So far as foodstuffs were concerned, that level was maintained by means of food subsidies.  Members of the present Government and their supporters&mdash; every one of them&mdash;boasted of being the authors of the food subsidies. They went before the electorate in the last general election as the authors of the food subsidies.  When the election was over they solemnly published in every newspaper in this country their pledge to the Dáil, to the Oireachtas and to the people that if they were enabled by a group of Independent Deputies in the Dáil to form a Government they would maintain those food subsidies.  Presumably, the food <Col N="318" /> subsidies were originated in accordance with Article 45 (2) of the Constitution. They have been slashed and swept away by the Minister&mdash;with the support of people who went into the Dáil pledged to maintain them and pledged to press to have them increased.  The fact is that their removal has made the cost of living soar.  Side by side with the increase in the cost of living that was started by the Budget of 1952 and that is being maintained this year&mdash;the cost of living in respect of food alone increased within the last quarter, as was explained only yesterday in the Dáil by the Tánaiste&mdash;whatever the Minister or his colleagues may say, you have a very rigorous restriction on bank credit.  You have businessmen, big and small, in the country who have been quite unable to get reasonable credit facilities from the banks.  I am not talking in favour of the person who seeks credit for purely speculative purposes but people have been refused reasonable credit facilities for reasonable projects and it will be a long time before the people will believe that that has not been done if not actually at the behest of the Minister for Finance at least with his blessing and because it was in accordance with Government policy.</P>
    <P>Other matters occurred during the year.  Last year, when he presented his Budget, the Minister for Finance was charged with budgeting for a surplus. The truth and accuracy of that charge has amply been demonstrated by the present Budget which the Minister introduced.  During the past year. Supplementary Estimates to the tune of, I think, £8,000,000 were introduced in the Dáil.  Of them, moneys to the extent of £4,500,000 were not forecast by the Minister for Finance or by any member of the Government.  I think I am correct in saying that the Minister or the Taoiseach, or possibly both of them, stated that there would not be any Supplementary Estimates.  Certainly, Supplementary Estimates to the extent of £4,500,000 were introduced in the past year without having been forecast by the Government or by the Minister for Finance.  Where did that money come from?  I think it is quite clear that it came because the Minister <Col N="319" /> had budgeted for a surplus last year and he budgeted for a surplus so that he would be able to provide the extra £4,500,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Not alone did the Minister provide that money during the course of the year by his surplus budgeting of last year but he has made it quite clear in this year's Budget, either that he does not believe in all his talk about balancing budgets or he is budgeting for a surplus this year as well.  Everyone will remember how the Minister used to beat the big drum and tell the people of the awful crimes of his predecessor in office, how this man, whom he described as a mean, grasping lawyer, had failed to balance his Budgets.  We remember how the Taoiseach and other Fianna Fáil speakers stumped up and down this country condemning this crime of introducing and passing unbalanced Budgets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has the Minister done?  This year, he introduced a Budget in the region of £100,000,000, based on a Book of Estimates for that figure, and calmly tells the Dáil that he sees no reason why, when one is talking in terms of £100,000,000, he should not be able to make savings in the year amounting to a minimum of £3,500,000. Either the Minister has budgeted for <Col N="320" /> a surplus, or he has brought in this year an unbalanced Budget.  He can take his choice.  In case any Senators may think I am misquoting the Minister, I refer to his Budget statement of 6th May, column 1208 of the Dáil Debates, in which he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;While economies affecting the living standards of the weaker sections of the community are out of the question and will not be sought, this does not apply to other sectors of the administration.  There is little reason to doubt that within the framework of an expenditure of over £100,000,000 significant economies can be made without impairing efficiency or curtailing essential or useful services.  Accordingly, the Government have decided that a general economy of at least £3,500,000 in the cost of the public administration must be secured.  I can assure the Dáil and the taxpayer that this matter will be most vigorously pursued in every Department.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister, in other words, introduced a Budget reimposing the taxes which he imposed in his 1952 Budget, based on a Book of Estimates in the region of £100,000,000.  While he is going to collect exactly the same taxes as last year, while he is going to have the people paying higher prices for bread, butter, tea, sugar and practically every commodity one can think of, he says now, a year later:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Despite the fact that I am putting on the same taxes and despite the fact that I am asking the people to pay the same amount of money, I am perfectly convinced that, when you talk in terms of £100,000,000, you can economise to the extent of at least £3,500,000 in public administration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What does this Budget mean?  Is the Minister looking for £100,000,000 or for £96,500,000?  A sum of £1,000,000 here or there does not seem to bother the Minister very much, but £1,000,000 or £3,500,000 extra in taxation may mean a very great deal to the people.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had been able to find this sum of £3,500,000 last year&mdash;he says it is no trouble to him now and he <Col N="321" /> is firmly convinced it is there&mdash;was there any reason to be so savage in the reduction of the food subsidies?  Was there any reason to treat the civil servants as they were treated?  Was there any reason to dishonour the arbitration award as it was dishonoured by the Government?  Would the Minister answer these questions when replying to the debate?  Remember that the people of the country have already answered them.  I referred to the fact that there were significant events during the course of the year in the political arena.  Three of these significant matters concerned Dublin City, Wicklow and East Cork, because, in these three constituencies, the Government policy, as put before the Oireachtas within the framework of this Bill, was put to the people for their decision, and can anyone doubt what the decision of the people was?  In North-West Dublin, a very respected member of this House, an extremely popular Lord Mayor of this city, was soundly thrashed for no other reason than that he stood for Fianna Fáil and the Fianna Fáil policies.</P>
    <P>The same thing occurred in Wicklow and East Cork, and there is no doubt whatever that, as far as the people of this country are concerned, they want to see an end of the present Minister's policies.  They want to see an end of the policy which the Minister introduced in 1952 and reintroduced this year.  It is abundantly clear that not only the members of the Government but everyone sitting behind them in the Dáil and in the Seanad intensely dislike the very thought of a general election.</P>

      <P>His refusal to withdraw will go on the records of the House.  The people of Dublin to whom he referred as the mob have given their answer and I have no doubt at all that, if we had in this country any kind of real democracy in Government, the people of the country as a whole would have an opportunity of giving their answer.  Instead of submitting these policies to the people, the Government chose to hang on in the Dáil, despite the doubtful constitutional position.  They did so by means of the votes of certain Deputies&mdash;certainly not of a majority of the members of the Dáil.  They decided they would come into the Oireachtas and ask their own Party and their kind Party friends to give them a vote of confidence.  The people who should be allowed to say whether they have confidence or not are the electors of this country.  I invite the Minister and his Government to give the electors an opportunity of deciding that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to bringing in a Budget designed to raise the same amount of money from the same taxes as last year, the Minister has persuaded his colleague in the Department of Industry and Commerce to add new charges.  We remember how some months ago the Taoiseach and, indeed, the Minister for Finance in his Budget statement, were very emphatic that the limit of taxation had been reached and that the people of this country were staggering under the weight of taxation imposed by the Fianna Fáil Government and that it was not going to go an inch further.  At the same time as those statements were made, we had the Minister for Posts and <Col N="324" /> Telegraphs wandering into the Dáil with a new list of charges, new taxation and new burdens on the people. I do not know if in that situation any reliance at all can be placed on the pronouncement of Government Ministers.  If the Minister for Finance tells the people that the limit has been reached and if the Taoiseach tells the people that they are staggering under the weight of taxation, surely the people are entitled to think that an end has come to the capability of the Fianna Fáil Government to find new ways of imposing taxation on them? But, not at all.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs found that he could raise something over £500,000 by increasing postal charges and, further, that money could be raised by increasing wireless licences.  Another Minister discovered that money could be raised by increasing lorry licences and motor taxation charges.  That is taxation whatever the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs may say about it.</P>
    <P>Whether the Minister likes it or not the policy which he has been pursuing and advocating over the last two years has been emphatically repudiated by the people.  I would ask him, in so far as he claims to be a democrat, to accept the verdict of the people, change his policies or else get out of office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.F. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>It was said here this afternoon that had we not known what took place in the Dáil in regard to the Finance Bill we should not have learned very much this evening from the Minister for Finance.  In a very simple story he told us that this was a Finance Bill which he would ask us to pass.  He went through the various sections of that Bill.  Certainly we were not entitled to think from what we heard from him that the Finance Bill was giving effect to a Budget which was concerned with the spending of £100,000,000, £113,000,000 or, perhaps, even £125,000,000.  No, he did not tell us anything like that at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For all we knew from the Minister, perhaps his Budget would not be concerned with anything more than knocking down Dublin Castle and putting it <Col N="325" /> up again or, perhaps, knocking down the Oireachtas buildings and replacing them with new ones.  He appeared to think that there was really nothing in this Bill.  He had considered it fully. It was only a matter of over £100,000,000 and we should put it through as quickly as we could.  The Minister really could not be heard to say that the policy of the Government but, perhaps, in particular, the policy of the Minister was not responsible for the position in regard to unemployment to-day.  I think Senator O'Donnell has very clearly shown that if the policy of the Minister is not responsible for the state of the country, to-day, the Minister should tell us what is the reason for the unemployment we have.  As everybody knows, the position in regard to unemployment was never in our history worse than it is to-day.</P>

      <P>Very good.  It may be said that it is nonsense, but I think it cannot be denied that the position in regard to unemployment was never worse than it is to-day.

      <P>I do not know if a speech of a colleague of ours, Senator McMullen, made to-day at the Congress of Irish Unions, was mentioned here to-day.  He stated quite clearly that in his view and in the view of many people like him there was no doubt that what I am saying is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the Budget of 1952, everything went wrong.  Unemployment soared and I think all that happened &mdash;perhaps, it would not be true to say solely&mdash;principally because of the last Budget.  This Budget is not improving things.  Under the Budget of 1952, we had a general restriction of credit.  It was strange that more or less following that Budget we had that restriction. I do not know whether the Minister has sufficient influence with the banks to compel them to adopt a <Col N="326" /> restrictive credit policy, but the fact remains that they did adopt a severely restrictive credit policy with the result that trade in general slumped so that nobody could make any effort to make any progress in business.  I would say, in fairness, that restriction in regard to credit has been somewhat alleviated principally, I think, because the banks realised that if they did not give advances until they were satisfied that old advances had been repaid they could not carry on.  The restriction in credit has been relieved but only very slightly.  There does not seem to be any indication that there will be in the near future any great improvement. We have heard something about elections here this evening.  I do not know why the elections should cause any annoyance or heat.</P>

The Minister for Finance, of course, does not tell us anything about those things.  These items of taxation for Local Government and Posts and Telegraphs have all to be paid by us.  The Minister will tell us that he has nothing at all to do with this and the Government in office endeavours to deal with the position with regard to the roads grants.  They thought they would withdraw certain grants. The Government in office proceeded to indicate to county councils that they would not get as much money, by way of grants, this year as they got last year.  But the Independent Deputies said: &ldquo;No, you will not do that.&rdquo;  We have not heard anything more about that since.</P>

      <P>I certainly would not tell a person if he was an Irish citizen that he could not make a certificate to the effect that he was an Irish citizen.  The Minister talks rubbish when he talks like that.  In another clause we are told that the rates of stamp duty on deeds of exchange on property are to be increased and the duty in such cases is made chargeable <i>ad valorem.</i>  The old rate of duty was a fixed rate of 10/- and has been in force, I think, since 1891. I would like the Minister to tell us later on what changed so radically that the Minister should now alter the fixed rate of 10/- to <i>ad valorem</i> which increases the amount payable.</P>

      <P>The Minister is taking power to enable the Revenue Commissioners to accept in discharge of death duty 5 per cent. National Loan.  That is only proper and in accordance with his undertaking. Perhaps he might consider enabling the Revenue Commissioners firstly to accept that, in discharge of duty and interest instead of duty only and, secondly, to accept at their nominal value land bonds which the Minister himself issued.  He might consider that favourably.  I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister also to tell us something in regard to the rates of duty on conveyances where the consideration is between £1,000 and £2,000.  In such cases where a Government grant is not payable in respect of the property the duty is at the rate of 3 per cent.  Very often great hardship is caused to people, particularly young people setting up homes.  If the purchase money is in the neighbourhood of £2,000, as is frequently the case in regard to houses for that class of people, they find it very hard to pay the duty and a case could be made for a reduction of the duty where that occurs, and to have the duty payable <Col N="330" /> at the rate of only 1 per cent. between £1,000 and £2,000.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to income-tax. My view is that income-tax is relatively fair.  It is as fair a way as any the Minister can discover or design to obtain a substantial share of revenue.  Our principal grievance about income-tax is not so much that there is a difference between how one person and another is assessed, but that we have to pay income-tax at all. I do not think there is much that can be done about the income-tax position. I have noted that it has been suggested here from time to time that the farmers are fair game for income-tax, and that the law should be altered so as to bring in farmers so that they would be made liable to tax in the same way as people who are not farmers.  The less we seek to interfere with farmers the better for ourselves and the better for the farmers.  I think we should leave the farmers alone.</P>
    <P>I wish to come to another important point, the duties on beer and spirits. The Minister must listen very carefully to this and he will be honest enough to agree that in regard to spirits he has made a big bloomer.</P>
