    <Title>Public Business. - Vocational Education (Amendment) Bill, 1953&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Moylan) Seán Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Moylan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a simple one, but it will have far-reaching results in the country in regard to vocational education. Section (1) is the important section, inasmuch as it envisages a possible wide development and a necessarily greater State and local expenditure. The justification of this is the great demand for vocational education throughout the country based on an appreciation of the advantage which it offers.</P>
      <P>Costs of buildings, equipment, salaries and wages have increased so considerably that an amendment of existing arrangements is essential if vocational education committees are to meet the demands made on them and to plan their future programmes with consideration and in a full knowledge of the resources available to them.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the Bill provides for increased local contributions ranging from 3d. to 8d. in the £ over the rating figures specified in existing legislation. This local contribution naturally involves an increase in the amount of State grants payable.</P>
      <P>One point on which the Seanad requires assurance is in regard to wasteful expenditure.  The fact that a substantial local contribution is involved in every development is a safeguard against wasteful expenditure, and I am satisfied that the various local committees have always given serious consideration to the balance of advantage and disadvantage in all the proposals they put forward to my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed to provide for a rate of 15d. in the £ for each of 32 committees and 18d. in the £ for each of <Col N="287" /> the remaining six.  These six are urban areas with the exception of County Longford, which is a small county with a relatively low return from the rates.</P>
    <P>There is a special problem in relation to certain counties where the rateable valuation per head is exceptionally low and my Department has been frequently urged by the Irish Vocational Education Association to make a special provision to meet that problem.</P>
    <P>Section 53 of the original Act of 1930 states that, in making regulations for the payment of parliamentary grants to vocational education committees, regard may be had to:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(a)  the annual local contribution payable to each vocational education committee;</P>
    <P>(b)  the amount of the rate required to raise such annual local contribution, and</P>
    <P>(c)  the population of the vocational education area of such committee.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Hitherto, except in urban areas no special weight was given to considerations of population and low valuation in the making of regulations for the payment of grants.  When a committee found itself in straitened circumstances and the Department was satisfied that this was due to a low return from the rates, special State subventions were made as required, to tide the committee over its difficulties. This is an unsatisfactory method.</P>
    <P>As the vocational education schemes developed, however, it became more and more evident that areas of low valuation were at a great disadvantage. The committees' incomes consisted mainly of the return from the local rates plus an equal sum from the State, and where the local rates produced only a small sum the State grant, too, was small accordingly.</P>
    <P>This difficulty in rural areas has now been given special consideration in this Bill.  It is proposed to provide by regulation for an increase of the ratio of the State grant to the local contribution in the case of seven county <Col N="288" /> committees, or to place them in relatively the same position as the rest of the county committees.  The seven committees concerned are those for the Counties of Galway, Donegal, Kerry, Leitrim, Longford, Mayo and Sligo.</P>
    <P>If any of these seven committees finds that its income for any year on the present basis of £1: £1 is insufficient, State grants may be authorised at a ratio of more than £1 to £1, but not exceeding £2 to £1.  This will relieve these committees of anxiety on the score of income in regard to contemplated development and will enable them to plan ahead effectively and comprehensively.</P>
    <P>The method of computation of the grants is set out in regulations which the Minister makes each year under Section 53 of the Vocational Education Act, and as the original Act empowers the Minister to raise the ratio of grant, there is no specific reference in this Bill to the seven committees concerned. The new arrangement is, however, implicit in the fact that the upper limit of rating in the Bill is fixed in relation to six of the committee's concerned, at 15d., and to the seventh at 18d.  These upper limits are much less than would be necessary if the payment of grants to those committees were to continue on the present £1 for £1 basis.</P>
    <P>On the £1 for £1 basis, for example, a rate of 2/- would be necessary at present to produce the same total income for vocational education in County Kerry as would a rate of 15d. under the proposed arrangement.  In plain language, these committees, of which, incidentally, four are for Gaeltacht counties, will in future be eligible for a higher ratio than heretofore of State grant.</P>
    <P>I wish to make perfectly clear, however, that it does not follow that all or any of these seven committees will automatically receive a higher ratio of State grants forthwith, nor that all or any of them will ultimately be placed on a £2:£1 basis.  The increasing of the ratio will depend on each committee's probable financial position in the years ahead after ascertaining whether its difficulties could not be met by <Col N="289" /> merely taking up additional rate each year and continuing the grants at the existing ratio.</P>
    <P>The estimated additional cost of these proposals in State grants and local rates over and above that authorised by existing legislation is as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>&mdash;and ultimately, if a 2:1 basis were in operation for all seven, a total of £68,000 per annum.  In comparison with the total cost, the amount payable to these low-rated counties is not really significant.</P>
    <P>The purpose of Section 2 of the Bill is to deal with matters arising out of the introduction last year of the payment of remuneration to vocational teachers on the same basis as for secondary and primary teachers, namely, by scales of salary differentiated on a marriage basis.  All these scales carry children's allowances and rent allowances, but in the case of secondary and primary teachers the children's allowances are payable to retired teachers and to widows of teachers.  To pay allowances similarly to pensioned vocational teachers and to widows of vocational teachers would appear to be going beyond the provisions of the Local Government (Superannuation) Acts.  The Department of Education is not wholly responsible for vocational education.  Moreover, the paying body is, in the case of the superannuation of vocational education officers, the local rating authority. After consultation with the Attorney-General it was decided that provision <Col N="290" /> could be made for the payment of children's allowances to vocational teachers' widows and to superannuated vocational teachers by amending the Vocational Education Acts as is here proposed, so as to enable vocational education committees to pay them out of their funds.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill is intended to remove any doubts as to whether the children's allowances and rent allowances are pensionable.  They were intended to be non-pensionable, as they are for primary and secondary teachers, but in view of the meaning of pensionable remuneration as defined in Section 34 of the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1948, there was some doubt as to whether they actually were non-pensionable.  Section 3 proposes to make them so beyond doubt and thus to bring the vocational teachers into line with the other teachers in this respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  However, I am not quite certain of that at the moment.  About a dozen of the committees are now on the maxima allowed by existing legislation or are within a fraction of a penny thereof, and they cannot obtain sufficient income for all their commitments next year unless this Bill is passed at an early date.  If it is passed before they make their usual demands early next January to the local rating authority, sub-section (3) of Section 1 will enable them to avail of the additional rate provided in the Bill so as to have increased incomes in the coming financial years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dáil has been so much preoccupied with other matters that this Bill came up for discussion only a week ago.  In the month of November each year, vocational education committees prepare and submit to the Department of Education their schemes and estimates for the following financial year, and they have to decide in that month the amount of the local rate which they propose to <Col N="291" /> adopt.  For that reason, I was forced to ask the Dáil for special consideration in relation to the Bill, and I am grateful to the Deputies for the cooperative spirit in which they met me in that regard.</P>
    <P>While I am hopeful for the same indulgence from the Seanad, I am yet anxious for their consideration and criticism of every aspect of vocational education on which Senators have, from their experience, such criticism to offer.  There has been great progress and development, in vocational education, but if we pursue the development, as it is possible was may, we can say that the system is merely in its infancy and wise consideration may enable us to avoid errors that might arise in future development.</P>
    <P>I regret that it was impossible to bring the Bill before the Dáil at an earlier time so that there might be a more adequate discussion of the whole problem, but I hope that what we failed to get in the Dáil may help forward what we get in the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is a characteristic Cork man.  I agree entirely with him that this is the kind of Bill which would merit discussion in this House.  It comes to us very inopportunely on the last day of sitting before Christmas and comes to us with a request from the Minister&mdash;a very reasonable request I am sure&mdash;that we give him all stages to-day.  Whether there was delay in the Dáil or in the Department I do not know, but the Dáil is so busy these days with what I called here before reheated porridge &mdash;praiseach ó aréir&mdash;that they have not time for legislation at all.  I wonder whether it would not be possible to evolve a system whereby Estimates in the other House would be finished in the summer and this time of the year devoted to legislation. At any rate, we have to take this Bill as we find it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill proposes a further development in vocational education and vocational education in this country has a great many merits.  In the first place, it is almost the only sphere in which voluntary mixed committees <Col N="292" /> work extremely well for a national purpose.  It is, I think, an excellent idea to have the association of teachers, managers, educationists, outsiders, with representatives of local bodies to manage vocational schools. There is, of course, in certain places, a fairly long tradition of vocational education.  In Dublin, for example, and in other cities, it goes back to the old British Department of Agriculture which, I think, could be regarded as the beginning of Home Rule in this country.  It was extended in 1930 by the then Minister for Education, Professor J.M. O'Sullivan, and it is now well established in the country and a great many buildings have been put up as vocational schools.</P>
    <P>In Dublin and, I am sure, in other cities, there is, as I say, a well-established tradition and considerable education in arts and crafts.  The technical school in Dublin which began in Kevin Street has a very remarkable history of efficiency and of keeping up to date with various discoveries and it should be the policy of the Minister, we would all agree, that the vocational schools should be devoted, in the main, to the teaching of domestic arts and crafts, the teaching of trades, and should not, if it could be avoided&mdash;I know it is difficult to avoid it&mdash;afford assistance to the movement towards what one might call white-collar occupations and the turning away from occupations which require manual skill and all the various types of work that have to be done on a farm.  In cities, there is necessity for a certain amount of what is called commercial education, but it is very undesirable that there should be in country towns a tendency for vocational schools to be used merely for shorthand and typewriting. The committees in pretty well all cases are very sound and I should like to say that in the efforts made by University College Dublin and University College Cork towards adult education, very good assistance has been given by the committees and by the officers of these committees in co-operation with the university authorities in forming classes for adult education.  With regard to the general tendency, I often wonder whether the rural bias <Col N="293" /> about which so much is talked can be achieved merely by teaching a subject like rural science.  We are becoming very rapidly urbanised and urbanisation is a comparatively recent thing in this country.  It has taken place with great rapidity in the past 30 years.  When I was a boy the great majority in Dublin were only one generation removed from the country, but I am sometimes amazed by the complete ignorance of young people from country towns of how people just outside the town live.  Whether it is affectation or not, I am not quite sure, but, at any rate, the education they get seems to remove them entirely from any knowledge of the type of life their fathers or their grandfathers lead.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether vocational schools could not be used a little more for the purpose of telling people exactly how our fathers or our grandfathers lived, what kind of houses they had, what kind of furniture they had, what kind of tools they used for the work they had to do before reapers and binders the tractors and all the modernisation which is now on the farms came in.  I wonder would it be possible to have in each school some material examples of the kind of tools used, and the kind of life led in rural Ireland.  I am not pleading for a stress upon history.  I think we have almost too much history about the injustices suffered by the Irish and about the political struggle and not enough about how the land was used, how people lived, how they played and how they laughed, because, in spite of history books which show us the Gael ground down in the dust, there must have been considerable vigorous life in the country.  We need to know more about that.</P>
    <P>There is at present in the museum in Dublin, under the Minister's control, a folk section.  It is very well done, but, of course, it entirely cramped for space.  It is in a very small space and has, indeed, too much material for the space it has.  I take this opportunity of suggesting to the Minister that we need folk museums in the country and need in Dublin an open-air folk museum, which would show in an open space the kind of houses people lived <Col N="294" /> in, the kind of furniture they had and the tools they used.  Such a thing is common in the Scandinavian countries. There is a project afoot to establish such a museum in Belfast.  It would be very curious if the part of the country which is the most agricultural were to be beaten by the more industrialised section of the country in showing to the people, the young people in particular, the kind of rural life which existed in the country 100 years ago.</P>
    <P>I think we would need to know, more than anything else, more than the doctrinaire politics, more than pride in political achievement or even in military struggles, what kind of life people led in the country and how they survived under very great difficulties. If we can awaken knowledge of that kind of life we would awaken pride in it and it would be a greater remedy for urbanisation than any other thing that education could give.  Pride must be based on knowledge and I think the vocational schools could be used to give that knowledge.  If they were, it would be a considerable step forward and it would serve as an antidote to the great tendency towards life in the town and white collar occupations which turn people away from skilled workmanship and the farm.</P>
    <P>There is another point to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention.  It is an old point about which a great deal has been said and it is one about which I spoke before. The teaching of Irish in the vocational schools could stress a background of rural life more than a knowledge of the irregular verbs.  There has always been a certain amount of discontent among university graduates about the way in which they are treated in vocational schools.  The Department itself recently, I think in September of last year, initiated a course for teachers of Irish specially under the Department itself and entry to that course was at the point of having the Intermediate Certificate and not even the Leaving Certificate.</P>
    <P>The course took nine months and those who passed at the end&mdash;a small number of people, I think about 20&mdash; were then declared to be qualified to teach Irish, English, Arithmetic and <Col N="295" /> Geography in the vocational schools.  I think that kind of a course is a mistake. University graduates should be accepted for that purpose.  I do not think that people who merely have the Intermediate Certificate are competent to be made teachers for any purpose in our vocational schools.  I suggest that that kind of quick, special intensive course is not sufficient and that the people who attend vocational schools should have an opportunity of contacts with teachers who have a wider knowledge.</P>
    <P>That particular wider knowledge may not be used for any particular class.  It is recognised generally by educationists that teachers should have a knowledge that is on a much broader base than people can possibly have by beginning a course of instruction as teachers after they have completed a secondary school course.  It is a costly method, too, of training teachers.  Teaching brought to that level is a mistake.  There may be certain exceptions necessary in the case of Irish but I think that kind of course is not going to increase the efficiency of our vocational schools.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is not the Minister's fault that we had not time to discuss this matter adequately.  I merely dealt with two specific points, but before I sit down I must say to the Minister that I know his predecessor was interested in the matter.  I know that other people were interested and I think the present Minister himself is interested in the matter, but it is nothing short of a disgrace that, in a country like this, which boasts of its rural roots and always talks about agricultural production, we should not be able to show our young people, say, in such a place as the Phænix Park&mdash;it is a comparatively large area&mdash;the houses, furniture and implements of all kinds that our ancestors used. Mind you, they need not go very far back into history either to say: &ldquo;That is how my grandfather lived.&rdquo;  That would be the case with the great majority of people even in Dublin City. I think that project would be worthwhile. There would be some initial expense but the project would eventually <Col N="296" /> pay for itself.  People coming from overseas&mdash;and we talk a lot about tourism&mdash;would see here what they would not see elsewhere.  That has been done in Wales.  It is projected in Belfast and I think it would be very bad if we did not make an endeavour to do it.  It must be the responsibility of some Department and I think the Minister for Education, particularly the Minister in charge of vocational education, is the person who should initiate the project.  I think it has the Minister's goodwill and I would urge upon him not to relax in his efforts to see that it is done.  I entirely agree with the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make one or two observations on this measure.  Like Senator Hayes, I consider it was rather a pity that we did not get this measure earlier so that we would be able to discuss it with a little more leisure.  It is not obviously a political measure in any sense.  Accordingly, we can express ourselves in a frank and sincere way without any sort of feeling that what we say will be pounced upon by somebody on the other side.</P>
      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say that he would welcome frank criticism and the views of people in this House who have experience of vocational education as it is.  Anything that anybody in this House can say can only be said from his own personal experience in the field of vocational education.</P>
      <P>I support, in the main, everything Senator Hayes said.  I think it is really unfortunate that in our educational scheme, as it is at present operating, there is not more emphasis on that other not too distant past about which there is too little known. This measure makes provision for local authorities to raise a much larger rate for the expansion of vocational education in the future.  I know it is frequently said that there is no more unwelcome form of niggardliness than to cheesepare in the matter of education. That statement may be partially true, but I think there is the other aspect in regard to this whole problem of expenditure on education and it is this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="297" /> This is a poor country and we have to study carefully what we are going to spend on any particular service.  It is the responsibility of those who have anything to say to ensure, when we are going to spend money, it is going to be spent wisely and in such a way that we will get the greatest possible advantage from what is being spent.  I know a number of counties, including my own, which have gone to the limit in regard to the rate that can be levied for educational purposes.</P>
    <P>There is a clamour for the building of new vocational schools and the Minister seems to be very busy.  We all agree that it is a welcome sign of the times to see him opening new schools up and down the country. Hundreds of thousands of pounds are being spent on new buildings throughout the country for primary and vocational purposes.</P>
    <P>On another occasion we had Senator Hayes talking here about spending hundreds of thousands of pounds on university education.  That is very commendable work in a new country &mdash;because in a sense that is how we must classify ourselves&mdash;but I have the feeling that in many of our countries this problem of expenditure on vocational education must be approached with a considerable degree of caution. I have been a member of a vocational committee for a great many years.  I am not discussing my own feelings in this matter alone, but feelings which are shared by colleagues of mine on the vocational committee when I say we are really not happy about the expenditure on vocational education.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes pointed to the efforts of our vocational schools to tell us something about our past, but if I have a feeling of mental disturbance about this problem it is because we are not quite clear where we want to go in future.  We are spending a very considerable sum on vocational education but if you look around amongst your neighbours, amongst young people growing up, you wonder to what purpose it is being spent.  Our rural schools are teaching commercial subjects; there are woodwork teachers, domestic science teachers and perhaps an Irish teacher.  When you look to see <Col N="298" /> what the fruits of their labours are in any particular district, you must confess that in the people around you there is not much evidence of it.</P>
    <P>I do not want that to be taken as a condemnation of our schools or our vocational teachers, many of whom work very hard and very industriously but I am forced on many occasions to wonder whether our approach to this problem of vocational education is a proper one or not.  New schools are being built to teach subjects which can be taught, in my opinion, more profitably, from the point of view of the pupil, in the national schools.  With the necessity for economy in the country, and bearing in mind the great expenditure on education, it would be very well to study whether or not the national teacher could teach boys and girls such subjects as English and mathematics as well as that work can be done in a vocational school.</P>
    <P>When children come to 14 years of age they want to get away from the discipline of the national school in their own locality.  They want to be able to hop on their bicycles and travel the four or five miles to town and back again every day.  There is more freedom in that, but I question whether it is better for education or for discipline for the boys or girls.  Furnishing the kind of material that will be valuable to the child in after life would be much more profitably done in the local surroundings where there would be less waste of time and effort.  We are duplicating in our vocational schools what could be better done in the national school.</P>
    <P>I wish I could say positively what I would like done.  My difficulty is that while I am unhappy with what we are doing and the results accruing from our present line of policy, it is terribly difficult to decide what is to be put in its place.  We are not clear about the purpose of vocational education and the children who are going there are much less clear.  They are sent to these schools to learn woodwork and other subjects, and they are catalogued and pigeon-holed; many of them are not clear as to what classes they wish to attend, whether shorthand and typing or other subjects.  Many children <Col N="299" /> coming from national schools want to learn shorthand and typewriting, although we all know the difficulties of providing worthwhile employment in that kind of work.  There is an intensive demand for employment of this nature that is not profitable from the point of view of earning.</P>
    <P>Many young people who attend the vocational schools clear out of the country afterwards.  You do not see where the boys and girls who do their courses in these schools leave their mark.  It is true that many of them, due to the attitude of trade unions, find it difficult to find employment and to sell their service.  That is something that ought to be put right.  It is a great tragedy that we have spent such great sums on vocational education over a number of years with such meagre results.</P>
    <P>The people who direct our vocational plan ought to have in their minds a purpose in regard to the subjects they teach.  The primary purpose ought to be that the boys and girls going through these schools are going to serve and live in Ireland.  They ought to inculcate in them the feeling that they want to remain in this country and their training should be shaped to that end.  That applies to universities as well.  We are giving the wrong type of education to thousands of our young people and when they have got it they cannot live in this country&mdash;there is no employment for them.</P>
    <P>We ought to reconsider this whole problem.  In our rural districts our vocational schools serve as a kind of secondary establishment for boys and girls many of whom cannot afford the fees at a secondary school but they are just a stepping stone over which they pass to emigration.</P>
    <P>Under our vocational plan we ought to be able to provide a lecturer who would go into our rural schools perhaps once a week or every three weeks and discuss with each class something about what they mean to do in life, where they mean to go, and how they mean to live.  He would talk to them of the desirability of so shaping their scheme of education that they <Col N="300" /> can sell their services here in Ireland. I do not think anyone is emphasising that point of view for our young people.  We are just drifting helplessly along.  Neither teachers nor parents are stressing that aspect of the problem, and the immediate desire of so many young people at 18 or 20 years of age is to flee from the country.  Those of us with more experience know that they are fleeing to economic conditions and a way of life much less desirable than they could enjoy at home.  The economic standards, if measured completely, are not as high as they could enjoy at home if they had the right slant from the beginning and went out with a proper purpose to work in their own country.</P>
    <P>I have to express the feeling I have had for many years as a member of a vocational committee, that I am never happy about the money we are spending. It is very difficult to show in what way it can be spent so as to give better results.  I am not alone in that.  Many of my colleagues have those feelings also, and we have expressed them one to another.  We are all too easy-going about it.  We are not vigorous enough in tackling the problem.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes referred to rural science.  I do not understand why every boy who is going to be the boy on the farm at home should not be inveigled, if there is a rural science teacher in the school, to attend the rural science class.  There is no one bothering about that.  The parents are not bothering, as many of them know very little about rural science.  People in public life, Deputies and Senators, are not bothering&mdash;many of them are themselves comparatively uninformed about it.  If we had rural science in our vocational schools, a teacher who could teach rural science, who could go out into the fields with the boys from the vocational school and demonstrate by example the meaning of the science as taught in the schools, that would arouse a fresh interest in rural life and strike the imagination of those boys in a way no one has done up to the present.  I believe that ought to be done.</P>
    <P>There is a problem to-day with regard to teachers.  A complaint very <Col N="301" /> frequently made in my county is that we have not been able to provide up to the present any training in electricity. We have rural electrification all over the country but there is only a limited number of people who can do anything in this sphere.  The great bulk of the people who are to be served by electricity would hardly know how to put in a bulb.  This is a requirement which demands immediate attention.  If value is to be got from electrical power in rural districts, a great many more people must be taught to understand it so as to be able to do something for themselves, and for their neighbours who cannot fend for themselves.  I do not know whose job it is.  It does not seem to be a function of vocational education.  On more than one occasion our committee tried to get a teacher, but he was not available.  Naturally those who are expert in electricity at the moment in an area are not going to come along and train more teachers, since the greater the number trained the less work will be for themselves; in other words, a limited number of people can make a &ldquo;corner&rdquo; out of this, as it is there at present.</P>
    <P>I understand there is a shortage of domestic science teachers and there is definitely a shortage of rural science teachers.  We have advertised a lot for one or two rural science teachers and cannot find them.  Is that not an appalling situation where so many people come from the land, where the land is so vital, and where people are continuously crying out that there is nothing for young people to do?  Some one should give attention to this whole problem of diverting the minds of young people into those fields where they can most profitably sell their services in the future.  From that point of view, a great deal of the money we have spent on education in every field up to the present has not been spent as profitably as it might have been.</P>
    <P>As one representative of a local authority, I would be more enthusiastic in asking my colleagues to increase the rate for vocational education if I were satisfied that we were doing the right thing, that we were providing our young citizens with the type of training which would be valuable to them in <Col N="302" /> Ireland, which would make them proud and anxious to work in Ireland and to serve Ireland.  I do not see those fruits coming from the scheme of vocational education as it is to-day.  I do not know the remedy.  I have never had sufficient opportunity to work this out, or time at my disposal to try to work it out.  We know about the folk schools in Denmark and the great development they have made.  We know of the achievements of the Danes in farming and in engineering.  We look around this country with its high level of individual intelligence and see such backwardness everywhere.  We must come to the conclusion that there is something wrong with us as a people or that the people who are trying to train our minds and shape our course are not training in the right direction and that someone has to sit down and think again.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether these remarks will be regarded as a criticism of the Bill or not.  I believe we must go on and we will probably find the better way, but we will only find the better way by individuals who feel a certain way about it expressing dissatisfaction. I can only say that while I support the Bill I am not happy that we are getting value for the money and I think it is incumbent on us to think again.</P>

Seacht gcontaethe bochta iad agus, fé mar a dúirt an tAire, baineann cheithre chontae díobh leís an nGaeltacht.

    <P>Sin í an cheist.  Baineann ana-chuid rudaí leis an dtuaith, ach ceapaim gurb é an rud is tábhachtaí ná conus an talamh d'oibriú i gceart.  Sin ceist talmhaíochta.</P>
    <P>Fé mar a dúirt an tAire, tá baint ag Aire eile le cúrsaí gairm-oideachais sa tír seo, an tAire Rialtais Áitiúil, mar is as na rátaí a faightear cuid mhaith den airgead.  Luíonn sé le réasún, mar sin, go mbeadh focal údarásach le rá ag an Aire Rialtais Áitiúil, ach im thuairim-se, ba cheart go mbeadh baint ag Aire eile leis an saghas seo oideachais&mdash;an tAire Talmhaíochta. Ba chóir, más féidir é a dhéanamh ar aon chor, feidhm a bhaint as na cigirí agus na teagascóirí sa Roinn Talmhaíochta chun cabhrú le hoideachais gaírme beatha sa tír seo. Ba chóir na daoine sin do chur ar fáil chun léachtaí agus teagasc do thabhairt ar conus is féidír na torthaí is fearr a bhaint as an talamh, ar conus an chré agus an talamh a leasú i gceart, agus mar sin de.

    <P>Rinne mé tagairt cheana do cheist na Gaeilge ins na scoileanna sin.  Tá mé den dtuairim gur féidir mórán obair mhaith do dhéanamh ar son na teangan ins na scoileanna gairm-oídeachais. Admhaím go bhfuil obair mhaith dá <Col N="304" /> déanamh iontu cheana féin mar tuigtear dom go bhfuil múinteoirí Gaeilge in gach ceann des na scoileanna sin.  Is féidir go bhfuil an teagasc ins na scoileanna sin sásúil chomh fada is a bhaineann sé le múineadh na Gaeilge ach ní leor é go múinfear an Ghaeilge mar lom-abhar ins na scoileanna sin. Ba cheart an obair do leathnú agus ceangal do chur ar bun ídir gach scoil gairm-oideachais sa tír seo agus an saol leasmuigh a mhusclódh suim na ndaoine ins an gceist.  Tá eagla orm go bhfuil an iomad ceangail ar na múinteoirí ins na scoileanna sin agus nach bhfuil an tsaoire acu a bhíodh ag múinteoirí taistil, mar shompla, chun cúrsaí cultúra Gaeilge do chur ar aghaidh chomh maith leis an dteanga féin.  Má's mian linn an Ghaeilge a bheith in a teanga bheo, ní mór dúinn í do chothú le cúrsaí den tsaghas sin. Sí beatha na teangan í a labhairt agus an cultúr a leanann í a chothú chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Ba chóir go mbeadh sé ar chúrsa aon mhúinteora atá ag múineadh ins na scoileanna gairme oideachais an obair chultúir do chur ar aghaidh chomh maith le múineadh na teangan féin. 'Sé atá in aigne agam ná drámaíocht agus rudaí den tsórt sin.  Sa tslí sin, is féidir beatha a thabhairt do'n teanga Ghaeilge.  Go dtí go ndéanfar é sin, agus go dtí go mbeidh ceangal níos deise idir an scoil agus an saoghal leasmuigh, ní bheídh an oiread dá dhéanamh ar son na Gaeilge agus ba mhaith linn a bheith.</P>
    <P>Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil mórán eile le rá agam faoin mBille seo i láthair na huaíre.  Fé mar a dúirt an tAire, is Bille simplí é cé go bhfuil mórán leastuigh de.  Is maith liom go mbeadh a thuille airgid le fáil don tsaghas oideachais seo.

    <Speaker pid="WilliamFearon" hpid="Professor Fearon Professor Fearon">
      <NameTxt>Professor Fearon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a most useful and timely measure and I very gladly support it.  I am one of the people who have enormous belief in the importance of our vocational education and in its ultimate development in this country.  Becoming more and more industrialised as we are, vocational <Col N="305" /> training will be more and more important in our general set-up as a people.  We are coming into a sort of technocracy.  Anything that can help our people to develop their natural skill is something which we ought to assist in every way and for that reason I welcome a Bill which makes more money available for vocational education and also seeks to raise that money in a more equitable way by distributing it more fairly amongst the sources of revenue.</P>
      <P>At the same time, I am sorry we cannot raise a little more, and I wonder if the Minister would consider a way in which that might be done.  Our industries are developing so rapidly and, in many cases, so successfully, and drawing more and more on our vocationally-trained boys for their supply, that I feel that Irish industry should contribute to the maintenance and upkeep of our vocational education. Senator Baxter referred to electricity and the problem of ensuring that people know how to attend to electrical fittings in their ordinary working conditions.  I presume the E.S.B. contribute to the training of the boys whom they will in future employ, but I should be very surprised if what they contribute would represent very much of the expense incurred in giving the proper technical training. I feel that we, as ratepayers and taxpayers, are paying for the training of boys that eventually will be used in the industry.  We are not only paying for the goods we eventually buy but for the training of the people who make them, and I believe that industry should contribute much more effectively to the support of all this technical vocational training, especially as modern industry is becoming extremely technical and requires proper training in the use of modern apparatus, properly trained teachers and so on, and it would be in the interest of industries to see that the fields from which they will recruit future workers are satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How can industry be interlinked so that it can be drawn on to aid vocational education, as I believe it does in England and Northern Ireland?  One way in which that might be done would be by enlarging the vocational <Col N="306" /> education committees to include representatives of all the industries and then seeking to have them devise some methods for contributing to vocational education.  Another way, of course, would be to allow them an income-tax rebate on money spent for the purpose of the technical education of the students they will eventually employ.  In short, I feel that we should get far more support from our developing industries for our technical training, much of which will be employed in these industries.  That is possibly the answer to some of Senator Baxter's apprehensions with regard to the money being spent on vocational education.  I do not think, by any means, that too much money is being or will be spent, but more money might come from another channel.</P>
    <P>I should like to avail myself of the Minister's suggestion that we should discuss this matter more generally by referring to the teachers in these vocational education institutions.  People come to me, having graduated or having done science, for suggestions as to what they should do, and I often make the suggestion: &ldquo;What about vocational education?  It is very interesting work, very valuable work and very important work in this country.&rdquo; I find, however, that it is not popular among certain types of students, and I find that certain criticisms are levelled at it.  I wonder how much there is in this type of criticism? Vocational education, I understand, draws its recruits for teaching from three types of person&mdash;the ordinary trainee, the part-time teacher and the university graduate.  In the case of a trainee, I have been told that the standard is so disappointing that, of the trainees, only about 10 per cent. eventually qualify for a grade A teachership.  If that is true, something is wrong&mdash;either the method of selecting the trainees is not sufficiently widespread or the inducement is not sufficient.</P>
    <P>Another complaint made to me is that the trainee who has some special line and who takes up this work in the belief that he will be called on to teach, principally, if not entirely, in that line, finds, later on, that he is expected to teach in subjects (a) in <Col N="307" /> which he may have no interest and in which he may not be able to acquire an interest and (b) what is even worse, for which he may have no aptitude. That is a very discouraging possibility. I have often heard it said that, where a trainee for some reason finds that he is not really qualified to teach, he is confronted with a fine of a considerable sum of money, if he gives up his endeavours.  That fine, I have been told, has to be paid in a lump sum and not spread over a number of years.</P>
    <P>If these are real grievances, they are grievances which ought to be examined, if we are considering spending more money on vocational education because the teacher is an enormously important person.  He is more than a technician; he is a craftsman, and, if he is enthusiastic about his craft, he will awaken enthusiasm in the students and that enthusiasm will help to keep them at work.  The enthusiasm of the craftsman is a very precious thing indeed, and if it is going to be frustrated by various obstacles, such as diversion to teaching subjects not his own and the like, we are in danger of losing it.  For these reasons, I take the opportunity of drawing the Minister's attention in a formal way&mdash;I am sure he knows about them already&mdash;to the possibility of inter-locking industry and making the wheels of industry do a little turning to the wheels of education, since industry will profit so much by it, and to the question of the technical teacher in vocational education who is an extremely important person and whose interests require to be very well and very carefully safeguarded.</P>

      <P>I would like to say at the outset that I welcome this Bill as I consider it affords a corrective for certain evils that have militated very much against the success of vocational education in this country. At the very outset the vocational system was taken up earnestly and enthusiastically by the urban areas and the large towns and they set immediately about erecting very expensive, well-equipped and beautiful schools.  Some of us down the country felt at that particular time&mdash; 24 or 25 years ago that that money would have been better spent in extending and popularising the system throughout the rural areas where there was every necessity for it.  We believed at that particular period, when the vocational system was in its infancy, that the style of building was not as important as the nature of the instruction to be imparted and that the buildings would come afterwards when the people had grasped that the system really intended to do something to bring back a love of the arts and crafts that, as Senator Hayes pointed out in opening the debate, prevailed in this country 100 years ago. That was not done and, as far as I know, the personnel of these vocational committees were mostly drawn from the urban areas and the big towns.  Naturally, they were anxious to bring the benefits immediately to their own particular areas and they did that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite an amount of useful work was done in these schools, but the system was very adversely criticised and never more criticised than when the local body met at the estimates meeting and discussed the contribution that the vocational committee expected to get in order to qualify for the parliamentary grant that was made available.  Naturally, representatives from the rural areas asked at these meetings: &ldquo;What will our people get out of this system?&rdquo;  The only reply was: &ldquo;The system is in its infancy and eventually it will spread out.&rdquo;<Col N="311" /> This Bill will do something to help it to spread out and I am sorry that something of this kind was not done very many years ago when I believe no small contribution would have been made towards correcting the flight from the country into the big towns and cities and emigration to England.</P>
    <P>The people generally in the country up to recently were not very sympathetic to the system for the reason I have given.  They did not see any evidence of the benefits the system was bringing to their particular areas. Latterly that apathy has been conrected more or less, and that has been mainly due to the work of the vocational committees in the different centres who are now sending out part-time teachers and carrying the instruction into the remote areas.  As far as the large schools in the urban areas are concerned, some people from the rural districts availed of the instruction given there, but it was only those who could provide transport for themselves or who could afford to take up residence in the centre in which the school was built who could attend.  I know one case myself of a young man who cycled 20 miles every morning and evening during a course in order to avail of the instruction being given in ironwork at one of the urban national schools.</P>
    <P>There has been much criticism as to the standard of education that many applicants for admission to the vocational schools have on entering there. There is every reason to raise that question because the standard in many cases is not what it should be.  Twenty years ago it was not an unusual thing to find boys of 15 to 17 years of age attending the national schools during the winter months, and they will admit themselves to-day that the two years when they came back, say, from November to March, were certainly the years in which they reaped the greatest benefit, because they had at least reached the use of reason, and they realised what they had lost through their carelessness in earlier years.</P>
    <P>It is a most unusual thing now to <Col N="312" /> find pupils, boys especially, in the national schools after they reach the age of 14 years.  Even before they reach the age of 14 years very many of those who would and could derive considerable benefit from vocational instruction have not the standard of education to avail of that, not because the standard is low in the primary schools but because of the apathy of their parents in regard to the attendance of these youngsters during the years that they should attend school. The apathy, of course, led to the first Government passing compulsory attendance legislation but I am sorry to say that as far as the West is concerned that Compulsory Attendance Act is only administered in a very indifferent way.  If the youngsters are anxious, as Senator Baxter pointed out, to get out of the national school and enter the vocational school, they would be in a better position to avail of that instruction if they attended the primary schools regularly up to 14 years of age.</P>
    <P>What I like about this Bill is that the extra financial assistance that it purports to provide for certain areas is contingent on the work of the vocational committees in expanding the system into the areas where it has not been known before.  I believe that it is not the intention of the Minister or the Act that the extra money should be spent on further improving conditions in the urban school and neglecting the rural areas as they were neglected up to recently.</P>
    <P>In some of the large schools that were built in my own county the teachers or the committee showed a certain amount of originality and initiative so far as the instruction was concerned, which was to their credit. During the time that paraffin oil and petrol were very scarce in this country, when many cars were laid up in the garages and when motor-car batteries could be got almost for a song, one particular school in Mayo specialised in instructing its pupils on the construction of wind-chargers.  Because of that the disabilities that were suffered in other areas where people could not buy an ordinary candle, were not in evidence in this quarter.  Before rural <Col N="313" /> electrification was extended there, many houses that had pupils attending that vocational school had their own electric light.  I believe that if the intention in relation to which this particular extra financial assistance is being given is carried out by the committees administering the system in the different counties, much good will be done.  I am not so much concerned even now with the building of schools in these areas.  Unfortunately at the present time many national schools have not sufficient pupils to occupy all their rooms, and even where the rooms are occupied I know of no manager or teacher who would object to having part-time classes carried on in his particular district which would bring instruction to the adults in the area, which they certainly would appreciate.</P>
    <P>I know districts where classes in carpentry are being carried on and are very much appreciated.  Within the last couple of weeks a three-months class in a particular school was about to cease.  There was a unanimous request from an excellent attendance to have that class continued for three months more.  That is an indication to me that the rural areas, if they get an opportunity of reaping some of the benefits of this system, will avail of that opportunity and no other section of the community will be more enthusiastic about the scheme than they will be, when that opportunity is provided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill on two main grounds.  First, it provides money for the extension of vocational education and, secondly, it provides that vocational teachers will be brought up to the standard of those in other categories in the teaching profession. Senator Baxter was the first to give expression to grave doubts as to the advisability of spending greater sums on vocational education.  At the same time, he reminded us that he himself was a member of Cavan County Council and Cavan Vocational Education Committee.  Senator Baxter and others very often request us to have more vocationalism, to give more power to local representatives and persons interested in particular sections.  Here <Col N="314" /> is one organisation the direction of which is entirely in the hands of those persons who, in the opinion of the elected representatives in the various counties, are the best persons to direct that organisation.</P>
      <P>I can safely say, on behalf of the Galway County Council, that there are very few councils in Ireland, if any, as politically minded as the Galway County Council; but when it is a question of appointing a vocational education committee or an agricultural committee, the members are chosen not on a political basis, not because they are supporters of any political party, but because in the opinion of the members of the Galway County Council they are the persons most interested, the persons who will give the greater benefit arising out of their knowledge of the subject, whether it is agriculture or vocational education.  The proof of that has been evident in the progress that has been made down the years in vocational education in County Galway. As remote a place as the Aran Islands has been provided quite recently with a very splendid school which I am glad to say is very much appreciated and is well attended by the residents of this particular district.</P>
      <P>We must all admit that if you subtract the holidays, Church holidays and so on that young people going to school receive, the period of attendance at the national or primary school, though spread over seven years, does not reach anything more than four years.  While they are compelled to go from seven to 14 years of age, a large portion of that time is devoted to recreation rather than education. That is too short a period of time to prepare one for life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These vocational schools, about which doubts have been expressed on the other side of the House as to the advisability of spending more money on them, are to a large proportion of our young people their universities. It is more important than that as these vocational schools turn out manual workers, while universities provide workers in another field.  How are we to make this system successful? It is a new growth and a growth that <Col N="315" /> in the early days had very much opposition and criticism from groups of people who were in other ways interested in education and who felt that this new development should not be encouraged.  That might arise from various reasons.  It might arise because they had not complete control over the new system; it might arise because they felt it would not be safe to give into the hands of democratic representatives the power of appointing persons to take charge of such an important function as education of any kind.</P>
    <P>Worse still, there was opposition from another section, from trade unionism.  They feared that if this system was encouraged and developed it would hamper very much the tradition that had grown up in trade unionism of confining certain trades to sons and daughters of those in the trade, thus keeping it within a very close section.  That fear was there and I assume it was for the reason&mdash;there may be other reasons&mdash;that trade unionism was opposed in the main to the development of vocational education. A good deal of that has changed and quite a number of various branches of the trade union organisation go so far now as to make it a condition of the trade that apprentices and trainees attend a vocational school.  That is a good development and I hope it will be extended to all sections of trade unionism, to make this vocational education the success we would like it to be and to remove the doubts, if genuine, that Senator Baxter or others may have that the moneys being expended will be expended in a useful way.</P>
    <P>The national teacher, the primary teacher, might be encouraged to interest himself in these young people who are in their last year at school, at about 14 years of age, to find out on what line of thought their minds are running.  He could encourage them to avail of the vocational system at their disposal.  That primary teacher would be doing a great service to the pupil, to the school and to the nation. It is on the national teachers we must depend entirely to encourage young <Col N="316" /> people to avail of the services that are given at such a great cost.  Every effort should be made to introduce the best type of person to undergo a course of training to be a teacher in a school of that kind.  As Senator Hayes and others have pointed out, they must be people who take pride in their work, particularly in the crafts.  I do not entirely agree with Senator Baxter. Where you have a local committee with local knowledge and insight, to give to the people something they would like to claim credit for, their first interest should be to develop local art and craft.  The tradition would be there and in that way the better article would be produced.</P>
    <P>Senator Fearon made a recommendation to the Minister as to how more moneys might be provided.  He said that industries should make a contribution. I think it should not be entirely a question of a financial contribution. You have three headings&mdash; the primary school teachers, the trade union organisations and the industrialists. Each can make a big contribution to the success of this scheme.  We have already one of the largest organisations in the country, the motor trade organisation, insisting that before a person can get a certificate as a qualified mechanic he must have attended a vocational school and get a certificate there.  If we can get further in that direction it would be of great assistance to the country.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter and Senator Ruane criticised the erection of large schools in urban areas and said that many of those trained in those schools are forced to emigrate.  We all admit that. I think we might as well be practical on this.  Whether it be through force of circumstances or not, this country will have people leaving it every year. If, by an extension of this system of vocational education, we can better equip such people for life, it is right and proper that we should do so. With regard to our live-stock exports and our exports of manufactured articles, we are being appealed to day by day to send out only the best.  If certain young people wish to seek their livelihood and their fortune in other countries, I submit <Col N="317" /> that vocational education is one of the best ways by which we can help to equip them for their future life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be quite evident to anybody who keeps his eyes open that one of the most popular forms of education in this country is vocational education.  One has only to try to get a student enrolled in any one of our technical schools to discover how many thousands of young people and adults&mdash;in this city, particularly &mdash;are anxious for, and availing of, vocational education.</P>
      <P>If I have any criticism at all to make of this Bill it is that we have not enough schools for the number of young persons who are anxious for vocational training.  We owe a very great deal to the vocational schools which we already have.  I suggest that, in a sense, there should be greater development on technological lines than there is at the moment. Industry is growing apace in this county and, while some of the municipal schools are developing along technological lines, there are other vocational schools which, I understand, do not deal with that aspect of education at all.  I am referring, of course, to students of, say, articles in a primary stage of production.  Certain technical institutes in this city&mdash;particularly the Rathmines Institute&mdash;are sponsoring a series of talks by experts who come across once a fortnight to talk about primary articles which become finished product in the course of their trade.  That technological knowledge is something which we had not here and for which there is still much scope.  Irish industrialists have suggested that the establishment of a technological college here would be advisable.  In my view, however, the matter could be better coped with through the medium of the vocational schools which are already in existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am rather surprised to hear anybody deplore the spending of money on this form of education.  It is probably the best form of education we could have and I think that with young people it is more popular than either secondary or vocational education. I am indebted to this form of <Col N="318" /> education for whatever little knowledge I may possess.</P>
    <P>I should like to see an extension of the teaching of arts and crafts in our vocational schools.  Senator Hayes mentioned that point but he meant it in a different way.  It seems to me that, ultimately, this country will develop into a large-scale industrial country.  We must apply to our raw products our own ideas and the influence of our crafts in relation to our own environment rather than copy trends from outside.  We have a tradition in relation to many crafts: basket-weaving, hand-knitting, hand-carving, rug-making and probably we have one of the finest traditions in the world in the matter of bookbinding.</P>
    <P>I have seen examples of the work of our schools in which this craft is taught and, to anybody who is a book lover and a collector of books, the work is a thing of joy to have for ever. That art is a sort of natural instinct in quite a number of our people.  If our vocational schools can be extended to include the teaching of these native arts and crafts they would form a very sound basis for our industrial development and it would ensure that the influence of our county would be brought to bear on the finished product rather than that we should imitate what is being done in other countries&mdash;as, to a certain extent, we are doing at the moment.</P>
    <P>I make the plea to the Minister that our students in vocational schools be given an opportunity for a more extensive study of design.  To anybody who is interested in Irish industry, it must be obvious that a lot of our designs are imitations of those of other countries, even if it be only to a very mild extent.  It is important to our industry that we should be original in our designs.  I am thinking now not only of the design of cups and saucers, furniture, wallpaper, and so forth: I am thinking of all the things that surround us in our everyday life on which we could imprint the stamp of our environment. Take, for example, a carpet that is designed in England, or china that is designed in Czechoslovakia. These are two cases in point where I think the study of design in <Col N="319" /> this country could be very important and very beneficial indeed.  If our vocational education can be conducted on these lines, any money which is devoted to that purpose will be well spent, and I heartily support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHartney" hpid="Mr. Hartney Mr. Hartney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hartney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, as one who has been associated with vocational education in my county since the passing of the original Act.</P>
      <P>Vocational schools have served a very useful purpose in the rural areas, apart altogether from what they have done in the larger centres of population.</P>
      <P>It has been said on various occasions that the vocational school is the poor man's university.  That is all right on the one hand, but, on the other hand, there is the matter of an inferiority complex.  Some people did not think that it was the right thing to do to put their children in the local vocational school after leaving the primary school. If a man's neighbour sent his child to a secondary school he felt that he should do likewise for his child.  The number of secondary schools has doubled, if not trebled, within the past 20 or 25 years, with the result that there was always a choice of a secondary school in every area.</P>
      <P>One must take cognisance of the fact that some people had a certain inferiority complex about sending their sons or daughters to a vocational school immediately after primary school especially if their neighbours were able to send their children to secondary schools.  However, as time went on, results proved to such people that there was indeed something in vocational education.  It has filled a very big want in the rural areas. Perhaps all of the good it has done cannot yet be seen but a lot of the good results can be seen if we just take the trouble and go to see them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A vocational school has been operating in my own locality for quite a while.  They decided to have a show of work.  Many people visited the school just to see what this show of work meant.  I may say that they went home very surprised people when they saw what was done in those schools. <Col N="320" /> After that, classes in these schools became more popular because people began to realise what a very useful purpose these schools serve, whether the children attend the day classes or the evening classes.</P>
    <P>The position now is that there is an all-round demand for vocational education throughout the country to supplement the primary education. That demand is there and it cannot be denied.  In my county, all the domestic economy instructresses, bar one, are pupils of our own schools. That is no mean achievement.  In addition, several of our pupils have been appointed under other vocational committees throughout the country.  A five-roomed school was built about 20 years ago.  It has proved completely inadequate to meet the needs of the locality and another building is now being erected there.  It is not so much that it is a big town as that the majority of the pupils come from the rural areas surrounding the district.  That shows that the advantages afforded by the rural science teacher have been availed of.</P>
    <P>The unfortunate thing is that rural science teachers are in short supply at the moment and I suppose the reason is that conditions under the Department of Agriculture are better and we are unable to induce them to come into the service of vocational education when they can do better under another Department.  That is natural.  There is also the consideration that work is much free under the Department, because they work so many hours and are then finished, while the rural science teacher has night classes all through the winter and so has not very much time to enjoy the recreation which he considers he is as much entitled to enjoy as people employed in other capacities.</P>
    <P>The branches of the I.C.A. are always very helpful in seeing that the domestic economy end is kept up. They use the schools for meeting people and in that way a definite contact is maintained.  While that state of affairs continues, vocational education can never fail.  If there were any doubts in the minds of people as to <Col N="321" /> what vocational education can do and what its value is likely to be, they should be dispelled by the great interest which Dr. Alfred O'Rahilly of Cork University has taken in it and is still taking in it.  He is an authority who will be accepted by everybody, not merely at home but internationally. He has shown his interest in it in relation to the social science courses which have been established.</P>
    <P>One of these courses has just been completed; a second is in its second year and another was started this year.  If more money were available, there would probably be more of these courses which show the value of this form of education and what it can lead to.  It is only in its infancy, but if we get the foundation right by making the best use we can of the child coming out from school, we can, as time goes on, develop more and more the system of instruction for adults which will be to their advantage.</P>
    <P>We must remember also that the vocational school has been a very useful means of saving the language, because it has afforded an opportunity to children on leaving school to continue their studies of the language in the night or day classes.  The spirit of the Gaelic League permeated all these schools in their origin, because the pioneers who worked in the old days of the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction all came over into the service of the vocational committees under what we call the original Act, and in that way the true spirit of the pioneering days of the Gaelic League was brought in.  These schools have proved very useful in enabling students to continue the language by making sure of the holding of classes in a great number of centres where timthirí, or persons competent to teach Irish, are employed.</P>
    <P>They are employed in most of the schools in my county with very good results and any move for an extension of this work will be well received by everybody because the demand is widespread. We have demands for schools here, there and everywhere else, and, while the Department are most sympathetic and help in every way possible in getting more schools built, I want to <Col N="322" /> point out that there is a greater necessity at the moment for the speeding up of the training of teachers.  If this is not done, there will be schools which will be under-staffed, and an under-staffed school cannot be expected to give results.  I specially appeal to the Minister to give consideration to those branches of vocational education in which the shortage is most acute.</P>
    <P>So far as domestic economy instructresses are concerned, it is very hard to get them trained fast enough. Whether it is that their cooking makes men regard them as good hunting or not, I do not know, but five years is about the average time they stay with most committees.  In the case of some of the other teachers, such as the woodwork men, they are barely able to meet the demands of the committees, and there are some committees who are holding on to men in the hope of a new batch of teachers coming out.  The Minister cannot get a lot done in a day or a week, I admit, but I make a special appeal to him, as a member of a committee for a number of years, to give serious consideration to the great necessity at the moment for more and more trainees, because, as I say, with the present rapid provision of schools we are going to find some of our schools under-staffed.  In Limerick, we have found trouble in keeping our own staffs up, and we have plans on foot for more schools and extensions to existing schools, so that if trainees continue to be turned out at the present rate, we will be facing a position&mdash;and the same is true of every other committee&mdash;in which we will have schools which are not fully staffed.  I know the interest the Minister takes in vocational education, and I do not wish my remarks to be taken as anything but helpful criticism.  I hope he will succeed in having trainees ready to jump into the breach when a new school opens in any area of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentMcHugh" hpid="Mr. McHugh Mr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the introduction of this Bill, which I consider is long overdue. It will help in some way to enable vocational committees to extend the extremely valuable work they are doing and have been doing for a long <Col N="323" /> number of years.  The Minister is, perhaps, in a better position than anyone else to appreciate the work of these committees.  He has seen quite recently in my county of Clare a sample of what an energetic committee with an energetic chairman can do. He has seen the opening of an addition to a school in Ennis, and, a few weeks after, an addition to a school in Kilrush.  The committee in Clare are hoping to begin work in the near future on a new school in Ennistymon.</P>
      <P>Our committee in Clare are working under tremendous handicaps by reason of the size of the county&mdash;I think the county is the sixth largest in Éire&mdash; and by reason of the poverty of the vast majority of the people in West Clare.  They are suffering also from the apathy which existed in the early days of the old technical instruction system.  As everybody knows, there was a considerable amount of apathy in various quarters at that time and, in Clare, we suffered a lot from it and we are suffering at present from that early apathy.  A lot of work remains to be done in Clare, and, I am sure, will be done, with the co-operation and goodwill of the Minister and his Department.</P>
      <P>As the Seanad is aware, the revenue of these vocational committees is derived, first, from the rating authority; secondly, from the grant given by the Department based on the old system of grants in relation to attendance at classes and so on; and thirdly, the revenue comes from slightly less than £ for £ grant given by the Department also.  Due entirely to the small grants paid originally in Clare, the Clare Vocational Education Committee have for a long number of years been unable to develop their scheme in any way sufficient to meet the demands of the county.  The reason for that is the apathy which existed a good many years ago at the beginning of this scheme.  The present committee are is no way whatsoever to be blamed for the apathy which existed long before their time and under which they are suffering now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Clare the vocational committee <Col N="324" /> could only develop on a very restricted basis and for a long number of years they were handicapped also by a heavy overdraft in the bank. This overdraft was only wiped out last year.  The Committee were seeking sanction to build another school and I understand that the Department refused the committee sanction because of their bad financial position.  The committee got over that financial position and the objection by skimping and scraping in various ways.  They refused all kinds of applications for classes, part-time teachers and extra teachers. That type of economy is not desirable and has often very bad effects.  In this case, however, it had the result of reducing the overdraft to such an extent that now the Department has sanctioned the building of the new school in Ennistymon.</P>
    <P>That, of course, creates other problems&mdash;problems of maintenance, staffing, heating, lighting and various things like that.  At the moment the committee find that they can barely get along with the commitments they now have on their present finances.  It is extremely doubtful, unless they get some new source of revenue, if they will be able to run the projected new school in Ennistymon, together with the other schools, on a proper basis, maintain the schools properly and staff them properly.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill the revenue can be increased.  It may be increased from 9d. in the £ to 15d. in the £.  It may be increased if the rating authority are agreeable.  In other words, if Clare County Council see fit to sanction the grant to the vocational education committee. But the Clare County Council like every other county council, have their difficulties.  They have in the past granted to the vocational education committee the maximum grant but it is extremely doubtful, having regard to the present financial position, if they would see their way entirely to give to the vocational education commitee the maximum grant to which they would be entitled under this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is obvious, therefore, that Clare cannot benefit to the maximum extent which the Bill would appear to indicate it may benefit.  Many counties <Col N="325" /> with higher valuations than Clare get much higher grants.  In fact, I understand that some of these counties have not even yet approached their local rating authority for the maximum rate which they can receive from the local authority.  In County Clare we have been on our maximum grant for a number of years.  The counties which received the higher grants from the Department and which have not yet asked their rating authority for the maximum rate are the very counties which really do not require vocational education to the extent we do in the West.</P>
    <P>For instance, many of the richer counties which receive these higher grants have the benefits of secondary schools.  In some of these areas there are seven and eight colleges and some of them enjoy the benefits of university education.  It is those counties which really benefit from departmental grants for vocational education.  In fact, they do not require these grants as badly as the western counties.</P>
    <P>The average rate per acre in Clare is only 8/9.  That is the sixth lowest in the entire country.  The area covered by the Clare Vocational Education Committee is the sixth largest in the country.  It appears obvious to me at any rate&mdash;I am sure it must also be obvious to the Minister&mdash;that no matter what increase there may be in the ordinary revenue which the committee receives they can never hope, on their present scale of finance, or even with the hope of a larger revenue as a result of the Bill, to deal with all the applications they have already for courses and extra teachers, not to speak of attempting to enlarge the scope of their scheme.  They will never be in a position to bring the benefits of vocational education to the entire county.</P>
    <P>The county is a long, widespread county.  It is very poor and has very bad roads.  It is impossible for any county situated as is the County Clare to ever hope to be able to cope with all the applications for courses.  The Minister stated here and in the Dáil that the Counties Kerry, Galway, Sligo, Mayo, Donegal and Leitrim will be <Col N="326" /> given increased grants on a certain basis.  I cannot understand why the Minister, travelling from Kerry all along the western coast, left out the County Clare.  Some case must have been made for leaving the County Clare out.  I do not know what that case might be.  The case might have been made that the finances of the County Clare were such that it did not require any increased grants but, of course, that is nonsense.</P>
    <P>Obviously, a county which is one of the largest in area&mdash;and it ranks sixth per acre in valuation&mdash;cannot be in any sound financial position to cope with vocational education the demands for which are increasing daily.  It is obvious to me, in any case&mdash;perhaps it may not be so obvious to the Minister &mdash;that if one travels from Kerry to Donegal, through Galway, Sligo and Mayo, there must be some reason why Clare was passed over.  I suggest that the Minister should reconsider the matter and include Clare in that list of counties.  Funny enough, the valuation per head of the population in Clare is the sixth lowest in the county.  It is lower than either Sligo or Longford and yet those counties are included in the list of counties to which the Minister is prepared to give increased grants.</P>
    <P>In justice and in fairness, he should include my county in that scheme. Unless Clare Vocational Committee obtain some relief they can never hope to extend or even improve the present system of vocational education which they are operating.  I am quite sure the Minister, being a reasonable man and having been appealed to by Senator Ashe, who is also a member of the Clare Vocational Education Committee, will reconsider his decision and include Clare in that list of seven counties which are being given increased grants.</P>

      <P>I welcome this measure very much; in fact, I may say that it is seldom there is a measure before this House for which I have such regard.  The reason is that I see in this Bill that power is being given to the vocational committees to raise more money through the rating authority.  I am a member of the <Col N="327" /> vocational committee in my own county of Leitrim and that committee has always levied the maximum amount on the rating authority with a view to giving effect to the various schemes they have planned.</P>
      <P>Implicit also in the measure is the power being taken by the Minister to make it possible for him to extend the amount of the grant that can be given to committees in order to allow them to give effect to their schemes.  Whereas the sting, so to speak, in the Bill is expressly stated, the good side of it is hidden in sub-section (2) of Section 1.  I remember making a case to the Minister and to officials of his Department on this question&mdash;and I used to refer to it as the 30/- £&mdash;that in counties like Leitrim where you had a very low poor law valuation and very high commitments for vocational education, the basic grant of £1 for £1 should be departed from and something in excess of £1 should be given. I do not know if we were the first to make that case but I was not aware at the time that any measure of success had been achieved on the line of a 30/- £, if I might use my own phrase. I am glad to see the Minister is taking power to this effect and that it will be possible in certain cases to go even further than 30/- for every £ provided locally by the rating authority.  I understand it cannot exceed £2.</P>
      <P>Senator McHugh showed that he had some actual working knowledge of vocational education but I might remind him that the Minister has not excluded Clare from this Bill.  If and when there is a case for an increased grant in County Clare, having regard to the prevailing poor law valuation position and having regard to the other facts, I am quite prepared to believe that the Minister will not be unkind in his attitude towards increasing grants in respect of that county because I do know the Minister has his heart and soul in vocational education.</P>

      <P>Generally in this country.  This Bill may be regarded as <Col N="328" /> the coming of age of vocational education in Ireland.  It is about 21 years since it was put on its present footing and it is grand to see this progressive measure being brought in by the Minister at this time, because it will indicate to people who believe in vocational education that it has passed its growing pains and birth pains.</P>
      <P>This legislation will make it possible for counties that have a very low taxable capacity to give the type of service they would like to give.  The experience has been that counties like Donegal, Mayo, Leitrim and Sligo, with a very low poor law valuation, cannot possibly, under the present scheme of things, give the same kind of service as, say, a county like Meath. I understand that 1d. in the £ in County Meath would raise £2,400.  A 1d. in the £ in County Leitrim will raise £600.  Since the vocational committee in Meath could levy the same amount on the rating authority as County Leitrim, it would be quite impossible for a county situated economically like Leitrim to give the same service and spend the same amount of money.</P>
      <P>The tragedy is that the counties where vocational education was most needed were the counties that could not raise enough money by way of grant.  It is a fact that the counties with the higher poor law valuation are the counties in which you have more institutions for the provision of secondary education, whereas the counties with the lower poor law valuation have not the same volume of secondary educational facilities.  Comparisons are odious, but I cannot help making a comparison.  I do not know the number of secondary schools in County Meath, but I know there is only one boarding-school for girls in Leitrim, and some day-schools of a secondary type.  The position is different in Meath.  That would indicate there is greater need for vocational education in Leitrim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not the doubts or fears that have been expressed by some members of the House.  This measure will be the coming of age of vocational education, particularly in the counties where it is most needed.  I have listened to <Col N="329" /> suggestions as to how it should be planned in certain areas.  Senator O'Donnell has dealt with Dublin.  I am not an authority on that and could not say whether he is right or not.  I am prepared to argue that in rural areas the type of education which should be given is a post-primary course to both boys and girls.  If they do not get that in the vocational schools they will not get it anywhere else.  In the case of boys it should include manual instruction, building instruction and rural science as technical subjects.  In the case of girls it should include domestic science. Without a post-primary general course vocational education would not be fulfilling its proper function in congested districts.  If you have not a continuation course, those in congested districts cannot lead as full a life as they should.</P>
    <P>Some reference has been made to people leaving this country.  The function of vocational education in rural areas should be to teach the boys who remain at home on the farm rural science.  It is the sad fact that for a long time people have been leaving the congested districts and there is no real sign of that stopping completely.  Even if they do leave, surely vocational education committees have some responsibility to ensure that they have a good education, so that they will not be regarded as hewers of wood and drawers of water in a foreign country?  I had some experience outside this country for a short time and I found it sad to see men from one's own area employed in the most menial tasks, because they did not get a chance of education before they left.  I am not suggesting we should plan our scheme with a bias in favour of educating people to leave the country. I have not suggested that&mdash;lest I be misinterpreted in any way.</P>
    <P>On the question of co-operation between the advisory service of the agricultural committees and the rural science courses of the vocational committees, I am satisfied that good work is being done, but I wonder if there is that measure of co-operation there should be.  When the Vocational Education Act was passed, the agricultural and technical branches were <Col N="330" /> separated.  I often wonder if there is not the same outlook on the part of some people, that they want to behave as in the story of the two mothers who brought the child to Solomon.  There is such a vast amount of work to be done in regard to both rural science and vocational education that it would not be proper for anyone to behave as the two mothers who brought the child to Solomon.</P>
    <P>There has been some criticism of the cost of vocational education.  It is worth while spending money on education so long as we are travelling on the right lines.  Has it occurred to anyone to make a comparison between the cost of primary education and vocational education in rural areas?  I cannot give figures for any area, but I suggest there should be some ratio between the expenditure on these things in areas where there is no alternative education.</P>
    <P>This Bill seems to mark the coming of age of vocational education.  That being so, I want to pay a tribute to the officers of the Department who have grown grey in the service of vocational education and who, I suppose, are coming to the stage where they will be retiring.  My colleagues in Leitrim and myself know that the officers of the Department were not just mere civil servants, mere officers of the Department; they were much more than that.  On all occasions we regarded them as philosopher and friend.  I feel I must pay them that tribute now and, in conclusion, I welcome the measure very much.</P>

      <P>Our vocational education committee often is in difficulty as to who is in authority.  We know we have authority to appoint a teacher and to assign teachers to different schools.  On several occasions we found that teachers were not satisfied in their positions.  We know that is bad for the committee and for the school.  If we have authority to change such a teacher.  I should like to have that assurance from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We often have trouble about stocktaking. There is a tendency on the part of teachers to shirk the job of stocktaking another teacher's school. If some method could be devised <Col N="331" /> whereby we could get a local teacher or a local stocktaker who is recognised to be a capable man to undertake such work it would be a good thing for the harmony of the schools in general.</P>
    <P>Lately, we had a case of teachers being admitted to teach without having the necessary qualifications in Irish. We had some sharp criticism of the Department for allowing that to happen.  I understand that the excuse is the lack of teachers but at this stage of our national development I think that every man who is qualified at all should be qualified in Irish as well.</P>
    <P>We have just one other little problem and that is the matter of special allowances.  We have special classes in Kilkenny for a secretarial diploma and we can find only one local man to do the job.  He started off at 8/6 an hour but now he wants 15/-, or so, an hour.  I should like to know if the Department has any rules limiting the rate of pay in respect of those special classes.  Of course, the majority of the teachers receive the usual rates of pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Hayes that vocational schools should be essentially trade schools directed to the teaching of certain skills.  It is not, however, possible to confine them solely to such activities.  Somebody mentioned the Danish high schools which were really responsible for the change in economic conditions in Denmark. These schools were not directed towards the exclusive instruction of skills.  Rather, they developed a patriotic outlook in the people&mdash; an understanding that the country was theirs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I agree that we should be concerned mostly with the development of skills in the vocational schools, we can not afford to neglect the other aspect which is the driving force behind the schools.  Senator Hayes has been rather surprised at the lack of knowledge amongst townspeople, even village people of conditions in rural Ireland.  Maybe Senator Hayes is not himself familiar with these conditions. One of the reasons why people in small towns have very little knowledge of <Col N="332" /> rural life and of conditions on the land is that they were completely cut off from the land.  In my young days, every small town&mdash;in good land, of course&mdash;was surrounded by estates where it was a crime and a misdemeanour if anybody put his foot inside the wall.  With the disappearance of the landlord, that disparity was not removed.  The farmer who got the land was as much an opponent of any trespass by a man who lived in a village as any landlord.</P>

      <P>B'fhéidir.  I think that the idea of a folk museum is good.  Our people should have a clear grip of the general background of their social history.  I believe that it will be useless to try to teach them Irish and to try to create the national background that is necessary for the development of Irish if we cannot provide a folk museum.  I should like every support that can be given to be given to such a project.  I presume we could have exhibits in the various vocational schools, but I do not think we could compare with Norway or Sweden in our exhibits.</P>
      <P>As well as being deprived of land&mdash; I always seem to be talking about landlords&mdash;our people were deprived of skills.  Actually skill of this type was completely urban.  I remember the tools that my very near ancestors worked with on farms and in workshops. My God, they were crude and very poor.  In my view, it would be wise to collect these types of tools and to exhibit them.  We should collect everything connected with our past for a folk museum because the National Museum is not fitted for that purpose and neither is an historical museum.  I think it would be a good thing if we developed that suggestion and tried to have something of that nature exhibited in the vocational schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Naturally, Senator Hayes is deeply concerned with the welfare of university graduates.  He says that we ought to have them as teachers of Irish in <Col N="333" /> our vocational schools.  Quite a number of university graduates are teaching under the vocational system but, strangely enough, we have not been able to get university graduates to teach Irish.  It is because of the lack of graduates that another system had to be adopted to secure teachers of Irish.  I am not satisfied that the standards are often good enough in any sphere but one particular sphere in which we should have graduates is in the teaching of rural science.  We have not ever been able to get sufficient teachers.</P>
    <P>Some people have expressed doubts about the future.  Senator O'Reilly has no doubts.  I am not clear of them. Many committees, naturally, have ambitions to build schools and to provide for the demands made on them. There is no good in building a school unless you can provide in it courses which are valuable, considering the district in which the school is located. I do not think it right that, if people demand certain courses, they should not have them&mdash;even shorthand and typewriting in the country&mdash;but it is something that should not be stressed. Our farmers, except in certain places we know, are quite industrious and have, from their experience, a sound knowledge of their trade, but farming systems have been revolutionised in recent years.  There is much greater knowledge of farming available nowadays and I think that the vocational school has a great part to play in the development of agriculture.  That is where I have my principal hope.</P>
    <P>Our most important economic occupation and activity is the point at which we can have the greatest development and we should try to get it there, but we are not able to get as many rural science teachers as we should, nor are we able to get as many woodwork teachers as we should, because carpenters, even in terms of unemployment, are paid more nowadays than we can afford to pay teachers.  In the same way, good metal workers can make a great deal more outside the vocational system than they can make inside it.  There is, of course, the settled position and the pension, and it possibly is a far better position than that occupied by the <Col N="334" /> ordinary worker outside, but the man getting more money at present outside is not going to view the future in that fashion.  My one fear is that we might try to rush the building of schools without being able to equip them properly with teachers.</P>
    <P>It was stated here that vocational teaching is not popular amongst potential teachers, but except, in so far as these teachers are tradesmen who can get better pay outside, I do not find that difficulty.  I think we can get sufficient teachers, and, comparatively with other teachers, I think we are dealing reasonably with vocational teachers in regard to pay and general conditions.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter asked if our approach to vocational education is the proper approach.  That is a question we should be always asking ourselves. Even though there have been developments and progress in vocational education, if we utilised this Bill to the very fullest, the condition we would then create would reveal the fact that vocational education at present is in its infancy and, therefore, we should not decide right now what the final form of vocational education will be.  There must be a certain amount of empiricism and we must learn from experience as we go and be prepared to change.</P>
    <P>Senator P. O'Reilly said he is not an authority on certain subjects.  I thought he was an authority on every subject.  I do not like comparisons between primary education and vocational education.  Primary education is doing its job, and any idea of cutting the amount being spent on primary education for the benefit of vocational education, is something to which I would not agree.  There is, however, the difficulty that children coming to the vocational school are not as well equipped as they might be to accept the knowledge that can be given to them there and very often that is because of a poor attendance at the primary school.  The child is kept away from school one day or two or three days a week on any excuse, and when a parent decides to send the child to the vocational school, the child must immediately develop into a genius.  If the groundwork has not been laid in <Col N="335" /> the primary school, the work in the vocational school will not be successful.</P>
    <P>Lecture groups were mentioned during the discussion.  One of the very valuable developments in the vocational schools is the discussion group &mdash;not formal education but a general direction by the teacher and a general discussion of some social problem or some aspect of agriculture.  Like the gentleman in France who did not know he was talking prose all his life, many men have a good deal of knowledge unknown to themselves, knowledge which only displays itself when they discuss matters with others.  That is an aspect of vocational education which is having very valuable results.</P>
    <P>I believe in vocational education.  I think we can make a job of it, but we must be watchful in what we are doing and must not be entirely without doubts that everything is right and on the up and up.  We must direct vocational education, so far as we can, to the development of skills in and knowledge of the fundamental economic system with which we are associated.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this small but rather complicated Bill is twofold; first, to authorise the detention in mental institutions of certain patients who, in the light of a recent judicial decision, appear to be illegally detained because of defects in the reception procedure, and second, to correct technical omissions in the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, which have created serious <Col N="336" /> difficulties in the machinery for the provision of institutional treatment for mental patients.</P>
      <P>In <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings which were recently before the High Court, a temporary patient in a mental institution was discharged by order of the court on the ground that the reception order on which the patient was detained was not properly made.  I should mention in this connection that in the case of a chargeable patient of unsound mind as distinct from a temporary patient received in a district mental hospital the Act expressly provides that any medical officer acting on behalf of the resident medical superintendent may make the reception order, and it had been understood that another medical officer could also sign a reception order in respect of a temporary patient.  The High Court has, however, ruled in effect that no person other than the person in charge&mdash; in a district mental hospital the resident medical superintendent&mdash;can make a reception order for a temporary patient; that any such order made by a person other than the person in charge is void and of no effect, and that the detention of a patient in pursuance of such an order is illegal.</P>
      <P>Reception orders in respect of a considerable number of temporary patients in mental institutions have, in fact, been made by officers other than the person in charge.  The position is that these patients are medically unfit for discharge and must be detained for their own safety or the safety of the public.  A number of them are actively or potentially suicidal; others are undergoing treatment the interruption of which might have serious consequences, and still others would constitute a public danger if discharged. It is urgently necessary, therefore, to give authority for their detention and the necessary provision for the purpose is being made in Section 3 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In district mental hospitals particularly, having regard to the size and population of the institutions and the wide range of duties developing on the resident medical superintendent, it would obviously be impractical for that officer to sign all reception orders at <Col N="337" /> all times or, indeed, to perform in person all the duties assigned to him under the Mental Treatment Act.  Provision is accordingly being made in Section 3 of the Bill to enable the powers and duties of the resident medical superintendent in his capacity as the person in charge, or chief medical officer, or resident medical superintendent to be exercised or performed by any other medical officer of the institution authorised by the mental hospital authority.  Similar provision is being made also in respect of private mental institutions.</P>
    <P>The judgment of the High Court also revealed that the arrangements for the reception of a temporary patient are defective in another respect.  There is no authority under the Act for the removal of a patient to hospital when the medical certificate, which must accompany the application for a reception order, has been signed.  It is essential that authority for this purpose should be given in urgent cases and provision for the purpose is included in Section 5.</P>
    <P>The remaining provisions of the Bill are designed to correct two obvious defects in the Act which have given rise to serious difficulties.  Section 2 of the Bill is intended to correct an anomaly in Section 5 of the Act of 1945 so as to enable the nearest available dispensary medical officer to act for the dispensary medical officer in a district where there is only one such officer where the latter is not available.</P>
    <P>At present there is no power to have a patient received as a temporary patient if he is outside his mental hospital district at the time urgent hospital treatment is required.  Section 4 of the Bill will remedy this position.</P>
    <P>The authorisation of the detention of patients whose reception was irregular is a matter of great urgency and I ask the House to agree that the Bill be passed through all stages to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is a sensible measure and one which, on the recital of the facts given by the Minister, <Col N="338" /> is necessary.  For that reason, I have no doubt that the House will facilitate him in getting the Bill through quickly because it is one of urgency.  I think it is right once more from these benches to raise some protest against this kind of thing happening time and time again to the Seanad. I do not know if the Minister for Health realises it, but practically every day the Seanad meets some Minister of the Government comes in here and makes an excuse as to why the Bill is coming before the Seanad at short notice and makes a case for the Seanad giving all stages of the Bill.  In cases of genuine urgency, it is probably unknown for the Seanad to refuse a Minister these facilities, but I think it is right to say that some of us in these benches are perturbed by the frequency with which these requests are being made.  If the Seanad is to perform a serious function, it should be treated seriously by the Government and adequate time for consideration and discussion of these measures should be given.  I want to make it clear again that those remarks do not apply to this particular Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has been occasioned because of a technical flaw, if you like, in the earlier Act, and the amendments which the Minister is proposing to introduce by means of this Bill governing admission and retention in mental hospitals are amendments which I personally think are very desirable.  Probably most of us, from time to time&mdash;certainly those of us in the legal profession&mdash;have come up against situations in which we can visualise the very grave difficulties that would be encountered if the law, as it stands at present, by virtue of a court decision were allowed to remain unaltered.  Probably, every day of the week the medical staff of mental hospitals are confronted with problems which must be dealt with in a hurry.  If by reason of the existing legislation, it is to become necessary for a particular officer and no one else to sign admission orders or discharge orders, I can see the situation would be quite impossible.  Sections 3, 4 and 5 of the present Bill propose very common-sense amendments of the <Col N="339" /> existing legislation, amendments which I think will be accepted by the House and I believe we should give the Minister this particular Bill in all its stages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRuane" hpid="Mr. S.T. Ruane Mr. S.T. Ruane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it this Bill has some connection with another Mental Treatment Bill of which many Senators will have a recollection of having gone through the House several years ago, the provisions of which led many of us to believe that something very novel, revolutionary and beneficial was about to be introduced into the country in the method of treatment for mental illness.  Many of us were led to believe at the time that dispensary doctors in the different districts would have clinics at which cases in the early stages of mental trouble might obtain treatment and that there would be specialised treatment afforded at the various mental hospitals.  I do know that specialised treatment is carried on in some of the hospitals and with good effect now but I have not heard of any case&mdash;and doctors from time to time are confidential with some public or local representatives&mdash;that had been treated at a local dispensary.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to be ruled out of order but let me say that as a result of specialised treatment in institutions big bills are coming before the local bodies for special clinics.  As a matter of fact, one was before the Mayo County Council less than a week ago which, carried by a majority of the council, will involve the county in expenditure to the extent of £60,000 for establishing a clinic.  I have no objection to this Bill going through but I think it might be opportune to take the Minister's mind back to the particular occasion on which the last Bill was passed, and get information as to what progress, if any, has been made in this particular trouble.  Some of us have not seen the benefits flowing from that Bill that at the time we expected would flow from it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been told that this Bill, which is an effort to modify and make more rational the Mental Treatment Act of 1945, was necessary because of a recent <Col N="340" /> case in the High Court whereby a patient who was detained as a temporary patient in a mental hospital was discharged for the reason that the reception order under which he was detained was not properly executed.  We have been told that the decision of the High Court has drawn attention to the defects in the Act.</P>
      <P>I received a copy of this Bill yesterday. I have not had an opportunity of studying it very thoroughly or of studying the Act itself, but from a rather quick persual of the Bill and of the Act I can see that the original Act contains a great number of anomalies. At the time when the Act was drafted in 1945 the Minister and his Department I am quite sure had ample opportunity of consulting someone and seeking advice from people who would be in a position to tell them the best way of drafting a difficult Bill of that kind.  There are plenty of people in this country associated with mental disease in one way or another, either professionally or on the lay board of some of these hospitals and, therefore, very familiar with the requirements. Whether the Minister at that time did seek their advice I do not know.  If having sought the advice he followed it or not I do not know.  I do know that during the past eight years I have heard this Act discussed on several occasions in medical circles and I know that a number of doctors associated with the treatment of mental disease have been very perturbed and worried about it.  I have been told by them that they made protests to the Department of Health in writing on several occasions and asked to have certain amendments and regulations altered and that nothing has happened.  It was not until some legal person saw the defect in the Act and applied in the High Court to have a patient discharged that anything was done about it.  The Act has been in force for eight years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, I have had very little opportunity of reading this Bill but I am sure the Minister will correct me if I am wrong in the points I am about to put.  As a result of this Act and the way it was drafted and the numerous anomalies it contains it is not only one patient that was detained <Col N="341" /> illegally.  I believe that the number runs into 2,000, and for that reason this Bill is urgently necessary and, therefore, I give it my support.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that the whole Act requires re-drafting and I hope that the Minister when he has an opportunity will introduce an amending Bill and alter the whole thing.  I think the idea behind it is very good, but it has been so badly drawn and it is so full of mistakes and errors that it is likely to lead to a great deal of trouble.  In this Act you have classified three types of patient.  There is the voluntary patient who goes voluntarily into a mental hospital for treatment.</P>

      <P>I will not be very long.  I do not think I can explain very thoroughly unless Senators understand what a temporary patient is.  The main object of the Bill is to change the method of admission of a temporary patient.  A temporary patient is one looked upon as being ill only for a short period of time and who, after some treatment, will be cared.  The other person is a permanent patient, looked upon as a person of unsound mind and likely to be detained for some time.  The trouble about the amending Bill is that it does not go far enough to change the old regulations.  The difficulty is about admitting a temporary patient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A temporary patient is admitted on an order signed by the dispensary doctor.  The order is then sent to the <Col N="342" /> hospital and the medical superintendent has to sign it.  That has been the difficulty.  The change being introduced now is that it may be signed in the hospital by anybody who represents the medical superintendent &mdash;for instance while the medical superintendent is absent on holidays. Under the amendment, authority may be given to any properly qualified person who deputies for him.  We have the difficulty that the dispensary doctor also may be absent.  Under the Act, if he is absent it cannot be signed.  Under the new amendment, if he is absent, the nearest dispensary doctor may sign the document.  To my mind, that is not a very wise arrangement. The nearest dispensary doctor may be 15 or 20 miles away and there might be great delay searching for him.  I suggest to the Minister that in the absence of the dispensary doctor for the district any registered medical practitioner should be allowed to sign. That would save a great deal of time.</P>
    <P>In the case of a patient of unsound mind, the permanent type of patient, the certificate can be signed by the dispensary doctor and the patient sent to the hospital without the medical superintendent signing any document.  He is examined on admission.  I cannot understand why there is a difference between the two types.  One has to be signed for by the medical superintendent of the hospital or his deputy before he even sees the patient, but in the other case the person of unsound mind is sent to the hospital on the order of the dispensary doctor or whosoever deputises for him.  That means that the admission of a person as a permanent patient is very much easier than the admission of a temporary patient.  That has not been changed in this new Bill.  Therefore, the tendency is, if you are going to have a difficulty in getting a person into a mental hospital, to certify him as a permanent patient.  It is very much easier.  If you want him to go as a temporary patient, you have to get someone to take the certificate to the doctor who may be a long distance away and then get it signed by the medical superintendent and then bring it back again.</P>
    <P>Some of these cases are very urgent <Col N="343" /> ones, and when the dispensary medical officer is absent I think the nearest doctor should be allowed to sign, as in acute cases, maternity cases and so on, where if the dispensary doctor is not available you may get the nearest medical doctor.  Mental disease should be treated on the same lines.  These acute cases are very important.  There is the protection of the patient himself; he may be suicidal.  Secondly, there is the protection of persons around who may be attacked.  Thirdly, a very important point, which has not been mentioned, there is the importance of very early treatment of these patients.</P>
    <P>Therefore, any legislation brought in with regard to the admission of any patient with any mental illness to a hospital should be done in the easiest and quickest way possible.</P>
    <P>Another point I want to make in this connection is that a dispensary doctor or any doctor in any kind of practice outside the practice of mental diseases is not the competent person to certify whether a person is a temporary patient or a permanent patient. That is a matter that should be decided only by those who are competent to do so, i.e., those people who are accustomed to and who are constantly dealing with mental illness.</P>
    <P>A person may be mentally ill&mdash;he may be extremely ill for a time&mdash;but he may be curable.  Very often, these people in mental hospitals are unable to decide when they first see a patient, and they may be unable to decide even at the end of the first week and sometimes even at the end of a month whether the patient will be temporary or permanent.  I think it should be left entirely to the medical officers in these mental hospitals to reach the proper diagnosis.  I do not think anybody else is competent to do so.</P>
    <P>In my view, all patients with mental illness should be sent to hospital, just as other patients are, and examined and observed and treated there until the doctors can come to a conclusion as to how long exactly the patient must be detained.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of payment between the hospitals.  Suppose <Col N="344" /> a person happens to be up in Dublin for a holiday and becomes mentally deranged and is admitted to hospital, even though he happens to belong to another part of the country.  If he is admitted as a temporary patient to a mental hospital in Dublin then his local county council will not pay for him, but if he is admitted as a permanent patient then they will pay for him.  To my mind, it seems absurd if you have a question as to whether he is a permanent patient or a temporary patient.  Why should a permanent patient not be paid for and a temporary patient not be paid for?  It is very important that any patient should get urgent treatment immediately. If he gets treatment and is cured, it is all to the good.  Why refuse to pay for him?  The other procedure would be to take him back to his own county by ambulance or some other method of conveyance and then, if it is found that he cannot get the treatment which he requires in his own hospital, he is sent back to Dublin for the necessary treatment.  There is far too much red tape involved.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is introducing an amending Bill I trust that he will go a little further than he went in the present Bill to try to put mental disease of any kind on the same footing as any other type of disease and to treat it in that way.  No matter what type his mental illness may be, the patient should be sent to a mental hospital and he should be sent there on the order of any doctor, if necessary, and if the relatives are not satisfied he should be given the power of having a second opinion.  The patient should be sent to hospital for diagnosis and treatment&mdash;and sent in, in the first instance, either as a temporary or as a permanent patient.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I thing these silly anomalies about the payments between county councils and hospitals should be removed.  They cause a great deal of embarrassment.  A person may wrongly be certified as a permanent patient in order that the county council may be compelled to pay for him.</P>

      <P>I approve of this Bill.  I think that the Minister should <Col N="345" /> be given the Second Reading this evening. I was very interested in Senator Cunningham's contribution to this debate, particularly as he is a medical man.  I should like to hear the Minister enlarge on this matter of non-payment in respect of a temporary patient and payment in respect of a permanent patient.  If Senator Cunningham is right in what he has said, I think the Minister should give this House some information on that matter.</P>
      <P>I should like also to be informed of the full implications of Section 5 of the Bill which relates to Sections 184 and 185 of the principal Act.  As I have indicated, I approve of the Bill and I think that the Minister should be given the Second Reading this evening.  I understand, however, that it is expected that the Minister will be given all stages this evening.  I want to protest that it is unreasonable to ask this House so frequently&mdash;even with a good case&mdash;to give all stages of Bills without fully considering them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have just heard Senator Cunningham's contribution to this debate.  I must say that, having heard it, I feel more strongly than I did previously that this Bill should not be given all stages this evening.  I feel that we should give the Bill more careful consideration and that if we had time to do so we might perhaps prepare amendments.  The position is becoming really ridiculous in regard to the manner with which we deal with Bills, all stages in the one day, without giving them any detailed consideration. So bad has the position become that last evening it was announced from Radio Éireann that the Dáil had passed all stages of the Mental Treatment Bill&mdash;and Radio Éireann, knowing its Seanad, then announced that &ldquo;the Bill will be put through the Seanad to-morrow.&rdquo;  If such an organisation, from its knowledge of our speedy methods&mdash;to put it euphemistically&mdash;can say that a Bill will be put through the Seanad on the following day, it speaks very badly for the Seanad.  It speaks badly that we should have the reputation that a Bill has merely to be given to us to be passed here without detailed consideration. Thinking on it again, it is quite <Col N="346" /> a serious matter.  Radio Éireann is, apparently, an organisation in the control of which there is no Minister. The Minister whom we might think to be in control of that organisation has indicated that he cannot deal with domestic matters there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am quite satisfied also that it is not the Minister's fault that the Bill was not introduced in the Dáil earlier.  He has made a very good case for urgency.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>One would expect that the case made against the giving of all stages of the Bill this evening by Senator O'Reilly would be a better one, in view of his position.  He based his argument on a statement which he said was made from Radio Éireann that, because of the speedy passage of the Bill through the Dáil, and its urgency, this House would act as sensibly as the Dáil in a matter of this kind and give the Minister all the stages to-day.</P>
      <P>At the outset, the Minister pointed out the urgency which gave rise to the introduction of this Bill.  So far as I have read the Bill, I have not seen any provision in relation to the matters raised by Senator Cunningham.  He raised the question of payment by county councils for patients, whether permanent or temporary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is a simple measure designed to legalise a form of admission to and retention in a mental hospital and it arises out of an action in the High Court.  That is all that <Col N="347" /> the Bill contains.  Senator O'Reilly knows, as well as I do if not more so, that it is not within his province or the province of any member of this House to amend the Bill in the way in which he wishes because the Bill does not relate to the matters which he raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must apologise to the Seanad for bringing this Bill in at such short notice, but I should like to point out that the Dáil, which usually takes a considerable time to deal with Bills, realising the urgency of the Bill, put it through all stages in one day&mdash;in fact, on the day after it was introduced, although Bills are usually introduced for some time before they are discussed. In my opening speech, I asked the Seanad to deal with it as expeditiously as the Dáil dealt with it, because, as Senator Hawkins pointed out, we are dealing only with matters arising out of the court judgement.  An amending Bill in relation to the 1945 Act is being prepared&mdash;in fact it has been prepared for a couple of years.  As is usual in the case of these big Bills, when matters arise which would appear to be worthy of consideration for amendment, they are put into the file which is being built up for the amending Bill.</P>
      <P>It would be rather remarkable, indeed, if an amending Bill was not necessary in respect of the 1945 Act, because it was a radical measure, a complete departure from the concept of legislation up to that time, and we did not have even the advantage of being able to take our ideas from other countries, because it was such a complete departure from what existed previously. The matters raised by Senator Cunningham will be considered for the amending Bill which will come along in due course, though I cannot say exactly when.  Senator Ruane asked if it had any connection with that Bill and, of course, it has.  This Bill is an amendment of the 1945 Act, dealing with flaws pointed out by this judgement given some few days ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator is wrong in thinking that there was no result from the <Col N="348" /> promises made at the time of dispensary treatment of mental diseases. There are clinics in practically all counties which are doing very good work.  If anybody reads the report of the Department of Health for last year&mdash;the next report for the year ending 31st March, 1953, will be out in the course of a few weeks&mdash;he will see that there is a very big increase in the number of both voluntary and temporary patients in mental hospitals, whereas the number of permanent patients has not increased.  There is also a very big increase in the number of discharges from mental hospitals, so the point is that, under that Act, people are undoubtedly going in earlier, being cured and coming out more quickly, which was the aim of that legislation.  The success of these clinics has been very satisfactory, due, of course, to the enthusiasm with which the resident medical superintendents in the various hospitals and their assistants have taken up that part of the scheme of mental treatment.</P>
    <P>Senator Cunningham raised the point that any medical officer should be eligible to sign the certificate for a person going into a mental hospital. In the main Act, the dispensary doctor is mentioned.  I had not very much time in drafting this Bill to think about principles in the main Act&mdash;I could think only about the defects&mdash; but I presume that there was some principle on which the decision that the dispensary doctor should sign the certificate was based.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The point I was making was that while I might agree with Senator Cunningham if I studied the matter, I had not time to do so. I had to say: &ldquo;We will stick to the principle of the main Act and amend only in so far as the judgment compels us to amend, leaving the discussion of change of principle to the amending Act which is to come along.&rdquo;  I can assure Senator Cunningham and other Senators that I have an open mind on the question&mdash;at the moment at least &mdash;until I see what the arguments were for the dispensary doctor being designated as the person to sign.</P>
      <P>Senator Cunningham said&mdash;and from the medical point of view I am sure he is quite right&mdash;that it is important when a person is mentally deranged that he should be removed to an institution for his own safety and the safety very often of his neighbour, and that it is also important from the point of view of effecting a cure. Therefore, Senator Cunningham reasons, the more quickly he is got there the better.  From the medical point of view there is no doubt that he is correct but if the Senator had listened to the discussion in the Dáil he would have found a very opposite point of view expressed&mdash;that we should not make it too easy to get a person into a mental hospital because relatives are sometimes interested in getting a person in there in order to prevent a change of will or for some other reason.  In any Bill which might be brought before the Oireachtas we have to hold the balance, at is were, between what is necessary and advisable from the medical point of view and what is necessary, on the other hand, for the safety of the individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further point raised by Senator Cunningham is covered in the Bill.  If a person is outside his own district and if he should need to be brought into a mental hospital&mdash;take the example of a person from my own county of Wexford who is in Dublin &mdash;the Bill provides that he can legally be brought to the mental institution if he is certified as being of unsound mind or as a person requiring mental treatment as a temporary patient, and <Col N="350" /> the parent county will be responsible for the expenses of his treatment there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that what Section 108 of the Principal Act provided?  The trouble is that Senators have not had an opportunity of consulting the Principal Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that.  That is Section 4 of this Bill which refers back to the Principal Act.  Another point made by Senator Cunningham was that it is the resident superintendent, or whoever is acting for him, who is the person who should decide into what category a patient should be put. That appears to me to be very sound and it is a matter which could be discussed when we bring in the amending Bill.  Sometimes, as Senators are very well aware, a doctor is, perhaps, inclined when he knows very well that a person should be put into an institution, to make it soft for the relatives by saying: &ldquo;We will send him in as a temporary patient.  He will be cured in a short time and will be out again.&rdquo; He may know very well that he will be there for a long time and should really be put in as a person of unsound mind and as a permanent patient, but out of the kindness of his heart, he classifies him as a temporary patient. These, however, are matters which could very usefully be discussed when the amending Bill is brought along.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put it to the Seanad that it was, on the whole, better to confine the amendments in this Bill to matters arising out of the recent court judgment. These matters are, first of all, that the reception order can now be signed not only by the resident medical superintendent but by any other medical member of the staff who is authorised by the mental hospital authority.  Secondly, the judgment lays down that if a person is rushed to hospital on a certificate of the dispensary doctor he is illegally removed if the reception order was not signed before he was removed.  It will be legal, when this Bill is passed, to have him brought and the reception order signed when he arrives there by the superintendent of <Col N="351" /> the hospital or by the person authorised by the mental hospital authority.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, a safeguard is being brought in because the Dáil thought it was making it too easy to get a man put in.  The person concerned may ask for a second medical opinion before being removed and if he does the second medical officer must be produced and must agree, of course, with the first man before a person can be removed.  Thirdly, is a point which was not mentioned in the judgment but which, I think, would follow consequentially.  The district medical officer, strange to say, where there is only one district medical officer in the district, must sign and nobody can deputise for him.  In the original Act where there was more than one either could sign and if neither could sign, then the nearest district medical officer could sign.</P>
    <P>It is obviously an oversight that the same provision was not put in here. There was only one.  We are putting it in now because it was obvious to me and my Department that if a judge held that nobody could deputise for a resident medical superintendent, then nobody could deputise either for the district medical officer unless we put it into this Bill. We have, therefore, confined the amendments in this Bill to matters arising out of the judgment.  We have not departed from that.  It does not, of course, in any way interfere with our intentions to proceed with an amending Bill to the original Act which will be a much bigger measure. I do not know what size it will be but I should say that it will deal with a number of matters in the Principal Act and will amost inevitably deal with some of the questions raised here by Senator Cunningham. If I do not myself proceed to amend in the direction in which Senator Cunningham has suggested, Senators, of course, will have an opportunity of raising these points when that amending Bill comes along.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senators are aware, a change in the method of distribution of the agricultural grant was introduced in 1946.  Under the Rates on Agricultural <Col N="353" /> Land (Relief) Act of that year, the three types of allowances taken over from the 1939 Act&mdash;the primary allowance, the supplementary allowance and the employment allowance&mdash; were continued, but in different form. The primary allowance was calculated at three-fifths of the general rate on land valuations up to £20.  The supplementary and employment allowances were payable where the valuation exceeded £20 and were applicable only to the excess of the valuation over £20. The supplementary allowance was calculated at one-fifth of the general rate, and the employment allowance at the rate of 10/- in the pound where one or more men were employed on a holding. The employment allowance was limited to £6 10s. 0d. per man, and the Act provided that the supplementary allowance and the employment allowance taken together were not to exceed the actual rates paid on the valuation over £20.</P>
      <P>The 1946 Act originally applied to the financial years 1946/47 and 1947/48 but it was extended annually to each subsequent financial year up to and including the financial year 1952/53.</P>
      <P>When the Bill to extend the 1946 Act to the financial year 1952/53 was before this House in March, 1952, I said that I was having the whole question of this form of rate relief examined to see if the comparatively large subsidy involved might be used to a greater extent to benefit those landowners who are engaged in the forms of agriculture which afford the maximum employment and who, in present conditions, are best serving the needs of the community in regard to agricultural production.  When the Bill was before the Dáil I made a somewhat similar statement.  I was anxious that my intention to change the system of distribution should be made known well in advance to all concerned.</P>
      <P>The Bill now before the House represents what I think can fairly be done within the framework of the present system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main change is that the two allowances payable on land valuations over £20 are being merged.  The supplementary and employment allowances <Col N="354" /> provided by the 1946 Act are, in effect, being abolished and instead the Bill provides for a new employment allowance at a flat rate of £17 per man employed subject only to the limitation that the total of the employment allowances does not exceed the rates on the valuation over £20.  The primary allowance is not being disturbed and farmers will, as heretofore, get relief at the rate of three-fifths of the general rate on the first £20 of their valuations.</P>
    <P>The Bill will apply to the current financial year and to the two following years.  This is necessary in order to give the revised system a chance of proving itself.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill will enable county councils to amend rate assessments already made for the current financial year in order to bring them into conformity with the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister makes this sound a very simple measure, and possibly it is; but the House should take some cognisance of the history which leads up to the introduction of the Bill into the Seanad, even thought the Minister decided to skip anything in the nature of a review of the history of this Bill or its proposals in recent months.  Every Senator is aware of the fact that the proposals which ultimately found their way into this measure were announced by the Government some time ago.  These proposals are not ones in which I would have any particular personal interest, being a Senator living in and making his living from the capital city of this country, but a great many Senators and a great many members of the Dáil represent interest in rural areas which would be affected by this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister presents the case that he had made up his mind to do what he could to encourage employment in rural areas within the framework of the existing rates relief legislation.  I agree that that is a very praiseworthy objective but I certainly question whether or not it is likely to be achieved by what is contained in this Bill, particularly having regard to the manner in <Col N="355" /> which it has been approached by the Minister.  The Minister presents the Bill as something to relieve unemployment in rural areas, something presumably to discourage the flight from the land and to encourage farmers to employ more men and thus keep them on the land.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that that was the motivating intention behind this Bill at all.  I believe the reason this Bill was proposed by the Government was for the purpose of shifting about £500,000 from the Exchequer to local rates.  In the original pronouncement made by the Minister and Government spokesmen with regard to the legislation now before us, it was quite clear that a sum of £500,000 was going to be put on to local rates by this change in the mechanics of the agricultural rates relief system.  Even now, after the Minister was pressed to amend his original proposals by the Opposition in the Dáil, and having given way to a great extent to that pressure, the Bill as introduced by him will mean something in the region of £120,000 per annum as an imposition on the local rates.</P>
    <P>I am surprised, particularly having regard to the discussion which took place in the Dáil, that the Minister did not extend to Senators the courtesy of giving them figures in relation to the losses or gains which would be sustained by different local authorities by reason of this legislation.  Those figures are available to him.  The Opposition Deputies in the Dáil, when they did not get that assistance from the Minister, went to the trouble of making their own inquiries from local authorities and obtaining the figures from them.  It is showing very scant courtesy or regard for this House that even after those figures were available to him the Minister did not bother mentioning them, that all he has to say about this Bill is that he thinks it is all that can be done within the present system.  The fact of the matter is that a number of counties will find themselves poorer by some thousands of pounds.</P>
    <P>What will be obtained in return for that?  If the Minister could only claim <Col N="356" /> that in return for whatever additional burden is being placed on the rates there would be a substantial improvement in the employment position in these counties, he would find very little adverse criticism of this Bill. But does anyone seriously think that any farmer will be induced to spend another £200 or £400 a year to employ one or two more men for the sake of securing a relief grant to the extent of £17 or £34?  I think it would be made economics if that were the way a farmer set about his business.</P>
    <P>If, as the Minister seemed to indicate when he approached this matter in the Dáil, there will not be any great charge on the local authorities or on the Exchequer, why, then, was it necessary to have any alteration in the position at all?  I suggest to the Minister and to the House that this measure, even pared down as it is, is designed solely for the purpose of shifting from the Exchequer a burden on to the local rates.  There is no change being made in the three-fifths relief given up to the £20 valuation. The position formerly, I understand, was that over the £20 valuation the one-fifth allowance was given.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to three types of allowance&mdash;the primary allowance, the supplementary allowance and the unemployment allowance.  His definition is that while the three-fifths allowance remains unaltered up to the £20 valuation, the other two allowances are bulked together.  They are not only bulked together, they are abolished and in their place an allowance of £17 a year is being given in respect of a person employed for the full period of 12 months.</P>
    <P>It seems that under this Bill as it stands&mdash;and I presume Senators will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;the same has applied heretofore: that the allowance is only given in the case of male labour.  I suggest that it would be well worth the Minister's while to consider giving a grant where female workers are employed.  It would be an improvement in the present Bill and I do not think it would affect the cost to any very appreciable extent.</P>
    <P>Another point I want to make is that the Minister has not given the Seanad <Col N="357" /> any estimate with regard to what the working of this Bill will mean either in terms of persons who it is anticipated might be put into employment because of its provisions or in relation to the pounds, shillings and pence aspect of this legislation.  Last year, according to the figures that were published, approximately 21,000 people left the land.  Whatever calculations the Minister has made under this Bill, he has kept them a secret and has not bothered telling us about them, but it is reasonable to assume that whatever calculations he made were based on the number of people employed last year or in the last few years and the number of additional people to whom he hoped employment might be given by holding out this £17-carrot to the farmers.</P>
    <P>If I am right in saying that there are 21,000 persons less on the land now than were there last year, that 21,000 left the rural areas, left agricultural work, does the Minister expect that no one at all will leave this year? Suppose the Minister achieves his purpose and only 10,000 persons leave this year?  If the Seanad will consider those figures for a moment, I think all on the far side, and the Minister himself, would be congratulating the Government if that position were achieved, that only 10,000 left in 1953 as against 21,000 in 1952.  What would that mean in relation to the financial position under this Bill?  It would mean a very considerable saving to the Exchequer. The Minister has not bothered giving us calculations of that sort.  I think those calculations should be given. The Minister should have endeavoured to find out per county what the effect of this legislation would be and he should have informed the House about that.</P>

      <P>I do not care what <Col N="358" /> the proportion is.  The difficulty of Senators on any side of the House is that the Minister has introduced this Bill without mentioning any figures at all.  We can only make the best shot we can, on the basis of the statistics published by the Central Statistics Office. It is the job of the Minister in charge of the Bill to put the Seanad in a position to examine his proposals, by letting us know what effect it will have financially or on the employment problem, as the case may be, in rural areas.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not bothered giving us those figures, but the history of this legislation belies the claim that the Minister has made that the whole motive behind it was to endeavour to increase employment in rural areas, to give encouragement to the farmers who were willing to employ more men.  On the basis of a circular issued by the Minister to local authories&mdash;and any Senator who is a member of a local authority knows that this is so&mdash;it was proposed that a sum in the region of £350,000 would be shifted on to the rates.  It was only because of the protests made to the Minister by local authorities and in Dáil Éireann that the proposals made by him and outlined by him in black and white in that circular were dropped.</P>
      <P>When this Bill was introduced, it was found in radical respects to be different from what he had indicated was his proposal.  The blundering which took place in connection with this proposal from the time it was outlined has proved rather expensive with some of the local authorities.  Some of them who had been directed to prepare their demand notices on the basis of the Minister's circular, found they were not able to proceed on foot of those demand notes.  The original proposal&mdash;again I speak subject to correction&mdash;was dressed up as an attractive offer made to the people of rural Ireland, peculiarly enough at a time when, in one part of the country at any rate, they were voting in a by-election.  Since then the Minister has changed his tune.  He has been made to change it by the criticism which his proposal aroused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to be taken as standing in the way of this Bill.  I am not going to oppose its passage but I <Col N="359" /> exhort the Minister, when he is concluding, to pay this House at least the courtesy of giving us some information about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to point out the confusion that this alteration in demand notes has brought to the secretarial staff in my county.  I am credibly informed that the Bill means a net loss of £10,000 to the finances of County Mayo.  I am also informed that it means a loss of £3,000 more than that to Galway and that Roscommon loses less, but still the loss there is £4,000.  Unfortunately any motive the Minister may have to absorb farm labourers has no application to the majority of farmers in Mayo, where those farmers have not sufficient land to employ themselves for the greater part of the year.  They have to leave the land and supplement earnings at home by their work as labourers across the Channel.  Therefore a remission of £17 in the rates means nothing to most of the farmers of my county.  It means that the rates will have to make up at least £10,000 that was hitherto made over to the county in the distribution of the agricultural grant.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Higgins on the question of relief to the few farmers of Mayo whose valuation is over £20 that none of them is going to employ an extra labourer and pay him £4 or £4 10s. a week for the purpose of getting a remission of £17&mdash;or twice £17 where the employs two men&mdash;in the rates.  That is not going to happen. The Bill is not one to make people in my county enthusiastic and I certainly am not enthusiastic about it.</P>

      <P>One wonders how easy it is for members of the Opposition to change their views on various matters when they change sides in this or the other house.  We have had almost annually a Bill in connection with these rates on agricultural land. During the term of office of the inter-Party Government, the then Minister for Finance was here dealing with this matter.  I would advise Senator O'Higgins and Senator Ruane to go back over the debates of that period <Col N="360" /> and revive their memories on his approach, at that particular time, to this matter of subsidising the farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I have ever heard a Minister for Local Government or a Minister for Agriculture in this House claiming that this measure was a measure to create employment on the land.  The Bill is just a proposal to give relief of rates to holders of agricultural land.</P>
      <P>When the Minister informed us here, about this time last year, that he proposed to change the system, we were all anxious that whatever assistance would be given should be given to those people who were engaged in agriculture proper&mdash;that is, those who produce the food for this country.</P>
      <P>Senator Ruane suggested that County Mayo would lose £10,000 or £100,000 and in particular he referred to the smallholders of under £20 valuation.  If he had read the Bill he would have found that no change is made in relation to this particular section at all.  As a matter of fact, taking it by and large, Mayo is one of the counties which should benefit most under the proposed changes.  It is extraordinary that in this House to-night, and in the Dáil during the week when these matters were under discussion, quite a number of Opposition speakers urged the Minister to be more generous had to extend the provisions of the Bill as it relates to agricultural workers to include female workers.  That, in itself, is a contradiction because it is an admission that the £17 provided per man under this Bill will be of considerable influence on the farmer in the matter of keeping in permanent employment persons whom he formerly employed for, say, ten months or 11 months of the year. If it is not an inducement to the landowners to keep persons in continuous employment, then surely if it were extended to female labour it would not have the desired effect either.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>The relief is there in so far as the majority of cases of that kind will be covered by the relief under the £20 valuation on the other section of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Higgins referred to some 21,000 or 22,000 persons who have fled from the land.  This Bill has no relief at all for that.  It is a simple measure to give relief of rates to a certain section of the people: it is nothing more or less than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHartney" hpid="Mr. Hartney Mr. Hartney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hartney</NameTxt>
      <P>When the change was made in the distribution some years ago, the principle was generally approved throughout the country. Previous to that, the same relief was given to the poor man with a low valuation as was given to the rancher, to the man with a big house and broad acres, even if he were an absentee.  An effort was made to remedy that state of affairs and the principle was introduced of giving a primary allowance on all valuations under £20 and in respect of the first £20 in all higher valuations.  That was followed by an employment allowance of £6 10s. per man.  In our county, that was based on a valuation of £12 10s.  You got the relief per man employed after £20.  The £20 is covered by the primary allowance.  My desire is that the unit will be made £20, with a rate of 10/- in the £.  That will represent £10 per man employed. That means that a farmer with a valuation of £40 would get the primary relief on the first £20 and then substantial relief on the second £20 in respect of the employment of a man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the principle of giving the primary allowance in respect of the first £20 was introduced it was followed by an employment allowance on the next £12 10s. of the valuation: the rest was covered by the supplementary <Col N="362" /> allowance.  In my view, it was a pity that the £12 10s. was not increased to £20.  That would mean that a man with £40 valuation would be given a bigger allowance.</P>
    <P>Unless a full year's employment is given to a man, the farmer will not get the benefit of the allowance.  In my county, it is usual for a farmer to enter into a contract in regard to the employment of a workman.  The contract starts about the 1st February and it continues until the following Christmas Eve.  January is looked upon as a kind of a holiday month. It is frequently the case that a workman has a certain amount of work to do for himself and he looks forward to the month of January in which to do it.  That means that his period of employment with the farmer is about eight weeks short of a full year.</P>
    <P>It is a pity a farmer would not be entitled to claim five-sixths of the full year's allowance in respect of the ten months' employment which he gives to his worker.  Obviously, a great deal of money would have to be spent in administering such a scheme and, in the end, we should probably find that the game was not worth the candle.</P>
    <P>In counties where there are very high valuations, even if a man is giving employment, quite a good portion of his valuation is untouched if the owner himself is a farmer and works on the farm.  If the owner is elderly and has two sons working on the farm he will be able to claim an allowance and thus he will be doing well for himself. However, if the owner is a young man and is working the farm himself, no matter how good a worker he may be, he will not get any allowance.</P>
    <P>This scheme must be tried out.  I think that all public bodies put their views before the Minister on this matter. I remember that in my own county I pressed for the extension of the employment unit to £20 at 10s. in the £ after the first £20.  However, I did not succeed.  It must be borne in mind that relief is also given if the worker is a male member of the family.  It is only fair that there should be some recompense for him and it is surely better that he should get it than that <Col N="363" /> it should be passed on to a man who let his land to a grazier from Kerry or some place 30 or 50 miles away. Anybody will agree with that.  In my county, under this change, 7,000 odd people are benefiting and another 2,000 losing.</P>

There was objection when the first change was made by the man who had not employed anybody before because he was going to lose and the same objection is made to-day, but I maintain that it is sound economics. If a man does not want to employ, he is not being asked to do so.  If a man employed last year he will be remunerated for it this year.  It is for the men employed in 1953 that a farmer claims in 1954.  I should like to see arrangements made, however, for some allowance in the case of the man who has given over six months' employment. I do not ask that smaller periods be taken into account, because I know it means trouble and worry, but at least where six months' employment has been given, there should be some recognition for it.</P>

      <P>I oppose this Bill.  I gather that there is some confusion as to its objective.  The Minister thought that in introducing it he was endeavouring to provide for maximum employment on the land. Senator Hawkins&mdash;perhaps he was not fully briefed&mdash;seems to think that the matter of employment on the land does not enter into the effects of the Bill at all, and I should like the Minister to clear that matter up for us and let us know exactly what is the idea behind the Bill.  One thing appears clear to me and it is that the Central Fund is going to save a considerable sum of money.</P>

      <P>The Minister can correct me if I am wrong, but the Central Fund is going to be the gainer of a considerable sum if this Bill goes through.  The idea behind all this saving goes back to the mind of another Minister, who said not very long ago that taxation presses lightly on the land.  The Minister for Local Government has taken his cue from that, has looked around and has seen that he can do something for the Central Fund as a result of this Bill.  More rates will be paid by the farmers as a result of it. That cannot be denied.  Taxation, we are informed, presses lightly on the land.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to say whether, in fact, it does.  However, the idea has been put abroad and has been accepted by at least one Minister, and at the moment we have a commission sitting to inquire generally into income-tax and the incidence of income-tax.  If that commission takes the view that taxation presses lightly on the land, the proprietors of the land will hear a great deal more about taxation in the future. It will be seen that some Ministers of this Government think that taxation does press lightly on the land and farmers may find the entire system of taxation, local and national, changed considerably to their detriment.  For these reasons, I oppose the Bill. Senator Hartney, though I could not be quite clear about it, apparently supports this Bill, but he supports it with some reservations, complaining that Limerick will lose some money and also that the provision as to employment operates unfairly against some farmers. I oppose the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I am somewhat surprised at the announcement made by the Senator who has just sat down because I was given to understand that the policy of the Fine Gael Party in relation to this Bill in the Seanad would be, perhaps, the sort of criticism to which we listened but that there would be no formidable opposition in the sense in which it has just been announced.  It was mentioned here that at some particular time or another I made the statement that the employment allowance was designed to increase employment on the land.  I did not make that statement here or in the other House, nor did I make it outside either of these Houses.  During the course of the <Col N="367" /> debate on this Bill and the discussion on the Bill last year I made a simple statement over which I am prepared to stand.  If, as is the case, large sums of money are being extracted from the taxpayer for the purpose of affording relief to landholders, it should be the policy of those charged with the formulation of a scheme for the distribution of that money amongst landowners to ensure that such money would go, in the main, to give employment, whether it is paid employment or employment given to adult members of families.</P>
      <P>I can be asked in a flippant sort of way what the difference between £6 10s. and £17 will mean to a farmer.  It is a matter of 2/6 per week in one case and 7/- in the other. Those who want to play around with little footling points like that can always make as much freedom as they like with these little questions. I should like if Senator Ruane were here now to hear what I have to say. If a farmer in County Mayo with a valuation of £40, on the first £20 of which he was entitled to get a three-fifths remission of the rates struck, and if that Mayo farmer had, perhaps, two sons over 17 years of age working at home with him, I can assure Senator Ruane that if he asked that Mayo farmer whether he would prefer to get in respect of these two sons £34 or £13 he would not be long until he would get an answer.</P>
      <P>I do not contend that this method of distribution is going to make any dent in unemployment on the land, but the man who employs for wages or provides employment for additional members of his own family will be glad to get in respect of each such person so employed £17 as against £6 10s. at the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know where the Senators got the figures to which they referred, but I suppose it does not really matter.  It is true to say that I have not given any figures myself.  In the Dáil I gave my reasons not only in the course of the discussion on this measure but in reply to parliamentary <Col N="368" /> questions designed largely over a period to press me into introducing this measure and, strange to say, although there seemed to be great urgency about it this year&mdash;for the first year in my memory&mdash;when I came along with it, they were not anxious to give it to me.  It reminds me of the story that I attempted to tell in the Dáil one time about the lady who was asked by a man at her door for a drink of buttermilk.  There happened to be a mouse in it.  He handed the drink back to her and she turned her back and whipped the mouse out of the buttermilk and again gave it to him to drink.  He said: &ldquo;Sure, it is as bad as it was.  You do not expect me to drink it this way.&rdquo;  She said: &ldquo;You would not take the drink when the mouse was in it and now, when I have taken it out, you will not take it either.&rdquo;  That was the attitude of Fine Gael in the Dáil.  They badly wanted me to introduce the measure, and when I came along with it they did not want it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I gave a very good reason for the change that has been effected by the consolidation of <Col N="369" /> the amounts formerly distributed through the supplementary and employment allowances and by the creation of an employment allowance of £17 per person&mdash;not alone per person employed on the land but in addition the owners' male relatives over 17 and not exceeding 70 years.  Therefore, not only does this affect farmers who are providing paid employment but, what is far more important, it affects the farmer whose valuation is over £20 and who is providing employment for members of his family.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that the many thousands of farmers who will benefit from this will see the reason for it. In fact, one of the reasons why the idea of making this change was seriously considered was that everywhere one went throughout the country one found a man who was in need of labour saying: &ldquo;I cannot get men to milk my cows.  They will not work on Sunday. They do not want to do this or that form of agricultural work.&rdquo;  Therefore, having regard to the known facts in these matters, we should all agree that if the Government collects money from the taxpayer to assist agriculture in the form of the relief of rates the dice should be loaded in favour of those who carry on agriculture in its most difficult forms in these times.  These are the reasons that underlie the new principle set out in this Bill.</P>
      <P>All these other questions about the employment of female labour and part-time labour have been debated over the last 20 years since first this method of relief of rates was instituted.  One time I went back on the discussions that took place in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The case was made year in, year out, pleading for the inclusion of women working on the land and pleading for part-time employees, making a case for the men who were employed for six months and others for nine months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no use in my going over the whole argument against these recommendations&mdash;the impossibility of administration, the impossibility of determining when a woman is actually working on the land, or the amount of time that a woman or girl might devote to agricultural matters.  In any <Col N="370" /> event it finally came down to the question of the amount of money that the State decided to provide.  The sum that has been provided this year is a fairly large one&mdash;£5,000,000.  A statement was made by at least one Deputy in the Dáil who was critical as to whether or not we were getting as good value for this money as we could get, perhaps, if some other method of distribution influenced or determined on the basis of real production were followed.  I did say that I could not think of any other method by which you could reach so many people as by the method that is employed here.  It is a large sum and we should be careful to secure the best results from it.</P>
    <P>I do not know if I gave the reasons as to why I did not commit myself to figures for different counties.  I did not do so in the Dáil or here mainly because I could not get figures I could stand over as completely firm for each county.  My officials, of course, made calculations&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Could you give us those?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as to what the results would be and the basis on which the present method has been decided was that of providing the same amount of money towards the relief of rates that would have been provided if the system in operation last year and the year before were in operation now.  The method of distribution is being changed but the method decided upon in this Bill is designed to absorb the same amount of money provided by the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>Senator Hartney was pretending to be all innocence in this matter. I believe he knew quite well his county was going to benefit and benefit fairly substantially as a result of this new method of distribution but, of course, although the Limerick men try to give you the impression they are always flathúil and open, he was keeping this to himself for fear there might be jealousy on the part of other Senators who come from other counties which may not fare so well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="371" /> Senator Ruane need not shed any tears in regard to Mayo.  This county will benefit substantially as a result of the new method.  Senators have been critical and Deputies in the other House have been critical of the fact that certain counties will benefit and others will not.  I agree that even in Limerick and in Mayo, where they stand to benefit, taking each county as a unit, there will be individuals who will lose.  The fact that a county as a unit will gain does not mean that some individuals within the county will not lose.  They will lose because there will be people with fairly large tracts of land who will have fairly high valuations and who will not be giving employment.  They may have their own personal reasons for that and I am not objecting.  I suppose they have to be free agents in that matter but the taxpayer who pays and we who speak for him should at least have a say as to where the money will go that is being provided in the hard way.</P>
    <P>As far as the figures that have been quoted are concerned, there is not much to be gained by my making a forecast as to the exact amount any particular county will gain or lose. Next year when each county has adopted this particular system we will know to a penny, or to a pound at any rate, how things have worked out.  I will take the risk of saying that Senator Ruane will find a far more pleasant picture at the end of the year than he seems to contemplate now.</P>

      <P>I want to emphasise the point which was made by Senator O'Rourke, because it is an important one and one which I did not appreciate until the Senator spoke.  I can only deal now with what is in the Bill and it provides that this supplementary or employment allowance, whatever it is called, will be given only where there is continuity of employment.  Senators from rural areas can speak with much more authority than I can on this aspect of the matter.  If you could draw a parallel with employment in urban or city areas you would very frequently have the case where a person does three months, six months or nine months' work and then leaves that employment of his own free will.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, or leaves to better himself.  For one reason or another the continuity is broken.  In such a case if the person who would, but for this break of continuity, have qualified for the allowance does everything he can to employ another man and to lesson the break in continuity, the allowance should be given.  It should not be difficult to work out such a scheme.  If it cannot be done under this Bill, some amending Bill should be introduced.</P>

      <P>I do not think Senator O'Rourke or Senator O'Higgins are so simple.  Senator O'Higgins elects to have no experience of rural matters.  They should know that rural people are not such fools.  If you leave <Col N="373" /> the gate wide open to the people of any county, they are not that foolish&mdash; they will know exactly how wide it is open.</P>

      <P>I want to emphasise the point made by Senator O'Rourke. I know many cases where workmen left without any reason.  The employer did his best to get a man but it was often at a crucial time.  Any farmer will realise that it is much harder to find a farm labourer immediately than to find a man for any industrial job. For that reason I would stress very strongly the point made by Senator O'Rourke.  If possible, some steps should be taken to ratify this.  In our own county a man who failed by just one week&mdash;the employee left&mdash;will lose his benefit although he did everything possible to get another man immediately.</P>

I admit that my connection would be limited to a particular county but it extends over a long period of association with local bodies and otherwise.  This matter is provided for in the Act of 1939.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make the point, anyhow&mdash;the Senator cannot stop me. If a man is ill there is a good deal of discretion given to the local authority to make a decision, where there is any question as to whether continuity is maintained.  The officials of a local authority have the obligation of examining these matters.  There are the two weeks provided by law to an agricultural worker, and the farmer can therefore be without an employee for those two weeks, if the man runs out on him. After all, he runs out without his holidays, and the farmer has two weeks in which to engage another, if the local authority so decides.  It is not cut just as fine as is suggested.  It need not be cut as fine as some Senators would have us believe.</P>
      <P>The 1939 Act provides that there must be continuity of employment. That was discussed at great length on a number of occasions, in the same way as other matters referred to here. There is also provided in the law the discretion to the individual local body to examine and discuss this and to settle questions of doubt.  In that way, I think the employer would normally be given some time and that in actual practice he does not really have to have his finger on a bell, and when Johnny leaves in the morning he must switch on to Michael.</P>
