    <Title>Imposition of Duties (Confirmation of Orders) (No. 2) Bill, 1953&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House knows, Orders made by the Government under the Emergency (Imposition of Duties) Act require to be confirmed by resolutions of each House of the Oireachtas. This Bill, which is in the usual form, is to confirm 11 Orders made under that Act during the course of the past five or six months.  An explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill gives in a general way an indication of the commodities to which the Orders relate.  Five of the Orders imposed new duties; three of them extended the scope of the existing duties to cover additional lines; and three of them provided for the alteration of rates of duty previously in force.</P>
      <P>The first two Orders named in the Bill relate to wire mesh netting and certain fabricated iron and steel bars and sections and iron and steel wire. These two Orders imposed a new duty on wire mesh netting and on iron and steel wire, and varied in minor detail the existing duty upon fabricated iron and steel bars and sections.  The manufacture of mesh netting was begun this year at a factory located in County Dublin.  The market in this country for the types of wire, barbed wire and netting, to which the Order relates, is estimated to be worth £400,000 per year and the aim of the firm which has started operations is to supply the whole of that market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The products of the firm in question are being sold at prices which are competitive with the prices of corresponding <Col N="226" /> goods produced and sold in Britain.  It is to be appreciated, however, that, in respect of metal products, there is a difficult situation now prevailing, partly because of price fluctuations and partly because it not infrequently happens that manufactured goods are procurable at prices which appear to have no relation to and are even sometimes lower than, the prices of the raw materials from which they are made.  The arrangement made with this firm manufacturing barbed wire and wire netting is that their prices will be related to the prices of the wire rod which they import, and, while that would ordinarily be a simple arrangement to operate, the present position, as I say, is complicated and is being investigated.</P>
    <P>I have in the past said that a firm which produced and sold goods here at prices similar to those prevailing in Great Britain would be regarded as satisfactory, from the viewpoint of its efficiency, but, in the case of these goods, it is recognised that continental prices are more competitive than British prices, and, if the duty were not in force, it is likely that it would be from continental countries that these goods would be brought in.  It is fairly certain, however, that, in the course of the coming 12 months, these anomalies in relation to steel and other metal prices will be ironed out and a normal position restored.</P>
    <P>So far as single cotton yarns, to which Order No. 309 relates, are concerned, the position is that we had imports of these yarns subject to quota restrictions.  Under our agreement with the O.E.E.C., we are required to maintain 75 per cent. of the volume of our trade free of quota restrictions and cotton yarns were included upon the liberalised list we supplied to O.E.E.C.</P>
    <P>The council of the O.E.E.C. considered that we were not justified in suspending the operation of liberalisation in relation to the cotton yarn beyond July of this year.  Accordingly, the quota Order was revoked and in its stead Order 309 was made imposing duties at the rate of 50 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> full and 33? per cent. preferential upon single cotton yarn.  These <Col N="227" /> yarns are being produced by a number of firms in this country.  While it is clear that their installed capacity is not sufficient at the present time to meet the full requirements of the market, that capacity is, I understand, being increased and it is likely that they will shortly be in a position to meet the whole of our internal needs for single cotton yarn.</P>
    <P>Order 310 which relates to handbags extends the scope of the existing duty to cover those articles when made from plastic materials.  It also brings within the scope of the duties certain trunks, suitcases, travel bags, attaché cases and similar articles.  There are a number of firms engaged in the manufacture of these goods and all the information available to us indicates that the prices charged here by Irish manufacturers are no dearer and in some cases lower than those charged for handbags produced in England.</P>
    <P>Order 311 is not of very great importance. It extends the scope of a duty which previously applied to spectacles to spectacle frames made of material other than metal.  There are three firms engaged in the manufacture of spectacle frames and they produce so wide a variety of frames that a comparison with prices elsewhere would be impracticable but as far as I can ascertain prices here are fully competitive with the British prices.</P>
    <P>The next Order, 312, relates to sheet and plate glass.  It requires, perhaps, a fuller explanation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Order 312 does not deal with plate glass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It does.  It is Order 241 of 1953.  I may say that the duty applies to plate glass only because the Revenue Commissioners are unable to differentiate between sheet glass and plate glass on importation but in practice duty free licences are given on application for the importation of plate glass and the duty applies effectively only to sheet glass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The duty on sheet glass was reviewed under the provisions of the <Col N="228" /> trade agreement made with Great Britain in 1938 by the Tariff Commission which, before the war, was the reviewing authority under that agreement. The rates of duty which have operated in respect of sheet glass here were those recommended by the Tariff Commission following that review. They were specific rates of duty &mdash;that is to say the duty did not relate to the value of the article on importation. The rates were £1 per cwt. full and 13/4 per cwt. preferential.  It is clear that rates of that kind imposed in 1939 afforded lesser protection than was originally intended because of the alterations in values since the end of the war.</P>
    <P>The trade agreement did not provide for a further review of duties fixed in consequence of a review held under the provisions of the agreement but the British authority, nevertheless, agreed that there should be a further review which was undertaken by the I.D.A. which is now the reviewing body under the agreement.  That agreement provides that duties should be fixed at a rate which will give British manufacturers full opportunity of reasonable competition while at the same time having regard to the requirements of the Irish producers who it was intended should be afforded adequate protection having regard to relative costs of efficient and economical production and taking into account the requirements of a newly established industry.</P>
    <P>The position had arisen that under the old rates of duty the British glass could come in here and sell at a price which was very slightly above the price at which Irish sheet glass was produced. In fact, in certain parts of the country where high transport charges operated, it was less than the home price.  It was quite obvious that if the firm making the sheet glass and which was losing money on the operation was to be properly protected and facilitated in extending its operation, then it would have to be allowed to secure a higher price.  The purpose of the review of the tariff was to consider what change in the rate would permit them to obtain a higher price.  The fact is that sheet glass can be produced in <Col N="229" /> England at a lower price than it can be produced here.</P>
    <P>The I.D.A., however, took note of the fact that the full operation of competition in Great Britain had, in fact, wiped out competition there.  There is now only one large producer of this commodity in that country.  The I.D.A. was not prepared and decided it could not accept as reasonable competition something which had that effect in Britain, particularly having regard to the provision of the agreement that the Irish producer should be afforded adequate protection relative to the cost of efficient and economical production and taking regard of the difficulties of a new industry.  It is clear that the Irish firm engaged in the manufacture of sheet glass cannot obtain raw materials at anything like as favourable a price as the British combine.  That firm has other higher charges, including higher wage rates and higher cost of fuel, power, light and water.  Nevertheless, the I.D.A. came to the conclusion&mdash;in fact, the conclusion was not challenged by the representatives of the British firm who were heard in this connection with the review&mdash;that the concern operating here was as efficient as a concern of its size could be and that the methods of production were as economical as they could be made on the basis of the existing output.</P>
    <P>The Irish firm had secured only about two-thirds of the home market at the time this review was made. They, therefore, decided that they could not regard the British price as being a fair standard by which to test the efficiency of the firm.  They said if that price had been brought about by the free interplay of the forces of supply and demand their outlook would be different, but having regard to the special circumstances prevailing in Great Britain they decided that prices in other countries, where conditions are more closely comparable to our own, were a fairer standard to apply.  They recommended, therefore, that this increase in duty should be brought into force.  Under the Order the preferential rate of duty was raised from 13/4 per cwt. to 22/- per cwt.  It was recognised that the consequences <Col N="230" /> of the alteration of the terms of duty would be to permit the Irish producer to increase the price of sheet glass from 100/- to 120/- per case, that is per 200 sq. ft.  It is possible that that price may be reviewed and reduced again if the Irish producer secures the whole of the home market, but in the meantime a price of 120/-per case is required to enable the industry to carry on.  The increase in price makes an addition of about £1 to the total cost of constructing an ordinary-sized house.  There are at present 130 people employed in the manufacture of sheet glass here.</P>
    <P>Order No. 313 alters the rate of duty applying to articles made of asbestos suitable for use in building or drainage.  The old duty was a specific duty of 4/6 full and 3/- preferential per cwt.  The duty was suspended for some years and when it was decided to bring it back into operation it was decided also to change from a specific to an <i>ad valorem</i> duty.  The new rates are 30 per cent. full and 20 per cent. preferential. All the information available to us is that these asbestos goods are produced here with high efficiency and are sold at prices which are comparable with prices elsewhere in Europe.  It is an important industry to develop, giving employment at present to about 340 persons in the town of Athy, County Kildare.</P>
    <P>Order No. 314 which relates to tableware may require some more elaborate explanation also, particularly because it was the subject of some Press controversy after it was made.  There was in operation upon delf tableware before the war, duties which were both <i>ad valorem</i> and specific, although the specific duties were the really effective ones.  The specific duties were 1/3 full and 10d. preferential in respect of tea and coffee pots and 6d. full and 3d. preferential in respect of other delf articles.  Again, it will be appreciated that the rise in prices which took place since these duties were originally imposed reduced their protective value, and the effect of the Order was to raise the specific duties on these articles other than tea and coffee pots to 1/6 full and 1/- preferential per article.</P>
    <P>These duties represent protection at <Col N="231" /> a high <i>ad valorem</i> rate and it is somewhat difficult to understand why further protection should be required particularly having regard to the fact that all the evidence is that these delf tableware articles are produced here at prices which are entirely competitive with British prices and of a quality which is certainly not inferior and may in many instances be superior to the quality of these goods sold in Britain. Nevertheless there was evidence of importation continuing mainly, as far as we could discover, of delf tableware for hotels.  The purpose of the new duty was to check that importation and particularly to give the Irish manufacturers an opportunity of securing the hotel trade.</P>
    <P>This matter might not have been dealt with at this particular time but for the fact that a new factory is being established in Galway for the manufacture of chinaware.  Previously no chinaware was manufactured in this country and clearly the specific rates of duty which would afford reasonable protection in the case of the much cheaper delfware would not be equally effective in dealing with chinaware and it was thought desirable, from the point of view of convenience of administration and of the trade, that the same rates of duty should apply to all tableware whether made of delf or china.</P>
    <P>The factory at Galway has not yet been built.  Certain processes are however being undertaken there pending the completion and equipment of the factory for which the workers are being trained and it is likely to be some time before full scale production is in progress.  It is a difficult industry to establish.  It was thought, however, that in view of the fact that chinaware is not by any means a perishable type of commodity as soon as it became known that a factory for the manufacture of chinaware was being established in Galway, that as soon as the manufacturing processes were initiated there would be a tendency to import considerable quantities of these goods in anticipation of a duty coming into operation.  Normally it is not thought <Col N="232" /> desirable to impose customs duties in advance of the commencement of full scale production but in this particular case it was regarded as essential to the project; without it its prospects of a successful beginning would be gravely prejudiced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister has it not always been the policy to impose tariffs before production began?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, my memory cannot be as bad as that.  Surely, they have been imposed over and over again before production starts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Very rarely; in fact, I have repeatedly expressed a personal disinclination to consider the imposition of tariffs in advance of the expenditure of the capital to be invested in a new project mainly because I do not wish a promise for protection to be used as a lever for the raising of capital.  It might in certain cases produce undesirable results.</P>
      <P>In connection with this duty we had representations from the Hardware and Allied Trades' Association.  Having considered their representations, I decided to relax the operation of the duty for the time being.  The relaxation which has been agreed upon will operate until the end of March next. It will be subject to review before then, perhaps continued after that date, perhaps amended at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the new procedure, duty free licences will be given for sets of delf tableware on the basis of a licence for the importation of one set for each set ordered from the manufacturers of delf tableware here, subject to the condition that the imported set should be of the dearer class of delfware, that is between 34/9 and 71/5 per set. Up to the present, the Arklow pottery has concentrated upon the cheapest type of delfware.  It is only in recent months they have begun to develop production of the higher grades of delfware, but they are not yet in a position to meet the full requirements of the market in respect of these higher grades.  Consequently, this easement <Col N="233" /> will permit of a supply of higher and dearer types of delfware being imported on a 50-60 basis with Arklow production.</P>
    <P>A similar arrangement has been made in respect of chinaware.  A duty free licence will be issued for the importation of a set of chinaware in respect of every order for one set placed with the Galway concern.  In that case the condition is that the cost of the imported set must exceed 71/5. It has been decided, however, that chinaware sets costing more than 120/-per set will be freely licensed for importation. The Galway concern is proposing to concentrate&mdash;at any rate, for the time being&mdash;on the production of the cheaper kinds of chinaware and these more expensive sets will not be produced here and consequently will be imported free of duty.</P>
    <P>The effect of these administrative arrangements will be to give the retail traders in these goods what they desire, namely, a greater variety of patterns and designs for sale while the home production is being stepped up. It has to be recognised, of course, that the manufacture of these goods by a limited number of concerns tends to restrict to some extent the varieties of pattern and design available to traders &mdash;which, naturally, the traders concerned do not like&mdash;but it is hoped that in the course of time a very considerable variety will be available which will meet their needs.  May I say that when these matters were being discussed with the association in my Department there were no complaints made regarding the quality of the Irish products?  The only ground on which they urged some relaxation of the duty was to permit of the availability of a wider range of designs.</P>
    <P>Order No. 315 applies to electric wire and cable.  Its primary purpose is to extend the existing duty, which relates to rubber covered cable, to plastic covered cable which is tending to replace the rubber covered variety. It also closed what was in effect a loophole in the duty.  The Revenue Commissioners had decided that a length of flex or cable with any fitting, even a wall plug, at the end of it was an electric fitment and not a length of flex of cable.  That ruling was being <Col N="234" /> availed of to bring in duty free flex and cable which it was not intended should be imported.  This Order was availed of to close that loophole to make the Order apply to a length of flex or cable even with a fitting attached.</P>
    <P>Order No. 316, which is in respect of glass packed sterile liquids, represents a very interesting and important development which has taken place here, namely, the manufacture of injection solutions by a firm in Roscrea. This firm in Roscrea, which was manufacturing a wide range of these injection solutions and which is at present exporting more than half its total production, is turning them out to the same standard of quality as imported solutions and at prices which are in all cases competitive and in some cases lower than the British prices.  Nevertheless, it was found that they were not getting the orders from the Irish market which in the circumstances they might have expected.  I came to the conclusion that that was due to the fact that there is in many cases a close connection between large Irish wholesale chemists and British manufacturing firms and that it was only by the imposition of a duty which might not otherwise have been necessary that the business could be secured for the Irish manufacturers.</P>
    <P>The firm concerned has been the subject of a very favourable report by some of these experts who came here upon technical assistance missions to report upon Irish industrial possibilities. Their products have been strongly commended by people who are familiar with them on the ground of their quality and suitability and, as I have said, their prices are competitive and are in many cases lower than the British prices.  There has been no change in their prices since the imposition of the duty.</P>
    <P>The last Order, if I may mention it, has the effect of extending the existing duty on toilet paper in rolls to toilet paper made up in packets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamFearon" hpid="Professor Fearon Professor Fearon">
      <NameTxt>Professor Fearon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two or three items in this list about which I would like a little further illumination. Three of them will be involved in the <Col N="235" /> operation of the Health Act and I think it might be well to draw the attention of the House to their possible effect on the expenses of the medicines or preparations that will be provided by the Act when in operation.  For example, I see, in Order 311, &ldquo;Spectacle Frames&rdquo;.  I take it that when the Health Act comes under way there will be a very large and increasing demand for spectacles and optical appliances of that kind.  It seems to me that in consequence of this duty there will be an addition to the cost of the Health Act.  I suppose it would be impossible to secure exemption from the duty for the time being until the increased demand will be raised when the Act comes into operation.  I am not sure if the tax on plate glass will affect the tax on optical glass and spectacle lenses.</P>
      <P>With regard to Order No. 316, dealing with packed sterile liquids, I touched on that&mdash;not, I am afraid, very clearly&mdash;when we were discussing the Health Bill.  When the Act comes into operation there will be an increasing demand for these drugs and if the local manufacturers are not able to meet that demand it means that it will have to be filled by imported liquids, all of which will be taxed, and the Exchequer will be getting the benefit of this tax without necessarily contributing at all to the working of the Health Act.  I would draw the attention of the Minister to these points.  It is hard to anticipate what the effect of the working of the Health Act will be. If there is any comparison at all with its working in Great Britain, there will be a period when there will be a great demand for a lot of these things and if that demand cannot be met at home it will have to be met by imported taxed foreign substitutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point arises in connection with tableware.  As far as I could follow the Minister, the situation seems to be something like this.  If production prices fall on the other side, the duty here goes up.  If production prices rise on the other side, the duty here goes up.  Therefore, whatever happens, we get the worst of it.  That may be as <Col N="236" /> it may be.  I feel, in connection with keeping a check on the prices of our home-manufactured articles, that we also want control of quality.  Our prices may be lower than, or well below, or competitive with the British prices but unless the quality is kept up and safeguarded the position will be most unsatisfactory indeed.  I have had some very unhappy experiences with some of our Irish-manufactured products&mdash;I shall not mention their names.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, these products were inferior to the British ones in particular conditions and in this connection I might mention that I am not at all biased in favour of any country. If I can, I like my requirements to be Irish manufactured.  I feel that, occasionally, there is a relaxation of our standards of quality and it is essential, therefore, that that aspect be perpetually safeguarded.  It is said that the cost of liberty is perpetual vigilance.  It seems to me that the cost of protection is constant watchfulness.</P>
    <P>I draw the attention of the Minister to these matters in view of the effect which these duties will have when the new Health Act comes into operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Two of these Orders will make some difference to our farmers.  We have all taken this policy of tariffs so much for granted that few have the hardihood to say anything by way of protest or to question the wisdom of what we are doing or to question the prices which the Irish people are asked to pay.  At this point, I am only asking the Minister to tell the House what, in his view, will be the result of these Orders so far as the price of the commodities to our farmers is concerned.  I hope he will tell us what the effects will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When you impose a tariff on a product which everyone must buy it means that we are all put in the same position. I submit that the only people who will buy this wire are our farmers and that they will buy it for fences. The imposition of a duty on steel mesh hits our farmers too.  It is very easy to impose a number of taxes like this on the farming community.  Other sections of the community are not <Col N="237" /> aware of these taxes because they do not press on them.  When the farmers come to claim against all the extra charges they have to carry, and want to have them met somehow or other by our consumers at home&mdash;because they cannot do very much about the consumers abroad&mdash;many people will talk out with great vigour against the &ldquo;wicked farmers&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not know what effect these Orders will have.  If one effect will be a restriction on the use of fencing wire, then it will not be good for our farming economy.  It will not be a good thing if the farmer does not make the best use of his fields in the most economic way.  Apart altogether from the cost of the labour involved in the erection of these fences, if the cost of the wire itself is increased the farmer will ask himself whether or not the whole thing is worth the trouble and the expense.</P>
    <P>Then, again, there is the question of the value of money.  That is very difficult to determine.  We have an Irish made milk tank on the market at the moment.  The Irish manufactured article weighs 25 lbs. and costs 56/-. Also on the market is a German made milk tank weighing about 33½ lbs., the retail price of which is 56/&mdash;the same price as the Irish manufactured lighter milk tank.  Anybody who has had experience of handling creamery tanks will realise that a tank weighing 25 lbs. will not stand up to much hardship and abuse.</P>
    <P>I submit that the Irish-manufactured tank represents a very considerable depreciation in the quality that a man is getting for his money.  I do not know what standards the Minister may have in mind by which to judge the value of the home-manufactured fencing wire as against the foreign-manufactured product.  Will he judge it on the weight per yard, or what? The Minister says the price will be related to the price of the wire rod, which is imported.  I suppose there will be some check, though I do not know who will keep it.</P>
    <P>My feeling about all these mounting burdens on our agricultural community is that there comes a point when somebody <Col N="238" /> has to stop or somebody cries out that he cannot go on any longer. I do not say that our farmers are in that position at the moment but I think the best of it has passed.</P>
    <P>Senator Fearon fears that certain difficulties may be created from one aspect of the imposition of these duties: I see a danger of difficulties being created from another angle.  I realise that we cannot have things both ways.  Apparently we are not able to establish a new industry here right away and to put the product on the market at a competitive price.  I suppose that is understandable.  My fear is that, behind all these duties, we are building up a sheltered community who never want to go out beyond the fence to feel the blast. Such a position is even worse for our community than to have no industry at all.  When the sun is always shining, people become lazy and indolent.  They love to enjoy the sun and the shelter.</P>
    <P>It is said that the most vigorous races on earth are those in climes where they have to battle for existence. It is very important that the Minister should not cease to emphasise to the people in industry in this country, and who want to have the shelter, that a time will come when they can no longer be certain that the shelter which they love will be there and that, therefore, they had better prepare themselves as quickly as possible to feel the blast of the competitive world.</P>
    <P>Henceforth our farmers will meet much more intense competition than they have met for some years past and it is well to remind manufacturers of products which farmers buy that they must keep that fact constantly in mind. If our farmers have to carry the burden of people whom the nation is sheltering with tariffs, and if our farmers are taxed while, at the same time, they are battling with outside competition, the job of the Irish farmer will be made even more difficult than it is and that is where the Minister must come in and play his part.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>If one did not know Senator Baxter as well as I do, one might conclude, from the speech which <Col N="239" /> he has just made, that he is an opponent of Irish industry.  For some reason known only to himself, Senator Baxter seems to have a very pathetic view on every matter that comes up for discussion.  The policy of the development of Irish industry is accepted by all Parties in this State. To achieve that end, it has also been accepted that protection must be given at the outset.  That is just what is being done under this Bill, in the majority of cases.</P>
      <P>My main reason for speaking on this matter is to welcome Order No. 314. I should like to say how much we who come from the West, and particularly from Galway, appreciate the encouragement which the provisions of this Order give to the promoters of an industry in Galway City to proceed with the work.  That appreciation has already been shown by Galway Corporation in making a site available to the promoters, and, while the work on the erection of the factory has not begun, it is expected that it will commence early in the New Year.  Already the workers are in training and there is in the premises of one of the largest merchants in the city a display of some of the products of this industry which has gained the admiration of all.  If we in Galway have any grievance, it is a grievance in relation to our disappointment that a much greater effort has not been made&mdash;it may be more the fault of the local people than otherwise&mdash;to give to the people in this area the benefits which were expected from the Undeveloped Areas Act.  This is one of the first, and we welcome it, and, as I say, we appreciate the action of the Minister in giving the encouragement he has given to the setting up of this industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Order No. 309, I wonder if I correctly understood the Minister to say that this was not a matter of quota but a matter of a commodity being subject to a duty? I understand that the new spinning factories are doing an excellent job of work.  I have heard that from users of their products, particularly in the hosiery trade, who tell me that the yarn being spun in the various factories <Col N="240" /> here is quite as good as the imported yarn.  Though there is a slight price differential at the moment it is hoped to get over it in a short period.  The labour content of the secondary industries, however, would be much higher than that of the primary industry and if there was any adverse reaction, if because of this Order they were unable to get certain types of yarn, the Minister would be well advised to reconsider it.</P>
      <P>This is rather a technical matter.  I do not know to what counts the Irish factories spin but I take it they spin to the counts which are most popular; but in the case of yarns of certain finer counts which the machinery would not be able to produce it would be advisable if the Minister would include in his Order a licensing clause.  I do not know whether that would run counter to the liberalisation agreement with O.E.E.C. but certain secondary industries may be affected if they are confined entirely to the products of the Irish cotton mills.  I congratulate the Minister on this further evidence of his desire to develop Irish industry.</P>

      <P>I understand the purpose of the Bill is to encourage the development and expansion of home industries and to increase employment as a result.  I believe that the encouragement given has, to a certain extent, justified the legislation, but there are many who feel that certain industrialists&mdash;not all&mdash;are taking advantage of the sympathetic attitude of every Government towards the development of home industries to charge excessive prices for their products.  You will find in the manufacturing class, as in <Col N="241" /> every class, the conscientious man as well as the man with the rather elastic conscience.</P>
      <P>It has also been alleged&mdash;I do not know with what truth&mdash;that certain employers or industrialists utilise legislation of this type for the purpose of increasing the cost of the goods they manufacture.  They do it in an indirect way by putting it up to their employees that they cannot continue as they are and they cannot maintain the numbers they have in employment, so long as the article they produce is sold at a certain price, and they look for increased protection.  The net result of this action by the employers is that the workers will look for increased wages, and the employer for extra protection.  Manufacturers and employees are both organised.  Manufacturers have an organisation to look after their interests and the workers have an organisation, and a very good one, to look after theirs; but the consumer has no organisation and he looks to the Government to protect his interests.</P>
      <P>It has been alleged from time to time that certain goods which are not manufactured in this country and which have to be imported are sold at a very much higher price than that obtaining in the country of origin.  I do not know how true that is, as I have no personal experience of it, but I do know that a Bill went through this House and through the Dáil to protect the interests of consumers.  That measure was the Restrictive Practices Act which is now nearly a year old.  I do not know if the country has any evidence yet that any good has come from it.  There is no doubt that, when the Minister introduced that legislation, he saw there was a reason for it. Perhaps the fact that the Bill has been passed has been responsible for doing away with the practices it was designed to prevent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite an amount of comment is to be heard in the country with regard to a certain matter which was raised in the other House recently, namely, the increased charge for bottles of a certain class, compared with that obtaining in countries to which these <Col N="242" /> goods are exported.  I know that the Minister has a very reasonable explanation for that, but people feel that, in so far as other exports are concerned, the reason which justifies an increased price to the purchaser of the home-manufactured bottle at home would not justify the charges for other goods which are produced and sold at a higher price here than in the country to which they are exported.  These are matters on which the general public are entitled to get information, and it would greatly settle their views and minds on the matter if they had an explanation as to the reason for these differences.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to speak on this small Bill, but, in view of the remarks made by Senator Baxter and Senator Ruane, I feel that I should not leave it entirely to the Minister to answer what I suggest are some of the reckless statements which were made.  I am getting a little tired of having these reiterated charges as to the manufacturers in this country being a sheltered class made on every occasion on which we have before us any measure dealing with tariffs of any kind, whether temporary or permanent. We have had that statement this evening from Senator Baxter, and we have just heard from Senator Ruane that a certain proportion of the manufacturers are taking advantage of the protection they enjoy.</P>
      <P>I think it is well to emphasise that protection is not peculiar to this country. The protection of industries is an important factor in the economy of such wonderful nations as the United States and Germany and other countries with an industrial tradition, where there would be no suggestion at all that protection was being used to bolster up prices, a complaint which we are continually hearing here.  There are considerations other than price that affect the rulers of these countries. There is this all-important question of the national economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always refrained in this House from making any criticism of the farmer.  I think Senators Baxter and Ruane will agree that the greater <Col N="243" /> amount of employment we can find in factories the greater the consuming public for the products of our farms. The Minister is well able to take care of the direct challenge made to him on the question of the price of bottles. The industries of this country to-day&mdash; I make this as a deliberate statement &mdash;in the light of the length of their operation, the scope of the domestic market and the difficulties of getting into the export market, will compare more than favourably with the industries established in many other countries of its size and type in the world. I can be taken up on that and I would be very glad to be taken up on it.</P>
    <P>I do not think it helps either our industrial activity or general economy to have members of this House on any or every occasion that presents itself to them coming along and making a statement of the kind we heard this afternoon.  To the degree that there is protection in any country, protection may be described as shelter, but the word has been given a wrong meaning in this country and I hope we will have an end of that kind of criticism.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the general policy with which this Bill is concerned, I would like to ask the Minister one or two questions.  We all accept the argument in respect of protection for infant industries.  That is common ground, but the question arises as to when an infant industry reaches maturity.  I do not know what criterion applies as to when an industry no longer requires the protection it originally obtained.  In the absence of any other criterion, I would say that just as a human being attains maturity after 21 years so also should industries which have enjoyed protection for 21 years be regarded as coming of age after 21 years.  They should throw off protection and stand before the world free to meet competition from all quarters.  I look forward to the coming of age of a good many industries, including perhaps the one in which Senator Summerfield is interested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a tax on wire mesh.  Net wire is part of the cost of production. <Col N="244" /> It is also part of the cost of extending our plantations which badly need extension as far as afforestation and shelter belts erected by farmers are concerned.  If that tax adds one iota to the cost of poultry production, I think it will require a great deal of justification.</P>
    <P>I, myself, had some little experience of the effect of taxation on the price of implements used by people in the country.  I had occasion to buy a new blade for a Bushman saw.  A friend of mind undertook to get it for me.  He said it would cost only 4/-.  He got it all right, but the next time I saw him he told me that a tax had been put on the Bushman saw-blades and I had to pay 7/- for it.  At our time of life we do not look forward to many decades but it would cheer my old age if the new saw-blade industry, when it had grown up, having reached 21 years of age, would enable me to buy a Bushman saw-blade for 4/- instead of 7/-.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the points raised by Senator Fearon, the Minister for Health was given every opportunity of expressing his views upon the proposed duties upon spectacle frames and injection solutions before the Government took decisions. Senator Fearon will be relieved to know that there is no reason to apprehend that all possible requirements of these goods cannot be produced here and be available at prices which will be no higher, and may, indeed, be lower than the price of corresponding goods imported from Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of spectacle frames there are three firms engaged in their production. They have an output capacity considerably in excess of their present sales and the possibility of any scarcity or any need to import goods to supplement their production does not arise. I said when referring to the matter originally that there are some hundreds of varieties of spectacle frames, and it is not very easy to establish an absolute comparison between the prices charged here and the prices of corresponding frames produced in Great Britain.  A general review of the situation appears to establish that prices <Col N="245" /> here are certainly not higher than prices in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>In the case of injection solutions the firm producing them is in a position to meet all requirements of the type of solutions to which the duty applies.  It does not apply to all types of solutions.  I said that of their total production in the past 12 months three-fifths was exported.  There is therefore a reserve to supply home needs if it should be necessary to call upon it.  In fact, of course, the output can expand at a rapid rate to meet any demand upon it.  Again, the evidence is that the prices at which these injection solutions are available are in many cases lower than when imported from Great Britain.  The sheet glass duty does not affect optical glass.</P>
    <P>I am not quite sure what Senator Fearon meant when he talked about the duty on tableware.  He said that if prices fell in Great Britain the duty goes up here and that if costs rise here the duty goes up also; that the duty always goes up.  It is, of course, possible for any firm to export a surplus production at a lower price than it secures in its home market.  British firms can export tableware at prices at least as low as those at which the Irish firms can produce them.  The Irish firm can export to Great Britain at prices which may secure sales for it there.</P>
    <P>In the case of delf there is a substantial trade in seconds, that is to say, goods which do not come up to the standard of first-class goods.  The design may be slightly awry or there may be some other defect.  The natural tendency of the firm producing them is to get rid of these slightly inferior products in some market other than that in which they normally operate. That has been one of the difficulties about building up the industry here. It is one of the reasons why the manufacturers are looking for an export market so as not to allow the seconds to be sold in the same market as first-class quality goods.  It might happen that the retailer might not always be prepared to distinguish between first-class quality and the other when offering them to the customers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="246" /> There is no reason why the production of delfware in this country should not be as economical as in Great Britain.  There are certain advantages even from the point of view of supplies from Britain in the location of the factory at Arklow against the location of the potteries in Great Britain.  Now that a very high standard of efficiency has been secured by local workers, I hope to see it growing in size and taking the export trade in its stride.</P>
    <P>With regard to wire netting and barbed wire, Senator Baxter asked what standards are being applied.  I said when introducing this Bill the rule of thumb test we apply is to judge the efficiency of a concern here by comparing its prices with British home market prices.  I realise that it is not always a sound one because British home market prices may be subsidised by export prices or alternatively may be subsidising export prices.  In regard to these goods, however, I am informed by their manufacturers here that in the case of barbed wire their price is £56 per ton as against a British price of £60 per ton; in the case of wire netting their price is £78 per ton against a British domestic price of £97 10s. per ton.  The British export price for wire netting may be lower than their domestic price but even if lower it is still higher than the price at which it is produced here.  I recognise, however, that in the case of these two commodities the British price may not be able the sole criterion because continental prices are at the moment lower than British prices.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is fair to expect Irish manufacturers to be able to produce the goods they are concerned with at a lower price than they can be imported from any country in the world.  There are some countries where social standards are different from what they are here and in any event it is always possible to find temporary conditions in some country which will enable cheap purchases to be made even though a permanent trade upon the basis of these prices is not likely to result.  In this particular case the fact that we can produce these goods and sell them at prices which appear to be lower than British domestic <Col N="247" /> prices, is I think, a fair enough test that a good job is being done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister have the figure of the import price for barbed wire from the Continent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I made inquiries in that connection and I got a price quoted for bright wire which was lower than the price quoted for the wire rod from which it is made.  That obviously could not be a permanent price.  As I said, I am examining the position of this firm in relation to continental prices at the present time and I do not want to say more than that.  They can draw their wire rod from the Continent and the price of their manufactured products must be higher than the wire rod.  I have to satisfy myself that these prices are not unduly high, even if below the prices in Great Britain.  I want to be quite clear on this because if that is so some other test than the British price may have to be applied.</P>
      <P>The price of steel is falling and I think we are in sight of the time when the British will have to change the present conditions where their export prices are higher than their home prices, in which it is possible for them to subsidise the prices of fabricated steel goods in their home market in the way they have been doing.  During this transition period we have to make certain allowances and not be too critical of the price of Irish goods in comparison with the price at which occasional lots of similar goods appear to be purchasable.  By establishing this industry in this country we admittedly deprive ourselves of the opportunity of making an occasional bargain but I think that on the whole we gain by the development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Johnston asked what criterion should be applied, why not automatically wipe out a tariff after 21 years?  In a publication I received recently containing an article by Henry Ford, of America, in regard to the abolition of tariffs, he was prepared to take a much longer period.  After all, America is a much larger country than we are and if they think it was necessary to keep their tariff system in <Col N="248" /> operation to give their manufacturers a fair opportunity of developing, we are hardly to be criticised for doing the same thing.</P>
    <P>I did contemplate, however, that over the course of the next two or three years a systematic review should be carried out on all tariffs in operation for the purpose of establishing the progress made in consequence of them and the need to maintain them at the rates originally imposed.  We have carried out an industrial review in the Department of Industry and Commerce mainly for the purpose of investigating new opportunities for industrial development and the material which has emerged as a result of that review is of such tremendous interest that we think we should follow it up along the lines I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter said that we are not able to establish new industries on a competitive basis, that we should accept that and proceed accordingly. I do not accept that at all.  It is true that a new concern operating a process which was not previously employed in this country, having to train raw labour in the technical aspects of that process is at a disadvantage for a time.  But similar new concerns in any other country would almost inevitably be at some disadvantage too.  The fact is that most of our new concerns have got equipment and production techniques far more modern and far more efficient than those operating in many British factories at the present time.  It may be true that the most vigorous races are those that have the most hardship.</P>
    <P>In Senator Baxter's enthusiasm to see a vigorous race developing here through a process of hardship he will perhaps be delighted to know that there is something in the statement I made at a recent meeting that we have the most liberalised trade régime in Europe.  That fact is not often appreciated. We have fulfilled in full the liberalisation agreement of O.E.E.C. Far more powerful countries, including Great Britain, have not succeeded in doing that.  In other words the restriction of imports into these countries are far more extensive and far more <Col N="249" /> definitely applied than restriction on imports into this country.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donnell inquired concerning a duty on single cotton yarn. Single cotton yarns were subject to quota until July last.  In July, the quota Order was revoked and a duty was substituted.  We did so by reason of our obligations under the O.E.E.C. agreement.</P>
    <P>I do not want to enter into an argument with Senator Ruane with regard to the export price on bottles.  It is clear that firms can export their goods at a lower net return than they seek in sales on the home market.  That is normally the case.  Quite early in my life I had to deal with the flour milling industry.  I had the flour millers before me and I asked them how the flour millers in England could sell flour in this country at a lower price than the Irish flour millers were charging. Their mills appear to be as efficiently equipped, they got wheat at more or less the same price and their labour costs were no higher.  They said: &ldquo;We will sell flour in England at a lower price and lower than the British millers are charging because it is always possible to step up production and sell the marginal output at a lower price and still secure a profit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When I was in the newspaper business I was struck by the fact that the whole of the expenses of the production of a newspaper were the same whether you produced one or a million copies of the paper.  When you had the paper made up and the plates upon the press if you succeeded in running off 45,000 copies instead of 40,000 the extra 5,000 cost no more than the paper and the ink and represented a substantial economy in the total production of the firm.</P>
    <P>The same applies in almost any industry.  In the case of the glass bottle industry it was contended by the manufacturers to me that if they got 17 tons of metal out of a tank instead of 15 tons, the extra two tons would cost only the materials which went into the tank.  Labour costs, overhead charges and other costs would remain precisely the same as if they were producing 15 tons.  Consequently the <Col N="250" /> bottles made from the extra two tons could be sold, if a market could be obtained, at a much lower price than the bottles made from the 15 tons.  By producing them and selling them at a lower price&mdash;it was only on that basis they could be sold&mdash;they were able to keep down the whole of their overhead costs and sell their entire output at a lower price.  If they lost that additional production they would have to increase their price in order to break level.</P>
    <P>I certainly would not like to see any mentality developing amongst our people which would operate to discourage manufacturers seeking export markets, even if they have to find them on the basis of charging for export products less than the home market price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the point I made about the cost of barbed wire, the Minister indicated that from the information available to him the price at which the Irish manufacturers were prepared to sell was actually lower than the British price.  The Minister knows quite well that the Irish farmer is concerned about being able to get what he wants at the lowest price at which it can be bought. My impression is that we have been importing this material from the Continent and that the British price is not a comparable price at the moment.  I am no more an opponent or an antagonist of tariff policy than Senator Summerfield but no one does that tariff policy more damage than the enthusiast who is always ready to declaim against anyone who is ready to question anything about it.  You are always suspicious about anyone when they protest too much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish farmer has justification at least for being doubtful about the value of the product he is getting from some <Col N="251" /> of our tariffed industries making things which he is using on the land.  I do not want to get 100 yards of barbed wire with thorns at every foot, nor do I want to get the thorns when they are going around about one and a half inches of the wire.  I want to get something I have been accustomed to handle in the past, that you can handle and that does not tear the hands off the men.  I do not want carelessly manufactured products put on the market for farmers.</P>

For the sake of the good name of Irish industry, Irish industrialists and Irish workers, let us see that we are efficient.  I have no use for the person who wants to denounce Irish industry, but less use for the Irish industrialists, on any side of the House or whether occupying a ministerial post, who think we can build up industries and foist a product on the consumer which is not what he has been accustomed to have and which is not as good as we can manufacture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite convinced that we can have the machinery here, the modern equipment we ought to be able to get. We should have the management ability somewhere.  If we have not it amongst the natives, we should be able to buy it for a while and train the workers.  If we can teach them to work hard and if they do that, we will have a product which everybody will buy at home and which we will be able to sell abroad.  The people who are going to prevent that are the <Col N="252" /> people who protest against voices like mine being raised to declare that the Irish industrialists must become as efficient as they can.  We should not expect Irish farmers to buy any type of product merely because they see &ldquo;Made in Ireland&rdquo; stamped on it. If they set that as a fixed aim and then told us about their difficulty in achieving it, we would sympathise with them; but we will not understand them when they tell us what they have been making is the best in the world and we should be satisfied with it here, when our experience in some fields points to the contrary and when we have information over which we can stand because it is our own personal information.</P>

In this case we had an Order applying to the bodies of road commercial vehicles.  Again we ran foul of obligations under the O.E.E.C.  Agreement and the council of the organisation did not agree with our departure from liberalisation in regard to these goods or to our proposal to make a switch between them and another class of goods on the non-liberalised list.

    <P>So long as we maintain protection by way of quota upon woollen and worsted fabrics, it is necessary to keep control over the importation of these imitation fabrics as well.

      <P>To a certain extent, it is.  From the trade point of view, they are using it to replace the shoddy. This Order merely protects the worsted manufacturers more than the woollen manufacturers.  This cloth is for the manufacture of men's cheap clothing. It is quite a reasonably good cloth. However, I do not think it is the sort of fabric that is suitable for the climate of this country.  Unless a mill is established here for the production of a similar type of cloth, or a substitute cloth, this Order may affect lower priced goods.</P>

    <Title>Courts of Justice Bill, 1953&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has four main objects.  First of all, it proposes to increase the jurisdiction of the Circuit and District Courts in civil cases so as to bring the jurisdiction of these courts more into line with the present day value of money.  Secondly, it provides for a rearrangement of the Circuit Court circuits and the District Court districts. Thirdly, it allows for the appointment of an additional High Court judge, which appointment has become necessary because of the congestion of business in the High Court.  Finally, it authorises increased salaries for judges and justices.  In addition to its main provisions the Bill contains a few miscellaneous provisions about which I think there will be no difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not much I need to say in regard to judicial salaries.  The Bill carries out the recommendations of the Select Committee of the Dáil except in so far as the date of payment is concerned. The view of the Government is that, because the increased salaries proposed in the Bill are so much better than the salaries originally proposed, <Col N="258" /> it would not be fair to the taxpayer to ask the Oireachtas to authorise payment of the new salaries from a date earlier than 1st April, 1953.</P>
    <P>As regards judicial pensions, it is proposed that a judge appointed in future shall not be entitled to retire on pension until he has reached the age of 65 years unless his retirement is brought about by ill-health.  The same provision will apply to justices. In addition, the Bill proposes that the qualifying period of service of a justice who is to get full pension shall be reduced from 30 years to 20 years.  The pension provisions of the Bill will not apply to existing judges at all, but they will apply to existing justices, if they so elect.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill deals with the expenses of members of the judiciary and the section will replace Section 77 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936, which has been found defective and difficult of interpretation.  It is not intended to alter the existing practice in regard to the payment of these expenses and Section 5 of the Bill will simply provide a clear and unequivocal statutory foundation for what has always been the practice.</P>
    <P>As I intimated in the Dáil, the Government does not propose to proceed with the reorganisation of the Circuit Court circuits, nor do I propose to go ahead with the reorganisation of the District Court districts, until the report comes to hand of a special committee we propose to set up to inquire into the operation of the Courts of Justice Acts.  The Bill, however, proposes that power to re-organise should be given to the Government in the case of the circuits and to the Minister for Justice in the case of the districts.  In regard to the circuits the figures available leave no doubt that the work in the Circuit Court is unevenly distributed and that in some circuits there is too little work, whereas in the Dublin circuit the two judges permanently assigned may well have too much work.  The same is the position in regard to the District Court districts, outside the Dublin Metropolitan District.</P>
    <P>When the circuits have been re-organised, the idea is that there shall <Col N="259" /> be one supernumerary circuit judge who will be available to assist any of his colleagues who, from time to time, may need assistance.  In the District Court, we will probably have five or six extra supernumerary justices who will also be available to assist their colleagues.  This position in both the Circuit and District Court will last for a few years and will act as an insurance against any particular circuit or district created under the Bill having too much work.  As I said, however, it is not proposed to go ahead with the reorganisations until the report of the special committee is available.  By that time, we will be able to see more clearly how the increased jurisdiction is affecting the work of both courts.</P>
    <P>I now come to the proposal to increase the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court and the District Court.  In both cases, the reason for the increase is the same, namely, that money has lost more than half its value since the present financial limits were set by the Courts of Justice Act, 1924.  In the Bill as introduced the increase in tort was limited to £25 but the demand to increase the tort jurisdiction to £50 was so insistent in the Dáil and so strongly supported by a number of Deputies on both sides of the Houses, including solicitor Deputies, that I agreed to do so.  The matter was left to a free vote and the Dáil decided by a large majority that the jurisdiction in tort and contract should be the same.</P>
    <P>I come now to deal with the miscellaneous provisions in the Bill. Section 12 reintroduces a practice which existed during the emergency under which High Court judges on circuit did not visit appeal towns where there was no business.  This section was put in at the suggestion of the president of the High Court.  Section 13 of the Bill allows for the remittal and transfer of actions on consent of the parties by the master of the High Court.  This section was also put in at the suggestion of the president of the High Court.</P>
    <P>Section 15 allows for the reconstitution <Col N="260" /> of the Superior Court Rules Committee and provides that the Council of the Incorporated Law Society shall be entitled to two nominated members, instead of the president of the society who is at present an <i>ex-officio</i> member. This is being done at the request of the society.  The section also clears up a doubtful matter concerned with the power of the rules committee to make rules in regard to election petitions.</P>
    <P>Section 19 of the Bill validates a practice which is considered to be of doubtful legality and under which part-heard actions are transferred from one venue in a circuit to another.  Section 29 of the Bill clears up a difficulty which arises under the Rent Restrictions Acts and this section was inserted because of a recommendation of the Rents and Leaseholds Commission.</P>
    <P>Section 31, of the Bill, which deals with desertion cases, validates an existing practice which we have been advised has no legal foundation. Finally, Section 30 of the Bill makes it quite clear that there is an appeal to the Circuit Court from an order of the District Court under Section 1 of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1907.</P>
    <P>The foregoing are the main provisions of the Bill and the other provisions are purely consequential. The immediate cost of granting to the members of the judiciary the increased salaries proposed and of providing an additional High Court judge will be approximately £29,000 a year but the eventual cost, when the number of circuits and districts have been reduced, is likely to be no more than £16,000 a year.  The increased salaries will, of course, mean higher pension charges and there may be some slight increases in judicial travelling and subsistence expenses.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I should like, as I did in the Dáil, to thank, on behalf of the Government, the members of the Select Committee of the Dáil who so kindly gave their time to the study of judicial remuneration and produced such a helpful report.  I should also like to thank those members of the two branches of the profession who saw me from time to time and raised <Col N="261" /> various points in regard to the Bill. At times we were able to accept the arguments advanced and, where we were unable to accept them, they were nevertheless given the most careful consideration.  In all cases the views of each branch of the profession were brought to the attention of the Government. I am saying all this in case there may be any suggestion that the decisions in regard to the matters in the Bill were come to without full examination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill with which, in general, I think we all find ourselves in agreement.  The Bill has had a very curious history.  It is long delayed and could certainly be regarded now as being very much overdue. The Minister says it has four main objects, but, from the point of view of the layman, one could say that it consists of two entirely dissimilar parts, one of which deals with salaries of the members of the judiciary and the other with the jurisdiction of the Circuit and District Courts.  One would like to suggest that these two things should be kept separate, that the salary question could have been dealt with in a Bill entirely by itself and the other matters dealt with in another Bill, because then the delays that have taken place might not have been so great and so bad for the persons concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first point that strikes me with regard to the connection between these two things is that the jurisdiction of certain courts must naturally be altered in view of the changed value of money and that jurisdiction is altered by doubling in tort and in contract the amount of money that can be involved in cases before these courts, but that particular procedure is not followed with regard to salaries; that is to say, the district justice and the circuit judge now find themselves in the position that business which did not come into their courts before now comes into them, and the district justice is dealing with claims for larger sums of money because £25 in 1924 is considered more than the equivalent of £50 to-day.  If that is so, surely the £25 he got in 1924 would be worth far more than £50 to-day, but, while his <Col N="262" /> work is increased on the basis that the value of money is half what it was, his salary is not increased on that basis at all.</P>
    <P>Before coming to the merits of this matter, it strikes me also that it should be possible&mdash;I know that the law is complicated and difficult and that it is quite foolish to say that the draftsmen should write in plain and simple language, because they just cannot, for a variety of reasons, one, of course, being the history of all these legal matters&mdash;to set down in the Bill, so that any ordinary person could find it, what the salaries of the judges are going to be.  You cannot find them in the Bill, unless you do a certain amount of mathematics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>A little addition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is much more difficult than addition.  The salaries were fixed at certain figures in 1924. In 1947 they were all increased on a percentage basis, 25 per cent. in some cases and a different percentage in others.  Having worked that out, you come along and find in this Bill the addition of a sum of money, not a percentage.  You find what their salaries are and you then discover that you did not take notice of the change in the value of money.  It certainly seems extraordinary that you could not put into this Bill, in 1953, after a delay of two years, what the salaries of judges are going to be so that he who runs may read.  You would require three Acts of Parliament and a ready reckoner to find out what the salaries of the judges are and if you are not very skilled in the reading of Acts of Parliament and the handling of a ready reckoner you will be in a bad position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the question of jurisdiction, the Minister's statement that that is going to be the subject of a special inquiry would indicate <Col N="263" /> that we ought, perhaps, accept that and let the experiment be tried for a period until the committee has made its report and confine ourselves to the question of salaries.</P>
      <P>Certain members of the judiciary, district justices&mdash;I do not want to argue this but it certainly should be said&mdash;were promised in the clearest possible manner in an official letter from the Department of Justice that their salaries would be increased from the 1st July, 1951.  Matters were then held up and a special committee appointed.  The special committee recommended unanimously, I think, that their salaries should be increased as from the 1st April, 1952.  Now, in the month of December, 1953, we are on the eve of passing into law a Bill which will increase their salaries from the 1st April, 1953.</P>
      <P>I suggest that there must be a considerable amount of bungling and mismanagement in that and very bad faith with people who have no remedy such as other people who can go out and hold public meetings and so forth.  We should remember that all these people, from the highest to the lowest, are doing a very important job.  One may be impatient with slowness and it may be that sometimes people would like to streamline certain processes, but I am entirely confident that the present system, where the judiciary is entirely separated from the Executive, is as sound one and it is well worth while putting up with delays and occasional stupidity for the purpose of having the whole system exactly as it is.  Let us appreciate what we have now and what we would have if we changed the system, having regard to the system of courts which obtains in other places.</P>
      <P>It may be unpopular to advocate good pay for people whose salaries appear high, but these people are doing an all-important job and they should be placed in a secure and attractive position.  It would be well worth while for everybody's sake; it would be well worth while not only for the commercial community, but for ordinary poor people as well as rich people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The comment I would like to make <Col N="264" /> about it&mdash;I made it often before&mdash;is that these people have the misfortune to be specialists and not administrators. In the State as it is now managed the specialist, whether he be a lawyer, engineer or doctor, is not going to get the same treatment from Departments and from Ministers as the administrator.  The increases these people are getting are not in line with the increases given, I think, to the higher grades of the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>At any rate, más mall is mithid&mdash;I suppose it is better late than never. The people who have been waiting for these increases have made a very sound case.  They are getting rather meagre justice at this particular moment.  They are getting it in a very belated manner and apparently in a very begrudging fashion, but such as the Bill is we are not able to improve on it.  We have to be thankful for small mercies.  I would like to see this question of salaries separated from such questions as those relating to jurisdiction and appointments.  If that were so, one could get a clearer discussion.  In the meantime I am in favour of passing the Bill as it stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with practically everything Senator Hayes has said. This action of the Minister's is belated and I do not know why this matter does not commend itself to the Administration and the Legislature generally.  On the whole we can be proud of our courts and of the people who adorn our benches.  I agree that if you want to secure the services of the very best available to the people in a judicial capacity you must be prepared to pay them well.  It would be very unfortunate from the point of view of the administration of justice and the interpretation of the law if we did not have the best possible talent available to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How are we going to secure that if we do not show our appreciation by paying a remuneration comparable with the remuneration paid to men of the same ability in other spheres? District justices in the country areas are paid lower salaries than their colleagues in the City of Dublin.  I do not say that the people in the City of <Col N="265" /> Dublin are overpaid; I do not think they are.  I find it difficult to understand why it is that we pay members of the same type of court one salary in one place and a different salary in another place.</P>
    <P>I imagine we should not put anybody on the District Court in the country if he is not of such competence that he could be transferred to the capital at any time.  He should have inherent in him that understanding of the law, that wisdom and general knowledge which would justify his transfer from any part of the country to the City of Dublin if that were regarded as good for the service. As I say, members of the District Court are paid less in the rural districts than in the city.  If the Administration is not satisfied with the person or if they do not like him, they can hop him from one part of the country to the other.  I do not know what the position is in that respect.</P>
    <P>The interpretation and administration of the law are just as difficult in rural districts as in the City of Dublin.  Life is, perhaps, complicated. I think that in an urban centre in the country you find more complicated problems to resolve.  The urban and rural communities have their difficulties and a district justice must be able to understand both sides.</P>
    <P>There is the view that these people are paid on the basis of the amount of work done.  I think that is an old appreciation of the value of services rendered.  If that be so, I wonder is there any other set of servants administering the affairs of this State who are paid on their output. Is that not what it amounts to?  If that be the standard fixed, they are just paid on the number of cases they handle in a year.  I wish we could do that with everybody from the top to the bottom.  If everybody in this State were paid on that basis it would be amazing how many people would be going around down-at-heel, but at least you would know when they were down-at-heel that they were paid on the basis of output.</P>
    <P>If that is the basis, and I understand it is, it is a thoroughly unsound one. <Col N="266" /> If you take the case of our Circuit Court judges, I think their salaries are the same wherever they serve, whether it is the city or the country.  I do not know why there should be this reflection on the members of the judiciary who serve as district justices and it is something which the people from the rural community should take exception to.  The person whom you require to administer the law and justice in the country to-day really wants to know the country and wants to know his people and it may very well be it is a mark of the competence and efficiency of district justices in many areas, and an indication that they are doing their job well that there is not more work to do.  If a man has the common sense and the capacity to ensure the maintenance of peace and make people who want to go into his court, appreciate that it is not going to be so profitable, they will stay out and settle their differences.  That man is lowering his output by doing that.</P>
    <P>I consider there is justification for a re-examination in this regard.  Speaking as a countryman, I believe that there should be the same equitable treatment in regard to the studying of problems from the bench down the country as in Dublin.</P>
    <P>There is just one other comment I want to make&mdash;and it is in support of the Bill&mdash;in regard to the increase in jurisdiction of our courts.  That is a very welcome decision.  If the Minister took the line of least resistance in that matter I am very glad that the Dáil had the common sense and the understanding of the needs as they are in the country to-day to decide as they did.  The more decentralisation we have, even in the law, the better for the country.  This whole idea of cramming all the law into the Dublin courts is not good from any point of view.  I have no doubt at all about the competence of these people to determine issues.  In fact, whether a lawyer becomes merely a district justice or the president of the High Court or the Supreme Court, in many instances it is merely a matter of fortune.  Therefore, there is no doubt that many of the people that man our benches in the lower courts are as competent to give <Col N="267" /> a decision on the issues that come before them as any lawyer sitting in a higher court.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that the Minister could have gone even further and justice would still be done.  However, in so far as he has broken from the position as it was and increased the jurisdiction of the lower courts I am glad to support him.  I agree generally with what Senator Hayes has said and it would be a very good thing if the Minister would also agree because I believe what he said is supported by reason and fact.  If the Oireachtas wanted to do justice in the way it should be prepared to do it, the line that should have been followed by the Minister is the line indicated by Senator Hayes in his speech.</P>

      <P>Táimse leis i bfabhar an Bhille seo agus, ar nós na gcainteoirí eile a labhair, is dóigh liom gur cheart é a dhéanamh roimhe seo; ach is fearr déanach ná riamh mar adúirt an Seanadóir Ó hAodha.  Tá dualgas orrainne anseo neamhspleáchas na mBreithiún do choimeád sa tír seo.  Tá sé sin curtha síos i mBunreacht na hEireann, ach níor leor go mbeadh sé sa Bhunreacht mura mbeadh sé le feiceaíl trí íocaíocht a bheith ar aon-dul leis.  Ní fhéadfaidís a bheith neamh-spleách mura mbeadh íocaíocht ard a ndóthain acu chun na dualgaisí a bhíonn orthu do chomhlíonadh.</P>
      <P>I am thuairimse, go dtí seo do bhí bearna ró-mhór idir Breithiún na hArd-Chúirte agus na Cúirte Uachtaraí agus Breithiúin Cúirteanna Ioctaracha.  Is maith liom anois go bhfuil an bhearna sin á lionadh beagán, ach b'fhéidir go bhfuil sé róleathan fós.</P>
      <P>Is mór an tathrú atá tagtha i gcás an dlí.  Is cuimhin linn go léir an tráth sa tír seo nuair nach mbíodh meas madra ag na daoine ar an dlí ach do dob shin í an uair a bhí Rialtas Shasana i mbun na tíre ach anois unair atá rialú na tíre fúinn féin tá an meas ar an dlí agus ar na cúirteanna ag fás in aghaidh an lae.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said in Irish, I am very much in favour of this Bill.  It is only <Col N="268" /> right that those people who administer the law in this country should be placed and kept in an independent position.  The independence of the judiciary is guaranteed by the Constitution of the land but in my opinion that would not be sufficient without placing those people in an independent position as regards remuneration.  The judges of all the courts in the country, high and low, are placed in a position apart from the general community. They have to follow a certain rule of life and it does not matter whether they are judges of the Supreme Court, the High Court, the Circuit Court or the District Court.  They have to follow the same rule of life and have to preserve their immunity from the general public.  That in itself is a certain sacrifice to have to make.  They have also to observe a certain social standard, whether they are in the cities or in the country.  It is well that we would take that into our calculation when determining what remuneration these judges should get.</P>
    <P>The same principle applies to judges whether they belong to the upper courts or to the lower courts.  I have always held the view that there has been too much differentiation between the remuneration paid to the judges of the higher courts and that paid to the district justices.  The district justices have to live the same kind of life, they have to keep themselves apart from the people in the same way as the judges of the higher courts.  In any case I am glad to see that their salaries are being stepped up to a degree that will enable them to keep up their social standing in the country.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter referred to the differentiation proposed in this Bill between district justices in Dublin and Cork and those elsewhere.  He maintained they should all be on the same level when they are all qualified in the same way and that there should be no distinction in salary or any other way.  I would not hold with Senator Baxter in that.  Everyone knows the job of a district justice in Dublin is much more exacting than it is down the country.  There is a greater rush of business in the courts in Dublin and the cases that present <Col N="269" /> themselves are often more difficult and the justice would not have the same amount of time to deal with them. Again, the cost of living in the city is much higher than it is in the country and that must be taken into account. I think the Minister is wise in preserving the differentiation between metropolitan and country justices.</P>
    <P>There was a big discussion in the Dáil on this measure and I am glad that the Minister emerged from it with the Bill very little amended.  He was confronted with a good many lawyers. No doubt they were very helpful.  I have read the debates and I must say the contributions made on this measure in the Dáil were very good, but whether we would all agree with them or not is another matter.  As regards jurisdiction, I think it would not be appropriate in this House to go into that very much.  After all, the Dáil has already decided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFOReilly" hpid="Mr. P.F. O'Reilly Mr. P.F. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.F. O'Reilly</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dáil has already decided this by an overwhelming majority.  Of course, there is nothing to prevent us from discussing it here, but I do not think that anything we can do would alter the position that has been reached in the Dáil as regards the jurisdiction that should be given to the Circuit or District Courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was the question of the law of contract and the law of tort.  The financial limitation in both has been stepped up&mdash;from £25 to £50 in the case of contract and from £10 to £50 in the case of tort.  I would consider the latter a very great jump.  Whether it can be justified or not is another question.  I do not know if any really cogent argument was put forward in the Dáil for having the financial limitation in the case of the law of tort on the same level as it is in the case of the law of contract.  The question is whether it is easier for a district justice to come to a decision in the case of the law of tort than in the case of the law of contract.  I hold&mdash;as many of those who spoke in the Dáil held&mdash; that the law of contract is much simpler.  Where an issue on the law <Col N="270" /> of contract is being determined, you have first of all to find out whether there is a contract at all or not, whether there is a unity of wills to bring about a valid contract and then whether the terms or conditions of the contract have been fulfilled or whether they are capable of being fulfilled.  That does not take very long to decide.</P>
    <P>The case of tort is a much more difficult and complicated matter, especially in connection with those cases that come into courts from time to time, accident or &ldquo;knocking-down&rdquo; cases, where there is a plea of negligence put forward by the plaintiff against the defendant and a plea of contributory negligence put forward by the defendant against the plaintiff.  There is always this fictitious person who is known to the courts and to the law as &ldquo;the reasonable man&rdquo;, to ascertain what a reasonable man would do in such a case, whether he could have avoided the accident or not had the person exercised reasonable caution. All this has to be found out in an action in tort and is no easy matter.</P>
    <P>In any case whatever financial limitation is put to the jurisdiction of a district justice or Circuit Court judge there is always a way of circumventing it and, indeed, it is being done.  We all know that a client, on the advice of his lawyer, will go to the High Court, sometimes even with a flimsy case.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, whereas he might lose with a more serious case.  The best way to illustrate that is to give a practical example.  I remember a &ldquo;knocking-down&rdquo; case which was brought to the High Court although, indeed, it was more appropriate to the Circuit Court.  It had to be, then, an action for £1,000 damages.  It was the case of an old lady who was alleged to have been knocked down.  She was not knocked down at all.  She was turning the corner when a car came round at a quick pace.  She fell beside it in a fright.  She immediately went to bed and on the advice of her solicitor took an action against the driver of the motor-car.  The claim was filed in the <Col N="271" /> High Court but before it came to hearing the case was settled.  She got something like a couple of hundred pounds damages because the insurance company was frightened into settling the case when it was brought to the High Court.  Also, of course, there are higher fees for the lawyers in the High Court.  The case was settled and as soon as it was settled the old lady emerged as hale and hearty as ever.  I am only giving that as an example of how things can be defeated.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  No matter what some of the Senators have said about it, the retrospective payment is generous enough&mdash;going back, as it does, to the 1st April, 1953.  I am sure that those for whom the increases are intended will be quite satisfied.  I think their case is being fairly met.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.F. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>After many vicissitudes, the Courts of Justice Bill, 1953, has found its way into the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I would oppose this Bill, and strongly oppose it, were it not for what the Minister has told us.  He said that, in the relatively near future, we may have a commission set up which will inquire generally into the working of the courts and into the jurisdiction that will have been conferred upon them by this Bill and that, to some extent, the Bill will be only in the nature of an experiment.</P>
      <P>The question of the remuneration of judges and justices of our courts has been delayed too long.  That is another reason why I shall not oppose this Bill.  As Senator Hayes has indicated, the matter of the remuneration of judges should have been dealt with by a separate Bill, and another Bill should have been introduced to provide for the matters in the present Bill, other than the remuneration of members of the judiciary.  In the circumstances which I have mentioned, I am supporting this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I trust that the Minister's hopes as to the additional jurisdiction which he <Col N="272" /> is giving to the Circuit Court and the District Court will be justified.  I have an open mind on the matter.  As to the Circuit Court, I am rather inclined to think that the Minister is making a mistake in seeking to reduce the number of circuit judges by one. It may be that time will justify the Minister in his view that he will be able to do with only nine judges instead of, say, ten as to-day.  I have some experience of the Dublin Circuit Court.  We have two judges on that circuit who work extremely hard. They are doing their very utmost to keep abreast of their normal work within their jurisdiction to-day and they are finding it extremely difficult to do so.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that until, say, two years ago, we had three circuit judges sitting in Dublin.  To-day, we have only two.  After this Bill has been passed the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court will be considerably increased. I find it difficult to imagine that the judges who will be there will carry out all the work which they will have to do by reason of the increase of jurisdiction. I am not overlooking the fact that, to the extent that the jurisdiction of the District Court will have been increased, some work which they do to-day will be taken away and in that way make room for additional work. With the growth of Dublin and the growth of litigation generally and with the growth of business by virtue of Statute which has extended so much within recent years&mdash;with the added jurisdiction&mdash;it will be impossible for us in Dublin to carry on with only two circuit judges.  The Minister has told us that, by rearrangement of circuits elsewhere, he may be able to ensure that there will be no difficulty or trouble in getting the work done in the other circuits.  Let us hope the Minister is correct.  The jurisdiction of the District Court has been considerably extended.  Again, I have an open mind on that matter.  At one time I thought, in regard to the increase of the jurisdiction in tort from £10 to £50, that the Minister was going too far. Perhaps he is not.  We shall have great difficulty in some District Court areas in having the District Court <Col N="273" /> jurisdiction in contract and tort carried out to the satisfaction of people&mdash;at any rate, so far as time is concerned. In my view, it will be impossible in certain District Court areas to give full effect to the added jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I now come to the position with regard to the salaries of some justices. As the House has heard, there are different salaries for country and city district justices.  Senator Baxter suggested that perhaps the justices should be paid on a flat rate&mdash;that there should be one figure for all justices. Senator Kissane said no.  I do not know.  Possibly something can be said for both views.  A justice has a District Court near Cork City.  There is a justice near Waterford City, and we have a district justice near Dublin City.  To a very large extent, these justices do a great deal of city work. I think they should be paid in the same manner as justices appointed for cities who, under the Acts, are called metropolitan justices.  The Minister should provide that justices whose districts include part of cities, such as those I have mentioned, should be on the same basis in regard to salary as metropolitan justices.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed as to the salaries provided for justices, circuit judges and High and Supreme Court judges. I think that in all these cases the salaries should be higher.  Really, I think we do not pay these men in the way we should pay them.  We are extremely fortunate in this country in that our courts and our system of the administration of justice and, for that matter, our system of appointment of justices and judges command the respect and complete confidence of the people.  The fact that the people of this country have complete faith and confidence in our courts is a matter of which we&mdash;members of the Oireachtas&mdash;should feel very proud. Of course judges cannot give satisfaction to everybody.  A judge or justice always gives satisfaction to a successful litigant, but to the unsuccessful litigant he is perhaps the worst judge in the world.  However, that view is only held for a short time and, generally, our system of the administration <Col N="274" /> of justice has the complete confidence of the people.</P>
    <P>To that administration of justice we should be able to attract the very best people we can find and we shall not attract the very best people unless we provide adequate and remuneration for them.  I suggest that the remuneration here is not adequate and I would oppose strongly that part of the Bill were it not for the reasons I have given.  The Select Committee reported that the increases should be made retrospective as from April, 1952.  The Bill provides otherwise&mdash;that they should be retrospective only from April last.  I think the Minister should reconsider that matter because I feel that all parties concerned, judges and justices, have been too long deprived of an increment to which they were and are entitled.  Their remuneration was increased last in 1947 and since then there has been a very considerable fall in the value of money.  Taking that suggestion with the Minister's reason for increasing the jurisdiction as mentioned by Senator Hayes, it cannot be said that I am unreasonable and I ask him to consider it very carefully.</P>
    <P>The Minister takes power in the Bill to appoint an additional High Court judge and I say that he is quite right in that.  There is urgent need at present for an additional High Court judge.  There is a substantial amount of work waiting for another judge.  It may be said that if we appoint this new judge we may have a judge at times not doing anything.  I am sure that this will not be the case but it would be much better that we should have a judge at times with nothing to do rather than have a lot of work ready to be done by a judge who was not there.  I fully approve of the power the Minister is taking to appoint a new High Court judge.</P>
    <P>It was also said in another place during the passage of this Bill that the law vacations should be shorter and that judges should sit longer hours.  I am sure that the vacation should not be very much shorter.  Recently one of the vacations&mdash;what might be described as the summer or long vacation&mdash;was shortened slightly, but <Col N="275" /> I am not so sure that any of the other vacations should be shortened.  People engaged in the profession of law, solicitors and barristers, have other things to do besides attending courts, and barristers and solicitors welcome the opportunity which the vacations provide to enable them to get done work that cannot be done while the courts are sitting.  As to earlier hours, the hours from which judges should sit and to which they should sit, again we have something to do besides being in court at 10 o'clock or 10.30 o'clock in the morning.  Most people find it difficult enough to get to court at 11 o'clock and they are not away a bit too early from the court at 4 o'clock.</P>
    <P>I hope for the success of the Bill and I thank the Minister on behalf of my profession for the considerate manner in which he received the views of my profession and for the assistance which he and the members of his Department have at all times given to my profession.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much appreciate what Senator O'Reilly has said and I should like to say that if we had got in the other House anything like the reception for the proposed increase in salaries that we have got here, I would not have been reluctant to increase them much more than they were increased. It may be within the recollection of Senators that when we set up a committee to go into this question, two Parties refused even to take part in it.  These are some of the difficulties which we have to face in matters of this kind.  I certainly do not feel too happy that we were not able to carry out exactly what was promised, but, at the same time, what has emerged as a result of the deliberations of the committee is that actuarially the district justice and others are in a better position than they would have been, if they had got what they were told they would get in the letter written to them nearly two years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had the matter examined actuarially, because naturally I have to try to meet some of the complaints made, and the financial benefits proposed to be conferred by this Bill on <Col N="276" /> justices and circuit judges are much more valuable than the financial benefits they were told they were going to get and the capital cost to the State of the provisions in the Bill exceeds what was promised by about £45,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The capital value?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the capital value &mdash;you know the way actuaries work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I knew there was a snag.  You could not prove that to anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>What they were promised was much less per annum than the committee afterwards recommended and I want to repeat what I said in my opening statement, that I personally and the Government feel very grateful to the members of the committee because they took a lot of the political burden off our shoulders and shared it with us.  Unfortunately, there is in this country a strong objection to giving people who have what are considered large salaries any increase and that is the reason I was not able to do all I should have liked to have done.  Senators know that they were promised £300 a year increase and they are getting £450 under this Bill.  The increase does not go back as far as the committee recommended, but we thought that, having regard to the fact that it is a big increase, going back to 1st April was meeting them pretty fairly.  I was sorry as a member of the committee that we did not go back further, but we had to consider other services and, when all these things are taken into consideration, we feel that, on the whole, they have not done badly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hayes, I suppose, has reason to object to the way in which the salaries are dealt with in the Bill and to the way in which they were dealt with in the other Bill, but we hope to consolidate all the Courts of Justice Acts soon and one will not require to be a mathematician to find out exactly what judges are paid when that consolidation has been completed. I agree that there are two parts in the Bill, but the last Bill in which there was an increase of salary for judges <Col N="277" /> in 1947 also contained other provisions. The Act which set up the courts also had other provisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a foundation Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It was, but we followed that in subsequent Acts and, when we had to increase the salaries, other matters were put in as well.  I think it is not a bad line at all.</P>
      <P>Senator Kissane was right in what he said about the difference between the work in the District Courts in Dublin and in the country.  There is no question that it is much more difficult work in the city and I think Senator O'Reilly agrees that it is much more difficult work.  There are more cases and some of them are very much more difficult and the justices have often to deal with more experienced counsel.  Generally speaking, I think the life of a district justice in the country is far more easy than it is in the Dublin District Court.  Anyone who knows the position will admit that there was always that differentiation and I think it was quite justified.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Circuit Court, we are going to have, as I stated already, an inquiry into the whole judicial system in the country.  It is proposed to set up a committee and all these questions in regard to the Circuit Court and the work to be a done will be considered.  It may be of interest to Senators to know that we made an examination of the work done in the Circuit Courts in the country during the past year.  In one case the judge sat only 73 days and in another 85 days.  In Dublin the sittings are over twice as long as that.  I am quite satisfied that the judges themselves have made no objection to this and a lot of them are quite prepared to do more work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the 1946 Act, I think, Dublin was reorganised and we made provision for a President of the Circuit Court. A judge can be brought in from outside to help in Dublin.  They have been doing that.  I think that meets Senator O'Reilly's point.  If there is an increase of work in Dublin and one judge is <Col N="278" /> slack he will have no objection to helping in Dublin.  I do not think there is any more I can say.  I am very pleased at the reception the Bill got here as opposed to the reception it got from certain sections in the other House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with that matter in the other House.  An amendment was put down which was ruled out of order because it imposed a charge.  I pointed out that the work of the justice in County Dublin very largely originated in the County Dublin although the court meets in Kilmainham. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, Deputy Lynch, pointed out, as did Senator O'Reilly, that other areas in the same country could equally claim the same status as the metropolitan justice if we were to do as suggested.  I and the Department have examined the matter and we think there is no case for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="279" /> There are now two justices permanently in that area whereas formerly there was only one.  I really think there is no case to give this justice the same status as a metropolitan justice.  It would mean that those justices who always worked in the city could be required to deal with work in the county also.  It would really affect their position.  There was no special case that I could see.</P>

Perhaps, in that case the Minister might later on see if he could, provided the facts warranted such action, have the justice dealing with that area treated as a metropolitan district justice.  The area now includes places like Ballyfermot, parts of Rathfarnham and Howth.  If the Minister tells me he will reconsider the matter with a view to having, if the facts warrant it, the justice brought within the city area as a metropolitan justice, I would be satisfied.</P>

      <P>As an ordinary member of the public who has no connection with the law, I would like to make one or two remarks.  In my experience this is the first time I have seen the State take vocational guidance in a matter of this kind.  I would like to congratulate the Minister on that because I know it is not the custom in other Departments to do that.  I understand that in regard to <Col N="281" /> this Bill the Law Society, as well as the committee of the House, was consulted. This is a very good precedent and I hope it will be carried out again. In many instances in other Departments, Ministers first make the decisions and afterwards seek other people's comments upon the decisions to which they have come.</P>
      <P>There is one thing that strikes me with regard to what Senator O'Reilly said.  He was congratulating the Minister on the general quality of the judges and this is a commendation with which I entirely agree.  It does seem to me, however, as an ordinary man in the street that these gentlemen who dispense justice should by no means be left open to bribery or corruption. That has never happened here and I hope it will not.  One remark he made which I cannot allow to pass without comment is that in which he was congratulating the Minister on the manner of appointment. I am afraid that is not generally accepted because it is felt by the public that the appointment of certain judges has a certain political quality.</P>

      <P>Perhaps when Senator O'Donnell was saying the Minister accepted vocational guidance he had not read the appendices to the report of the Dáil Committee which show the memoranda sent in by the judges and the district justices about their salary.  If he read what they said they wanted, what the committee suggested they should get and what <Col N="282" /> the Minister is not giving them, I do not think he would be so complimentary to the Minister with regard to accepting vocational guidance.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister, now that he is getting the Bill through and since there has been so much delay, how soon after the Bill becomes an Act will the amounts provided for be paid?  It is because of the delay that has occurred that we have departed from our usual practice and as the particular season is coming could the Minister say how soon the payments will be made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I will undertake to see that they are paid with the least possible delay and I hope well before Christmas.  I think Senator O'Donnell is wrong to say that other Ministers do not consult the people concerned in various legislation.  We do not always accept what they propose, I quite agree, but we get very valuable help. In connection with this Bill most of the suggestions that were made by the law association and by the committee were accepted.  As far as the committee is concerned&mdash;I may be wrong&mdash;I remember that the only thing we did not accept was the date from which payment should be made.  Generally speaking, it has always been the practice to consult the interests concerned; of course you cannot accept everything that is put up.</P>

    <Title>Rent Restrictions (Continuance and Amendment) Bill, 1953&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Continuation Bill.  As Senators are aware, there was a commission set up to go into the whole question of the rent restrictions code and they reported some time last year.  Last year there was objection taken to prolonging the Bill for 12 months, but this year there was more satisfaction because I pointed out that since the report had been circulated I had interviewed three bodies, two representing householders and one representing tenants, and there is an <Col N="283" /> application for me to receive another body interested in this report.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out last year when I was asking for a continuation of the Bill, once the committee had been set up it was only fair to them and to the general public that the recommendations of the committee should be circulated and that those who felt they were affected by the recommendations should have an opportunity of making their case.  It is quite clear they have not all made their case yet and the Rent Restrictions Act would lapse before the end of this year if it were not continued.  Therefore, I ask to have all stages.</P>

      <P>There is just one matter to which I have been asked to call the Minister's attention.  I am quite sure he is well aware of it already, but I would like to keep my undertaking.  The Minister has mentioned the fact that the commission was sitting and this is a matter that has of course been dealt with in evidence by the commission.  A number of people who are tenants of houses built since the 7th May, 1941, in other words, decontrolled houses, are perturbed by the fact that while they may accept a yearly tenancy at a particular rent or possibly a two, three or four-year tenancy, making the arrangement that the landlord would pay the rates, they find that whenever the tenancy is up, under the law as it now stands, their tenancy would end unless they agreed to take over the burden of rates.  In many cases both in Cork and in Dublin the situation is that these people who first went as tenants into their houses 12 years ago now find that they are paying nearly double what they were paying when they originally signed their tenancy agreement.  I am perfectly well aware that this is one of the matters that has been dealt with by the commission but <Col N="284" /> I have been asked to take this opportunity of specifically calling the Minister's attention to it.</P>

      <P>I am sure we are all agreed that the Minister should have this Bill.  It is quite clear that this report which he has received is not merely a very valuable report but a very long and a complete report and that he will require some more time to consider it.  Of course, it must be borne in mind that the delay, which I am sure will be unavoidable, causes hardship not merely to tenants but also to landlords.  It may result in the position that we will not have any building of dwelling-houses for letting purposes.  If that were to be a result of the delay it would be a great pity and we can only hope&mdash;and I am sure we are right in hoping&mdash;that the Minister will use great expedition in having the report fully considered.</P>

      <P>These matters are all being considered.  Of course, it was pointed out in the other House by Deputy Sweetman, that when we were putting the other Bill through we thought we had covered every point, having consulted many sources and having worked on it for weeks, and we discovered in spite of all that that various points were not covered. Senators will agree that these matters require great consideration and no hasty decision should be taken.  We are looking into the question and also that particular aspect that was raised in the other House last week.</P>
