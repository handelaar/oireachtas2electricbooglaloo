      <P>This legislation is being promoted by the hospital governors because they find that the financial position of the hospital is such that, unless additional revenue is obtained, they will be unable to carry on and the hospital will be obliged to close down.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to empower the governors to admit a certain number of patients who will be nominated by local authorities and for whose maintenance in the hospital the local authorities will pay at an approved rate.  This involves an amendment of the hospital's charter and the making of new by-laws.  The by-laws must be approved by the three judges specified in Section 3 or by any one of them.  They must also be submitted to the Minister for Health with a request that he should lay them before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill does not restrict the governors as to the number of local authority patients whom they will accept.  This number will be specified in the by-laws, but, in the course of the discussions at the Committee, a figure of 30 per cent. was mentioned, and the representative of the hospital gave an assurance that such a limitation would be applied by the governors.  In the light of that assurance a judge, before whom by-laws <Col N="870" /> might be placed for approval, would have difficulty, I am sure, in approving them if they provided for the admission of any higher percentage of local authority patients.</P>
    <P>It is not unlikely that experience will prove that unless a higher percentage than 30 is admitted and paid for as proposed, the revenues of the hospital would not be sufficient to enable the governors to carry on and if they were to be limited to this percentage the whole object of the Bill would be defeated.  I think, therefore, the House should place it on record that, while it would like to see the public charitable character of the hospital maintained to the maximum practicable extent, there would be no objection, if at any future date the governors find it necessary on financial grounds to admit more than 30 per cent. of local authority patients, to their doing so.</P>
    <P>There should, of course, be no effort to force the governors to accept a greater number of local authority patients than they wish to admit, and what I am now proposing would not in any way interfere with their discretion in that respect; but I think it would be very unwise to restrict them should the financial position of the hospital require that a higher number than the 30 per cent. mentioned at the Committee should be admitted.</P>

      <P>Whilst I appreciate what the Minister has said, I think that, as the Joint Committee gave this matter their very careful consideration and that it was only after that consideration that they agreed to the Bill, as amended, the matter should be referred back to them so that the Joint Committee may give consideration to the Minister's statement.  The Bill was amended, as agreed by the Committee, because some members took the view that no charge at all should be made and that the charter should not be amended.  However, the matter was fully considered and the Committee decided to pass the Committee Stage of the Bill, slightly amended, on the undertaking, which was readily given by those in charge of the Bill, that only 30 per cent. of the bed accommodation would be charged for.  What the Minister has in mind, of <Col N="871" /> course, would mean that the hospital would be entitled to charge not only for one-third of the bed accommodation but for 50 per cent. of it or even for all the bed accommodation.</P>
      <P>Whilst we appreciate very fully what the Minister has said, the Committee has given the matter very careful consideration and the members agreed with some reluctance to the amended Bill on the undertaking that only 30 per cent. of the accommodation would be charged for and it is in view of that that I wish to move as an amendment to the question before the House that the Bill be referred back to the Joint Committee for consideration of what the Minister has said.</P>
      <P>I do not think that we may anticipate any great difficulty in obtaining from the Committee agreement to the measure, having regard to what the Minister has stated, and having regard to the maintenance of patients in local authority hospitals.  The Committee considered the matter very fully and their only difficulty was in regard to the charge for 30 per cent. of the accommodation.</P>

    <P>In sub-section (1), line 61, after &ldquo;offence&rdquo; to add &ldquo;It shall be a good defence for any director or member of a committee of management to prove that he was absent from the meeting at which the consent or approval was given and had no knowledge of the offence.&rdquo;&mdash; (Senator Douglas.)</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelHartnett" hpid="Mr. Hartnett Mr. Hartnett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hartnett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if I am wrong.  I find that this amendment is an exact reflection of Section 6 of sub-section (5) of the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act of 1946, except that, if anything, the Minister has modified the terms of this particular section.  Under that section of the 1946 Act to which I have referred, there were caught, in addition to the directors, the manager and the secretary of a body corporate which contravened any of the provisions of that Act.  That Act has been in operation for some seven years and nobody has had cause to complain that it has acted in a manner prejudicial to the defence in any particular case.</P>
      <P>I recommend to the House that this amendment should be rejected and I do so for the reason that I want to safeguard the interest of any person who may be charged with an offence under the provisions of this Act.  As the section stands, the onus of proving guilt rests upon the prosecution and the prosecution will have to prove whether there was guilty knowledge; whether there was what the lawyers call <i>mens rea</i>; whether there was the culpable compliance that is an essential ingredient in every charge unless the onus of proof is by Statute transferred to the defence.  There are cases like the Customs (Temporary Provisions) Act of 1945 where the onus is in a very flagrant way transferred to the defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Senator Douglas's amendment is adopted, it means, in my view, and I think it may be held by the courts to mean that the onus is on the defence to prove that they were absent; that, if he was a director or a member of a management committee and if an offence has been committed and could be made attributable to that body, he was <i>ipso facto</i> guilty unless he proves that he was absent from the meeting at which the cause of the trouble or action occurred and had no knowledge of the offence. <Col N="873" /> Now, first and foremost, that amendment is unnecessary.  A <i>prima facie</i> case having been established by the prosecution, if he were able to prove that there was no guilty complicity, he is entitled to an acquittal.</P>
    <P>I would ask Senator Douglas to consider this: it may lead to other legal difficulties.  If this amendment were to be adopted and a case were to be brought summarily before a district justice, the enactment of this amendment might lead the district Justice to believe that if the director were present and voted against the consent or approval being given to the objectionable restrictive practice he would be liable under the Act.  There is a well-known legal maxim: <i>expressio unius, alterius exclusio,</i> if you deliberately and expressly exclude one case-that is, where he is absent from the meeting at which consent or approval was given&mdash;you might be held to include that in circumstances where he was present at the meeting and had fought like a tiger against the particular trade practice being approved and finally had been overborne by persons on the board who convinced him that it did not contravene the Act and did not make the company liable to a penalty, in those circumstances if this amendment is adopted he might be put to the pin of his collar to escape.</P>
    <P>Any specific inclusion of a sub-section saying &ldquo;it shall be a good defence&rdquo; is a positive embarrassment to a lawyer endeavouring to defend a person charged with a criminal offence.  In all cases the onus is on the prosecution to prove their case.  No man has to prove himself innocent.  People whose everyday work it is to defend persons charged with criminal offences are only too well aware of the dangers of putting in an amendment of that kind. I have no doubt it is actuated by the very best possible motives.  I have no doubt it was conceived in an effort to protect the liberty of the subject, but it shows a lack of experience of the procedure in criminal courts.</P>
    <P>Well-intentioned persons in the past often have been responsible for putting sections into Acts which they believed would have the effect of protecting the <Col N="874" /> subject, but which, it afterwards traspired, had the very opposite effect. In the interest of the persons who may be charged with offences under this Bill when it becomes an Act&mdash;I certainly hold no brief for them at the moment&mdash;but in their interest, I think it is advisable that the section should be left as it is.</P>
    <P>I would like to know why the Minister cut down the provisions of Section 6, sub-section (5) of the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946.  That Act provided that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where an offence under this section is committed by a body corporate and is proved to have been so committed with the consent or approval of, or to have been facilitated by any neglect on the part of, any director, manager, secretary or other officer of such body corporate, such director, manager, secretary or other officer shall also be deemed to have committed the said offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, immediately, I can see no reason why in this case the Minister has not thrown the net as wide as it was thrown in the 1946 Act.  There may be a good reason for it but, if there is not, the Minister might consider bringing in an amendment on the Report Stage to widen the terms of this section.</P>
    <P>The Minister did, I think, in the Dáil&mdash;if my recollection serves me rightly&mdash;alter &ldquo;neglect&rdquo; which is used in Section 6, sub-section (5) of the 1946 Act to &ldquo;default.&rdquo;&ldquo;Neglect&rdquo; and &ldquo;default&rdquo; is one of these legal couplets in very common use.  I went to the trouble of looking up &ldquo;neglect&rdquo; in Stroud's Judicial Dictionary.  To &ldquo;neglect&rdquo; doing is the omission to do some duty which the party is able to do.  The dictionary gives the example that a gas company does not &ldquo;neglect or refuse&rdquo; to supply gas when it is prevented from doing so by <i>vis major,</i> such as, an extraordinary frost.</P>
    <P>Now, &ldquo;default&rdquo; in the same dictionary is described as a very loose&mdash; of course, the definition is taken from accepted legal precedent&mdash;and large word in the legal sense.  If I were to <Col N="875" /> choose between the words &ldquo;neglect&rdquo; and &ldquo;default&rdquo; I would have chosen &ldquo;neglect,&rdquo;&ldquo;default&rdquo; being the wider one, though, again, that admits of a great deal of argument, depending on the circumstances of the case and very often on a person being tried.  At any rate.  I do not think there is a ha'porth of difference for all practical purposed between &ldquo;neglect&rdquo; and &ldquo;default&rdquo; in the context of this particular section.  For the reasons I have given this House, the greater protection of the potential offenders under this Act, who in a democracy are entitled to a fair trial, I would ask the House to reject Senator Douglas's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I plead guilty, beyond question, to lack of knowledge of criminal courts and I am not going to compete with the last Senator on that issue.</P>
      <P>On the question of the two words. I expressed my view yesterday, not claiming it on legal grounds, that &ldquo;neglect&rdquo; is less objectionable than &ldquo;default.&rdquo;  That is purely because I read it in a dictionary, not because of any experience.  I am not at all impressed by Senator Hartnett's discovery that this is in a 1946 Emergency Powers Continuation Act.  I would have been if he had told me there had been any prosecution of individuals under it, but I do not think there have been.</P>
      <P>In a case of this kind, where people who carry on their business honestly and straightforwardly are perturbed, I hold it is our duty to draw attention to difficulties we see and try to find some way of removing them.  None of my amendments on this stage, as I have said already, were prepared after consultation they were put down for the purpose of raising points.  I expected that if the Minister agreed he would make some improvement; if he did not, I could put them down again on the Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before Senator Hartnett spoke, I had intended to say I would seek leave of the House to withdraw the amendment and would probably put down something later which would drop the point <Col N="876" /> with regard to attendance at meetings &mdash;which I see could be misunderstood &mdash;and endeavour to provide that a person cannot be held guilty of an offence in the case of something they did not or could not know about.  This is going to be rather difficult, but I would like leave of the House to withdraw this amendment and if necessary I will put something down on the Report Stage. At the same time, I hope the Minister will have a further look at this, in his own interest and the interest of the Government, to see whether there are not some grounds for the uneasiness which has been expressed.  I did not particularly discover this: my attention was drawn to it from outside the House long before I put down the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It may save time on the Report Stage if I point out that, as the section stands, the director of a company cannot be prosecuted unless it can be proven that he consented to or approved of the offence.  Therefore, if he has no knowledge, he cannot possibly be held to be guilty.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point Senator Hartnett raised, about managers and officers of a company, I think they are adequately caught under Section 12, which provides that any person who aids, abets, or assists another person to contravene the Act is equally guilty of an offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that what the Minister says is not correct, but it is just a very good illustration of the difficulty of interpreting a section, particularly when you are dealing with personal matters.  In Section 13 the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; means &ldquo;and&rdquo;, according to the Minister's interpretation.  If the word &ldquo;and&rdquo;, were put in, I would be perfectly satisfied. It says &ldquo;and is proved to have been so committed with the consent or approval of, or to have been facilitated by any default&rdquo;.  It seems to me that &ldquo;or&rdquo; means facilitate or default, that they are not to be connected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be, but it <Col N="877" /> is not in the section.  I am not trying to press the point now, but this was taken up by the ordinary businessman to mean that he could find himself guilty of an offence by a company with which he was connected, regarding something he could not or did not have any knowledge or.  I rather gathered from the Minister and from Senator Hartnett that that could not be done, no matter what is in the section.  I leave it at that.  It is just as well I raised it, if only to get that point made clear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is no need at this stage to provide penalties anything like so severe as those provided in the Bill.  I did not put down an amendment&mdash;I thought it would be more or less useless to do so&mdash;but I want to put it on record that, to my mind, it is wrong to provide that you can be prosecuted within 12 months and there can be a continuing offence for which the fine could be either £50 in the case of summary conviction, which works out at about £18,000; or £500 a day on indictment.  I did not go into how much the £500 a day would be over a year, but I suppose we could buy another Tulyar with it.  Is it really necessary in dealing with a matter of this kind to have a continuous fine at the rate of £50 a day which could be applied to an offence where a person at the time did not know it was an offence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, no.  It would be a continuing offence after the courts had given a decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has just come to the point I was making.  Is it clear that it is the second and subsequent offences after the matter has been held to be an offence under the Act?  My reading of it&mdash;though it may be through want of being a lawyer, yet others have read the same thing&mdash;is that it may be a continuing offence.  In <Col N="878" /> other words, you may find yourself after three, six or nine months prosecuted and fined £50 a day.  I am not suggesting that the court would be likely to apply £50 a day but even £1 a day, which would seem small in relation to this, would be far too high.  I think something is required there and I would ask the Minister to look into it.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 19:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 6, to delete sub-section (2).</P>
      <P>This has appeared in several Acts before. I may be wrong, but I think the effect of it is to increase the period under which there can be a prosecution to 12 months instead of six.  I think six is ample in a Bill of this kind&mdash;certainly for a very large number of cases. I know the analogy is not quite the same.  I have had no experience myself of having anything to do with prosecutions under Emergency Powers Orders, but I have been told by barristers and others that they have found it, in their opinion, grossly unfair because it would be impossible to provide a proper defence as to what an employee or assistant did 12 months before.</P>
      <P>It may be that this is deliberate Government policy, but I rather think it was put in because of a habit on the part of the draftsman to put it into Acts.  Is has been put into many Acts recently.  I suggest there is no need for more than six.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether there is a case to be made for the permanent amendment of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act of 1851, but in cases of this kind it is desirable to have a longer period specified during which prosecutions may be taken&mdash;that is, a longer period from the date of the offence.  It is my experience in the administration of the Emergency Powers Orders during the war that it was often difficult to get evidence which would stand up in court in relation to an offence of the kind involved here and have the case prepared for trial within the limit of six months. Even if that caused inconvenience, it <Col N="879" /> is better that it should, than that some offender under one of these Acts should escape punishment on that technical ground.</P>
      <P>In dealing with restrictive trade practices, it may be months before it becomes known that an offence has been committed and the mere fact that detection has been avoided for a period should not be a means of escaping punishment.  I think it is necessary to have this longer period.  It is a customary provision in Bills of this kind, and particularly Bills dealing with the commercial activities of large concerns, to have a reasonable period prescribed during which evidence can be sought of an offence, and the case prepared and brought to trial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely this is rather different from the sort of prosecution under an Emergency Powers Order of which the Minister speaks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very much the same sort of thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is.  If you are to have prosecutions of this nature you have to take account of the fact that under the Emergency Powers Act prosecutions arose because inspectors went out and made certain investigations and obviously took quite a long time to cover the ground and get all the necessary information.  In this case, the Minister is going to have people complaining and lodging their complaints with him.  He is not going to have any peace or rest any more once this is the law, and his Department building will have to be doubled and the staff added to very considerably. I do not think it is the same thing at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a very unsatisfactory situation that a person should never know when he is finished or when the Department is going to pounce upon him and there ought to be some limitation of the time. There is no urgency about people being penalised for an offence, if somebody cannot be brought to justice within the six months, but if there is much of an offence, the Minister and his Department will see to it that punishment <Col N="880" /> is meted out to the offender long before six months has elapsed.  If that cannot be done, I do not think that the Act is really effective at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is missing the point, which is that it may not be possible to get the evidence of the commission of the offence within that period.  If some trade ring against whom an Act has been directed decides to continue to function as a ring but to get under cover in doing so, it may operate quite successfully for some. period before knowledge of its operation reaches the public or those responsible for the enforcement of the Act, and they escape punishment altogether because they covered up too well. That is the issue involved&mdash;should there be power to bring a prosecution even though the offence took place six months before the evidence became available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelHartnett" hpid="Mr. Hartnett Mr. Hartnett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hartnett</NameTxt>
      <P>The limitation of six months applies only to offences triable summarily.  Anybody charged with an indictable offence may be charged 20, 25 or 40 years after the offence was committed.  It is very difficult to see why the distinction is drawn because offences triable summarily are, in the very nature of the case, by definition, offences which are less serious than offences which are triable on indictment, and a person suffers a lesser penalty than be would normally suffer, if convicted after having been tried on indictment.  I do not think there is any great principle at stake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of that point is that if the longer period is not allowed to enable proceedings to be taken in a summary way, the only alternative, if the offender is not to escape, is trial by indictment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that no great principle is involved, but I took quite a different view from that taken by the Minister.  The impression I had was that the section was there in order that there would be summary proceedings for what I regard as minor offences, but the Minister talks about a big combine.  I cannot see proceedings being taken against them at all. The kind of case I had in mind is <Col N="881" /> where an Order is made under the Act by which a practice which has not been illegal suddenly becomes illegal and a firm or an employee of the firm is guilty for a week of continuing that practice.  Twelve months after, they can be brought into court because of that act, although it has long ceased. The whole thing is to stop an unfair practice.  It is not mainly a matter of getting fines, or penalising people, but to stop such a practice.  The practice was not illegal before and I still think that six months is ample, because if it is continued afterwards, the six months' provision does not operate. They are still doing it and the question of time will not arise.  On the other hand, in the case of a firm, an employee of which carries on a practice for two days after an Order has been made, that firm can be prosecuted 12 months afterwards, as I am told did happen in the case of an offence under the Emergency Powers Act.  I do not think it is fair and I do not think it achieves anything, but I withdraw the amendment.</P>

    <P>The effect of this amendment, if accepted, will be to provide that no member of the commission who is personally interested in any matter with which the commission is dealing may sit on an inquiry or have anything to do with an inquiry.  Clause 3 provides that if a member is personally interested in a matter with which the commission is dealing, he shall inform the Minister accordingly and shall not act as a member during the consideration of the matter, unless the Minister, being of opinion that his interest is not such as to interfere with the <Col N="882" /> impartial performance of his duties, authorises him to act.  I propose this amendment because I want to ensure that if a member is in any way personally interested, he will not be allowed to act.</P>
    <P>I should think that anybody learning that a member of the commission dealing with a particular matter was in any way interested in that matter would be amazed and would find it very difficult to believe that a commission of which that person was a member might not go wrong.  The public might take the view that in such circumstances they could have no faith in the commission and I think they would be rightly entitled to take that view.  I feel that if one member of the commission has any interest in the particular matter personally, the Minister should be most careful to see that he does not act and I put down the amendment to provide that the Minister may not give permission to a member to act when he has any interest in the matter before the commission.</P>
    <P>It would be entirely wrong that a member who was in the slightest degree&mdash;I would go so far as to say, personally or otherwise&mdash;interested should act on the commission and I am surprised that the Minister, unless be has a particularly good reason for doing so, inserted that last paragraph in the clause.  I feel the Minister would be only too ready to say to a member of the commission who was interested that he would not be permitted to act on the commission.  I cannot see why the Minister would exercise the right in the clause that a member of the commission so interested would be entitled to act.  I think the last part of the clause should be deleted.</P>

      <P>Such a person would have an interest in the outcome of the <Col N="883" /> inquiry if it meant the possibility of reduced prices for cigarettes.  Everybody will have some interest in something. It may be indirect and remote or it may be immediate and direct.  If it is immediate and direct, I agree that the person should not act on the commission. The section provides that the Minister should be informed of the nature of the interest.  The Minister would only authorise the person to act if in his opinion the interest of such person is not such as to interfere with the impartial performance of his duty. Where his interest is remote and of such a character that it would not influence his approach to the matters with which the commission was dealing or undermine his impartiality in the least, then the Minister may authorise him to act.  If anything, this section is more tightly drawn than the corresponding sections in other Bills in so far as it provides in this case that the member will not act unless the Minister authorises him and the Minister would only do that if the circumstances are such as would not affect the person's impartial approach to a problem.</P>

      <P>I quite agree with the Minister that most members of the commission will have some interest in the matters which will come before them to which the Minister referred.  A member of the commission may take a bottle of lemonade and be interested in mineral water manufacture or he may smoke cigarettes.  If that is a case where the Minister will give his consent, I would have no great objection to withdrawing my amendment and allowing the section to stand. As the clause stands it would appear that the Minister has the unrestricted right to give permission.  I know he will be very careful to ensure that a person who would have substantial interest would not sit on the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be much easier in my mind, however, if the Minister would accept my amendment and put himself in the position that he could not give any consent.  However, I feel that cases will arise such as those which he mentioned.  Perhaps, the Minister might answer this question.  Suppose <Col N="884" /> a member of the commission happened to hold a £1 share in a very large company. That would not give the member any great beneficial interest in the concern but would the Minister in such a case allow a member of the commission to sit on the inquiry dealing with the company in which the member had only a £1 share?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I probably would.  The section is drawn to ensure that the member who feels he has an interest in the matter under inquiry must report to the Minister and the Minister must not permit him to act unless the Minister is satisfied that the person's interest is so slight and remote that it could not have any effect on his impartial approach to the problem.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In paragraph 5, sub-paragraph (1), line 15, before &ldquo;unless&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;permanent members.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>During the discussions on the Committee Stage certain things emerged very clearly.  The Bill provides that two members may provide a quorum. Therefore, the commission can act with two members one of whom may be a temporal member appointed specially for the purpose of a particular inquiry.  That commission is intended by the Government not only to ascertain facts but to form opinions as to what is fair or unfair, reasonable or unreasonable, just or unjust, what is or what is not in the public interest and even what is in accordance with the principles of social justice.  In the criticism which took place mainly from this side of the House against the Minister's desire that there should be no impossible amendment of an Act confirming an Order, the Minister placed considerable emphasis on the fact that the report, although the inquiry might be by one person only or possibly two, would be by the commission as a whole.  But when we discuss what the commission as a whole may mean, we find the quorum is two and that they can be temporary members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We gathered from the Minister's speech that the temporary members <Col N="885" /> will be mainly of two kinds&mdash;those who are to take the place of a permanent member who is ill or unable to act or those who are appointed as assessors for a particular inquiry and who will have special knowledge.  The situation regarding people with special knowledge and a possible interest has always seemed to me to be one which may create considerable difficulty. Personally, I suggest that two is too small a quorum but if there must be two at least the two should be two permanent members.</P>
    <P>It must be taken into consideration that the function of this particular commission of which two will form a quorum is in some respects more or less usual in the sense that it is making provision for the passing of legislation by a Minister.  It is unusual in the sense that its functions are not only to find facts on which, there will be delegated legislation but also to form opinions.  If those opinions are produced and the Minister agrees with them, then the House can do nothing except to say it agrees.  On the other hand nothing whatever may be done about the report and that is an equally unsatisfactory position.</P>
    <P>I feel rather strongly on this matter. It is an improper surrendering of the functions of the House, particularly when the quorum is so small.  I think a commission of three is too small anyway. I suggest to the Minister that if he must have two they should be permanent and if the commission is composed of five the quorum should be at least three.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with the Senator in arguing that where a temporary member is appointed for the purpose of a particular inquiry the quorum for the commission might be enlarged for the occasion.  The Bill provides that the Minister may adjust the quorum in such a case.  Temporary members may also be appointed during the incapacity of a permanent member. If there is a commission of three and two are incapacitated by illness at the same time&mdash;the commission might consist of one permanent and two temporary members&mdash;nothing, of course, could be done.  That would be the position <Col N="886" /> if the Senator's amendment was accepted.  I think it is far better to leave the matter as it stands.  If the membership is three the quorum is two.  The Minister could alter the quorum if the circumstances required it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the function of this commission, I think it is not sufficient to provide that the Quorum should be two unless the Minister provides otherwise.  I think the Minister could exercise a little ingenuity and make it clear.  If not he might reverse it, and put the onus on the Minister of allowing a temporary member to act as part of the quorum. The case made for this commission is based on the whole commission reporting and, although they do not all have to inquire into a particular case, they are to make the report and are fully responsible for the recommendations. Again, I emphasise that these recommendations are to have the force of law if one Minister approves of them, although the House can see, if you like, what is being done.  It is a bad practice, however.  It is not a matter in which we would have to report to the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has power to amend it?  My view is that the quorum should be adequate and, if necessary, the Minister should have temporary power to reduce it in emergency. The Minister is not going around spending his or his officials' time amending the quorum and there will be a standing quorum.  There should be a quorum of three members subject to the right of the Minister to alter that quorum where it would be necessary under the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position of this commission is peculiar and I cannot emphasise that too much.  Temporary members are going to form opinions as to what is fair or unfair and&mdash;I do not care how honest they are&mdash;it cannot be satisfactory or reliable until there has been built up a practice and general consensus of opinion.  To think that just one <Col N="887" /> member and a person temporarily appointed for the purpose makes a quorum, is wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is an excellent case for this and it does not hamper the Minister in any way.  If Senator Douglas's amendment is accepted, paragraph (5) sub-section (1) would read: &ldquo;The quorum for a meeting of the commission shall be two permanent members unless the Minister otherwise directs.&rdquo;  No power is taken from the Minister and there is no power or provision made to keep the commission from working.  It means that in the ordinary way when the commission is meeting two permanent members must be present to make the report, and, if there is illness or any special situation, the amendment leaves it to the discretion of the Minister, without any hampering clause, to make any direction he pleases with regard to the quorum.  Surely this commission, as has been pointed out over and over again, is not a legal commission, is not working to any known rules of law, has no precedents, and must make its own decisions based on the opinion members give with regard to a certain set of facts ascertained by them.  Surely while this is being done the quorum of the commission should be normally two permanent members, two people acquainted with everything done by the commission. The Minister's argument against a certain amendment of mine was that there would be three people on this commission and that even though one member made the inquiry, the report would be made to the commission and all three members would be familiar with the whole field, with the precedents and principles adopted and with the general lines taken.  If that is so, then normally before they make a report, two of the three members would have to be present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with and I accept the Minister's view that there would be circumstances in which the whole business would be held up because two permanent members were unable to attend, and then, in that case, the Minister inside his Department by a <Col N="888" /> stroke of the pen, or a word on the telephone, can direct that some other quorum should be available for that particular period.  It is not unreasonable. The amendment does not hamper in any way the work of the commission and does ensure that when it is working it will normally work in such a way that the majority of the commission will be present and that all the recommendations made to the Minister will be at a meeting attended by people who are acquainted with all the circumstances, above all with the lines on which the commission proposes to proceed.  It is a very reasonable request and is no way hampering the machinery of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 22:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In paragraph 8 (1) to delete all words after &ldquo;means&rdquo; in line 1 to the end of the sub-paragraph and to insert &ldquo;a person who is by profession an accountant or auditor or is a member of a firm of accountants or auditors and who is authorised by the commission to act on their behalf.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I introduce this amendment because in the first edition of the Act the words &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo; were defined and there was quite an amount of controversy in the Dáil.  As a result, the authorised person now has lost definitory powers and anybody can be appointed to be an authorised person. A great number of people, particularly those in trade, have a very strong apprehension that a type of person may be appointed as an authorised person under the Bill who should not be appointed, and I am trying to narrow it down and see that the type <Col N="889" /> of person who should be appointed temporarily under the Bill would be either an auditor or accountant, or a member of a firm of auditors and accountants.  The reason I am doing it is because under the Bill as it stands an authorised person has powers which are extremely wide.</P>
    <P>Certain tradespeople would not be happy in disclosing information to any person except one who through his profession is accustomed to treat confidential matters confidentially and would not be happy allowing any other person to inspect documents, extracts or books and the like.  Therefore, I am putting down this amendment so that the authorised person qualified to do this work will be either an accountant, auditor or a member of a firm of accountants or auditors, and I would like that the definition of &ldquo;authorised person,&rdquo; in so far as this work is concerned, should be limited to the type of person I have proposed in my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>I do not like the amendment because it is too confined and I agree with the Minister on that. The only interest I had was to see if it would produce from the Minister an explanation as to what kind of person he had in mind.  For example, I have heard and I do not know whether it is true, that hotel keepers, for example, underwent inspection at one period by people from the Tourist Board, which seems quite absurd.  The Minister says that under the Bill these people will be civil servants and officials of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  In that case, I would be opposed to the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pleased to hear the Minister's view that officials of the Department of Industry and Commerce would be used.  I am rather glad to hear that because this is one of the sections causing most worry to business people generally.  In the original form of the Bill I think the word &ldquo;Garda&rdquo; was used and this has apparently been changed now and the work is to be done by &ldquo;an authorised officer.&rdquo;  A lot of people feel that this clause illustrates more than anything else the degree to which the State is interfering in the lives of the citizens and in their businesses because originally in Bills of this kind there used to be a provision that only people with the rank of superintendent could do this work.  The word &ldquo;Garda&rdquo; crept in by degrees and the ordinary business person was beginning to ask where we were getting to in all this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you are in business and there is somebody of rather low rank authorised to come into your business and make inquiries, particularly at a time when you are busy, it can cause quite a lot of trouble because in the minds of the public a person of low rank is not a very responsible person and may not be a person competent to carry out the investigation in a proper way.  A person might be the lowest form of clerk&mdash;and I am not saying that because he is so he is an irresponsible person&mdash;but he may not be sufficiently qualified to conduct an inquiry in a proper way.  It is wrong to allow a very junior and irresponsible person to come in and make inquiries such as can be made under this section.  It would be worth while to go to some trouble to define a type of person authorised to make such inquiries, who must be a responsible person.  It is only by having such persons that you could assure respect for them and for the commission and for the State itself. If you send in irresponsible people it <Col N="891" /> does lead to the feeling that the State does not care how much it interferes with the lives of the citizens or what type of person it is going to send to interfere with business.</P>
    <P>There is another amendment on this subject in the name of Senator O'Reilly and I think that these two things should be taken together.  I am glad to hear that the Minister has in mind a certain type of official for this work, but I think that such officials should be clearly defined.</P>

It could be that one of the lower orders such as have been referred to already might be used or somebody quite incompetent to do this type of work and who by their approach to the whole matter would be unsuitable.  When the Minister invited responsible bodies to give their views on this Bill one of the suggestions made by the Chamber of Commerce was that the commission or the Minister if they wanted certain information should apply to the courts in the ordinary course for a discovery of documents in accordance with legal procedure.  We still feel that that should be so in this important matter when we are dealing with fair trading practices.  It is not sufficient to say that inquiries will be made by an authorised officer in a Bill such as this. <Col N="892" /> The Minister or the Government should have to apply for a discovery of documents in the courts just as any private individual or trader would do and bear the costs of the application. I suggest that the Minister should still give consideration to that matter and provide for it in some way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no excuse for us if we have been too liberal in our approach in one case that we should be liberal again.  The Minister has used the words &ldquo;authorised officer&rdquo; but he may authorise any person and may send in any member of the Garda Síochána to make inquiries or anybody else and he is an authorised officer.  In those circumstances, the Minister could not blame the business community, the commercial community and the industrial people in this country if they have fears about this type of investigation. I think myself from the point of view of the industrial community that we can develop the drive towards production and development too much. You can make people sick and tired of production if you carry your measures too far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="893" /> Anybody with any experience of business whatever knows of the difficulties from which the business community is suffering.  They have difficulties concerning labour, for instance.  It does not matter how much you pay you will often find difficulties in getting labour and services of that type.  It is enough to have those difficulties without having the further difficulty of being worried unnecessarily by an authorised officer of the State.  Inspectors going up and down the country during the emergency did a great deal of harm to the reputation of the Government and the Ministers. I hope that the commercial community will want to make this Bill work, but they must be given some protection.</P>
    <P>Since I first entered Dáil Éireann in 1923 I never saw a similar document, a document so vague which purported to make a law and which does not say what the law is going to be.

One thing he should do&mdash;and there will be some difficulty about it&mdash; is to re-establish the confidence of the people on whom the investigators will call following the report of people who perhaps are not the kind we would like to have spying on ourselves.  I suggest this is all too serious and my view, mainly as an outsider, is that the whole procedure does not satisfy me.  I can see tears over this measure yet and maybe it will not be the people the Minister thinks but others who will cry over it.</P>

      <P>Some years ago I had the temerity to intervene in a discussion about something that concerned farmers and farm labourers and Senator Baxter asked me what right I <Col N="894" /> had to come into his province and what I knew about the matter and I had to admit I knew nothing.  I wonder, then, about the why and the wherefore of his intervention now in this matter that primarily concerns industrialists. I am rather concerned at the attitude of industrialists generally. They adopt the attitude that this thing does not concern them personally: &ldquo;I am not like other men, I am all right.&rdquo; Then they proceed to give the impression that they have much to fear by the passage of this Bill.  If they have nothing to fear, why all the concern? We have been swapping logic on the question of commas and the taking out and putting in of words and it appears to me that the business community have a lot to fear from the Act.</P>
      <P>The Minister is concerned only with people who are generally injuring the general community.  No matter how enthusiastic a businessman or farmer he is, every Senator must appreciate that there are some people who are injuring the public.  Whatever about our being an island of scholars, we are not all saints.  The Minister is only concerned with getting after the people who are injuring the community and the general good.  I cannot understand the concern of each individual industrialist in the House and now even a farmer representative is beginning to worry about what is in the Bill.  They should take a lesson in that regard from the trade unions who when they keep the law have nothing to fear.  Everybody outside thinks the trade unions are breaking the law but, as the Minister says, they have statutory permission to act in that way.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 23:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In paragraph 8 (1), line 2, before &ldquo;authorised&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;holding the rank of higher executive officer or higher rank in the Civil Service&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Despite what Senator Colgan has said the authorised officer is a person who will have great importance under this Bill.  We should provide that an authorised officer will be a person of responsibility, who will carry out his work as the Minister would require it to be carried out.  It is not right for anybody to think that we may or that we should authorise a person to enter into premises and interview people unless that person was properly fitted to do that work.  I would, of course, have no objection to a regular officer from the Department of Industry and Commerce or any other Department being appointed an authorised officer, but I think the Minister should indicate that some such person as that mentioned in my amendment&mdash;a higher executive officer or a person holding the rank of higher executive officer or of a higher rank&mdash;would be appointed as an authorised officer.  I would think it very wrong and I should feel very loth to give information to a person who would not impress me with his ability to receive it and convey it to the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it would be altogether wrong to authorise members of the Garda Síochána to make investigations as authorised officers for the purpose of carrying out the necessary work of this Bill.  The Minister should see that the authorised officer would be a person who would compel respect and regard in the mind of the person whom he was <Col N="896" /> interviewing.  After all, matters will be made relatively simple for the commission if its authorised officers are able to deal fully with the matter with which the commission intends them to deal and it is only a person holding one of the ranks I have mentioned in the amendment who would be properly fitted to do that work.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to officers of the Department of Industry and Commerce during the period of the emergency.  During that period the inspectors from the Department did their work in an excellent manner and impressed the people with whom they had to deal.  If the Minister would assure me that that type of person&mdash;I am aware that a number of those inspectors had not the rank mentioned in the amendment&mdash;would be appointed authorised officers and that it is not intended to appoint a member of the Garda Síochána to carry out such investigations, I would be satisfied.  I would impress on the Seanad that we should not put any Department or commission into the position that they would be entitled to send anybody into a person's premises with a view to getting the information required.  We should send in only those who would be able properly to discharge their duty and to impress the people whom they were going to see.</P>

Senator Baxter has stated his view and no matter whether the Industrial Development Authority Act got through the Seanad with a similar proviso or not does not matter.  You commit mortal sin once and go to confession and get shrived; if you commit it again you may get a harder going.  This is an outrageous section where people, at the behest of the commission, can examine books and documents and people do not know who they are; they can only take the Minister's word for it.</P>

      <P>I have already spoken on this matter on another amendment. There is one point I would like to make clear.  Though entitled to speak only in an individual capacity, it is not I alone who am objecting to these provisions.  Along with others representing industry there are independently minded people like Senator Professor George O'Brien and Senator Baxter, who are in different walks of life and who have spoken on this.  I happen to be voicing the sentiments and views that were expressed by every chamber of commerce in the country on this Bill.  They went into this closely.  I read every one of those expressions carefully and because of that I feel it is my duty to try and make the case the business people feel. I do not want it to be said that Senator McGuire does not want this Bill.  As already explained, it has very little to do with me in my own business. I am probably one of the least affected by restrictive practices or having any occasion to practise them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am making the case that has disturbed the business community and <Col N="898" /> anyone can read it in the journals of the chambers of commerce and of any trade association which has objected to this.  Can we not be sensible on this point?  If we met the Minister in his office he would say: &ldquo;I am very anxious to allay your fears, and if amendment is required will you suggest it?&rdquo; He is not taking that line here. He is sitting tight.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="900" /> In paragraph 9 (3), line 49, to delete &ldquo;100&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;250&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will have no hesitation in accepting this amendment. By virtue of the section which I seek to amend, if any person discloses information available to him by virtue of the powers of obtaining information required by the Bill, he shall commit an offence and in accordance with the section as drawn he will be liable to a penalty of £100, or imprisonment for a period not exceeding six months. That section would apply to any member of the commission, any authorised officer and any other person who would obtain information by virtue of any work he had to do or any evidence he heard if he was present at an inquiry.  I think we should make a greater endeavour to see that no such information would be disclosed by anybody in the course of investigations, if an authorised officer should obtain information which it might be essential would not be disclosed to any person or body save to members of the commission.</P>
    <P>It should be made clear that an officer who disclosed such information would be liable to a very serious penalty.  I agree that a penalty of £100 or six months' imprisonment is a serious penalty, but I think we should indicate that we take an even more serious view of such a disclosure and should provide a penalty not of £100 but of £250.  The Minister may say that, in similar Acts, a penalty of only £100 or six months' imprisonment is provided, but that is not any answer to the case I am making.  I am not concerned with what is in a previous Act; I am concerned only with what is in this Bill; and I say that by providing a penalty of £250, we should mark the serious view we take of such a disclosure, a disclosure which for many people might be a very serious matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment and I want to draw the attention of the House to the difference in the wording of the paragraph and the wording of Section 14 of the Bill, in relation to the punishments provided, where an offender under the Act, on summary conviction, is liable <Col N="901" /> to a fine not exceeding £500 and to all sorts of other penalties as well.  In the many discussions on this Bill&mdash; I happen to be vice-president of the Associated Chambers of Commerce, from which all the amendments submitted to the Minister emanated, so that I have been in on the ground floor in regard to all the discussions &mdash;it was strongly felt that the punishment provided in the case of those who would divulge information gleaned in the course of an investigation was out of proportion with the severe punishments provided for offenders under the Act.  If I were to speak for another half hour, it would mean the same thing, but we do feel that a good case can be made for increasing these penalties and I hope the Minister will be able to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any comparision between the penalties prescribed here and those prescribed earlier in the Bill for offences under a confirming Act.  A trade ring defying the law is doing so for profit and that profit could be very substantial.  That is why a substantial penalty has to be prescribed.  In this case, however, it seems to me that a maximum penalty of £100 fine and, at the discretion of the court, six months' imprisonment as well, is sufficient deterrent to anybody in the matter of the unauthorised disclosure of confidential information.</P>
      <P>There is the further fact which Senators have not adverted to that any such person would also be liable for any damages which his disclosure caused to a third party.  In the circumstances it seems to me the penalties are high enough.  I do not know that it makes a lot of difference whether you fix the maximum at £100 or £250. It is at the discretion of the court, anyway, and the only thing we fix is the limit beyond which the court cannot go.  The penalties seem quite reasonable and it would look rather fantastic to put them higher.</P>

I am concerned to see that the view of the Oireachtas that such an offence is very serious is made clear. The fixing by us of the amount of the penalty at £250 will make it clear that we regard such an offence as a very serious offence, as it could easily be, and for that reason I should like the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals with the Second Schedule which, so far as I remember, the Minister said he included in the Act for the purpose of defining as far as possible the sort of work the commission should do.  I have read this <Col N="905" /> Schedule very carefully and I do not see any reason for paragraphs (a) to (j), inclusive.  Since amendments No. 26 and No. 27 are complementary, I would like to take the two together.  Amendment No. 26 deals with the deletion of paragraphs (a) to (j) and amendment No. 27 deals with the deletion of the word &ldquo;other&rdquo; in paragraph (k), line 38.  I think that in itself is sufficient. I think the remaining section would cover everything that is rather loosely expressed in paragraphs (a) to (j).  I think it is only waste of time to define the sort of thing which the Minister endeavoured to define.  It does not explain anything.

What paragraph (k) means is very doubtful and I would hate to be pressed for an interpretation. When I introduced the Bill, there was no such Schedule.  I thought it was better to leave unfair trade practices undefined except in so far as they are defined by implication in Sections 8 and 9 of the Bill.  It was argued strongly in the Dáil that there should be something in the Bill to guide the fair trade commission in their work, some indication of the type of practices the Oireachtas want to see eliminated from commercial life.  An amendment was moved to that effect which, on consideration, I decided to accept and incorporate in the Bill.  This Schedule is the amendment.  It is not there as an exhaustive definition of unfair practices but as a guide to the commission in their work particularly in the matter of fair trading rules.  On the whole, it is better to have it there.</P>

      <P>I appreciate as much as anybody the difficulties of the Schedule, but I do not think, even if we argued for two or three days more, we would get much further as regards the Schedule.  It is a genuine effort, whether good or bad, to give some idea of what the Bill is intended to be about.  It does not do anything more than that.  I do not think the business <Col N="906" /> community have really any quarrel with that particular matter.  Senator O'Donnell need not be afraid of the Schedule.  Whatever he may be afraid of in the Bill will not arise out of the Schedule.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. A1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), line 17, after &ldquo;bogland&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;including the purchase of live stock and the doing of all other such things as are in accordance with methods of good husbandry.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I raised this point on the Second Reading and unfortunately I had left the House when the Parliamentary Secretary addressed himself to the point, but from what he said it must be his opinion the Long Title will enable him to do this.  If he is satisfied about it I want to have inserted in sub-section (2) the words &ldquo;including the purchase of live stock and the doing of all other such things as are in accordance with methods of good husbandry&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The main point is the point I made on the Second Reading, namely, that I believe that the proper cultivation of this land, its proper development and growth of grass, can be helped by carrying live stock; in fact, it may be found after a period of experiment that this is absolutely essential.  It did seem to me that this section covering the objects does not make provision for some officer of the Minister to go to a fair to purchase live stock.  I do not want to have any long discussion on this but I am sure it is absolutely essential to have power to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt whatever that it ought to be part of the company's programme and it may very well be <Col N="908" /> that the board set up to handle this project may discover after some time that, before there is any processing of grass into grass meal, the first process may be the grazing of this land over a period.  If it is to be properly maintained it will be rather difficult work and may mean the purchase of sheep and young stock and, perhaps, in some cases older and heavier stock.  What I am concerned about is that it will be within the powers of the company to be able to do this.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that Senator Baxter was not present when I was replying to the point he made in this connection on the last occasion.  Perhaps, the printed reports were not available at the time and I would draw his attention to columns 737 and 738, No. 8, Volume 41, where I suggested that in my opinion even in the Long Title there, perhaps, was sufficient scope to do what he suggests in his amendment.  I am sure he will appreciate that the proper cultivation of this land will require many things which are not specifically provided for in the Bill.  I think that if we are going to particularise in this instance there would be a danger of restricting the activities of the company and that perhaps their activities might be rendered too inflexible, for the proper carrying out of their functions.</P>
      <P>On the last occasion, I suggested that I thought in the initial stages when it might be necessary to dispose of the crops apart from cutting, drying or making grass meal of them in the first few years that the feeding of it to cattle off the land itself or in the cut form would be likely to be one of the methods which the board would use.  I have no doubt that under the terms of the Bill as it stands, the company would have power to graze properly, if necessary, the land on which the grass is to be grown.</P>

    <P>Government amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>Before Section 9 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  Where a person who is a director of the company becomes a member of either House of the Oireachtas, he shall, upon his becoming entitled, under the Standing Orders of that House, to sit therein, cease to be a director of the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard this matter raised on a number of occasions here and I just want to mark my dissent from this point of view.  I just do not agree with it.  I heard Senator Professor O'Brien speaking on this point on a few occasions and quite frankly it is something I do not accept.  I realise, of course, that there are some governmental authorities and semi-governmental authorities established where this would be quite impossible as a general principle.  As Senator O'Brien argued, you might be denying yourself the opportunity of availing of the services of people who might prove very, very valuable indeed in certain capacities because of their experience.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFOReilly" hpid="Mr. P.F. O'Reilly Mr. P.F. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.F. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In line 49, to delete &ldquo;the Minister given after consultation with the Minister for Finance&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;each House of the Oireachtas&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>By virtue of Section 9 of the Bill, the memorandum or articles of association may be amended with the approval of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance.  If the memorandum of association is to be altered, it has to be altered only because, I suggest, that what we contemplate or what, at any rate, we have discussed will be the business of the proposed company is to be extended, restricted or altered in accordance with the objects of the Bill.  If we are to consent to alteration only by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance, we shall not see or know what is taking place in regard to the alteration of the objects of the company.  I think it, therefore, desirable that we who are passing this measure on the basis that the proposed company will work for certain objects, should know what any alteration taking place in these objects may be.</P>
      <P>My amendment seeks to provide that the memorandum or articles of association may not be altered without the approval of each House of the Oireachtas.  In other words, we should not allow this Bill to go through in such a way that the memorandum and articles of association may be altered and thereby enable the company to do work other than that kind of work which we think was never contemplated. Clearly the memorandum of a company incorporated in the ordinary way may not be changed without the consent of the shareholders.  The alteration of the memorandum of a company may be effected only with the approval of the courts except in one small instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we are establishing a company with certain objects in view.  We have been told what these objects are and <Col N="911" /> how they will be furthered.  If we are going to allow two Ministers to alter the memorandum or articles of association in such a way that they may, if this section remains, go outside the object which we have here discussed, we would be giving the Ministers <i>carte blanche</i>&mdash;we would be giving them the right to do anything they like in regard to the purposes of the company.</P>
    <P>I know the Parliamentary Secretary will tell us that the objects of the company will not go outside the scope provided for under this Bill, but I do not think that he can have any objection to providing that no alteration of the memorandum and articles of association can be made unless with the consent and approval of the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House should remember that the original memorandum will be drawn up without any examination by either House of the Oireachtas.  The company does not require any approval of the original memorandum and, therefore, I suggest that it is not logical that the House or both Houses should have power to examine and approve of any amendment or alteration in the memorandum and articles of association.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I think it would not be a very practical way in which to operate the company if every little alteration in policy which might involve a change in the memorandum would have to be brought into the Oireachtas and discussed at length.  Each of the company's directors will be the agents of the MInister and will be expected to carry out the intentions that this Bill envisages.  As well as that, as the Senator rightly observed, they cannot go outside their terms of reference as contained in the Bill, in any case, and I think that is the greatest safeguard that we have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 11 of the Bill which is a licensing section authorises the company to go into some other line of production.  That is in my opinion a safeguard that the objects of the company will not be altered in any material way by an alteration of the <Col N="912" /> memorandum as is envisaged by the section here.</P>
    <P>Finally, I think it ought to be remembered that the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance are duly elected members of the Oireachtas and duly elected members of the Government and therefore I take it that it must be agreed that they are responsible men and will carry out their duties in a responsible fashion.  Therefore I suggest to the Senator that the acceptance of this amendment will make the operations of the company unduly cumbersome and it certainly would not be a practical way in which to operate the company and carry out its functions.  Therefore I do not propose to accept this amendment.</P>

Having heard the Parliamentary Secretary, I will not press the amendment, but I feel that we are legislating in such a way that we are enabling the Minister and a Government Department to do business about, which we will know nothing until we take up the papers, and we may then find that this company has gone into business which was never contemplated.</P>

It is provided in the section that notice will be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  I mentioned on the Second Stage of the Bill that <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> is a journal unknown outside the offices of newspaper editors, Ministers, Parliamentary Secretaries and solicitors.  It is a document which is very rarely, if ever, seen by an ordinary member of the public.  I would have thought that the whole idea of giving notice would be to see that members of the public are given notice of what is contemplated by the new company.  To say <Col N="914" /> the notice will be given by inserting it in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> is just nonsense. Very few people who would be concerned with this would see a notice published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  I know the Parliamentary Secretary will tell us that this section is just the same as the section which appears in this, that or the other Act and that therefore it is good enough for the Grass Meal (Production) Bill, 1953.  I say that is no argument.  I say due and proper notice should be given of a matter of this kind and due and proper notice can only be given by a proper advertisement of the notice of application in the daily newspapers.</P>

      <P>I would like some more information as to what is contemplated under the section.  Somebody must have some idea of what further developments will take place at some particular time.  The section also deals, of course, with feeding stuffs and fertilisers.  But this will give authority to go into a type of production different from anything we heard of in the Second Reading or stated in the Bill or, indeed, anything that is in the memorandum or articles of association, I presume, I would like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary what exactly is contemplated under the section.  While I can visualise the possibilities of the utilisation of grass meal or the treatment of it in a new way to enable the production of a new type of feeding stuff, I would like to have some information from the Parliamentary Secretary as to what exactly he is seeking.</P>
      <P>The question of obtaining meal from seaweed was raised some place else; what other developments are planned? This scheme can really be a very good scheme.  I see no reason why it should not be a profitable enterprise, if the company is properly equipped&mdash;and by that, I mean, in the technical and, indeed, in every sense.  I think that is very important.  I want to suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that before there is any thought of branching into by-ways or blossoming out into new sorts of activities not contemplated at the moment, it would be much better to stick to the original idea of the Bill and go right ahead with that.  Naturally in this area there may be many people with bright ideas of new things that might be or should be attempted by this company. My views on that would be to stick to the road clear before you which other people have marked out and where experimental work has been proved a success such as in the Gowla Bog of Comhlucht Siúicre Eireann Teo.  If you do that, you may be able to do the other things later on.  What I want to know is why Section 11 was put in at all.</P>

      <P>There is just one small point I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to deal with.  Sub-section (3) (a) will now read:&ldquo;...cause notice of his intention to be published in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and in at least two daily morning newspapers published in the State...&rdquo; and sub-section (b) goes on to say &ldquo;...any person may, within a specified period (not being less than 30 days after the date of the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> containing the notice)...&rdquo; There is a possibility there that if there was any big difference of time between the publication of the notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and its publication in two daily newspapers, which as Senator O'Reilly rightly pointed out would be far more widely read by the public than <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, the interests of the people to be protected here might be jeopardised.</P>
      <P>For instance, the section mentions a period not less than 30 days.  If publication appeared in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> on the 1st of March, and through some mischance did not appear in the two daily newspapers until the 15th March, the time set out here would date from the publication of the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, not from the time the advertisement became properly and publicly known as a result of publication in the daily newspapers.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary that when this is put into operation there be no time lag between publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and publication in the morning newspapers.</P>

      <P>If I interpret correctly what is in Senator Baxter's mind it is that, while the production of grass meal is a sensible and practical proposition, the production of seaweed meal is not in the same category.  I felt like that too until I read the morning's Press about a seaweed factory in the Orkney Islands which has sent out the first boatload of its seaweed meal.  It occurred to me that if they are able to do it we should be able to do it also.  I do not know if I have diagnosed it correctly but I think that is what was in Senator Baxter's mind.  He spoke last week about seaweed meal and did not think it was in the same strain as grass meal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the point <Col N="917" /> raised by Senator Hearne, the maximum difference there could be between an issue of <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and the daily newspapers would be four days.  <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> is published twice a week and newspaper publication would either coincide with it or precede it. The sub-section provides for 30 days after the date of publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and I do not think there is any cause for concern there.  It might easily have been provided in the Bill that 21 days' notice was sufficient; even with 26 days such notice would be sufficient to make people interested in the production of the commodity aware of the Minister's intention.</P>
      <P>Regarding Senator Baxter's point and that raised by Senator O'Callaghan, the initial undertaking of the proposed company will be to grow grass and dry it and produce grass meal which is a feeding stuff.  It was suggested to me in the course of the preliminary discussion on the preparation of this Bill that there was also a valuable commodity, seaweed meal, which we were not producing at all or, at least, to anything like a sufficient extent in the country.  That matter was looked into and it appeared that the reason for non-production to a sufficient extent was the absence of a suitable organisation located at a point where the economic production of seaweed meal could be done.  It has been suggested to me that the seaweed is available, that the equipment which this company will have acquired for the production of grass meal will also be suitable for the drying of seaweed for the production of seaweed meal.  Inasmuch as I am advised that there is plenty of scope for it, this section is purely an enabling section.  It may be that the company will never have anything to do with seaweed meal.  They may find it unprofitable or they may find it is already produced to a sufficient extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand there may be other forms of fertilisers or animal feeding stuffs that could be grown or made available by growing and processing on the bog.  This is purely an enabling section.  The Minister's licence can only be given in certain circumstances and then only after application by the <Col N="918" /> company.  Even if the company did market such a commodity as seaweed meal, I do not think it would in any way interfere with their main objects; it would be purely complementary to the work they would have undertaken under the terms of the Bill as it exists at present.</P>
    <P>Speaking for myself, I think it is a desirable section in case something would turn up that the company would find it possible to produce.  I had in mind in particular the production of seaweed meal.  Senators know that seaweed is used as a fertiliser to a large extent.  As Senator O'Callaghan pointed out, it is also used for processing into seaweed meal as an animal feeding stuff.  There may be scope for further processing and, if there is, this section will give the power to go ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied with the explanation.  You cannot grow grass all the year round unless you make new discoveries in Bangor Erris.  You may lengthen the season.  There will be a period of the year when supplies will not be available and it may be that you could utilise this plant.  I do not know what supplies of seaweed are available along the coast there. What is in my mind, and I would like to impress it upon the Parliamentary Secretary, is that if you get a company going on this project and then try to turn their minds to too many activities at the same time, dividing their energies, you will not get the best out of this enterprise.</P>
      <P>What the Parliamentary Secretary has undertaken demands concentrated effort.  It demands the application of technical knowledge and science and that is something you will persevere in only with energy and enthusiasm and you must completely concentrate upon it.  I have no objection to widening the scope under this section but I feel that if the Parliamentary Secretary is there he is responsible for this enterprise and he will find after a little that the company will have their hands full with grass without fishing for weeds in the sea.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="919" /> He will agree that if there is equipment which might be idle for portion of the year and if it could be put to some other use it would be a good thing.  Since the production of seaweed meal could not possibly interfere with the drainage and cultivation of bog I do not think there should be any fears in his mind.</P>
    <P>The Senator knows and western Senators must know that seaweed meal is gathered by people around the coast and is collected by agents of those who dry it at the present time. In that way while the primary operation of the board will not be interfered with it may give an opportunity of providing employment elsewhere as part of a process which will be ancillary and complimentary to the main process without in any way interfering with it.</P>

      <P>Might I ask your permission, Sir, and the permission of the House, to refer to the Order made earlier to-day on the Royal Hospital for Incurables Dublin (Charter Amendment) Bill?  The Minister for Health made a statement to-day, and, following that statement, an Order was <Col N="920" /> made referring the Bill to the Joint Committee.  The Seanad members of the Joint Committee have been in consultation on the matter since, and it appears that reference back to the Joint Committee involves expense to the Royal Hospital for Incurables, which is a charitable institution and very short of funds.  Senators who are members of the Joint Committee, Senators Douglas, Colgan and P.F. O'Reilly, have consulted together and have agreed that, in the circumstances, it would be better that the Order should be discharged.</P>
      <P>For the benefit of Senators, I would like to say that that means that the Fourth Stage of the Bill will be passed to-day and the Bill will go to the Dáil. The Minister will presumably make his statement there and Deputies will be free, either to let the Bill go through as an unopposed measure or refer it to the Joint Committee, so that we are not depriving anybody of any rights. I should like to repeat that the three Senators who are members of the committee are in agreement that the Order should be discharged.

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Walsh) Thomas Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish National Stud Company, Limited, was set up by the Minister for Agriculture in April, 1946, to carry on, in the interests of the Irish bloodstock industry, the business of stud farming at the National Stud Farm, Tully, Kildare, or on any other land held by the company.  An annual licence to use and occupy the National Stud Farm for this purpose has been granted to the company by the Minister each year since 1946.</P>
      <P>Section 11 of the National Stud Act, 1945, under which the company was established, fixed the share capital of the company at £250,000, divided into shares of £1 each.  The shares are allotted and issued to the Minister for Finance from time to time, according as capital is required by the board of directors.  The share capital so far issued amounts to £190,880.  This will shortly be increased to £194,130, leaving the amount of share capital unissued at £55,870.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company have, from time to time since 1946, acquired a number of sires and valuable brood mares.  But the stocking of the National Stud has not yet been completed and the board of directors have been emphasising for some years past that to ensure a profitable future for the company the purchase of a staying sire of the highest class would be needed.  Although the company have had a notable success with their sire Royal Charger, this animal is a short-distance horse. Horses of the staying type are much needed in this country in order to develop the export trade in throughbred horses.  Some additional brood mares of the highest class are also <Col N="922" /> required to supplement the stock at the National Stud.</P>
    <P>As the balance of the share capital unissued would be altogether inadequate for these aims, the board of directors have been pressing for some time past for a considerable increase in the authorised share capital of the company.  It should be noted that prices of bloodstock rose sharply after the war.</P>
    <P>Having carefully reviewed the financial requirements for the proper development of the National Stud, the Government approved the preparation of a Bill to amend the National Stud Act, 1945, so as to raise to £500,000 the limit of the share capital of the company. This is the main purpose of the Bill now before the House.  A minor matter also dealt with is that, on the suggestion of the board of directors of the company, the Bill proposes to repeal Section 26 of the 1945 Act, which section has been found to be unsuitable in practice, and to replace it by the more flexible provision set out in Section 3 of the Bill.  The enactment of this Bill is now urgently necessary following on the recent acquisition by the company of the very valuable horse, Tulyar.</P>
    <P>For some years past, the directors of the Irish National Stud Company have been searching in Britain and on the Continent for a suitable staying sire of the highest class.  As far back as July, 1951, the company were informed that if they purchased a suitable horse the price of which involved them in expenditure in excess of the company's unissued share capital, the authority of the Government would be sought for the preparation of a Bill to increase the share capital limit of the company. After further representations from the company, the authority of the Government was obtained on 1st July, 1952, for the preparation of a Bill to increase the share capital of the company. This was long before the purchase of Tulyar was thought of.  I want to emphasise this in order to make clear that this is not a Bill about Tulyar and that, with or without that animal, this Bill would have been necessary in order to enable the company to proceed with their programme <Col N="923" /> for properly stocking and developing the National Stud.  It merely happens that Tulyar is the type of sire for which the directors have been looking for years past.</P>
    <P>Horse-breeding is a long-established national industry in this country.  The net value of the export trade in horses in 1951 exceeded £3,000,000.  A substantial proportion of these exports go to the dollar areas.  Exports to these areas in recent times averaged about £200,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>The possibility of expanding our export trade in horses, and particularly to the dollar area, has been obvious for some time, but it is clear that, in order to expand that trade, horses of the highest standard must be produced.  The Government had this in mind in setting up the National Stud Company in 1946.  It is therefore the duty of that company to operate a policy designed to develop the industry from the national aspect rather than from the narrower aspect of an ordinary company or private individual.</P>
    <P>For success in the breeding of thoroughbred stock, the essentials are: good soils, suitable climate, skill in management and good breeding stock. In our soil, climate and skill, we are second to no country in the world. But, in the fourth essential, i.e. breeding stock, our position can be substantially improved.  There is, for instance, the acknowledged need for more extensive production of really high-class thoroughbreds of the longer distance or staying type.  The National Stud Company is obviously the organisation best equipped to bring about this improvement.  In the purchase of Tulyar, they have very definitely taken a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>Considered from the national point of view, the price the company has agreed to pay for Tulyar, although high, must be regarded as a perfectly sound investment.  A stallion of this sort would, on the average, remain in service for a period of 12 years.  The price of £250,000 to be paid for the horse spread over a period of 12 years would amount to approximately £20,000 <Col N="924" /> per year.  The purchase price of Tulyar when extended over the 12-year period is therefore a very small item as compared with the value of our export trade in horses, which, as already stated, is about £3,000,000 per year. In fact, the outlay on this horse actually amounts to only a very small fraction of the export value of our horses for 12 years at its present level. This purchase opens up great possibilities for the expansion of the industry.</P>
    <P>Apart from the national aspect of the purchase of Tulyar by the National Stud Company, there are also, of course, special advantages for the stud itself.  The earning value of Tulyar at stud is estimated at £16,000 per annum, and may possibly go as high as £20,000 for a period of 12 years.  Also, the company has some 10 or 12 high-class brood mares, some of which will be mated to Tulyar.  The female progeny of such matings will be extremely valuable stock to retain at Tully for stud purposes.  Those not required for this purpose and the colts from such matings, when offered for sale, will undoubtedly fetch very high prices.</P>
    <P>We have justly earned a very high international reputation for the quality of the race horses we produced. The produce of Irish studs have over the years won the most valuable races in many lands, including all the English classics and the most important races in the United States of America.  In the latter country thoroughbred breeding has in recent times reached an extremely high level, due largely to the fact that breeders in that country purchased from the Aga Khan some years ago three horses, Blenheim, Mahmoud and Bahram. These three horses were bred at the Aga Khan's studs in County Kildare, and during their racing careers all three had won Epsom Derbys as well as other important races.  In racecourse performance and pedigree, Tulyar is definitely a better horse than any of the three.  For that reason, American breeders were anxious to secure Tulyar for their studs.  The American interest in the horse leads us to anticipate a very keen demand <Col N="925" /> from that country for his progeny when it comes on the market a few years hence.</P>
    <P>It is also worthy of remark that stud farming has a high labour content; the output per acre is much above average. A review of some of our leading studs has shown that one man is employed for each 20 acres or so, whereas in farms of 200 acres and upwards over the country as a whole, one man is employed on each 42 acres.  The review has further shown that the earnings of a stud farm through service fees and yearling sales amount to upwards of £30 per acre, as against £12 per acre in output over the country as a whole.  In addition to the earnings from horses, there is, of course, on our large studs a considerable turnover from cattle feeding.</P>
    <P>Also, stud farms purchase very large quantities of oats, hay and straw, and at good prices, from farmers in the surrounding districts.  At some of our leading studs, the total amount paid for such items would run from £10,000-£20,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>Racing, which is closely associated with breeding, is also a valuable source of employment.  There are at the moment over 2,000 horses in training with a labour content of 1,200-1,400 men.  In one large racing establishment, the wage bill amounts to upwards of £12,000 per annum, while the purchase of forage amounts to an almost equal sum.</P>
    <P>The value of high-class horses for stud in recent years have been about £120,000-£160,000 each.  The horse, Nasrullah, sold for export after having been used for some years for service here, was about the latter sum.  The horse, The Phoenix, was syndicated at home at about the same sum.  The Aga Khan's horse, Palestine, a good winner for distance not exceeding one mile, is syndicated here at £120,000.  The only horse in Europe that approaches Tulyar to any extent in merit is the French horse Tantieme.  This horse is now at stud in France at a fee of £600 which amounts to an earning capacity of £24,000 per annum.  While his racecourse performances were really good, his pedigree falls entirely short of that of Tulyar.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="926" /> I have already said that the enactment of this Bill is now urgent and I commend it to this House as a sound and necessary measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>There are not many minutes left until 6 o'clock but it will not take me many minutes to say what I have to say about this measure.  I think the Minister is very unfortunate in regard to the timing of his Bill.  All sorts of factors are operating in the minds of the people which influence them in their attitude to the Bill itself. The Minister said that with or without Tulyar the Bill would be necessary but I doubt that.  I doubt whether we would get the Bill were it not for Tulyar.  Frankly, I say to the Minister that it would have been better for him to have said it out straight.  We have got the horse now and it has to be paid for.  I think we have to face up to that situation.</P>
      <P>We have a reputation in this country for breeding good horses.  We have bred good horses but we cannot continue to maintain that reputation unless we have an infusion of new and good blood.  This horse was very much criticised but he proved himself to be quite a remarkable animal.  The Minister suggests that his progeny may be very valuable.  That is just the difficulty. We all hope that his progeny will be very valuable.  Anybody who knows anything about the science of breeding, genetics and the difficulties of trying to estimate what particular crosses will give must realise how difficult it is to prophesy in regard to the kind of progeny Tulyar may produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, the fact remains that this is only a small country.  If this were a great nation which could spend countless millions on a bloodstock industry and if there were great opportunities, we would have the good, the not so very good and the middling.  Our bloodstock constitutes a considerable factor in our total economy.  It is much better for us not to try to feed too many horses any more than too many cows but when we feed horses we ought to feed good horses when we are looking for the good.  We cannot get good horses if we do not endeavour to <Col N="927" /> breed them.  We have got to have the blood and the reputation.</P>
    <P>I am forced to the conclusion that when this horse was on the market there were all sorts of suggestions but whether the Americans were serious or whether other people were serious about it, I do not know.  Any of us who have been to a market realise how difficult it is to understand what is in the mind of the other fellow.  We just do not know how far he is going to go. That is one of the difficulties which confronts everyone who tries to make a bargain.  Presumably these people were in that position but I do not know.  If the horse had gone to another country and if his progeny met progeny from this country, perhaps, people might say how foolish we were not to take the risk and make the investment.  There are a dozen ways in which we might have invested the money here and got a greater return. That is another consideration which must weigh in taking a decision like this.  If we lost the horse we do not know what we would have lost.  We might have lost the chance of half a century.</P>
    <P>Such a horse as this is not easily found and is very difficult to purchase. Wherever such a horse is he is regarded as being very valuable.  I was at the stables of Monsieur Boussac with a group of farmers.  The famous stallion Jezebel was there.  When I asked the gentleman showing us around the place what the value of the animal was he told me in francs a sum which was equivalent to £250,000 sterling.  That was in 1948.  There have been very valuable horses in the world.  They are accepted on their performances and those who purchase them can only hope that their progeny will produce the form which their sires displayed.  That is something about which there is no guarantee.  It is just a gamble.  We are gambling.  Any of us who would be frank about the matter must recognise that we are gambling with £250,000.  The money expended may reproduce itself many times over.  On the other hand it may not.  We just do not know.  I feel I am in the position that the Minister <Col N="928" /> must have my authority to go on with this Bill.  The horse is there and has to be paid for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not have very much to say about this Bill beyond expressing doubt as to the wisdom of expending such an amount of money at the present time on a horse, even of the calibre of Tulyar.  The Minister, of course, in introducing the Bill has stated that this Bill was not brought in because of the purchase of Tulyar, but Senator Baxter in his speech has effectively replied to that and pointed out that it is just the sum for which Tulyar was purchased.</P>
      <P>The trouble about this purchase is that it is a matter of timing, because at the moment we have 90,000 unemployed and I wonder if it is a wise thing to make a gamble of this nature or not.  That is one of the points which could be raised in one's mind. I would have thought, as an industrialist, that if the amount of money spent on the purchase of Tulyar was allowed to industrialists in the form of wear and tear on their machinery or depreciation in buildings, in the long run it might give better national results.  I even thought that, in another sense, if the same endowment was given for the purchase of pedigree bulls for the improvement of our cattle stock it might possibly have been a better purchase than this horse.  These are simply question marks in my mind and something upon which I am not competent to come to a definite decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am rather worried about the amount of money being expended, because I read in an English newspaper that Tulyar is supposed to race again on two occasions in a short while.  I am wondering if when that does happen and if the horse loses what effect it will have on his prestige value and his real value.  I would like the Minister, when he is replying, to tell us if such a decision has been taken to race this horse.  The Minister is one who makes an odd gamble, but in this case it is with a horse.  We all talk about gambling in this case, but <Col N="929" /> Tulyar is, in fact, the outstanding horse of his era.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to condemn the National Stud for their purchase but, as one who does know a little bit about horse racing, there will never again be in this century an opportunity to purchase a horse of the calibre of Tulyar.  Despite all the argument I can see against the purchase, I think it was a wise thing on the part of the National Stud to purchase Tulyar when he came on the market.  If the National Stud had not bought him in order to improve horse breeding here somebody else would have purchased the animal and we would be lamenting it ever after.  I would like to think that not alone was Tulyar being purchased to improve breeding but that another horse, Royal Charger, was also kept here for the same purpose.</P>
    <P>I have heard that Royal Charger's purchase is being negotiated and that he might be sold, and I hope the Minister will prove my information correct or not in this matter.  Any one of us who has been following racing knows that Royal Charger's progeny have been outstanding in the sale ring, as also have some of his colts on a few occasions.  Therefore, if Royal Charger is to be sold I would be as much grieved about his sale as I would be elated by the purchase of Tulyar and the subsequent successes of his progeny.</P>
    <P>The only thing I can say is to doubt the wisdom of the timing of the purchase. Of course, the trouble about it is that the horse was offered at this time and neither the Government nor the National Stud could have anticipated this offer.  I presume that, if the National Stud had failed to take advantage of the horse and not have bought the horse, they would be blamed for it ever afterwards.  Yet, if the horse does turn out to be a failure we will have people coming along and saying: &ldquo;I told you so.&rdquo; But I think we should consider this thing as a gamble and take the long view.  It is an extraordinary gamble but I am a gambler by nature and, therefore, approve of the purchase.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike the last speaker, I emphatically oppose this <Col N="930" /> Bill and the purchase of Tulyar.  There has been a great lot of talk recently about national debt and I think that this Bill could fairly be described even by the Minister himself as our &ldquo;national bet.&rdquo;  The Minister has made no secret that this whole business of the purchase of this racehorse is a gamble and has admitted such in the Dáil.  He then visited the country and, apparently, found out what were the views of the ordinary people regarding this matter and what were the views of his own supporters regarding it.  His attitude ever since then has been that we are not purchasing Tulyar but merely increasing the capital of the National Stud and it is merely coincidental that the increase in the capital of the National Stud is £250,000, which is the sum which is required to outbid the Americans for this racehorse.  I think that this Bill is a bit of mere spring madness.</P>
      <P>I do not know what reasonable excuse the Government can put up on the question which was raised here by Senator O'Donnell.  If the transaction is considered merely from the point of view of the livestock industry and of the breeding of livestock in the country then the Minister is quite right.  No one can devise any reasonable argument against him but you may just as well say that nobody could devise a reasonable argument against the Minister for Defence for coming into Parliament and asking for some millions of pounds for the purchase of an atom bomb to keep it in cold storage in the country.  No one could argue against him about that.  But unfortunately for the Minister for Agriculture he is a member of a Government and as such he cannot look on matters merely through the eyes of his own Department or a section of his Department. Much wider interests have to be considered and Senator O'Donnell spoke of some of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have in this country at the moment something approaching 90,000 unemployed not one of whom is going to secure a day's work because of the spending of this £250,000 on the purchase of a racehorse.  This is being done at the time when Government Ministers have been parading the <Col N="931" /> country spreading gloom and doom and telling the people that we are being put to the pin of our collars to save the £ and to keep the £ on a par with the British £.  They are going round the country telling the people and the country as a whole that we are living too well, spending too much and eating too much.  Few of the people who are getting that kind of advice from Government Ministers that they are spending too much and living too well have sufficient money left in their pockets for luxury purposes or even to put on a small bet never mind thinking about the purchase of racehorses.</P>
    <P>According to the Government, we are living too well and spending too much money and we cannot find the money to meet the arbitration awards for civil servants, or to put up worth-while relief schemes and we cannot find money to keep the housing drive in Dublin City and elsewhere going but yet out of the blue we are able to afford £250,000 for the purchase of a racehorse.</P>
    <P>I think this whole thing is an indefensible business.  I do not know what defence the Minister for Agriculture can make.  I do know that he has made the case that this is a gamble.  There was a time when the Minister, and I think I am not wronging him in this, liked to be considered as a simple farmer in charge of the agricultural destinies of this country.  What has happened now is that he has got the name of being a big time gambler, a man who is gambling for stakes of £250,000 and for £250,000 that is not coming out of his pocket but for £250,000 which is going to come out of the pockets of people who are already, according to the Taoiseach, staggering under the weight of taxation which has been imposed by the present Government, and staggering in order to save money or to raise money when this Government decided to abolish the food subsidies under their budget of last year.</P>
    <P>While that is being done&mdash;and done, according to the Government Ministers, because we are put to the pin of our collar to save the Irish £ and <Col N="932" /> because according to the Ministers we are all spending too much and living too well&mdash;we are asked to provide this sum of £250,000 extra which is not available for the Civil Service or the Army or the police force or for any drainage or bog roads in the country or for use in relief schemes for unemployment. Yet that money is available for the purchase of a racehorse. I find it very hard to explain what I feel about a Government that can come solemnly before the two Houses of the Oireachtas with a proposal like this.</P>
    <P>I am quite well aware of the fact that this Bill was dealt with in the Dáil and is going to be dealt with in the Seanad as a non-Party Bill.  I think it is right that it should be dealt with in that way but I think it is right also that every Senator who has views on the matter should give those views.  I am not hesitating to give my views to the Minister because I think this Bill is an outrageous Bill.  I think the whole proposal is an outrageous one.  I am quite certain on this that no matter who supported the Minister in the Dáil outside or inside his Party or no matter what support he can muster in this Seanad inside or outside his Party if you took a Gallup poll of any cross-section of the people outside Parliament, leaving out possibly those interested in the live stock breeding industry, there would be a very big majority there to condemn this proposal extravagant at any time, and to declare it a bit of lunacy at the present time.</P>
    <P>If no credence is to be attached to the statements made by Government Ministers over the last year or 18 months, if the Minister for Agriculture is going to ask us to disregard completely as so much bosh and nonsense the talks of the Minister for Finance, the speeches of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the words of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, I am quite prepared to stand behind him and agree with him on that, that these speeches are nothing more than a considerable amount of nonsense regarding the financial and economic position of the country.  Is it on that basis that the Minister for Agriculture is going to present this Bill to the <Col N="933" /> Seanad?  Is he going to repudiate the statements made by his Leader and his colleagues that we are on the fringe of financial ruin and bankruptey, that we are living too well and beyond our means and are spending too much.</P>
    <P>Is this Bill to be taken as a repudiation of all that?  Or is it to be taken merely as another example of the paradoxical policy pursued by this Government that within two days of the Taoiseach's telling the Dáil that the people of the country could not afford any more taxation, that they were staggering under the burden of taxation already there, the Minister for Agriculture decides that we have not had enough by a long way.  He is going to see to it that this little island will outbid the American nation when it comes to the purchase of a racehorse.</P>
    <P>If the Minister adopts the attitude that he adopted in the Dáil&mdash;that this is merely a gamble&mdash;I say it is a gamble which should not be taken; I say it is no time for gambling.  The Minister and his colleagues should see to it that other, more urgent, matters should be dealt with first.  When he has saved up £250,000, let him have his little flutter if he likes, but he should not have it at a time and in a situation which has been described by Government Ministers as being so serious, so far as the finances of the country are concerned.  This is not the time for gambling when you have the appalling situation regarding employment and the depression in trade and the slump in building industries.  While those conditions exist the Government should endeavour to find whatever money they can to relieve them.  If they can find £250,000 for any of those problems, which are worthy of solution and ought to claim the first attention of the Government, the Minister will meet little or no opposition in coming to the Dáil and Seanad and asking for money to be invested in the purchase of sires to further the live-stock industry.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister himself said it, but a number of those who supported him in the Dáil on this measure claimed that this should be regarded as investment of a capital nature.  If the Minister believes that, if he believes that we are now making <Col N="934" /> in this expenditure of £250,000 an investment that is going to mean something to generations to come, why does he not borrow to raise the money?  In particular, why does he not endeavour to raise the money from the people who will derive benefit if the Oireachtas passes this Bill?</P>
    <P>Remember, only a very small section of the people will derive any benefit from this flutter of £250,000.  To a very small extent, it may in certain areas affect the question of employment or unemployment, but a certain number of people interested in the industry may be able to derive advantage&mdash;and considerable advantage&mdash;by the spending of £250,000 in this way.  They are only a very small section of the people, but in the main, I think I am correct in saying, they are probably a very wealthy section.  Why does not the Minister approach them and see if he can get them to advance the money or to form some kind of syndicate to advance the sum of £250,000 to purchase the racehorse rather than call on the taxpayers to foot the bill&mdash;taxpayers who, the Taoiseach says, are staggering under the weight of taxation already imposed?</P>
    <P>I think that is a reasonable question to put to the Minister and I think the Minister would be acting as a reasonable man if he endeavoured to raise the money in that way.  It may be that he has made the endeavour.  I am not suggesting that he was so precipitate as to rush into the Dáil and, in order to outdo the Americans, to look for this £250,000, without making some effort to see if the money could be raised elsewhere.  Very probably he did make that effort.  If he did, then we are faced with the position that, having made the effort to get the people who are going to derive benefit from the deal to put up the money, he was turned down by them.  Either they told him: &ldquo;You will have to tax the people to raise the money,&rdquo; or else the Minister has not made the effort at all. If he has not, then he has acted very foolishly.  I will oppose this Bill at every stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>The three speakers who have already spoken have concentrated on the gamble of purchasing <Col N="935" /> his animal.  If the State had not purchased the animal when it was available to us, the gamble would have been greater and if the State refused to purchase and the animal went to the United States and became the great success in that country that we believe it will here, the grousing we would hear from people who like horses would be greater than anything we have heard so far.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that Senator O'Higgins has no knowledge of the ordinary Irish people or of what they think of horses.  I have met more of the ordinary people than Senator O'Higgins did since the Tulyar Bill was introduced and I challenge anyone to name one solitary individual, an acquaintance of mine, in the rural areas, who condemned the Government for this purchase.  In fact, the great majority, while agreeing that the sum was a colossal one but acknowledging that the horse was worth the money&mdash;for Americans do not pay £250,000 for nothing&mdash;were all fully convinced that the Government were fully justified in spending the money on the animal.  If the animal had been let out of the country they would be condemned by people whom we are now told are so much in opposition to its purchase.  I read and listened to some of the speeches made on this Bill in the other House.  I was rather amused by the speech of the Deputy who led for the Opposition but who, in his first speech at any rate, said that he did not know anything of horses. Later on, when he had almost established a precedent by talking the thing out in its later stage, he seemed to have gathered some knowledge about them.  But I was amused that, in the beginning, his speech was based on the grounds that he did not know anything about horses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a grand thing that the people of this country have had the opportunity of purchasing what is, as far as this country is concerned, the greatest animal the world has known.  We know that we have the National Stud Company and that it is composed of people competent to judge the value of this animal and not only that but its <Col N="936" /> value to this country and they in their wisdom decided it should be bought. Who are we here&mdash;a great number of us never sat on a horse&mdash;to decide that these people are talking through their hats and depriving the working man, that so many are shedding crocodile tears over, of work?  If one were to tot up the amount of money needed to remedy all the evils that Senators O'Donnell, O'Higgins and even Baxter have talked of, it is not £250,000 but £250,000,000 that would be needed.</P>
    <P>This brings to my mind the time I brought some friends into Trinity College to see the Book of Kells.  I asked the attendant what money value they set on that particular book.  He was dramatic and took me to the window and pointing to the courtyard said that if it were filled with gold it would not buy the book&mdash;it was priceless.  Supposing he could have got £250,000 for it and supposing that it were allowed out of the country&mdash;it would not be allowed out, of course&mdash;it means we are keeping here when so many people are hungry something which is bringing in nothing in cash, but which is worth that sum of money to us.  In the National Gallery, also, we have many valuable pictures hanging on the walls.  They are not bringing in any money, either.  If we measure everything like that, where will it land us?</P>
    <P>The bloodstock industry is one of our greatest assets.  Although the cattle industry is more valuable, it will be a calamity when the bloodstock industry passes out in Ireland.  I had an experience in Strasbourg&mdash;Senator Hearne will bear me out in this&mdash;during our visit some months ago.  The secretary to the German delegation called at our office, making inquiries about a different question.  Amongst other things he said he was a great admirer of the Irish horse and in my conversation with him I found he knew more about Irish horses than he knew about Ireland.  In fact, the only things firmly in his mind as far as Ireland was concerned were one man and the Irish horse.  If I could judge by his attitude to the Irish horse, I rather think that the faith they have in the Irish horse and the knowledge they have of it there is worth a great deal more to us than the £250,000 there is <Col N="937" /> so much weeping about.  We had a publication called <i>The Irish Horse</i>, and we had distributed all the copies of it, but we told this man we would send him a copy.  Later on, the officials of the Department sent that copy to him. The Department has sent me a copy of the letter this particular man wrote, acknowledging that book.  I wish Senator O'Higgins could see that letter&mdash;it would give him some idea of the value of the Irish horse to this country &mdash;and I am not talking about the value in pounds, shillings and pence.</P>
    <P>I remember the time, when we were all a lot younger, the late Dinny Gorey paid £600 for a greyhound, Harmonica. People thought he was cracked, as that was a fabulous sum to spend some 20 or 30 years ago.  I was talking to a person who has for that length of time been judging coursing throughout the country and he assured me that the purchase of that dog and two others, Dick the Liar and Holga, made the foundation of the greyhound industry, and that you could hardly purchase a dog of any high standard of quality in Ireland, England or Scotland but you would find traces of these animals in him.  Dinny Gorey's investment, though it seemed foolish at the time, was worth millions of pounds to this country since then.  I have read that the sale of our bloodstock last year amounted to £3,000,000, so £250,000 is a small sum by way of investment.</P>
    <P>One of the things I have wanted to hear in this debate is someone saying the animal is not worth that money, that we are paying it for an animal that could be bought for less, or that the animal is worth only £100,000; but I have heard it stated several times here that the animal is actually worth the money.  It is a very sorry day when our people become so poor that we cannot afford to buy the best in the world while it is in our own country and keep it and sell the progeny.  To make a correction, may I say that the price paid for Harmonica was £1,000 and for Holga £600?</P>
    <P>When people spend money on something which may not prove successful they are always liable to be condemned. Something may happen to Tulyar&mdash;we hope nothing will&mdash;or the <Col N="938" /> progeny may not be up to his standard, but all the odds are in favour of the belief that it will be.</P>

      <P>In my opinion, 90 or 100 to 1, that the progeny of Tulyar will be worth the money every time. I would be perfectly happy if the progeny carry on as he carried on during the time he was racing.  Some Senator asked what would happen if Tulyar raced again and was beaten. He also said that only a very small section have a real interest in this animal. The Senator would be amazed if he knew the tremendous number who are most interested.  I grant that only a very small number could afford to put in the big sums to a syndicate such as he talks of to buy it.  The number interested in his purchase is far greater than he imagines; the number inclined towards buying the animal is far greater than he thinks.  Practically everyone in rural Ireland has a bet on a horse and I think it is delightful that they do.  I have never condemned it, though I do not do much myself.  Just as the National Anthem says that we are, &ldquo;children of a fighting race&rdquo;, I like to think we are children of a gambling race, too, because there is nothing really wrong in gambling.  If a man wishes to back his fancy, why not?  If a Gallup poll were taken, Senator O'Higgins would get the surprise of his life.</P>

I sincerely hope the animal will prove a tremendous success.  It is always a great pleasure to me that we <Col N="939" /> can keep in this country the best of any particular line, animal or otherwise, that is available.  I very heartily support the Minister's introduction of the Bill, and I hope the purchase will be 100 per cent. worth while.</P>

      <P>I oppose this Bill.  I have considered the matter very carefully and, if I have any bias in the matter at all, it is in favour of the National Stud Company.  That is a company to which the country, and the bloodstock industry in particular, owes a great debt.  It is a company which has been run with considerable success since its formation.  Practically every member of the board of that company is an expert in the bloodstock breeding business.  These are my views as to that concern, and we might be careful in the course of this debate to see that we do not in any way hurt the reputation of that company, although I should think it would be difficult to do so.</P>
      <P>Senator Loughman is looking for the man who says that £250,000 is too much to pay for this horse.  I accept his challenge.</P>

There was not the like of Tulyar as a three year old and if he is raced as a four year old, I have not got the slightest fear that there will be anything to beat him.  Nevertheless, he is not worth £250,000.  Tulyar's highest value in my view, is £175,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.F. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>The company is paying too much, at least £75,000 too much, for the horse.  It is nonsense to think that, because the Minister has brought in a Bill seeking £250,000, we should say the horse is worth £250,000. It is nonsense to say that the Aga <Col N="940" /> Khan could get the same price from Americans.  I assert that His Lordship, His Reverence or His Imperial Highness would not sell him to America and that he has a very good reason for not doing so.  I will tell the House why he would not sell him to America.  The Aga Khan, the greatest bloodstock breeder in the world, is very concerned to see that Tulyar will be available for some of his mares for breeding purposes.  It will be very convenient for the Aga Khan to have Tulyar standing in Ireland or in England.  It will not cost him, if the sire stands here or in England, £1,000 return fare to the States for a mare and it will not cost him a fee of £2,000 for the services of Tulyar, as would be the fee if he stood in the States.  The fee here may be £500 or £600.  The vendor of this animal would in no circumstances send him to America for the reasons I have mentioned.</P>
      <P>It is nonsense for anybody to tell me that we were right in paying this money for this horse simply because we should not allow him to go to America.  In no circumstances, would the vendor send him to the States.  He is being sold here (1) because the vendor thinks he is getting an exceedingly good price, and (2) because he will be very convenient to serve his mares here.  The vendor was so keen about this, I understand, that he provided, or at any rate suggested that he should get four nominations per year.  I fully approve of that portion of the agreement.  I fully approve that, in his first few years, the horse should serve only high-class mares, so that his first year's progeny, we may expect, will be first-class and we may thereby get a good name for the horse.  I hope I have made it quite clear that there was not the slightest chance of his emigrating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister put forward as one of the reasons why we should purchase this animal the fact that it would turn over a very considerable sum of money for us in the sale&mdash;not in service fees only&mdash;of yearlings which he would produce.  We in this country will get practically no money for the yearlings which Tulyar will produce, and for this reason.  Tulyar, in his first year, will serve about 20 mares and, in subsequent <Col N="941" /> years, 40.  We will then have 15 to 18 foals in the first year and 30 to 35 in the years after, assuming that everything goes well and the horse is good.  In the main, the mares that will be served by Tulyar will be English mares.</P>

I suggest to the Minister that at least 75 per cent. of the first 20 mares will be mares from England. We shall get in respect of these mares the service fees.  We will not get, as the Minister said elsewhere, the value of the yearling that is realised at the sale.  We will get merely the service fees.  The horse will serve some Irish mares, I have no doubt, but I want to correct what the Minister said elsewhere, that all the yearlings of Tulyar would be sold from Irish mares at Ballsbridge, Doncaster or Newmarket sales.  That, I say, is not correct, and the Minister is misinformed as to that. In the main, our profit from Tulyar will be the service fees that will be charged and the Minister has put that forward as a reason for our purchasing the horse.  If I am right in what I say, it is a very bad reason and in fact no reason at all.</P>

Senator Loughman is talking the greatest balderdash when he says the people are going around welcoming him to Clonmel and district and saying: &ldquo;Thank goodness, you got the Bill through the Dáil.  Go up and get it through the Seanad now.&rdquo;  That is the greatest nonsense.  The people of this country are quite clear in their view, and their view is: &ldquo;What the heck are they buying Tulyar for at that figure?&rdquo; That is the view of the ordinary man in the street.  Let me say this also: If Tulyar were the real value he is supposed to be, £250,000, is it not good sense to ask why the bloodstock breeders of England, whom we would expect would have the money, would not say: &ldquo;Listen.  He is a gift at this figure&rdquo; and get the money straight away and pay it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.F. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not obliged to pass this Bill because there has not been a commitment by the National Stud.  They have not committed themselves until the way is cleared to get the money, and they cannot get the money until we pass this Bill.  The National Stud is a concern of which we should be very proud.  However, I think that, in paying this money, they are paying too much.  I think that the Government, having regard to all the complaints they have made about the difficulty of getting money, are altogether wrong in agreeing to promote this Bill to get the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main reason why we require a horse of the calibre, standing and proved performance of Tulyar is because the stud has not a horse at the moment that is likely to get horses that will win races beyond six furlongs. Two of our best horses to-day are Preciptic and Royal Charger.  Royal Charger has got horses which have won mile races but no horse which has won any good class of a mile race.  Preciptic may get such horses.  The main reason for buying Tulyar is to get a horse that would be reasonably certain to produce <Col N="944" /> horses that would stay longer than a mile.  In Tulyar there is such a horse. If the stud buys Tulyar, I do not think there is any reason why they should retain Royal Charger.  They will be overloading the stud so to speak.  If they buy Tulyar they should dispose of Royal Charger for the reason that Tulyar will take his place.</P>
    <P>The principal idea in forming the National Stud was to enable the less well-off man who was interested in bloodstock to send his mares to high-class horses.  That was the original idea, as well as to provide generally for the bloodstock industry and improve it.  It was never thought that the stud would charge the man in the smaller way with the relatively good mare the fee they would charge the better off man.  In other words, the company was to help the small breeders.  So far as I know, no line has been drawn between the breeder who is well off and the breeder who is not so well off.  Every breeder has to pay whatever the fee was.  Some reduction in fees should be made to enable the smaller man to send good class mares to high-class horses.</P>
    <P>In regard to the racing of Tulyar, I have no doubt that the stud would be making a great mistake not to run this horse again.  Suppose they ran him and he is beaten.  That is all right and no harm will be done.  Suppose he is beaten in two races.  In that event he might not be regarded as so valuable as he was, but his reputation has been made.  I believe the horse as a four-year-old will not and cannot be beaten. I believe that last year the horse improved all the time in all his races. Every time he won he showed he was a better horse.  If Tulyar is bought he should be raced.</P>
    <P>I am against the Bill, and I am prejudiced in the matter but prejudiced in favour of the National Stud.  I have an extremely high regard for it.  It is a wonderful concern, and everybody connected with it knows a great deal about bloodstock breeding, and a number of them know more about bloodstock breeding than anybody else in this country.  I think they are not wise in paying this amount for the horse.  I am not concerned with the <Col N="945" /> gamble.  I know there is a risk, but the same risk would be there if you expended £150,000.  I think the stud is not wise to purchase the horse, and the Government at £250,000 has a great cheek to introduce a Bill to provide money for a racehorse when they cannot provide money for more important and pressing matters.</P>

      <P>I must say that I was never more amazed in my life than I was to hear the speech made by Senator O'Reilly.  As it happened, I was at a point-to-point meeting to-day. The committee arranged to have 2,000 cards printed.  They were sold before I got there.  There must have been about 5,000 people there.  Quite naturally one could not go to a place like that without hearing a funny story about Tulyar, but I did not hear anybody speak against the purchase of the horse.  I met a prominent man in the racing world, a man who was largely responsible for the training of that wonderful horse, Tetrach.  He invited me to a cup of tea after the meeting, but I told him I could not accept the invitation as I had to go back to the Seanad where there would be a discussion on Tulyar.</P>

      <P>It just shows what politics can do to people, particularly legal gentlemen.  I thought that all the nonsense was finished when the matter of Tulyar was discussed in the Dáil, but apparently we are only <Col N="946" /> starting.  In any case, I was amazed to hear the speeches made by Senator O'Higgins and Senator O'Reilly, and the further these speeches went on the more amazing they became.  I do not mind anyone standing up and saying that he is against the purchase of Tulyar at the price he is supposed to cost, but when Senator O'Reilly stands up and says that he does not believe the horse is worth £250,000, but is worth £175,000, it is just complete nonsense.  The man who advises the Senator, or at least the man who tells me he advises him, says the horse was a gift at the price, and then goes on and talks about the various prices made for Irish horses over the years. I am largely going on his advice, and if I wanted advice at any time about racing, I would never have any hesitation in going to that same man and asking his opinion.</P>
      <P>I am not influenced by politics, and, standing up here, I speak my own mind.  In case I may be accused of having some connection with the Racing Board, I would like to say here and now that I am a representative of the Bloodstock Breeders' and Horse Owners' Association, and also a member of the Racing Board.  Further, in case anybody might make a mistake, they are both voluntary jobs for which I am getting no money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I do good work: maybe my best is not good enough, but I give my best.  With regard to the statements made, I am simply amazed.  I hope, before we finish with the Bill, that at least some people will stand up on the other side and make some sort of sensible statement.  I see one man who, at least, knows as much about the matter as anyone who has yet spoken about thoroughbreds and racehorses, and, while I am not a great gambler, I will back him at two to one that he will be in favour of the Bill, and that is Senator McGee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is right that we should discuss a Bill of this kind in this House, and I do not think it should have been discussed in the <Col N="947" /> other House, without someone paying a tribute to the late Paddy Ruttledge. I am right in saying that Mr. Ruttledge was a man who was consulted when the National Stud was set up and was placed on that board.  While he was on that board his advice and experience were invaluable to the National Stud and, because of his advice and experience, the National Stud has become the success it is to-day. Possibly as a result of his advice, the National Stud came along with the idea that one of the most important, things, if not the most important, it could do was to get a horse of the type of Tulyar.</P>
    <P>A lot of nonsense has been talked, as has been pointed out already, about this horse in the Dáil.  Senator Loughman said he would like to meet somebody opposed to the purchase of Tulyar, but I think it would take a long time knocking around the country &mdash;and Senator Loughman is in touch with rural Ireland as much as anyone&mdash;to do so.  If you wanted to find anyone in a hurry who was opposed to the purchase you would have to go into the Dáil and, apparently, we can find now two in the Seanad.  Senator Loughman pointed out the effect that the purchase of Harmonica by the late Denis Gorey had on the greyhound industry of this country.  I was associated with the greyhound industry then, but I had nothing to do with it for the last 25 years.  I remember, however, that when Mr. Gorey bought the dog for £1,000 there was a lot of talk, but he was correct.  Of course, £1,000 then was like £10,000 now. Any of the outstanding greyhounds being sold at the present time can trace back their breeding to Harmonica.</P>
    <P>We should take an example from things of this kind and the result of breeding from outstanding horses in the past, rather than take the views of Senators O'Reilly and O'Higgins that the Minister should have gone around and got some individual to buy a horse at that price.  When you get into that kind of financial figure it is only on a long-term policy that a person can buy that type of horse, and I believe that <Col N="948" /> the National Stud would be neglecting its duty if it allowed the horse to go to any other country in the world.  If he was allowed to go, we would have more people standing up criticising the National Stud for letting him go out of the country than there are criticising his being kept here.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that we should have people in this and the other House criticising directly and indirectly members of the National Stud who are not here to defend themselves.  I do not think that they need my or anybody else's help because their record since they took up office will stand more in their favour.  One would think that they had no interest whatever in this country and were not suitable for their jobs, if you were to listen to the talk and criticisms we have heard. Since they have taken over their jobs as Directors of the Stud, they have done most creditable work and, as a result of their efforts the National Stud is on a sound financial footing to-day as a business proposition, apart from anything else.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Higgins launched what I might call an indirect attack on the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mind a man launching a direct attack on anybody, but I do not like this indirect attack and attack by innuendo.  The Senator said that some time ago the Minister was regarded as a simple farmer and now he is a big-time gambler.  The Minister is no stranger in any part of this country and has been in a prominent position in this country for a long number of years.  He is well known in his constituency, and far outside it, as a simple and first-class farmer, and also as a man who has taken a prominent part in sporting circles as well as the horse breeding industry.  We have in the position of Minister a man who has taken an interest in the horse breeding industry for a long number of years and who, as long as he is in that position, would look favourably upon any proposition <Col N="949" /> which will arise as far as the horse breeding industry is concerned.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Reilly would be prepared if he were Minister for Agriculture to give £175,000 for Tulyar, but not £250,000.  I would like to know on what basis he is judging that Tulyar is worth £175,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the Aga Khan having to send certain mares to Tulyar is concerned, all I can say is that there are a lot of stallion owners in this country, owners of first class stallions who, I think, will be very glad to give three or four nominations to the Aga Khan for the best mares in his stud farm.  The best thing which could happen in regard to a young sire is that in the initial years of his career he would get the highest possible quality of mares, and on that account I am simply delighted to find that in the first year, at least, Tulyar can hope <Col N="950" /> to get four mares brought to him, probably the best mares in the Aga Khan's stable.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Higgins said that the majority of the people in this country were against the purchase of Tulyar. I do not believe that for one moment. I believe that the average person in this country&mdash;the overwhelming majority of the people in this country &mdash;are interested in sport and in the fact that Irish racehorses have been carrying the Irish flag to victory in various racecourses throughout the world.  In the Dáil we had Deputy Dunne declaring that the Minister for Agriculture had tried to wrap the green flag round Tulyar.  I believe that the average citizen of this country will be delighted in the years to come to see the Tricolour, and not the green flag, wrapped around the progeny of Tulyar in the racecourses of the world.</P>
      <P>I do not know how many people in this country have gone abroad to attend race meetings, but I remember the first year when I attended the Grand National at Liverpool and saw the Tricolour flying from the grandstand. What a wonderful thing I thought that was.  Then I saw the Tricolour wrapped round the winner of the Grand National and I was really delighted.  I had the same feeling when I saw that happen in other high-class race meetings in England and other countries.  I thought that was a grand thing, and I hope the Minister will still be here when the progeny of Tulyar are winning the classic races of England and of the other countries in the world.</P>
      <P>There are a number of other things which I propose to go into later and, with the permission of the House, I propose to read a portion of my speech.</P>
      <P>When the leading Opposition Party in the Dáil humanly removed its Whips from Tulyar, the more enlightened members of that Party heartily supported the National Stud Bill.  On the other hand, the purpose of the measure appears to have given nightmares to some other members of the House.  It is difficult to know how much of this opposition was genuine and how much of it was conditioned by Party discipline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Racing Board Bill had the <Col N="951" /> support generally of the Deputies now supporting Tulyar and it was opposed by practically the same gentlemen who object to this Bill.  I must say that it is a little bit of a puzzle to figure that out.  It is difficult to know just what would have happened with all these divisions if the Coalition happened to be there when the purchase of Tulyar came up.  I am afraid what would have happened would have been that this country would have lost Tulyar.</P>
    <P>Time has proved the Opposition completely wrong, as the organisation and finance of racing here since the Racing Board commenced to operate are the admiration and envy of racegoers and racing authorities all over the world.  The well-endowed prizes for classic and semi-classic events have encouraged owners to retain and race high-class fillies here and some of these will, I hope, later prove fitting mates for Tulyar.</P>
    <P>By virtue of their powers under the National Stud Act, the Government appointed five experts to administer its provisions, including the purchase of bloodstock to improve breeding.  In their purchases up to the present they have been amply justified by the results they have achieved.  They are not only the best&mdash;they are the only people to judge what animals should or should not be introduced into the stud.</P>
    <P>The performance of the progeny of Tulyar's matings will not confirm or confound the wisdom of his purchase for some years to come.  On the horse's record on the race track and on his blood lines, there is every probability of resulting benefits to Irish racing and breeding.</P>
    <P>So far as the horse itself is concerned, he is the very type of horse that the National Stud Board have been looking for since its formation. It is unfortunate, in view of the notice appearing in this evening's papers that there is a proposal to sell Royal Charger, that we should have people standing up in this House attempting to run down that particular horse.</P>

      <P>I do not know who made the statements, but statements were made here which were injurious so far as Royal Charger is concerned.  I think that Royal Charger has more than justified the people who purchased him and to-day as far as his record at stud goes he is a match for any other sire. At the moment there are more than two or three parties interested in competing for the purchase of Royal Charger from the National Stud.  I believe that if he is sold his value will be comparable with the stud value of the horse we are now discussing&mdash; Tulyar.  I am not saying that he is as good a horse as Tulyar, which is admittedly the greatest horse in the world to-day, but I think that Royal Charger has increased in popularity over the past couple of years and that when the history of racing for 1952 and 1953 comes to be written, Royal Charger will be very high up in the supply of bloodstock winners.</P>

      <P>Before trying to arrive at a value of this new cog which has been acquired for our bloodstock machine, let us pause for a moment to take a look at the machine itself, to study its workings and its purpose, to judge whether it needed a new cog and to assess to what extent the output of the machine can be improved by its acquisition.</P>

      <P>England has developed her coal industry, Southern France her vineyards, Persia her oil wells, America her steel.  In Ireland we have no natural wealth of coal, oil, or iron ore lying beneath our fields (or for that matter, sun to warm the grape above them), but what we have been blessed with, and blessed with in more generous measure than most other countries in the world, is bone-building, strength-giving, limestone land, the very essence of animal growth.</P>

      <P>It is as important to our country that this inherent wealth be used to the best possible advantage as it is to England that every possible ounce of coal should be mined, or to Persia that every gallon of oil should flow from her wells.</P>
      <P>Horse breeding has naturally played an important part in the lives of our people for many a year, but it is only in recent times that our Government has got around to harnessing this natural power to enable it to play its full part in helping the national economy.  Senators who have studied the history of this country will remember that there was a time when the owner of a horse was likely to have it acquired if it was worth anything over the figure of £5.  Unfortunately, the inferiority complex created as a result of those laws still lingers and certain elements in this country still believe that there is no reason why the Irish people and the National Stud, which in this instance represents the Irish people, should own a horse like Tulyar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apparently some people believe that if this country is lucky enough to <Col N="955" /> breed a horse of that type it should be put on the open market and exported to a foreign country and the people of that country should get the benefit of that particular horse rather than the people of the country in which it was bred.  I do not agree with that view. I am not, I think, cursed with that inferiority complex and I believe, as I have always believed, that nothing is too good for this country.  The best horses in the world were bred here, and as far as the Government or the National Stud in this country can do they should ensure that in the years to come there will be no chance that they will be lost.  In that way they will ensure the continuation of first-class horse-breeding in this country.</P>
    <P>The formation of the Racing Board and the National Stud Board are two concrete steps which have been taken to assist the growth of the bloodstock industry.  The Racing Board, by ploughing back into racing the proceeds of the betting tax, have increased the status and value of Irish races far above their pre-war level and have thus provided a shop window worthy of the display of high-class goods.  This more attractive shop window has in itself provided an added incentive to breeders to improve the quality of their stock.  In order to promote still further this all-important industry a National Stud has been formed, the task of which is to provide for all breeders, big and small, stallions of sound breeding and racing performance at reasonable fees and to assist in any possible way in raising the prestige of Irish bloodstock.  Senator O'Reilly suggests that as far as Tulyar is concerned the people of this country will not benefit at least for the first year, because it is his opinion that the mares that will be brought to Tulyar will be all from outside this country.</P>

      <P>It is true a number will be from outside the country but the Minister has made his statement in the Dáil&mdash;I do not know if he said it in this House, I was not here to hear it&mdash;that <Col N="956" /> there will be no departure from the procedure heretofore which was that 25 per cent. of the mares will be allocated by the Board in the ordinary way, and as far as they can judge they will select the best mares available and 75 per cent. will be balloted for by breeders of this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Reilly then knows more than the Minister or the Racing Board or the National Stud.  If the National Stud is to play its part efficiently it is imperative that every stallion that takes up residence there should be the best representative available of his own class.  In this way a strong and sound formation can be built up capable of supplying first-class assistance to every category of breeder.</P>
      <P>It has been pointed out in the Dáil by some of the more enlightened speakers on this measure that the National Stud should acquire not alone Royal Charger and Tulyar, but other stallions which would be capable of breeding first-class horses and that those stallions should be available to the ordinary breeders who are not in a position to pay high prices by way of stud fees.  I believe that system should be extended on the lines adopted in France and sires of good class should be made available to various sections and not allocated by the National Stud.  I understand one or two horses, the property of the National Stud, are standing in outside studs.  I believe that system should be extended, for the more it is extended the more it will raise the standard of breeding in this country.</P>
      <P>Until six weeks ago, however, the spearhead of the formation was missing.  The stud, in fact, possessed no stallion who could reasonably be expected to sire top-class performers over the full classic distance.  That is what Senator O'Reilly said and that is exactly what his adviser and my adviser holds.  He is a very good authority on racing.  He says the chances are that Tulyar will sire horses very likely to win classic events in this and other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="957" /> This need was realised by everyone concerned, but to look for and to find a stallion with these qualifications are two very different popositions?  The National Stud Board have been looking for a horse of this kind for a number of years.  When Tulyar came on the market and it was decided they should purchase this in the interests of the National Stud and the future of the horse-breeding industry, it was not a case of one or two people on the board deciding it.  They were unanimously in favour of the purchase of Tulyar.  I believe that if a Bill came up here to increase the capital of the stud, without any reference to the purchase of a horse of any description, it would have gone through the Dáil in all stages in a day.  I do not believe there would have been a word about it. I am convinced that certain speakers in the other House jumped at this purchase of Tulyar for political purposes and nothing else, and even on that low standard I am saying they have backed another loser.</P>
    <P>Normal, ordinary people in this country are sporting people, interested in the welfare of every industry, and the vast overwhelming majority have not a word to say against the purchase of Tulyar.  As I have said, the need was realised by everyone concerned, but to look for and to find the stallion with these qualifications are two very different propositions.  There are few horses bred in a decade which come near to fulfilling all the requirements of a classic stallion prospect, and of these a large percentage are usually owned by mammoth breeders who will not part with their &ldquo;super horse&rdquo; at any price.</P>
    <P>That was exactly the position of Tulyar.  Most people thought the Aga Khan would not sell the horse, no matter what price was paid.  We know that money does not mean much to a man of his wealth.  But because he wanted the horse to remain in this country, to remain within reach of his own mares, he was agreeable to sell it to this country at a lesser price than anywhere else.</P>

      <P>Senator P.F. O'Reilly says &ldquo;Ssh&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;  I do not know what <Col N="958" /> that means.  I can assure the House that I was in touch this morning by telephone with a man well known to horsebreeding in this country.  He telephoned me from Shannon Airport on his way back from America to France.  He is Mr. L.L. Lawrence, who bred some horses which carried the Irish flag in England, France and largely in America.  He called on the 'phone to-day and said: &ldquo;I do not know who is to be congratulated but you can give my congratulations to the Minister for Agriculture, to the National Stud Board or whoever is responsible for the purchase of Tulyar.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That is what you think. He has paid more taxes in this country than people who have a lot to say about Tulyar.  To tell you what his standing is in the racing world, I may say he has bred some of the most important horses in this country or any other country&mdash;the second or third most important in the United States at the present time, Prince Quillo, the second or third most important sire in the United States.  He said this country was particularly lucky, that it was the talk of the United States that this country had purchased Tulyar.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>The arrival of Tulyar on the market was a rare occurrence and one which, if it were humanly possible to exploit it, was too good an opportunity to miss.  Few will argue that Tulyar fails to fulfil the requirements of a classic stallion.  True, he has not yet proved his ability as a four-year old, but most racing men are agreed that the style of his past performances strongly suggests that he will be capable of doing so if required.  We have had some of the judges here in the Seanad who say that the horse should be raced again pointing out what would happen if he were beaten and what would happen if he were not beaten.  I take it that the Minister, while I think he is a far better judge <Col N="959" /> of what should be done with the horse than any previous speakers, will probably leave that matter to the National Stud Board.  They are the people who have to decide and, if they asked my advice, I would say: &ldquo;Leave well enough alone; you have the greatest horse in the world, with an unbeaten record; put him to the stud and await results, and I have no doubt as to what the results will be.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is difficult to make much of a case against the breeding potential of Tulyar.  A lot of people have tried to find fault, but in the debates here and in the other House no one has succeeded in making any kind of a case against the purchase of Tulyar on either performance or breeding lines. They are second to none and I believe the results will prove that the National Stud Board is right and that people who are opposed to this Bill here or in the other House have backed another loser.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No major industry can fight its way to the top of the tree without the backing of advertising.  Indeed, as the 20th century progresses, it seems that advertising is playing an ever-growing part in our daily lives.  By purchasing Tulyar at a moment when the world limelight had switched from the brilliance of his three-year-old career and was intensifying its focus upon his possible $1,000,000 purchase by America, we struck an advertising blow for the Irish bloodstock industry such as has never been equalled in the history of horse breeding.  That is a fact.  There is no racecourse or meeting of any description in the United States, according to the man who spoke to me this morning, which has not discussed the purchase of Tulyar and which has not given the impression that Ireland, having purchased Tulyar, is the envy of practically every country in the world where horse breeding is an industry.  No £1,000,000 advertising campaign could have drawn the eyes of the world upon Irish bloodstock so effectively as did the news that this great Irish-bred horse was destined to return to the land of his birth.  In every corner of the world to-day, whenever two horsemen meet, it will not be <Col N="960" /> many minutes before the names of Tulyar and Ireland arise and are coupled in the conversation.  That is real advertising and is worth all the posters and pamphlets in the world.</P>
    <P>Tulyar's purchase, however, will pay even more dividends than those attributable to stud fees and advertising value.  There will be keen competition for his services, and almost certainly the directors of the National Stud will take into consideration the quality of the mares whose names are submitted, in their allocation of at least some of the nominations.  His presence at Tully will, therefore, act as a spur to Irish breeders to improve the quality of their brood mares, a most desirable improvement.  The Irish breeders, realising the importance of the stallion which will now be at the National Stud, will try as far as possible to have mares acceptable as suitable mates for Tulyar, and that will be an incentive to people to go into breeding better class horses.</P>
    <P>Many of Tulyar's progeny will come up for auction at the Ballsbridge yearling sales, and it is reasonable to expect that their presence there will attract buyers from all over the world. The likelihood of more foreign buyers travelling to the sales will influence more breeders to sell their yearlings on the home market and will thus add even further lustre to the Irish bloodstock scene.  These and other far-reaching effects will prove before many years are passed that the acquisition of Tulyar was a praiseworthy and logical step in the building of a great national industry.</P>
    <P>I believe, as Senator Loughman has pointed out with regard to Harmonica, that, in years to come, people will trace back the breeding of high-class horses in this country to Tulyar.  I remember, when I was 30 or 40 years younger, members of my family were interested in the bloodstock industry. Then, for most of the horses, they tried to trace back to Birdcatcher.  I remember one old horse, not worth as much as Tulyar, £175,000&mdash;he was a horse called &ldquo;The Rack&rdquo;&mdash;and I heard about him very often.  He was by Thrales, by Restless, by Breadelban, by Stockwell, by The Baron, by <Col N="961" /> Birdcatcher.  They tried to trace the breed of several old horses back as far as Birdcatcher.  I believe that, in 20, 30, 40 or 100 years' time, if this horse has the luck we all wish him, even those speaking politically against him, the people of this country will be tracing the pedigree of stallions and yearlings, and, instead of going back to Birdcatcher, they will be and back to Birdcatcher, they will be tracing back to Tulyar.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to say we have some wealthy individuals who should have purchased this horse.  No matter how patriotic the individual is, he is bound to take notice of the immediate result likely to come; but the country as a whole, as represented by the National Stud, is bound to look far into the future and realise that, far and above any immediate profits which may come as a result of the purchase of horses of this country, in the years to come his progeny will bring into this country money such as was never brought into it before, as a result of the sale of bloodstock.  It is important to note that Tulyar, as far as I know, will be the third Derby winner ever to stand at stud in this country.  I can be corrected if I am wrong.  The others were Arctic Prince, the property of Mr. Joe McGrath, and&mdash;I think, though I am not quite sure, he stood as a stallion here&mdash;Orby.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>Orby stood as a stallion here, but in any case it is very important that we have horse of this type standing here.  As I said earlier, there was a time when the Irish people could not afford to maintain the best horses the country was able to produce. At that time, we had not our own Government and we had not what would be called an Irish National Stud to take over jobs of this kind. That was a time when two such horses as Galtymore and Ard Patrick, bred in County Limerick by Mr. Gubbins, won the Derby and, having won the Derby, were sold, one to Russia and the other to Germany.  In these countries to-day, they are tracing back the pedigrees of their high-class horses <Col N="962" /> to the horses bought for very small sums from the people who bred them here.</P>
      <P>In the past, Ireland has been very much in the limelight so far as breeding high-class steeplechase horses is concerned, but has not been so much in the limelight so far as flat racehorses are concerned.  In 50 years, 33 Irish-bred horses have won the Grand National, a record of which any country might be proud.  It will be a terrible accident if we do not have an Irish horse winning the Grand National this year, too, and it is a safe bet that, of the first five horses passing the post after that race, the first three will be Irish-bred.  That is a reasonable bet, and if you keep on making it you will finish up backing winners.</P>
      <P>With regard to the other type of horse&mdash;what might be called the short distance horse or sprinter&mdash;we have not had the success we might have had. We have done fairly well since 1920, in that eight Irish bred horses won the English Derby, seven Irish bred horses won the English Oaks and 15 won the St. Leger.</P>
      <P>A desperate effort will have to be made if we are to hold our place, particularly so far as the United States are concerned.  If this horse had been allowed to go to the United States&mdash; and I have no doubt whatever that an American syndicate was prepared to pay far more for the horse than we were prepared to pay&mdash;we would have far more criticism than we have to-day because he was not allowed to go to America and because he was purchased for the benefit of the breeders of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the slightest doubt about that.  As a result of his purchase by the National Stud, we will have American buyers coming to the Dublin sales and, while they cannot all be accommodated with Tulyar yearlings, any normal man will agree with me that, if a man comes from America to purchase a Tulyar yearling, and if he cannot get a Tulyar yearling, he will buy the next best and, if he cannot get the next best, he will take the next best again, so that, as a result <Col N="963" /> of the purchase of this horse, not only for the next five, ten or 12 years, or for whatever period of years he continues to stand, for 20, 30 and 50 years to come, people will be coming here trying to get Tulyar blood.  By the passing of this Bill and the purchase of this horse for the National Stud, we are building up an industry which will bring in dollars in perhaps greater measure than most of the other industries we are backing to-day.</P>

Some slight benefit for political purposes may be gained.  There are some people in this country slightly inclined to the left&mdash;slightly pink, or between pink and red&mdash;who are against the purchase of Tulyar.  I am not suggesting that either Senator O'Higgins or Senator O'Reilly are either pink or red, but I have a slight suspicion that the people against the purchase are catering for that type of vote, and I think it is disgraceful that a national industry, bringing in millions to the country, with the prospect of bringing in far more in the future, should be made the plaything of political Parties. The purchase of this horse should have the support of every political Party, and, when the whips were taken off Tulyar, the more enlightened people, the more educated and more reasonable <Col N="964" /> people, in the various Parties, even those who originally formed the Coalition, backed the purchase.  All I can say is that I am sorry for the people who did not, because they are in a hopeless minority.</P>

But I have the average farmer's knowledge of a good horse.  Down in the West, we judge them by the depth of their shoulders, the width of their chest or the shortness of their fetlocks.  We have our own technical terms for them, but apart from that, I know nothing about thoroughbreds and pedigrees and, as I say, I do not intend to bother learning at this stage.  So far as the Bill is concerned, however, I regard it as the action of a group of madmen to present to a country in the state in which this country is a bill for £250,000 for any racehorse, no matter what his pedigree or what he is worth, or what they think he is worth or expect he would realise, if put up in the open market.  If this country were prosperous and rolling in wealth, if every individual in it was employed at work which gave him a good weekly return, if everybody had full and plenty and if we had no emigration, I would still oppose the payment of £250,000 for Tulyar.</P>

      <P>No horse in the world is worth that when it comes to a decision to provide money for a horse rather than human beings.  Some of the Minister's colleagues are now trying to point out that this is not a Bill for the purchase of Tulyar, that we are only advancing this money to raise capital for the National Stud. We were told to-night that the money would be advanced whether Tulyar was purchased or not.  We know that is all cod and humbug.  This £250,000 is for the purchase of this thoroughbred. It is a gamble which no Government in the world would undertake. No Government in the world would tax its own people to provide £250,000 for the purchase of a racehorse.</P>
      <P>We are told the Americans wanted to buy it.  Was it the American Government who wanted to buy it?  Was the Secretary to the American Treasury going to ask the taxpayers of that country to put up the money to purchase the horse, or was it a group of individuals in the Southern States of America who formed a syndicate and put up their own money?</P>

We are told how nice it was of the Aga Khan to sell us this horse and how lucky we were to get him and that it was an exceptional stroke of good luck.  Is it not strange that we never thought of our exceptional ill luck?  If we check up on the register of unemployed we will find <Col N="967" /> that 90,000 of our able-bodied men are without work, all marching to the labour exchanges.</P>
      <P>Senator Colgan said it was not that much, but even if the figure was 40,000 or 50,000 it would still be rather peculiar that we could not provide money for those while from the blue we can provide the money for a racehorse. All the benefits will go to the individuals who are interested in horse-racing in this country.  What benefits from Tulyar will ever reach the County Mayo?

      <P>Last week when the Government introduced a measure to provide £100,000 for the starting of a grass meal industry, I was one of the most enthusiastic supporters of the <Col N="968" /> measure.  If we could have added £250,000 to that and made it £350,000 for the grass meal industry, Senator Yeats would then have had plenty of food if he wanted to go to Mayo for it; but we could not do that.  We could only provide £100,000 for the grass meal industry and we got that by scraping.  Yet, like a bolt from the blue, £250,000 is provided for the purchase of a horse which might or might not produce wealth.  It is a gamble.</P>
      <P>I have great respect for the Minister for Agriculture and I welcomed him when he came to the County Mayo, but he has changed.  I doubt if this is his idea.  I do not think it is.  Yet he piloted this Bill through the Dáil and must accordingly take the blame. He has changed from being the simple farmer interested in tillage and increased agricultural production to being the top-class £250,000 gambling man of the Irish Parliament.  If it were a question of doubling the value of every dairy cow, would we throw £250,000 around so flippantly?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has seen them left over in the case of dairy <Col N="969" /> shorthorns, but not otherwise, and the premiums which farmers 20 years ago got for dairy bulls were, in comparison, far better than they are securing to-day.  We have gone suddenly from a community of agriculturists into a community of racehorse owners.</P>
      <P>Senator Quirke, unfortunately, is not here but he probably will recall the time when in famine years a farmer was obliged to sell his horse, no matter how good it might be, to a Protestant for £5; that was a long while ago.  In the years from 1918 to 1923 what good were the racehorse owners to this country and what contribution did they make to the struggle for independence? How many of these men were like Senator Quirke and many others?  There were two large racehorse owners near me where I lived in County Mayo and they are now happily gone out of existence.</P>
      <P>At the present time we are faced with a choice of the people of this country or the purchase of a racehorse. We have bought a stallion, but this Seanad cannot do anything about it. It will be a very open and independent vote on the Bill and people who are normally in opposition have divided views.  There are those who say that if we have a stud we should go in for the very best type of animal and for the breeding of first-class horses, and then those who, like myself and Senator O'Higgins, are totally opposed to it and who think there are ways of spending the money more beneficially for the country.  But as far as the Fianna Fáil Senators are concerned, there is no divided mind and all are of the one view that Tulyar is a valuable asset and something which will prove really valuable to this country.</P>

      <P>We have heard a &ldquo;hear hear&rdquo; from people who are regimented by the &ldquo;Tulyars&rdquo; who lead the Party.  But as far as I am concerned, the county which put me into the Senate and into political life at the outset is a county where people cannot afford the luxuries of racehorsing or paying in taxes moneys which <Col N="970" /> may be squandered by the Government for the purchase of expensive thoroughbreds. If I said anything other than what I have said, I would be misrepresenting the county from which I come. It is quite clear that racehorse owners and breeders who graze their thoroughbreds over our finest fields are enemies of this nation and no good whatsoever to this country, especially when we see emigrating by the thousand people who would be able to work and toil for the national benefit in these fields in which the racehorses are grazing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know really whether those who have spoken against the purchase of Tulyar are in earnest or not, or if they have any idea what they are talking about.  We should be quite clear about this, that the increase in the capital of the National Stud, mainly for the purchase of Tulyar, has nothing to do with the level of taxation. The £250,000 to be invested in the Stud is a capital investment and has nothing whatever to do with taxes. Only to-day we had in the Senate a Bill to invest £165,000 in the bogs of Mayo and under which the State will spend several million erecting a huge power station in that county.  The State is this year spending millions of pounds on housing, hospitals, schools, rural electrification and the like, and the total amount which is being spent on capital services which have nothing to do with the taxpayers is in the region of £40,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, this £250,000 being invested in the livestock industry is approximately one/one hundred and sixtieth part of the total capital investment being made and there is no connection between this sum being invested in the bloodstock industry and emigration or taxation. In fact, this investment along with the rest of the £40,000,000 being spent on capital development is in accordance with the general purposes of such development, namely to improve the living standards of the people and provide employment in this country. Senator Commons speaks about the livestock industry and stud farms as if they were things that should not be allowed at all, but surely he should realise that stud farms are, in fact, one of the best forms of farming there <Col N="971" /> is from the point of view of giving employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts show that the amount of employment given by stud farms&mdash;this can be got from the Central Statistics Office and the Minister will also have them&mdash;is higher than almost any other type of farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, the more prosperous the bloodstock industry is the more employment it can afford to give. It is all very well to talk about rich stud owners as if they were the only people involved, but a great many people are employed in the studs and in the bloodstock industry, not merely in relation to stud farms, but running racecourses and the like.  Stud farms, apart from the employment given, use a great deal of fodder which is taken from the neighbouring farming community. If Senator Commons wishes to close down the stud-farming industry and the National Stud, then that is all right.  If, however, the bloodstock industry is a valuable industry from the point of view of the employment given, then the better type of horse we have standing at stud the better for the industry and the country itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order. Why, then, if Senator Yeats regards the bloodstock industry as so valuable&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does not the Department of Agriculture advertise for more horses instead of looking for more tillage, more wheat, beet and potatoes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hardly worth answering that, but I will do so.  The <Col N="972" /> total acreage taken up by the bloodstock industry is, of course, a very small part of the total tillage of the country, and it is no hindrance whatever to the extension of tillage generally, because there is no connection between the two.</P>
      <P>This Bill is one which, if it proves successful, as we hope it will, quite clearly will have beneficial results, not merely from the point of view of the country, but from the point of view of the employment which it will provide.</P>
      <P>The National Stud was set up originally in 1946, not for the purpose of making money as a stud, but for the purpose of developing the bloodstock industry in this country, and of improviding it.  This increase in the capital will help it in that work.  I hope that we will pass this Bill for the purpose of purchasing Tulyar.</P>
      <P>Senator Commons has suggested over and over again that he believed we should not buy this horse at a time when the people are emigrating from the country.  I wish he could realise that this is, in fact, the type of development which is best calculated in the long run to stop that type of emigration to which we all object so much.  Unless we provide the necessary money for the development of industries such as the bloodstock industry, we will never be able to stop emigration.  This Bill is calculated to further the purposes which Senator Commons has in mind, just as the £165,000 which will give employment to 30 or 40 people in Mayo under the Grass Meal Bill will do.  We are now voting £250,000 which will, in the long run, provide a great deal more employment in the country than that given under the Grass Meal Bill, which is, nevertheless, a good scheme.</P>
      <P>We are investing £40,000,000 this year, and I am convinced that that £40,000,000, including the £250,000 which is provided for here, for the purchase of Tulyar, will give a great deal of employment and will stop people from leaving the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentMcHugh" hpid="Mr. McHugh Mr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this Bill for a number of reasons which I will give to the House.  I have listened to the <Col N="973" /> speeches in favour of the measure by Senator Loughman and Senator Quirke who mentioned that in every part of their constituencies, and throughout the country, people were loud in their praise of the purchase of Tulyar.  I think they must have been moving around some Kildare backways.</P>
      <P>I have had quite a lot of dealings with cross sections of the people in the country and from outside the country and not one of them in discussing the purchase of Tulyar has a single word to say in favour of it.  All the Senator heard from those people were comments such as: &ldquo;Have the Government gone mad?&rdquo; The only other things said about it were in the form of jokes, none of which were very good, but in all of which the Government and the Ministers were made the butt of the jokers.  That appears to me to indicate that the people generally are not in favour of the purchase of Tulyar.</P>
      <P>While I am not in favour of the purchase of Tulyar, that does not mean that I am opposed to the principle behind the Bill, of supporting the Irish bloodstock industry.  We all know that that industry is a valuable asset to our industrial economy.  The Minister has put the value of the export trade in horses at £3,000,000, but he did not make any mention in giving that figure of how much of it came from the horrible trade of exporting horses for slaughter.  Perhaps if that figure of £3,000,000 is broken down we might not have such a huge figure for the bloodstock trade.  I do not mention that in any deprecatory fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not oppose the Bill if the times were favourable and the Government were in a position to reduce taxation, and if the times were so good that we could say that we have so much money in the Exchequer we can afford to use some of it in the reduction of taxation.  At a time when, according to a report in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of February 27th last, the Minister for Finance and other Ministers of the Government are telling the people that there never was such a difficult financial position, and when the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance are stating that we have reached the saturation point in taxation, I feel that <Col N="974" /> any expenditure which imposes further burdens on the people should not be undertaken, and particularly for the purpose of buying one horse.  How in such circumstances can this sum of money come out of the blue for such a purchase?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe it is out of the red.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentMcHugh" hpid="Mr. McHugh Mr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be out of the red before we are finished.  I would not question the competence of the National Stud Board to decide what is a good horse and what is not a good horse to purchase.  I think this is not the time to purchase Tulyar.  When the directors of the National Stud are making decisions to purchase they do not have to consider the over-all picture of our economy.  It seems to me that is not the function of the directors of the National Stud, but it is quite certainly the business of the Oireachtas, and for the members of both Houses of the Oireachtas to take into consideration in such expenditure the whole picture of the country's economy.</P>
      <P>Can we afford to pay this tremendous sum for a horse which is alleged to be unique?  The question arises, however, whether he is unique.  He has not been bought for racing purposes but for stud purposes.  If he has been bought for stud purposes is he particularly unique?  According to the <i>Sporting Press</i>, which I understand is a reputable sporting paper, of February 27th, Tulyar is two years older than a two-year old horse called Tarjoman.  That, to my mind reduces the value of Tulyar because it means that Tulyar is not unique as a racehorse.  His full brother could be a complete flop.  If he is proved a flop it will mean that Tulyar is just a flash in the pan or a freak horse, and that would indicate to me, at any rate, that £250,000 is a fantastic price to pay for him.</P>
      <P>Again, according to the copy of the <i>Sporting Press</i> of Friday, March 6th, on the question of Tulyar's performances, they say that: &ldquo;Tulyar was a game horse, able to act on all types of going, and that that could never be disputed.  Of his class as a potential stallion, there must remain grave doubts.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="975" /> Asking &ldquo;What did Tulyar beat,&rdquo; the paper says: &ldquo;As a two year old he was moderate, but so also was many a good horse before him.&rdquo;  They then say: &ldquo;As a three year old he swept all before him on all sorts of going, but what did he beat?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Going on to describe the type of horse which Tulyar beat, the writer says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Gay Time&mdash;despite his purchase by the English National Stud&mdash; judged throughout his career could hardly be referred to as a St. Simon. Faubourg, at the time of the Derby &mdash;in which he was beaten no more than two lengths&mdash;was only of moderate class according to French standards of vintage years.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelColgan" hpid="Mr. Colgan Mr. Colgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>
      <P>What paper was that? Was it an Irish paper?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentMcHugh" hpid="Mr. McHugh Mr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the <i>Sporting Press</i>, the official organ of the Irish Coursing Club, published in Clonmel. It says that Tulyar stood the test as a three year old, but asks what did he beat.  It then says he beat Gay Time which was purchased by the English National Stud.  It goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No horse can do more than win, and win easily, even against moderate opposition and that Tulyar achieved this is without dispute. There are however, other factors that should be dwelt upon.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He then goes on to question his breeding having already cast doubts upon the animal as a racehorse.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;His sire, Tehran, prior to the coming of Tulyar was far from a success.  It would be of interest to adjudge his next best son.  Mystery IX, a moderate Eclipse winner, was sold for export with undue haste to South Africa....  We have waited 40 years for one successful stallion of this line.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Forty years before Tulyar was produced and it is doubtful yet if Tulyar will be a success or not.  It continues:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;As regards Tulyar's dam line, the one possibility of success would seem to lie in his maternal grandsire, Nearco.  For the rest it is only <Col N="976" /> necessary to remember Harinero, Athford, Primero and Trigo.  That they could have been no more than handicappers was the normal expectation...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And it concludes by saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For the Irish National Stud's initiative in obtaining something that the world desired, there can be nothing but admiration and credit. As to whether it will succeed, the ensuing years will tell.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a reputable sporting paper in this country and it has cast doubts on Tulyar's performance as a racehorse, it says that he only beat second or third raters.  It also cast doubts on his breeding.  For a Minister or a Government or a Senator then to stand up in this House and say this horse is worth £250,000 after all that is very strange. At any rate it certainly raises grave doubts in my mind about the animal. I am not an expert but I presume a reputable paper like that would not publish those things unless there was something in them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>We have two different views.  You are putting yours and I am putting mine.  The purchase of Tulyar is supposed to benefit the country as a whole, but, as far as I can see, the only section who will benefit are the men of substance and wealth, the racehorse owners and breeders.  I fail to see how the ordinary small farmer will benefit. Certainly the unemployed in this country, the people who more than any other section need the help of our Government, can find no help in the purchase of Tulyar.  There are certain arguments put forward on the lines that we should buy the best for the National Stud or else close the stud <Col N="977" /> down.  To my mind that is utter nonsense.  If we cannot afford to buy the best for the stud, I do not think that we should close it down.  It has been a success up to the time that Tulyar came on the market.</P>
      <P>The fact that we do not buy the horse and refuse to pass this Bill&mdash;I do not think we will, but if we should refuse and left Tulyar to the Aga Khan &mdash;would not mean that the National Stud is doomed to failure.  They can carry on without Tulyar as they did before he arrived.  That argument is absolute nonsense.  If it were pursued to its logical conclusion, I presume we should sack the Civil Service because we could not pay them.  We should sack the Army, the police force and the teachers because we cannot afford to pay them decent salaries and, therefore, have not perhaps the best material in the services.  The Government did not look for the best recently when they proposed to establish the transatlantic air service.  They were satisfied with what was really an obsolete fleet of air liners.  That whole argument is utter nonsense.</P>
      <P>This is no time to gamble with £250,000 of the people's money on one horse.  If the horse were sold to America or Russia or any part of the world he would still be an Irish horse and any record breaking progeny he might have would be classed as Irish-bred no matter where he was at stud. He would, in fact, confer as much benefit wherever he stood&mdash;just as if he were still in the Curragh.  That is my opinion.</P>
      <P>We are told that this animal will not have proved his worth until his progeny are two years old, but that is assuming that he has progeny.  I maintain this is no time to gamble with the people's money particularly when, as I have shown here, doubts can be cast on this horse's ability, both as a racehorse and as a stud horse.  I do not know whether those facts are right or whether the directors of the National Stud will eventually be proved right but, however, I believe like many other people in this and the other House and like the vast majority of the people throughout the country that Tulyar should not have cost us £250,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hartney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a racehorse owner nor a rash man but I come from a county that has always earned a good deal of fame as a country from which some outstanding horses were produced.  Senator Quirke referred to Galtymore and Ardpatrick and I am sorry to say that one went to Russia and the other to Germany, but many another famous horse was also produced in that county.  I know a couple of people in that county who had always bred and trained good horses and raced them with indifferent success and their horses received sometimes good and sometimes bad prices. They are all people who are doing it in a reasonably small way.  They are of the people and were as much Irish in 1922 as they ever were since or previously.  The £250,000 paid for Tulyar will be admitted to be a small amount of capital to put into any national project.</P>
      <P>I am sure it will be agreed by everybody that if the Irish National Stud Board of Directors&mdash;I do not know if that is the right way to describe them &mdash;were to buy so many animals and then sit down and see how they would turn out, nobody would be pleased with them.  The least we might expect is that they would be progressive and would get the best obtainable on the market.  I cannot agree with Senator McHugh when he says that if the horse went to Germany, Russia or America it would be just as good for the Irish people.  That could not be as he would carry the plums at Epsom and everywhere else.  He says the honour would be traced back to the Emerald Isle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanHartney" hpid="Mr. Hartney Mr. Hartney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hartney</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise.  It is not said out of malice, as the Senator is here to defend himself.  The Minister made reference to 12 years for the horse.  I would be inclined to put it longer.  If the horse is the success we are entitled to hope and his performance speaks for itself, the blood behind him is definitely blood anyone <Col N="979" /> would like to possess in the form of a racehorse.  I have heard experts give the opinion&mdash;it is not my own, as I am not qualified&mdash;that, assuming he sires good horses of both sexes and a number of them remain in the country, then probably for three generations, nearer to 50 years than to the 12 mentioned by the Minister, it will be pointed out on racecourses when there is a success: &ldquo;There is the Tulyar blood again.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In races in the South, when they see a horse win a race meritoriously, people say: &ldquo;There is the Desmond blood; it cannot be beaten,&rdquo; and the Desmond blood has been there for 40 years.  All that holds good in this case, too.  We definitely agree that a chance had to be taken.  If it were not, it would be no use talking to-morrow or afterwards, when America would have the benefit. There was a horse some time ago that nothing much was thought about at all at first, yet a lot was done when it came to the closing stages to keep him alive and if it were possible later they would have resurrested him.  That was Cottage.  His two and three year olds proved his worth.  Seaview came up a winner in the Galway Plate.  Then there was Workman, which was another of the Cottage production, third in the Grand National.  The next year he won it.  There was Sheila's Cottage and Lovely Cottage.  A lot was thrown away and lost when that horse was coming to the end of his days and superhuman efforts were made to prolong his life.  Even when he passed out, if he could have been resurrected I feel it would have been done.  We are taking precautions against that and let us hope we will be successful in our gamble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not speaking for the City of Dublin, but for the County of Limerick, and as far as housing or anything else is concerned the buying of Tulyar is not doing us out of £1 we would get in the normal way for those things. Even the land project is not suffering and the Minister intends to put more in our way this year than heretofore. This is a capital investment, possibly spread over 50 years, and not a desperate chance.  I hope we will be <Col N="980" /> lucky, but the chance had to be taken. There is no use in a post mortem.  In conclusion, may Tulyar make history and do justice to the ordinary farmer who is Minister for Agriculture and who has not yet gone over to the men with all the betting, the men who are big business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is one disinterested man here in this debate, in the words of Senator P.F. O'Reilly, I am that man.  I was never at a horse race meeting in my life, so I am not interested in Tulyar as a horse, but I am interested in him for what he can do for the bloodstock industry.  I am satisfied that the bloodstock industry is important and if Senator O'Reilly had known my simple ignorance on the question, he would not have so brusquely turned me aside when I asked how he arrived at £175,000.  I was seeking genuine information and he refused to give it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding Senator O'Donnell, I do not think he is opposed to the Bill.  He asked some questions and then said he was not opposed to it.  Senator P.F. O'Reilly is opposed only to the price&mdash; he thinks we have been mulcted for an extra £75,000 we should not have paid. Outside that, he is in favour.  Senator O'Higgins and Commons, particularly O'Higgins, reminded me of something that happened when I was a young man.  In those days the trade unions used to walk out in processions through the City of Dublin and great pride was taken in &ldquo;getting out the banner&rdquo; and a horse and car cost a couple of pounds.  But invariably, from a few fellows who never walked, the cry was heard: &ldquo;What about the unemployed?&rdquo; when the couple of pounds was being paid for getting out the banner.  They said it should be spent on the unemployed.  It is just the same with Senators O'Higgins and Commons. This has nothing to do with the unemployed. It is the investment of money to bring more money into the country which I hope it will and the more that comes in the better for everybody, unemployed or otherwise, because the more money we have the more prosperous we will become.  Please God, the unemployment problem is a passing phase, but in the meantime we could <Col N="981" /> lose this opportunity to make this investment.  To me it appears like the owner of a business putting in an extra good type of machinery to develop the business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter.  The other people's money put in can develop the country as a whole, so the other people are concerned in it.  I was rather amused at Senator McHugh quoting a racing paper.  I know nothing about racing, but I understand that the most unreliable newspaper you can read, particularly on racing affairs, is a racing paper, so I think his premises there are bad.  He should not have quoted a racing paper against the Minister's word.  The number of horses I have backed in my day would not make a decent field in big race, but I understand that racing newspapers generally are most unreliable.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been criticised for the use of the word &ldquo;gamble&rdquo;.  That is horse racing.  What is the National Stud, what is everything that comes from the National Stud, only a gamble? Is not the whole thing a gamble?  Horse racing is a gamble.  I do not condemn it.  If men can afford to gamble, that is their own business.  The very fact that it is racehorses, that we have a National Stud, justifies the Minister in using the expression &ldquo;gamble&rdquo;, because every horse is a gamble. Every horse that runs in a race must be; if it were not a gamble, one horse would win all the time and then it would be most uninteresting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McHugh and Senator Commons talked about &ldquo;if times were better&rdquo;.  If times were better, probably there would be some other excuse for opposing the Bill.  The times are not as good as we would like them to be, but it would be a tragedy from the point of view of this great Irish industry to let this opportunity pass without buying this horse when he became available.  I was rather amazed at Senator P.F. O'Reilly talking to-day&mdash; and I think it weakened his case very considerably&mdash;about the expense of the Aga Khan taking a trip to America <Col N="982" /> that might cost him £1,000.  I understand that this gentleman, whose co-religionists make him periodic presents of his weight in gold, is one of the wealthiest men in the world.</P>
    <P>The spending of £1,000 now and again to go to America is a poor argument for Senator O'Reilly to use.  If he wants to go to America, he will go, and the question of expense will not arise.  I believe the man has a regard for this country, but that, outside that, it will be good business for him to have his horse here and good business for us that he will patronise the stud with whatever mares he has available.  As I say, I know nothing about racing, but I do know something about the wisdom of investing in this great bloodstock industry, so that it will be not only good but the best.  Like Senator Quirke, it always gives me a thrill when I see a racing result with the heading &ldquo;First three horses Irish bred&rdquo;.  I think we should all have that mentality and be glad to see the National Stud being put in a position to compete with the best in the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>When coming to the Seanad to-day, I thought the Bill might be approached in a far different manner.  I thought we would have had a reasonable approach to it.  The first two speeches were good, but then we had Senator O'Higgins and a repetition of what had already been said in the other House.  First, let us ask ourselves what is the purpose of the Bill.  The purpose of the Bill is to increase the capital of the National Stud.  It is not to buy Tulyar at all. I have not heard one speaker mention that the National Stud has £55,000 at the moment, without any £250,000, and if they wanted to buy Tulyar, they need have asked for only £200,000. But they have asked for £250,000 in order to enable them to buy the horse, to buy mares to supplement the mares they have in the stud and to do certain alterations, repairs and renovations to the stud itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is equally as important to get good mares as it is to get good sires, and, for the past two or three years, the directors have been travelling around Europe and England looking <Col N="983" /> for horses of the long distance type to put into the stud.  They have tried in France and in Italy, and they have not succeeded in getting one.  It is, if you like, a coincidence that Tulyar has come on the market at this particular time.  Somebody suggested that it was a bad time.  Maybe it was. If Tulyar had come on the market six months ago, we might not have had the same criticism as we have had, but it is a coincidence that he has come along when Senator O'Higgins, Senator Commons and a few others had some grounds on which to talk. They had the unemployed, but there is no relation whatever between the unemployed and the National Stud.</P>
    <P>We must regard every industry in the country as an industry.  There are several branches in agriculture.  Why is there not criticism when moneys are made available for these?  Why is the Livestock Breeding Act not criticised when we buy bulls and put them into Grange?  Somebody asked, in connection with that, why there has been no criticism of land reclamation and all the other schemes.  Because we are trying to build up this industry, an important industry, one of the most important we have from many points of view, not merely from the point of view of the cash value of the National Stud, but from the international point of view and from the propaganda we can use through our racehorses going abroad.</P>
    <P>The directors of the National Stud need this money, and the reason for it is that, in 1946, when the National Stud was being established, the Government decided to give them £250,000 as capital. We all know that times have changed very considerably since 1946, that the value of money has changed since that time, and that mares, which could have been purchased in 1946 for a few thousand pounds, are costing from two and a half to three times as much.  The same applies to sires.  If we were to get the type of sire needed by the National Stud and to keep the stud in existence, it would be necessary for the Government to put up this money, or, if not, to say that the stud was not to be what it was intended to <Col N="984" /> be, the best stud the country can afford.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the people who will gain benefits from this purchase are the people engaged in racing. That is wrong.  There are other people who gain benefits from racing.  The whole country gains benefits from racing and the production of horses. There is not merely the question of thoroughbreds; there is the question of jumpers, hunters and the troopers we had up to a few years ago, and if Senator O'Higgins and Senator O'Reilly knew anything about the farming community, they would not have been as critical as they were when talking of this Bill.  They have shown to me anyhow, whatever they have shown to the Seanad, that they know nothing about what they are talking about when they talk about farmers objecting to the purchase of this horse. The smallest farmer in this country, the 20-acre farmer has an interest in horse breeding and has an interest in it down through the years.  Whether it was the man with a brood mare or a thoroughbred horse, a good trooper or a hunter, he was able to find a ready market for it when it was broken and trained, or the small breeder producing a chaser, a point-to-pointer or a hunter&mdash;all these people were interested in the type of horse breeding being carried on, and these people were going to gain a certain amount of benefit from our bloodstock.  Let us take it that Tulyar is at the National Stud and a certain number of its yearlings go to Ballsbridge every year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFOReilly" hpid="Mr. P.F. O'Reilly Mr. P.F. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.F. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>How many of them will be sold there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>We will deal with that. The fact that his yearlings are going to Ballsbridge, the fact that they are advertised in the catalogues is sufficient attraction to bring people from England, from the continent and even from America to have a shot at these horses and see if they can get them. The fact that these people are brought here is a good thing, because, if they are unable to buy a Tulyar horse, they may buy a Royal Charger horse, and every pound that comes in, every £100 that comes into the country is of value to the country, whether it goes into <Col N="985" /> the pocket of somebody down the country, on the Curragh, or into the pocket of an individual in the City of Dublin who has a brood mare and who produces this yearling.  That money is here and it is going to be put into industry, and here is where the unemployed we have are going to gain benefit, as they will gain benefit from any other project or industry that may be assisted by way of getting increased capital.</P>
      <P>It is ridiculous to say that this £250,000 could solve the troubles of the unemployed.  It would not give them £3 per head.  I heard Senator Commons talk about relief schemes. What type of relief scheme would £250,000 give the 90,000 unemployed people he mentioned?  It would not give them £3 per head.  If that is his solution&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the only solution the Senator has, I am afraid he will never solve unemployment.  The only way in which unemployment can be solved is by capitalisation of the industries we have and building them up in such a way that they are able to provide employment.  We are doing that, so far as the bloodstock industry is concerned, by enabling the people down in the National Stud to get in a good sire, in order that we may encourage people from outside to come here to buy our yearlings and in that way to buy our bloodstock generally. This is going to be an advertising campaign for the country and should be regarded as such.</P>
      <P>The possibilities are that the National Stud is not going to make any profits out of the purchase of Tulyar, as we may regard profits; but he will be worth it to the country in so far as he will bring people here, when his progeny is put on the market, to buy his progeny.</P>

My responsibility and that of the <Col N="986" /> Government in this matter is to act on the advice of the National Stud.  They stated that they needed more capital if this concern were to be run as it should be.  They were appointed by the Government in 1946.  The Government had confidence in them then. During the three years the Coalition Government was in office and when Senators O'Higgins and Commons supported them, there was no question then that these people had not the confidence of the Government and had not the capacity to expend the money that came into the Stud.  If the Government then had no confidence in these people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;they have not got it now.  It is on the directors' suggestion that the horse is being purchased. It is the unaimous wish of the directors to purchase Tulyar and in this case the Government increased their capital in order to enable them to do so. Senator O'Higgins stated that this was a gamble and that I admitted it was a gamble.  He misquoted me in so far as he said that I stated the National Stud was a gamble.  I said no such thing but I did say that the purchase of any horse is a gamble.  It is a gamble to go to a fair and spend £20 on the purchase of a horse.  If you buy a cow it is a gamble.  Let us not try to get away from the idea that when you go out to make a purchase like that you have some guarantee that it is going to be a success.  Everything you do in that regard is a gamble. This is no greater gamble than any other gamble that any ordinary farmer would make in the morning.  The lawyers know there is such a thing as a gamble, too.  Sometimes they run up against it and they make a big gamble.  The criticisms by Senators were of the same type as those we had in the other House.  I was not in this House when Senator McHugh questioned Tulyar's breeding.</P>

I never came across a man yet who could judge in any way a hunter or racer to such an extent as to name a figure such as the Senator did and be so dogmatic about it.  A person may judge a horse on his looks, to begin with, and on his performances. What does the Senator judge him on?  Is it on his looks?</P>

      <P>In other words, you have no confidence in them.  That is the only conclusion anyone could come to. The Senator has no confidence in these people.  I never came across a man who could so clearly and lucidly value any horse in the way the Senator has done it.  A man who goes out to buy a horse depends on what he is asked for that animal, if the animal suits him.  Many factors have to be taken into consideration before one fixes the price in one's mind.  A farmer going to buy a horse does not say: &ldquo;I am going to pay £52 10s. for him and no more&rdquo;.  If he finds the horse suits him at £60 he will pay that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must have regard to the factors with which you have to contend when you are asked the price.  That is what happened in the case of Tulyar.  I have no doubt in the world but that this is <Col N="988" /> a good investment.  Let it not be regarded as anything else.  I hope it will be a successful venture.  I think the directors of the National Stud should be congratulated on going to buy this horse and putting Irish bloodstock where it should be, in the forefront of horse breeding in the world.</P>

      <P>I am informed that I am entitled to speak on this section. I am interested, as a breeder, in this measure.  I would have liked to have spoken on the Second Stage.  When I <Col N="989" /> found I was being eulogised by Senator Quirke, I began to think I ought to try and make up a speech. When this measure first came before the country, I was amazed to find that one of my best friends, Deputy Dunne, took up the matter, but I was more amazed to find that he was doing so on behalf of the unemployed.  To my mind, if ever relief is to be brought to the rural community and to the unemployed, then no greater event has happened to this end than the purchasing of Tulyar.  With all respect to Senator Commons, one of the best racehorse meetings we have is at Ballinrobe, and it will take him a while to secure a majority of people in his favour around there, because they breed very good horses which take a good deal to beat.</P>
      <P>If I am not mistaken, the entire country is wrapped up in rural employment. In the 60 odd years that I can recall, the entire transport of the community has ceased to have any connection with horses.  I can recall when every street and every town had its oats store and when oats was taken in to be consumed by horses which then formed the backbone of the community's transport.  That has now ceased, and there is no other animal which will live so successfully on oats, or consume so much in proportion to its own well-being as the horse.  For that reason, the more you can exploit the horse the better it is for the community, and these facts make me adopt the one course there is for me to adopt, namely, to support the purchase of Tulyar.</P>
      <P>I think that I am correct in stating there is an annual return of something like £3,000,000 from bloodstock and I would be very nervous lest the criticism being voiced prevents the directors of the National Stud from pursuing the proper course which is to buy, if necessary, two or three of the first six horses that won the &ldquo;Triple Crown&rdquo; in the European community, be they French or English.  An investment of £250,000 is nothing if the return is an annual income of £3,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was some mention made about Royal Charger and the fact that there <Col N="990" /> are rumours he may be sold.  If Royal Charger can command anything like £100,000 at 13 years of age, the National Stud directors have done their duty well and truly, and are entitled to give more than £250,000 for one four-year-old.  In addition to Royal Charger, you have Blackrock which in its first year of service was able to give numerous winners.  What would Preciptic be worth to-day?  He also had winners among his produce from his first years of service.  Then we have Legend of Confey, one of Preciptic's progeny, who but for bad weather would have won at Haydock.</P>
    <P>The men who bring in such horses at a first attempt are entitled to have first consideration and if the purchase of Tulyar proves to be wrong, let them double the figure of £250,000 to purchase another and better animal, because you would get that money back within three years.  The bloodstock breeders are entitled to get consideration and are entitled to national prestige.  Senator Quirke and the other Senators in supporting this proposal are doing their duty and putting right the wrong they did in hunting Blandford out.  We must look at this purchase from the national-minded point of view and, if they made a mistake, I am pleased to see them rectifying it, and I weigh in with them. All I have to say is that the Stud Directors should be encouraged in every possible way and the money spent by them is spent in giving employment to labour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, may I ask this question?  This section provides that the capital of the company shall be increased to £500,000.  Is it quite clear that the expenditure of the new capital is entirely within the competence of the board as was the original capital of £250,000?  In other words, is it clear from this Bill which increases the capital that ministerial interference is not possible with regard to expending the additional capital?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to put an addendum to Senator Hearne's question.  Could it be a fact that the Minister proposes to hand over a sum of £250,000 to the board without inquiring how that money is to be spent?  Was it not the purpose of <Col N="991" /> Senator Hearne's question to elicit from the Minister information and to get him out of the hobble in which he was, through being unable to say: &ldquo;I have no responsibility good, bad or indifferent in this; it is on the National Stud Board and we are all agreed that they are sound men fit for their job, and it is their job to spend the money and my job to give the money&rdquo;? Could it be a fact that the Minister proposes to take refuge in that kind of defence?  In his speeches he made it quite clear that this money was required for the purchasing of Tulyar.</P>
      <P>I want to put it bluntly to the Minister that this £250,000 is for the purpose of purchasing Tulyar and for no other purpose.  I also want to find out whether the Minister regards this as a gamble or not, because, in concluding his speech on the Second Reading, the Minister created some doubt in my mind by referring at times to an investment and at other times to a gamble. As this is a section dealing with the paying over of £250,000, I want to know if the Minister is suggesting that we should invest that sum or, as he suggested, gamble it.  Senator Colgan was in no doubt about it at all.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A great deal of the Minister's speech here to-day was a public acknowledgment of the fact that it was a gamble and, in a section such as this, whether we are dealing with racehorses, cattle or pigs, it was a gamble.  I do not agree with the section, which I believe was inserted merely for the purpose of <Col N="992" /> purchasing this particular racehorse.  I have not the knowledge or authority that Senator O'Reilly has on a question of value, but I am convinced that this sum of £250,000 is too high.</P>

      <P>I think I can answer the questions which were put during this debate.  It is within the competence of the directors of the National Stud to spend this money, and they will not be directed by me or any Minister on how they should spend it.  Regarding the question raised by Senator O'Higgins, concerning the purchase of Tulyar, we are giving this money for the purpose of buying a horse, but there is no compulsion so far as I know on the board to purchase this or any other animal.  I believe that this is a sound investment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say this, before Senator Quirke continues? Senator O'Reilly refrained from discussing the value of the horse in order that this Bill might be dealt with to-night, but if Senator Quirke now proposes to make a statement on the value of the horse he will be answered and this discussion might not finished by 10.30.  Without any desire, and I have no interest in the matter, to dictate to the House, I think the simplest thing would be to get it finished with now.</P>

      <P>I am only explaining that Senator Quirke is himself obstructing the passage of this Bill by insisting on making a statement.  In order that the Bill might be passed to-night, Senator O'Reilly refrained from making a speech on the value of the horse, but if Senator Quirke now insists on making a statement, Senator O'Reilly will have the right of reply and the right to make his speech.  If Senator Quirke insists he will possibly spike the whole business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will confine myself to five minutes.  I was saying that the only way in which to estimate the value of this horse or of anything is by comparison with something of a <Col N="994" /> similar nature.  The only way in which we can estimate the value of Tulyar is by comparison with another horse of the same kind.  The only way in which we can do that is by going back on racing history.  At least three or four horses were syndicated for stud purposes and one of them for £160,000 in the last few years.  Senator O'Reilly will see then by comparison what the estimated value of Tulyar is.  That horse won £75,000 in the course of his unbeaten record.</P>
      <P>Another thing which would give us an estimate of value would be the achievements of Nasrullah which while at stud in the course of six years produced yearlings which were sold by auction, and this does not include private sales, for a total of 314,390 guineas, and that did not include the horse No, which is one of the greatest horses in the United States.</P>

      <P>In fairness to the people concerned we should not go too deeply into this matter, but I can assure the House that it has been almost a complete failure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quirke has told us about Nasrullah and used it as a comparison in estimating the value of Tulyar, but by comparison with Nasrullah I think it can be shown that we are paying too much for Tulyar.  Nasrullah was sold for something like £120,000, paid in dollars.  Nasrullah would not be far removed from Tulyar as a sire; I would not say he was as good but he has proved himself, which Tulyar has <Col N="995" /> yet to do, to be an excellent sire and he was sold recently for dollars for something in the neighbourhood of £120,000.  That makes very little of the price being paid for Tulyar.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the price was around £160,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFOReilly" hpid="Mr. P.F. O'Reilly Mr. P.F. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.F. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Quirke has brought all this on himself in endeavouring to prove to the House the value of Tulyar.</P>
      <P>I had decided, in order to allow the Bill to go through, to refrain from making a speech on this Stage and collecting all the material.  I have, however, gone into the matter sufficiently. We are paying for this animal £250,000 and in stud fees we cannot hope to get anything like our capital expenditure back again.  Not merely can we not make a profit, but we will not regain the capital which we now propose to expend on the purchase of this horse.</P>
      <P>The horse in his first year will earn in stud fees about £10,000 on the assumption that he serves 20 mares at £500 each.  In the other nine or ten years which will be the extent for which we can hope he will be available he will earn in service fees something like £200,000.  We should then have got back £210,000, having expended a sum of £250,000 on his purchase. On those figures we should have lost a capital amount of £40,000. We shall have, during the nine or ten years we have him, lost in addition the cost of his keep and maintenance and the cost, which is not an inconsiderable amount, of insuring him.</P>
      <P>This valuable animal must be insured for a very large sum and the premium may be in the neighbourhood of from £7,000 to £9,000 per annum.  Undoubtedly should his progeny win well it will be to the benefit of the country and the prestige of the industry, the live-stock industry of the State.  Nevertheless, the price, £250,000, is too much to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot over-emphasise the fact that the Minister is not correct in stating that all the money that will be spent on the purchase of yearlings will be spent in Ireland at Ballsbridge. <Col N="996" /> What will happen I suggest is this. Mares from Ireland will be sent to Tulyar.  They will be very few because there will be a bigger demand and a bigger supply from England.  Irish mares sent to Tulyar will foal here, and their progeny will foal here.  Their progeny, say, ten per annum, will be purchased possibly by English people, but as for the other 30 yearlings, after they have foaled here or in England, they will all be in England where they will be sold and the profit made on the sale of them will go to England.  I am not blaming the English people for endeavouring to gain any profit in that way.  But it is wrong to think that the value of our export trade will be increased enormously or that it will run into millions.</P>

We have very few mares in this country to send to Tulyar.  I feel I must repeat, having regard to what other Senators have said, that I have complete confidence in the National Stud, but I am exercising my right&mdash; and it is quite clear that I have the right&mdash;to express disagreement with the amount of money to be paid for the horse.
