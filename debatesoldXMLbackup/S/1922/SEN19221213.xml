      <P>There is a matter that I would, with the permission of the Seanad, bring to their attention.  I understand that the accommodation for the reporters of our proceedings is not as comfortable as it might be.  We make every allowance.  We know quite well our chamber has been furnished somewhat in a hurry, and, therefore, things are not everything that they will eventually be.  I do not for a moment find fault with anybody, but there are one or two small improvements that might be made, perhaps immediately, and perhaps if we represent this to the proper quarter these improvements will be carried out at once.  In the first place, the desk at which these gentlemen, our recording angels, operate, is very narrow.  Possibly it could be slightly widened.  I also understand that the room outside in which they do their writing is very uncomfortable, inasmuch as the door does not close.  Now, I do not want this chamber to be a Cavern of Aeolus, and I would request that representations be made to the proper authority to have a screen outside the door, so as to make the apartment comfortable for the gentlemen who are recording our proceedings.</P>

      <NameTxt>The EARL of MAYO</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a question of which I have given private <Col N="38" /> notice, <i>i.e.</i>, with regard to the travelling expenses of the members of the Seanad. There are some regulations, I believe, and I should like to ask what those regulations are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>In answering that question, I would say that by Article 23 of the Constitution, this Seanad in the same way as the Dáil, has got power to provide for the payment of its members and may, in addition, &ldquo;provide them with free travelling facilities in any part of Ireland.&rdquo;  I think that possibly the wisest course to adopt with regard to this matter is that inasmuch as we have to appoint at least one Committee to determine matters of this kind that this question should be included in the reference to that Committee.  Later on, you will see it is essential to have a Committee for the purpose of determining and ascertaining matters with regard to the Chairman and Deputy Chairman.  We shall also have to make provision for the official staff required for this Seanad.  I think all these matters could very well be left to one good Committee of the Seanad to consider and report to us, and then you as a general body can come to any conclusion on their recommendation that you think fit.  The first business on the Agenda is the appointment of one of these Committees, to which I have referred&mdash;the appointment of Committee under the provisions of Article 21 of the Constitution.  The necessity for its appointment arises under Article 21 of the Constitution.  That Article is as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Each House shall elect its own Chairman and Deputy-Chairman, and shall prescribe their powers, duties, remuneration, and terms of office.&rdquo;  You will observe that that only covers the Chairman and Deputy Chairman.  I cannot find any provision in the Constitution that deals with the creation and appointment of the official staff that will be required&mdash;that is to say, the number or anything else; nor can I find the authority which is finally to determine that matter.  Therefore, I think it would be a wise thing for us to include that in the reference to this Committee, that we will have to appoint under Article 21, and to ask them to furnish us with their suggestions as to the extent and nature of the staff that will be required.  Instead of <Col N="39" /> having two Committees overlapping, I suggest that might be included in the reference under Article 21.  In the meantime it will be necessary for some member of the Seanad to propose that the Committee be appointed in pursuance of Article 21 of the Constitution.</P>

      <P>There is a question I would like to raise at some proper and convenient time.  I do not know when it will be convenient, but it is on the question of the speech yesterday, and the telegrams that passed between the King and the Governor-General.  I would like just to ask some questions about it when the proper time arises.  I will leave that matter to you.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not overlook that, Senator Moore. Of course, you will see that until we have our Standing Orders it is very difficult for me to lay down, or suggest to you, any procedure on a matter of that kind.  I think the best plan would be, where a question of that kind arises, it should be left to the Seanad to decide whether they will entertain a particular motion or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MAURICE MOORE Colonel MAURICE MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MAURICE MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it can be raised on the Governor-General's speech, when that arises?</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday we passed a resolution thanking the Governor-General for his speech and for the legislation that was included or promised in it.  I think, if you had any question to raise upon it, then was the time to do it by way of amendment or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MAURICE MOORE Colonel MAURICE MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MAURICE MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps you forget that you told us yesterday that we could debate this matter later.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not forget anything that happened yesterday. My memory is still equal to that strain. I remember that distinctly.  All that happened yesterday was that the resolution as originally framed included the words &ldquo;and we approve.&rdquo;  Some members objected to that because they had not an opportunity of discussing it.  They did not in fact approve of certain matters and I accordingly suggested to leave out the word &ldquo;approve&rdquo; and adopt the resolution without the word &ldquo;approve.&rdquo;<Col N="40" /> The resolution was then passed thanking the Governor-General for his speech and for the legislation promised in that speech.  If you objected to the Seanad doing that, yesterday was your time to move an amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MAURICE MOORE Colonel MAURICE MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MAURICE MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>You stated at the time that you would leave the matter open for discussion and that it could be raised whenever it was found suitable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">

      <NameTxt>Mr. JOHN THOMAS O'FARRELL</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of us were under the impression that the passing of that resolution yesterday did not debar a discussion on the Address afterwards.  We felt that there might have been some need for the Seanad passing the resolution.  Consequently on the statements made by you, whether rightly or wrongly, it was our impression that a debate on the Address would be provided for, and that there would be no opposition to Senators discussing the Address itself, and the subjects omitted from the Address, and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>If that desire exists amongst any substantial section of the Seanad I shall do my very best to facilitate them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.W. KENNY</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice that Standing Order 16 says: &ldquo;Provided that questions relating to matters of urgent public importance may, by permission of the Ceann Comhairle, be asked on private notice.&rdquo;  I do not <Col N="41" /> know whether this question arises, or whether it is considered a matter of public importance or not, but seeing that the Standing Orders are in a transition stage here, and that we have no set Standing Orders, I would like to ask whether the present application might come under the extract I have just read?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid not, for this reason: that deals purely with the procedure of the Dáil.  We have no Ministers here to answer questions.  That will be a matter a Committee on Procedure and on the Standing Orders will have to carefully consider.  I perceive a considerable difficulty of questions here being raised on responsible actions of Ministers of the Free State if there is no provision made by which they would be enabled to attend this Seanad and answer these questions. I will not be in a position to answer them, because I am not a member of the Government. The intent of the Constitution is that I shall hold myself independent, as I intend to do.  But it is obvious, for the convenience of the Seanad, that there should be some means provided by which Ministers could attend here if they think fit to answer questions on important Government matters.  I think that matter should be included in our reference to the Committee.  It will be part of the Committee's duty.  We have already appointed a Committee to provide Standing Orders for this Seanad. This Committee will naturally consult with another similar Committee in the other place and come to some <i>modus vivendi.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MAURICE MOORE Colonel MAURICE MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MAURICE MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>The Constitution lays down that all Ministers can attend here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'FARRELL Mr. O'FARRELL">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'FARRELL</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MAURICE MOORE Colonel MAURICE MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MAURICE MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Article 57 says, &ldquo;Every Minister shall have the right to attend and be heard in Seanad Eireann.&rdquo;  I understand there is a Liaison Officer or Minister to be appointed by the Government and he will come in and answer these questions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. JAMES DOUGLAS Mr. JAMES DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. JAMES DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>The clear statement that you have made rather tends to show that as far as possible <Col N="42" /> the Seanad will be well advised to take only urgent matters to-day, and let us have our own Standing Orders to consider these questions now raised.  I think otherwise we will waste a great deal of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MAURICE MOORE Colonel MAURICE MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MAURICE MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Chairman would be a little liberal in not sticking too close to the Order until we have got our own Standing Orders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do that with the greatest of pleasure. I think the Seanad should consider whether it would be wise for them to adopt the suggestion made by Mr. Douglas.  We are more or less at present proceeding in the dark. We are only finding our feet, finding our way, and before we come to a debate on any serious constitutional question we should have our own Standing Orders so that we can proceed with due process and deliberation.  It will not mean any long delay, because the Committee will be able to arrive at a decision on these Standing Orders within a very short time.  Probably the wisest course would be to transact nothing but purely pressing business to-day, to appoint Committees for urgent matters, and then when they are ready with their reports, and when we have framed our own Standing Orders we can go formally through any business that any member may bring forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MAURICE MOORE Colonel MAURICE MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MAURICE MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree.  We ought to press forward with urgent matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir THOMAS GRATTAN ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>An obviously practical proposition has been put to us from the Chair.  Until we are regularly constituted we are more or less beating the air.  If any member desires to raise any question it will be always open to him, as soon as we have our Standing Orders completed, to draw attention to any matter by simply handing in notice of motion.  If any member wishes to raise a question of that kind he could do so by giving ordinary notice.  I regard our Standing Orders as a matter of the utmost importance.  It will be in the recollection of the Seanad that the first resolution we passed was that we should appoint a Committee to draw up our own Standing Orders.  For the time being we have adopted the Standing Orders of the Dáil.  They may suit us well, but at <Col N="43" /> all events we must have our own Standing Orders.  Obviously what we shall do now is to discharge essential business and let our Committees proceed to work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. EAMON MacLYSAGHT</NameTxt>
      <P>If that Committee got to work now is it not possible they could report to us by Friday?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it will be a very elaborate business at all.  There are many Articles in the Standing Orders that we may take verbatim almost from the Dáil.  There are a great many, on the other hand, that have no application to our procedure here.  If we have an opportunity, I am quite prepared to wait on here after the Seanad rises and have a meeting of the Committee who are framing the Standing Orders.  By the end of an hour we would have done a good deal of work, and very likely we would be able to report to the Seanad, if not on Friday, at least on Monday.  The present matter before the Seanad is that this Committee, under Article 21 of the Constitution, should be appointed.  It will be necessary for some Senator to propose the appointment of that Committee, and it will be necessary that the Seanad should define its duties and its terms of reference.  I do not think it would be very convenient to have a general discussion on a matter of that kind. The simple course would be to refer it to a Committee to report to the Seanad, and the recommendation of that Committee can be adopted or rejected.  I think it is not a fitting subject for a general debate in the Seanad.  That is a matter entirely for the members of the Seanad.  The same thing applies to Article 23, the matter that the Earl of Mayo asked me about.  That Article reads:&mdash;&ldquo;The Oireachtas shall make provision for the payment of its members, and may in addition provide them with free travelling facilities in any part of Ireland.&rdquo;  I think that would be an inconvenient thing for discussion in the Seanad, and it ought to be left also to this other Committee, and let them report to the Seanad on both matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir THOMAS GRATTAN ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody apparently seems to have thought this matter out, and we ought to make a move in some shape.  Could the Chairman give us any indication of the number <Col N="44" /> that this Committee should probably consist of?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not desirable to have these Committees too large.  I should say at the outset that five or six would be enough.  Probably Col. Moore would be satisfied if the Committee he wishes to set up with regard to officers is embodied in this Committee, which could then deal with the duties of Chairman and Deputy-Chairman, the remuneration of members and travelling expenses, and the appointment of officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MAURICE MOORE Colonel MAURICE MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MAURICE MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not object to any arrangement made.  I rather doubt if it is not rather too much to ask the Committee to do.  If we want to settle only about the Official Staff and their salaries, that could be done in a day or two.  The other matters would take a longer time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. DOUGLAS Mr. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very desirable that one Committee should deal with both, for the additional reason that there would be a certain amount of overlapping, and they would have to consult together if you had two Committees. Further, there are matters in which the Committee will have to consult with the Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil as to a joint arrangement about printing, and there will have to be a working agreement between the two Clerks.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MAURICE MOORE Colonel MAURICE MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MAURICE MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it will be better to keep things separate. It will require a very special Committee to go into the question of the Constitution and the provisions you propose. The Committee suggested will require all the brains we can get.  The other matter is a mere matter of finance and the selection of clerks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>The duties of the Committee under Article 23 will not be very laborious.  It will be merely to suggest what <Col N="45" /> they consider right as to the payment of members and as to travelling expenses.  That is a matter that is provided for by Article 23.  The other Article, 21, only deals with the powers of the Chairman and Deputy Chairman. These three matters are to a great extent united, and the same principle would seem to run through them all, and I think you would be gaining a lot if you would leave them to the one Committee.  There is another reason, the Senators should bear it in mind that it will be a great tax upon the representatives of the Seanad who live in distant parts of the country to be asked to attend those Committees. Therefore, as far as possible, we should impose this duty on residents in the city or vicinity.  A Committee of business men would dispose of these matters in two sittings.</P>

It is in conformity with the usual practice that the Senator who has made the motion <Col N="47" /> should consent to act upon the Committee.  If that is agreeable to the Senate I shall put Sir Thomas Esmonde's name in conjunction with those already mentioned.</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>
      <P>Motion made and question put &ldquo;That the Committee shall consist of the following:&mdash;Sir Thomas Esmonde, Mr. Andrew Jameson, Sir J. Purser Griffith, Dr. Gogarty, Mr. J.J. Parkinson, Mr. Bennett, Colonel Moore, Mr. Farren, Mrs. Wyse Power, Mr. MacLysaght, and Mr. M. O'Dea.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. G. SIGERSON</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to propose the following motion:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Considering the flourishing condition of the Irish Fishing and Fish-curing Industries during the existence of the Irish Parliament, and their discouragement and decay since the Union, it is desirable that at an early period a Committee or Commission be appointed to report upon the state of those industries and on the best methods of promoting their prosperity&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My attention was first called to the condition of Irish industries through reading some Blue Books of the 18th Century pertaining to the English Realm, and the object of those books apparently was to discover why it was that the Irish Fisheries were prospering and gaining a hold upon the market superior to that which the British and Scottish Fisheries possessed.  The facts which I shall mention cannot be impeached for partiality, for they are all statements of English merchants and officials. First, you find that about the middle of the 18th Century the Irish fishers were even then alert and expert.  For example, a Mr. McDonald of Scotland brought some Irishmen over to teach the natives there how to make kelp.  Another gentleman at another time brought some Irish fishers to the North Hebrides to teach the natives how to cure fish, and, finally, to the Shetlands Irish fishers were brought to teach the natives how to proceed to the wider seas.  At that time they had only small boats containing <Col N="48" /> four men who would go out for eight miles, or larger boats containing eight men, who would go out for twelve miles.  They brought up Irish ferries then containing twelve men, who would go out a much greater distance.</P>
    <P>Then as regards the expertness of the Irish fishers at that early period, their advantages increased with the incoming of liberty and independence under the favouring guidance of an Irish Parliament. It has sometimes been stated that the Irish industries were fostered by too lavish bounties.  Now, this is absolutely untrue.  Those English Blue Books stated that, notwithstanding the fact that the bounties in Ireland were much lower than those given in Britain, the Irish made better use of them.  They were more aptly applied as well as economically spent.  Then, again, their alertness was remarkable.  Salt then was a precious commodity, and sometimes special cargoes of prize salt came to the ports in England.  In one case, for example, English merchants complained that when a cargo of prize salt came into the Port of London, the Commissioners there would not allow it to be transhipped and carried along the shores of England to other ports.  While they were discussing that matter a Cork merchant stepped in and bought the whole cargo and carried it off to Cork.  There was smuggling of salt and smuggling from Ireland, because Ireland seems to have succeeded in obtaining a superior quality of that material.  Then again, with regard to the mode of curing, it was alleged that the Irish mode of curing was much superior to that of Scotland or that of England.  And again, it was alleged that the probity of Irish merchants told greatly in favour of the Irish produce in markets abroad, because whereas it was found that in many cases fish cured and packed elsewhere than in Ireland were found to have their weight augmented by the presence of stones and other materials which were not edible, Irish fish were always chosen of the best, and only the best fish were allowed in the casks, so that though the casks were smaller than the casks of English or Scottish fish-curers, they fetched a higher price.  The Irish commanded the trade, so far as trade was allowed by the navigation laws of that period, which as you know, restricted the trade.  They commanded the trade of <Col N="49" /> the West Indies, and not only was the fish trade a success there, but meat-curing was also a success, and the produce was greatly preferred on account of the reasons which I have given, and which are in the Blue Books of the English Reports to the Committee of the House of Commons.  For these reasons, therefore, I beg to propose the resolution.  Since the Union these industries have greatly decayed.  At that time Ireland had a Highland fishery, and Ireland's boats were on the Highland seas.  They had also a fishery in Newfoundland. They even started a whale fishery there. Newfoundland at that time was governed in a peculiar manner not favourable to Irish fishers, because Lord North wrote to the Governor of Newfoundland saying that he did not wish that the country should be settled.  Instead of its being a British fishery it became a Colonial fishery.  Lord North made the statement: &ldquo;Whatever they ask for raw, give it to them roast, and whatever they wish for roast, give it to them raw.&rdquo;  In that way he tried to treat Newfoundland as a kind of country containing only persons of English descent or birth.  However, merchants brought over Irishmen there, and neglected to send them back according to the law, and the consequence was you had an Irish colony there where a British colony was discouraged and prevented and an Irish fishery established there which was practically a colonial fishery of Ireland. These are the reasons for which I propose this resolution.  Since that time the trade in these industries has been decaying and disappearing, and instead of our boats going into other seas, the boats of other countries come into our seas, and the wealth of our Irish waters is carried into foreign lands.</P>

      <P>I have great pleasure in seconding the resolution proposed by our respected friend.  No one is better qualified than he to speak to us on this subject, or indeed upon many other matters touching the material development of Ireland, which he has treated in his own fascinating works which I have done myself the pleasure of reading.  This is a subject in which I take a very deep interest, but I shall not make a very long speech upon it now.  We shall have very many more opportunities for discussing it later on.  It is a subject of which I have made <Col N="50" /> a study and in which I take a great interest. It is a subject of great interest for our people, and one in which there is a mine of wealth for the country.</P>

      <P>It may interest Senator Sigerson, having regard to the manifest concern he takes in the matter and the historical review he has given us, to know that the Government, I have been so informed, are actually engaged in the formation of a Ministry of Fisheries.

      <P>Perhaps the Senate could assist or co-operate with the Government in this particular matter, which is of very vital importance to the country at the present time.  This is a matter that has been delayed longer than it should be.  Fishermen are in a very deplorable condition, and they are suffering mainly from the want of instruction, the want of boats and tackle, and the want of co-operation in curing and finding suitable markets.</P>

      <P>Perhaps you will give me permission to bring forward a resolution, which, I think, will not be in any way objectionable to any member of the Seanad.  The resolution reads as follows: &ldquo;That this Senate requests the Department responsible for the Ordnance Survey <Col N="51" /> Office in Phoenix Park to obtain from the British Government, and have transferred to above office all the original engraved plates, drawings, triangulations and notes, etc., relating to the Surveys of Ireland; and from the Hydrographic Department of the Admiralty all similar plates, notes, etc., of the Charts of Irish territorial waters, and the larger Scale Plans of the Harbours, Rivers, etc., in Ireland.&rdquo;  It is probably within the knowledge of a great many of us that many of those plates and documents were removed to the Ordnance Survey Office in Southampton.  The result of that has been that the work which, in my opinion should be done in Ireland, is done in England.  In addition to that I think the proper custodians of those documents and plates, many of which are works of art, is the Irish Government, and the proper place for them is the Ordnance Survey Office in the Phoenix Park.  With the permission of the Seanad I shall take the liberty of moving this resolution.</P>

      <P>If there is no objection I shall put the motion.  It seems to contain nothing contentious, and probably the Seanad will be willing to accept it.  If it is objected to, having regard to the fact that no notice has been given, I would not myself be responsible for accepting it.  Being non-contentious, however, and dealing with a matter that I think deserves attention, probably the Seanad will accept it.</P>

      <P>We ought now to come to some conclusion with regard to the adjournment of the Seanad.  There are important matters to be dealt with by the Committees that have been appointed, and all the business on the Order <Col N="52" /> Paper has been disposed of.  At the earlier part of our sitting to-day Colonel Moore mentioned that he was anxious to bring forward a motion for discussion.  As we are at present proceeding under the Standing Orders of Dáil Eireann that motion is not capable of being discussed, as it is not on the Agenda, and under the Standing Orders governing our proceedings at the moment the motion should be put down four days prior to its being moved.  I would suggest, therefore, to Colonel Moore that it would be better for many reasons to allow this motion to stand over until our next meeting, when we shall be sitting and acting under our own Standing Orders.</P>

Various persons connected with the Press, and others, have approached me and possibly the other members of the Committee. We do not propose to make any statement.  Our silence neither means that anything has been done, nor that nothing has been done.  It should be taken as having no meaning other than wisdom.</P>
