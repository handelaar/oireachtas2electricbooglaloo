      <P>If the Seanad will allow me, I would like to give my reasons for what I admit is a somewhat unusual procedure.  My reason for introducing this motion and for asking for the withdrawal of Press correspondents is that before having a public discussion, in which perhaps certain old recriminations and prejudices may be raked up against anybody going forward for election, we should have an opportunity of discussing this matter in private.  I would most respectfully urge upon Senators that in considering the names of any two or more persons who may be submitted for election to the Chair, we should be guided solely by whether they are best fitted by their abilities and their position and by other circumstances, to fill the Chair with credit to themselves and with dignity to this Seanad.  In my opinion, there are three essentials for any man who fills this post.  The first is that he should be a man of recognised position, socially and otherwise.  The second is that he should be, if possible, possessed of Parliamentary experience, versed in constitutional procedure, and able to keep this Seanad, in the early days of its birth, on right lines.  The third, and perhaps the most important, requirement of all is that he should be a man having leisure time to devote to the duties of the office, which, at any rate for some time, must be of an exacting and arduous nature.  The very last essential, we will all admit, greatly limits our choice of candidates.  Without mentioning <Col N="9" /> any names, I am sure that if you look through the list of Senators you will recognise those of several men in the city of Dublin alone of outstanding ability in the commercial and business world, conversant with dealing with large bodies of men, any one of whom would make an excellent Chairman.  But, unfortunately, each of these men is so engrossed in his private affairs that it would not be fair to expect him to throw those up or make such a sacrifice.  That consequently limits our choice of candidates. I understand there may be two, or perhaps more, going forward.  I would ask everyone to bear in mind that whatever the colour of the political coats those candidates wore nine or ten years ago, that has nothing to do with the question to-day.  The sooner we forget all those prejudices and narrow-mindedness and bigotries which have kept Ireland asunder to her great discomfort and ruin the better.  The sooner we forget those, bury the past, and recognise that we are here, all Irishmen, united in a determination to loyally support the Free State Government and to carry out the Constitution which has been given us, and which, I think, nine out of every ten men admit gives us everything we could possibly want&mdash;to carry out that in a loyal spirit and in a spirit of goodwill, and with a determination to do the best in the interests of the country without fear, favour or affection&mdash;the better for the country.  To go into extraneous matters and refer to men's political cloth within the last few years, and how many times they have changed their coats or otherwise, has nothing to do with the question to-day.  I feel it would be disastrous if, on this opening of a new, and I hope a happy, era in the history of Ireland, it were to go forth that the Seanad, which has been elected by the goodwill of the President and the ballots of the members of the Dáil, began perhaps with a bitter and more or less venomous attack on the political opinions of men who might be submitted for our consideration.  That has nothing to do with it.  The only consideration that should guide us is, is this person or that person best fitted to fulfil the duties of Chairman.  We have every confidence that in the future we shall all do our best to ensure the peace and prosperity of this country.</P>

      <P>I wish <Col N="10" /> to say a few words on this matter.  There are many things which the last speaker said of which I approve.  I have never been a party man in the sense of wishing to exclude any of my countrymen from taking a share in the Government of this country.  On the contrary, I have always advocated and desired that all parties should come together and act together for the good of the country.  That has always been my view and I have very often got a great deal of discredit for not being a party man, and perhaps I am in that position at the moment that I am not a party man and do not do what any party choses to order me to do.  But while saying that, I cannot agree that we should wipe out <i>en bloc</i> everything that has occurred within the last few years. Some of the qualifications that the last speaker gave are qualifications that I entirely agree with.  There is one qualification which is extremely important and that is, that no man should sit at the head of this Seanad who does not possess the qualifications of having the respect and confidence of the people of Ireland. This Seanad has not very much actual power, but whatever influence it is going to have in this country will depend entirely on its own virtues and its own abilities, and the way in which we here in the Seanad tackle every subject that arises and work it out; and also it will depend very much upon what confidence the people of Ireland place in us. If we begin by losing the confidence of the people of Ireland, and if it is considered that we are extremists in one section or another; on the other hand, if we are not progressive or if we have our eyes cast over the seas to another country&mdash;if we have any of these things we will at once lose the confidence of the people of Ireland. The strength of any body, whether of the Dáil or Seanad, or any other body depends entirely upon the confidence of the people.  For that reason while I do not wish to raise any questions&mdash;I do not want to mention any names&mdash;I think it should be absolutely necessary to have some person whom we have known for a long period of years, whose record we know, and whose actions we may count on, and whom the people of Ireland outside, who may not know of particular things about this or that person, will respect and honour and have confidence in.  Therefore if we now appoint any <Col N="11" /> person who would not have the confidence of the Irish people, that would be a loss to our position and influence as a Seanad, and to our character, and we will be useless for all time.  It is not necessary, and it does not follow, that a person having the confidence of the Irish people should not be an extremely good man and should not be a man of ability. If we begin by letting it go forth that the Seanad is under the direction of some person who has not got the general confidence of the Irish people, then the Seanad will be doing the worst day's business that ever was done, and I believe we will sink into ignominy, and after another Dáil or two a proposal will be made to do without us.</P>

      <P>I wish to say that the arguments which the two previous speakers have used were the very arguments which forced some of us to vote against the Press being asked to withdraw.  I take it that we want the ablest man.  There is no reason why we should find the ablest man behind closed doors.  All the arguments could have been used in the presence of the Press.  We are not fixed to any political party, and we are not interested in the social position of anybody here.  What we are interested in is the ability of the man whom we select and for whom we are going to vote.  I do not see how the absence of the Press will help us to find the best man.  We want to know, and the country wants to know, the arguments for the selection of the best man we can get.  We will vote against the selection of any man of whose ability we are not convinced.  We will vote for the best man, and we do not want to know whether he is a Colonel or a Lord or a road worker.  He is just the same to us if he has the ability.  I am sorry that the Press has been asked to withdraw.  It would be interesting for the people of the country to know that we are all anxious to get the man or woman who has the most ability to conduct our proceedings.</P>

      <P>I think we should put aside once and for all all diplomacy in dealing with the people of the country. We have been diplomatised for a generation.  Let us stop it.  I am in thorough agreement with Colonel Moore <Col N="12" /> when he said we would be judged in this country by our abilities as a Seanad.  I suggest we consider nothing whatever but whether the man we are going to choose will have the necessary legal and necessary political knowledge to steer this Seanad through the exceedingly intricate channels through which it will have to pass.  We have thorny legal questions in this Seanad on every side of us, and, of course, we will have thorny political questions.  The past is dead not only for us but for this country.  There is no individual we can appoint who will add in any way to our popularity.  What enemy of ours will lay down his gun because of any man we appoint here?  I suggest we are assembled here no longer in a Nationalist or Unionist sense, but merely as members of the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. OLIVER St. J. GOGARTY</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words in support of the sentiments so generally uttered, but before saying anything of that nature it would be probably well to dispel from the air the bogies which seem to be overriding the minds of the speakers.  The first is that the elections should be unanimous.  I should be very sorry to see anything unanimous even in the Seanad, because I have been on many Boards and a unanimous verdict upon any candidate almost always means that there is a compromise.  The other bogey is this that public opinion reacts to precent. The public opinion of Ireland reacts to example and not to precept, and the most exemplary instance of that is the life of the late President Arthur Griffith who lived a life of obscurity with a clear vision of realising what a Nation is with the result that we owe to his work the fact that we are meeting here to-day in this Seanad.  Those who seek to placate public opinion are really placating ludicrous bogies of their own making in their mind.  They are placating public opinion.  That has been the curse of the methods of procedure because public opinion is as false a conception as that of the stage Irishman of the old days. Let us consider personally on merit and exemplary power.  There may be a reversion back to old associations and things that can be no longer forgotten. All I can say is that good may come from every part of our country.  Belfast owes us a mighty grudge for not supporting in Dublin that sink of acidity&mdash;Lord <Col N="13" /> Carson.  He used the enemies of Ireland as a springboard, and is now safely deposited on the English Woolsack.  His colleague is with his country here. Lord Carson's spiritual life has been exaggerated by a chronic attack of mental gall-stones.  Surely we must not allow a consideration such as that to influence us now.  We should have the courage to consider the date of the Seanad as starting from the 1st January. All mentalities before it are necessarily over-ridden, and, therefore, cannot be brought as criteria of our present action. So, I would precede the election by an appeal to people to have sufficient sense of the dignity of their country to make the Seanad an entity without any antecedent. Let us march forward with unanimity, and, for goodness sake, forget anything but capacity.  It may be the first time that is a clear issue.</P>

We do know the record of two or three of our members, who would make admirable Chairmen, but there are others who in the course <Col N="14" /> of twelve months or so would show that they too have admirable qualities for the Chair.  That being so I think we would be well advised in limiting the occupancy of the office for one year, in the first instance, and I propose accordingly that the term of office for the Chairmanship of the Seanad be for one year.</P>

      <P>I beg to propose the name of Lord Glenavy, and I do so because I regard it as one of the most important steps that this Seanad should take, especially if we mean to follow the road that leads to a united Ireland, and I think the idea of a united Ireland will be the supreme consideration of every Senator here.  Coming as I do from the extreme North, where I am in touch with the feeling of people there who are supporters of the Northern Government, I know the effect of the appointment of a man of Lord Glenavy's record.  It will have a big effect on them and be a big incentive in forcing the hands of their own die-hards to come into the Free State.  By electing Lord Glenavy we will give them a guarantee of fair play and let them see we are prepared to treat every man as a brother Irishman, irrespective of what his politics were in the past or his religion is in the present.  I certainly join with Senator Colonel Hutcheson Poë in deprecating any introduction of past politics.  We do not want to re-open the graves of dead and buried controversies or array anyone here in the shroud of Party politics.  I think it was Gambetta who said, when he was taunted with surrounding himself with Royalists, &ldquo;I refuse to ask the date when any man became a Republican,&rdquo; and I think this Seanad would be unwise to ask anyone at what date he ceased to be a Unionist and became a loyal supporter of the Irish Free State.</P>

      <P>I regret very much that I feel bound to oppose the election of Lord Glenavy as Chairman or Cathaoirleach of Seanad Eireann. I do so with great regret because I dislike very much any controversy, and it was in hopes of avoiding this controversy that I agreed and voted for a private meeting this morning.  Certain people in this Assembly, to my knowledge, are strongly opposed to it.  I, for one, intend to vote against it.  I cannot regard the present state of the country without looking back to the past.  I cannot hide from myself that the present state is due to causes that happened some years ago, beginning principally in 1912 and 1913. I have been asked not to rake up questions, but it is impossible to avoid these things when suddenly these things are pressed upon an unwilling people.  The state of affairs now is because of a certain rebellion raised in Ulster.  Everybody knows that.  It was on account of that the Irish Volunteers were raised in the South to prevent a rebellion.  The result of that was that two armed forces were raised up, one against the other. Arms were forced into the hands of people who were unwilling to fight, and who did not wish to raise bloodshed in this country.  The greater part of the people of this country who wished to settle these matters constitutionally, and who had been working and acting for forty years or more on constitutional lines have been pushed on unwillingly. I do not know what the future of those people might be who are now proposed.  I do not know whether they will work for the freedom of Ireland.  We are not yet complete in our freedom. We have certain limitations.  I have accepted this Treaty, and I am willing to accept it and to work it, but this Treaty may be limited or it may not be limited. It may be decreased, or it may not be decreased, and I cannot advocate the appointment to so important a position of anybody whose views and whose future I cannot foresee.  The position here is very different from what it is in other places.  Here we have no Ministers.  We have no one to lead the House; we are here standing alone without Ministers, and the person who is put in as Chairman <Col N="16" /> or as Cathaoirleach will be more or less in the position of Leader of this Seanad.  I foresee that he will not be quite in the position of the Chairman or Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil, who sits there merely as an independent person, merely deciding as to whether a person is or is not out of order.  I for one cannot willingly consent, and will not consent, to a person whose political future I cannot to a certain extent foresee being placed in that position.  Therefore, I myself will vote definitely against the proposal that has been made.</P>

I believe in the importance of the unity of Ireland, but I also believe in the formation and setting up of a Gaelic and democratic State.  I do believe that the appointment of Lord Glenavy will not bring the North to us. There is only one thing that will bring the North, and that is the economic condition. I do not think that electing Lord Glenavy as the mouthpiece of this the most important body in Ireland, perhaps, except the Dáil, will stand for the regeneration of Ireland in the traditional way we have been brought up to believe, and that we are all working for.  Believing those two things I cannot vote for Lord Glenavy, and I am sorry that I cannot.</P>

      <NameTxt>Lord GLENAVY</NameTxt>
      <P>(on taking the Chair):&mdash;My Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen, fellow-members of this Seanad, this resolution has come upon me so quickly that I confess I do not yet realise my position, nor can I find adequate words to give expression to my feelings.  I have not coveted the position.  No ambition of mine is served by it.  I appreciate its difficulties and its responsibilities, and had there been any substantial section of this Assembly who had expressed themselves opposed to my selection, nothing would have induced me to accept the office.  But I am fortified by the fact that with practically, so far as I can <Col N="17" /> see, but two dissentients, the Assembly of the Seanad wishes that I should accept this office.  Such a significant proof of their good-will and good opinion has removed all my doubts and misgivings, and therefore I am prepared with confidence and courage to accept the trust you have offered to me.  I observe&mdash;and this may be some relief to the feelings of the member of the Seanad who prophesied that the Chairman would be practically Leader of this House&mdash;by the terms of the Constitution, by which we here are bound, that the Chairman is not allowed to give a vote upon any division in this Chamber&mdash;a very clear indication, I think, that it is contemplated that he should hold himself aloof from the controversial questions of the hour, and confine himself to the duties of his office.  This prohibition of taking an active part in debates of your Seanad is, however, I think, a pretty safe guarantee not merely for his impartiality, but also for his independence.  The duties of your Chairman have yet to be defined in accordance with the terms of the Constitution, but it is fairly obvious that it will be his province to uphold the powers of the Seanad and the privileges of its members, to regulate the order and procedure of its business, and to secure, so far as is consistent with dignity and decorum in debate, and the reasonable despatch of business, to each and every member the fullest freedom of speech. To this task I shall apply myself wholeheartedly, to the best of my ability, without fear, favour or affection.  And I believe, promised as I am the sympathy and support of practically the entire body of members of this Assembly, that with that sympathy and support you will do full credit to yourselves as a constituent Chamber of the Parliament of the Irish Free State, and you will justify the confidence of those who have sent us here.  I claim but one qualification for this honourable position to which you have appointed me to-day&mdash;the qualification that I am certain I hold in common with each and all of you&mdash;that is, a love for my country and its people, a passionate desire for the restoration of peace, goodwill and unity amongst all Irishmen, and a speedy and honourable release from the horrors and devastation of the fratricidal strife that at present is being waged in our midst.  It is in that hope and in that spirit that I accept <Col N="18" /> the responsible trust that by your practically unanimous vote to-day you have bestowed upon me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir T. GRATTAN ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>My name has been mentioned in the course of this debate, and that is my only excuse for entering upon it.  May I take advantage of that circumstance to offer you my warmest and most sincere congratulations on your practically unanimous selection to the Presidency of the Seanad of Ireland?  I speak for myself.  I believe, I am certain, I speak for every member of the Seanad in saying that in the discharge of your important and arduous duties you will have our unanimous, our loyal and our enthusiastic support.  One of our members from the North of Ireland conveyed to us that your appointment would be taken more or less as an olive branch to our dissenting brethren in the North. Other speakers in the course of this discussion have thrown doubt upon that possibility.  I believe and I am convinced that your Presidency here will have a most beneficent effect on the relations between Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland.  At all events, we Southerners, in putting you practically unanimously into this high and important position, have given an earnest of our good intentions.  We can do no more than endeavour to prove to our Northern brethren that we recognise no boundaries; we only recognise Ireland.  Further, Sir, reference has been made to ancient days, days which possibly you and I can both remember.  All these days are, and they should be, absolutely forgotten and whatever has happened in the past, however much we may have differed, there is only one thing before us now, and that is our common country. Whatever we may have felt about details in politics in days gone by we are all united in our common desire and our common determination to serve our people to the best of our ability.  Therefore, I hope that nothing will ever be said, in this Seanad at all events, of ancient and bygone days; but may I put in this plea?  After all, we are not witnessing the birth of a new Nation, we are witnessing the rehabilitation of a very old and a very glorious Nation, and let us never cut the connection in sympathy and in thought of the great men who are gone before us.</P>

After the speeches <Col N="20" /> that were made as to competency I must confess frankly that I cannot claim competency; I can only claim willingness to learn and to endeavour to serve you.  I do not know whether the duties of Vice-Chairman will be such as will enable me, with the amount of time I can rightly give, to serve for any great length of time, but subject to it being understood that it may be necessary for me to offer my resignation if I find I cannot do so, I am glad to accept the honour which you have conferred upon me.  Ever since I could think of politics I have believed in and I have longed for and I have prayed for an independent self-governing Ireland.  I believe in it still, and to be able to serve in such a position of importance in the first Seanad of Ireland is an honour of which I am very proud and which I value very much, and which I thank you greatly for having conferred upon me.</P>

Some little time ago we listened, in the Oireachtas Assembly, to the Speech of the Governor-General.  I am sure it filled us all with pride and thankfulness to see him there in the first instance, and secondly the programme of legislation which he outlined seemed to be an admirable one for the advancement of the condition of the country.  I was in a more particular manner struck by his allusion to the question of Land Purchase, because I feel that the conclusion of Land Purchase is one of the many pressing and essential problems for the maintenance and furtherance of peace.

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. J. DOUGLAS Mr. J. DOUGLAS">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. DOUGLAS</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to ask leave of the Seanad to move the resolution which has been circulated to the members, and which reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Seanad Eireann desires to record its conviction that the securing of internal peace is essential to the well-being of the Irish Nation.  It, therefore, decides to appoint five Senators as a committee to consider, and if feasible, to consult with others as to the possibility of an immediate cessation of acts of violence.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say, first of all, that in moving this resolution I am acting on my own behalf and only on my own behalf.  I know I have the sympathy of other Senators, but I mean that I am not inspired by the Government nor do the Government approve, nor have they knowledge of my action in moving the resolution that is here.  I say this because I do not want this to be interpreted as what would be commonly called a peace move.  It is not.  I move it because I feel that it is right that this, practically the first meeting of Seanad Eireann, should have an opportunity of expressing what is in the heart and mind and soul of everyone in this country, a feeling that internal peace and the cessation of acts of violence is an absolute essential to our well-being. I do not propose to attack anybody; I do not ask you in this resolution to approve of anything that the Government has done; I do not formally ask you even to disapprove of anything. This will not prevent them from carrying out the policy for which they are responsible in the way which they believe to be best, but I do feel strongly that it would be a pity if this new body, which contains independent members, should not have an opportunity of expressing itself in a very simple form on this, what is admittedly the one vital essential problem before our Nation to-day. We have been reminded that it has been possible, and is possible now to put aside feelings of past differences. Some of us in this Seanad were on different platforms, between which points of view were acts of violence, and <Col N="25" /> while these acts of violence continued we could not put aside our differences; we could not have met together for co-operation, and now I want to suggest that it is violence and not the political opinions of those who may differ from us that is the real barrier to co-operation and peace in this country to-day.  Is it necessary to remind you of what this warfare and these acts of violence are causing this Nation?  We know that we can scarcely hold up our head, internationally, because of what is happening; we know that it has weakened and has lessened the position that we proudly held a year ago as a nation; we know that the economic situation may become extremely serious; we know that it may lead to unemployment uncontrollable, possibly to starvation, if violence goes on as it does; we know it leads and is leading to loss of life daily, almost hourly. Even little children's lives are being sacrificed or risked in this holocaust of violence and of wrong.  Far worse than that, and this is the one thing which I believe matters more than anything else in this country, these acts of violence are leading to a chasm of hatred between men who ought to be and who are, whether they admit it or not, common citizens of Ireland, and who ought to be brothers working together for the ideals which we mostly share in common.</P>
    <P>Somebody, I cannot remember who, described hell as a place where everybody hated each other.  We are getting very near a state of hell so far as some parts are concerned, and unless the people of this country are prepared to come forward to a man and to a woman and say: &ldquo;You can hold whatever opinion you like; you can agitate in whatever way you like, but this violence must and has got to cease.&rdquo;  Unless the people are prepared to do that then I suggest to the Government that their problem is an almost impossible one.  It is very easy to come along and say the Government should have done this, or the Government should have done that.  If I wished I could possibly criticise them, too, but I am not going to.  What I want to suggest is this&mdash;that instead of criticising the Government, as most of us are attempting to do, if we would criticise the people, if we would tell the people that they are responsible, that they, and they only, can put an end to the violence, we <Col N="26" /> might, perhaps, be achieving something. I wish from the bottom of my heart that my voice here, that the voice of this Seanad, could carry right over the country, that we could point out to those who are responsible for the violence something of what it means.  You read in the papers the other day of two little children in a burning house.  I do not know whether one of them will get better or not.  I do not suggest for one moment that these men meant to do that, but they did it, and this holocaust means that you start off with the idea of violence achieving some good and you find yourself committing acts for which you cannot be responsible and which you did not mean to do.  I cannot tell you, I wish I could, that any action of yours will lead to peace, but I do suggest this, that if we appoint a small Committee, not to start a peace move, for we have no right to do that, but which will give a gesture in a way to those who are opposed to us, mostly politically, that here is a small Committee who would be glad to talk with them as to how violence could be stopped &mdash;that is the need.  We do not want political agreements; we do want a country in which there may be honest differences of opinion, a country at least, where people can live and speak and work together in peace.  Some of us speak of the seven hundred years during which Ireland has struggled for freedom.  Some of us even the youngest of us, have been dreaming of what Ireland might do when she had her own Parliament, when she was able to make her own laws. We have dreamed of a policy of reconstruction, and we have planned many things which we had hoped for, and what have we got?  Destruction every day. Instead we ought to be spending our money, our time, our thought, and our lives in building up something worth while.</P>
    <P>There is no day but that some property, some life, and good will, which is more important than either, is also being destroyed.  I suggest that we should have a small Committee; that we should not ask it to report to us; that we should leave them quietly to do their work if they find any work to do; that at least we should tell the people that we believe that this thing ought to end and must end, and that <Col N="27" /> reason and good will should take the place of growing hatred, agitation and violence, and that we are prepared to assist, if it be in our power.  Might I again say that I move this on my own initiative, then, with a full heart, feeling that in much of what I have said I am speaking of the real longing of almost every man, woman and child in this country, and in the hope that our action here may lead to an echo somewhere. Let me give you one simple illustration of what this has cost us.  I knew Michael Collins in the days when by many here he was not believed in, and I learned to respect and to love him for his great, big, kind heart, and this war has taken him from us.  On the other side I knew at the same time Erskine Childers, and I learned to respect and love him for his unselfishness, and he, too, has gone.  I could go on, one after the other.  Violence takes the best and leaves the worst and it must be stopped, and I wish we all could say right out to the people, that it must be stopped and a way must be found. Mr. De Valera stated about twelve months ago that there was a Constitutional way of setting our differences. My Resolution simply says there is still a Constitutional way and we want you to help to find it.  I am perfectly certain that there are many opposed to us politically who are longing for peace as much as we are, and it is to them that I personally appeal, though they are not here; it is through them that this Committee may be able to bring some peace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. STOPFORD GREEN</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been asked suddenly and unexpectedly to second this proposal, which I do from the very depths of my heart.  I am not an old speaker, and perhaps I may begin by saying that this is the second time I have been under the terror of shorthand writers, when one's most injudicious words are reported. The only time I have had that honour before was when suspected by Scotland Yard, and I was under examination by the most able inquisitors in England.  This question, however, stirs me most deeply.  There is scarcely a family in this country which is not divided, and it is that very division which should make us, if possible, seek to reestablish peace and understanding.  I <Col N="28" /> was speaking the other day to a man of the people who is occupied in a difficult and dangerous task.  He told me half his family were out with the people on the opposition side, and he said the best and most honest and truest men in Ireland are there amongst them.  I said: &ldquo;Some of the worst.&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;Yes, that is true.&rdquo;  It is because these events are dividing us there is no living contact left between the people of the two sides. They think of us as being the worst of traitors, that we have sold our country for comfort, for convenience, for well-being, for cowardice, for I don't-know-what. We know we do not deserve that charge, that we have deeply in our hearts the feeling of our country and the determination for its full freedom and independence. We desire that the people should live in the fullest enjoyment of their own liberty, and that nothing of the slave mind should be left behind.  But how can we tell them this when they see papers with garbled stories and with propaganda going out that makes it hard for them to believe when we cannot bring the living voice, that contact of personal feeling which often does more than the living voice, and when we cannot show them that we have the same care and the same desire, and the same respect for them that we would wish them to have for us.  Therefore, it is a great pleasure to me, that at the first meeting of this new independent Seanad that has no authority over it, in fact, a new force brought into the country, that one of its first acts should be to devise the means of contact and friendly discussion, and so every one of us might use those great words, &ldquo;I am amongst you as one of the servants.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I feel great pleasure in associating myself with the resolution.  I feel at such a time as this, when we as a Seanad are meeting for the first time, if we could in any way effect a cessation of hostilities for the time of peace, that that, if nothing else, would make us honoured for all time. Everything in the country requires peace.  Commerce, trade, agriculture&mdash; all is become prostrate, and so far as I read all that is required is a Committee that will be acceptable, as far as may be, to those we are approaching.  I feel that when any of these people are approached in the spirit of peace the white <Col N="29" /> light of truth may lead them to a cessation of hostilities, and once there is a cessation of hostilities that Ireland, realising her destiny, will never again resume the conflict.</P>

      <P>I should like to say one or two words in regard to this motion.  Personally I think the time is singularly opportune for a motion of this kind, particularly in view of the fact that the season of peace and goodwill is now approaching.  Notwithstanding the fact that we have depreciated in morale as a result of fratricidal strife that is now tearing the country asunder, I believe that the approach of this season, which is common to all Christians, and looked upon everywhere as a time of peace, will not be without its effect on the minds of those who are arrayed in mortal conflict on opposite sides.  From the workers' point of view the one hope of salvation is peace, because while unfortunately some elements in every community gain in some way or another by war, the workers, who live by the work of their hands or their brains, stand to lose in every instance. Apart from that material aspect of the case, we are appalled at the possible consequences of a continuation of the strife.  The nation is drifting to ruin economically and socially, and from the point of view of its standing among the nations it has unfortunately lost that proud position which, as an old nation grown young once more in its liberty, it will take considerable time to recover.  I believe the first act of this Seanad in appointing a Committee that, at all events, may be a means of communication between the opposing forces is one of the best auguries that could be, and one of the best services it could render to the nation.  Consequently I have great pleasure in supporting the motion.</P>

      <P>I would like to say one or two words in commendation of those who have spoken. The most horrible thing to me is the increasing apathy of the whole country in this matter.  Years ago we were horrified at this idea of internecine strife of any kind.  We did not believe it was possible.  Then we began to abuse each other, but we still said &ldquo;We can abuse each other, but we will not fight.&rdquo;  We drifted from abuses into fighting, and we <Col N="30" /> went on from that to the burning of houses and murder, and from that to reprisals, all the time being shocked at each thing that happened, but whatever happens now we take it as a matter of course, so that now there is hardly anything left to be shocked at.  I think we have come to the climax of shocks.  I have been meeting several of those who have been fighting on opposite sides in the hills and in Dublin, and I find that they are also shocked, and I think for that reason that this is a proper time to appoint this Committee.  I know that the people on both sides wish this to end.  They tell me so constantly, but no one seems to know how to make the attempt.  Each side has certain words which they hurl at each other, certain proclamations and phrases on which they seem to think everything depends.  They are shot out like bullets out of a machine gun.  If you could get a little tenderness and softness of heart, and get the people together, and give over these phrases and verbiage so common amongst them, I think we may come to some degree of agreement amongst ourselves.</P>

      <P>I should like to make one or two observations.  Centuries ago it was the custom in Europe when nations were torn asunder by civil war, as well as by foreign assaults, that a truce of God was declared to hold during certain holidays, when arms should cease and men should live as Christians, and surely that is a necessity during the great festival of Christmas, when the birth of the Saviour gave joy to all nations and promised peace and happiness to men of good will.  Then, I would suggest that we adopt this ancient custom and add it to the resolution that has been so manfully proposed that a cessation of arms should be declared during the festival of Christmas and the days following, in the hope that the memories of that season&mdash;and perhaps the grace from a higher world&mdash;might touch men's hearts and make them forget the present quarrels and the havoc of strife, and look forward to the day when Ireland should again be the sun of Europe and the University of the world.  It is, no doubt, true that no nation perhaps on earth has been so apt to division and to strife amongst various factions.  History proves that unfortunately, <Col N="31" /> but if it does it proves something else&mdash;that in no nation in the world did the warring parties more rapidly coalesce or ancient wounds more rapidly heal.  That we have to remember. Everywhere, north and south, after every invasion and every fight the people came together, and their records are that, so close were the ties of good neighbourhood and so genuine the feeling of friendship amongst the people of Ireland when they came together, that nothing could excel that bond of amity that was to be seen everywhere, and that you will see in the North, which has not been understood, and which has not been able to express itself.  I have seen instances there where a Catholic entered into possession of a farm or a Protestant entered into possession of a farm.  Their neighbours&mdash;Catholic and Protestant&mdash;would come and plough up the land or bring in the turf, or carry the harvest to the stack-yard.  They are there still, and there are throughout Ireland the remnants of the men who made our country a nation, and of the Volunteers who at Dungannon declared for the emancipation of Catholics as well as the freedom of Ireland, as well as descendants of the men of '98, whose blood baptised Ireland with the sacred unction of Liberty.  Now, throughout Connacht, Munster and Leinster, there is unquestionably that hidden flame of friendship which lacks only the opportunity that it may blaze forth and enlighten the world. Therefore, it is a noble thing to foster and tend that, in order that what has been a jarring cry may pass, and that Ireland may once more become a nation of which not only we may be proud, but which, as in ancient days, will be revered, honoured and respected amongst the nations of the world.</P>

      <P>May I say a few words in this very interesting and very touching debate. There is no doubt about it, our whole nation is yearning for peace&mdash;is praying for peace.  Look at what has happened at home&mdash;at the destruction which the Senator opposite has rightly said the poor and the workers have to bear the brunt of.  Look at the position that our ancient nation now occupies in the face of the civilised world.  The situation with us is too awful.  It is not <Col N="32" /> Christian.  It is not civilised.  Why should we, at this time in our history, kill one another merely for political differences? The situation is too awful and too terrible for anybody who pauses a moment to reflect upon it.  What we can do I do not know&mdash;whether we can help towards peace in a practical way or not, but, at all events, we are coming near Christmas, and let this Seanad at least hold forth some invitation, some attempt at a golden bridge, whereby our warring countrymen may go and settle down in peace amongst one another.  If we can help in the least degree we shall be blessed, and we shall be doing a real duty to bring a real blessing on Ireland. I hope some good may come from this resolution, which I am sure the Seanad is unanimously in favour of, and I am certain the country will support us with all their heart.</P>

      <P>Before I put this resolution may I say, though probably transgressing a point of order, but comforted by the reflection that we have as yet adopted no standing rules, I think we are entitled to be very proud of the discussion to which we have just listened. I have seldom heard more eloquent or more moving or more appropriate speeches.  None of them were too long, and all were to the point, and I think everyone here must be impressed by their power and their sincerity.  God knows we all long from the bottom of our hearts for this approach and this holding out of the olive branch, so that, if possible, by the coming Christmas the great world message of &ldquo;peace on earth to men of good will&rdquo; may have a real meaning and a real significance for us. This discussion and this resolution will do much, believe me, to justify the constitution of this Seanad.  It breathes the true spirit of independence and also the best spirit of brotherly love and good will, and if it accomplishes anything in the direction of bringing our fellow-countrymen together&mdash;even resulting in the temporary cessation of hostilities&mdash; we shall have done to-day a work for which in all time we shall get credit and honour from our people.</P>

      <P>We have not as yet adopted any Standing Orders.  A Committee has been appointed to draw up Standing Orders.  The Dáil has drawn up Standing Orders for itself, and it is quite likely that the majority of these will be found acceptable to you.  Probably it would be a wise thing if in the meantime we were, by resolution, to adopt these, pending formation of our own Standing Orders.  That would not bind us to keep them perpetually, but it will enable us to have some Standing Orders to work under until our own Committee has adopted suitable Orders for the Seanad.</P>

The Committee can also consider the salaries to be paid to those officers.  In regard to the question of salaries, we all know that it is in the power of the Dáil, and the Committee will have to have consultation with a Committee or some representatives of Dáil Eireann before the matter is finally settled.

      <P>Members of the Oireachtas, to-day, in the name and with the authority of the people of Saorstát Eireann, you enter into the fullness of your partnership in liberty with the Nations co-operating in co-equal membership of a great Commonwealth of free peoples.  I meet you on this momentous day with sentiments of the deepest emotion, charged by His Majesty to associate myself as His Representative with the task which, after many years of hard-pressed claim, becomes yours, alone and unquestioned, by the effect of the Treaty made just a year ago between Great Britain and Ireland and subsequently ratified, the task of governing this State, of making the laws under which you are to live and of administering those laws for the happiness and well-being of all your fellow-citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3" /> You have adopted a Constitution for this State and in framing that Constitution, while you have in careful observance of your Treaty obligations conformed to those modes of Constitutional expression and form which are common to your partner Nations and characteristic features of their Association in the British Commonwealth of Nations, you have had no other fetter on the exercise of a single-minded and whole-hearted determination to create for your country such machinery of government as seemed to you most calculated to serve her best interests most efficiently.  You have just devised a Constitution under which the most patriotic yearnings for the re-creation of the national life and identity of your country in language and thought, in literature and art, for her progress along secure lines of social and economic development, for her assurance in prosperity, happiness and contentment are offered the utmost free play. You have been encouraged in your work by the support of your fellow-countrymen and women, who have testified in no uncertain manner their approval of and confidence in your efforts for the Nation.</P>
    <P>Unhappily, a small number who have not yet bowed to the will of the majority, have engaged in hostile operations against you and have spread ruin broadcast in an attempt to impose their will upon the majority by means of terror and destruction.  While failing utterly in their attempt to upset the Treaty so solemnly arrived at and to involve our country in renewed strife with Great Britain, these unhappy people have succeeded in striking deadly blows both at the economic prosperity and the political unity of Ireland, and thousands of persons have suffered individual hardships through their actions.  The problem of unemployment&mdash;so pressing in many countries to-day&mdash;was certain to have been of smaller dimension in Ireland than in almost any other country, but has been enhanced to an incalculable extent by the fury of destruction and attempted disorganisation which is the manner of war now being waged upon the people.  It must be your first and most urgent care to bring this disorder to a speedy end so that you may be free to devote your best efforts to the <Col N="4" /> solution of the social and economic problems it has created or aggravated.  In the meantime, my Ministers are giving their best attention to the working out of schemes for dealing with the problem, which they hope to have ready to submit to your active consideration so soon as the circumstances will allow of their being put into operation.</P>
    <P>The Parliament of that portion of the Province of Ulster called Northern Ireland, taking advantage of Article 12 of the Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland, has seen fit to present an address to His Majesty, by the effect of which the powers of your Parliament and Government have ceased to extend to Northern Ireland.  Accordingly it becomes the duty now of my Government to take such steps as may be necessary for constituting the Commission which is to determine in accordance with the wishes of the inhabitants, so far as may be compatible with economic and geographic conditions, the boundaries between Northern Ireland and the rest of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Legislation will be required in order to give full effect to the Constitution passed and adopted by your Constituent Assembly, and Bills will be submitted to you for that purpose.  Among the first and most urgent of such Bills is one with the object of providing for the exercise of the franchise as enacted by the Constitution and a comprehensive Electoral Bill will be submitted to you at an early date.</P>
    <P>The construction and establishment under the Constitution of a Judicial System specially adapted to the requirements of this country is a matter of immediate necessity.  A committee of persons of expert knowledge on this subject is being set up immediately to examine this problem, and as soon as possible after the report of the Committee has been received and considered a Bill for the establishment of an Irish Judiciary will be submitted to you.</P>
    <P>With the object of promoting economy and increasing efficiency a Bill will be submitted to you, providing for the setting up of Ministries under the Constitution and matters incidental thereto.</P>
    <P>It is of urgent importance that an organisation for the maintenance of Civil Police should be established, with all <Col N="5" /> proper training and equipment, and that it should be, in numbers and efficiency, ready to take over the guardianship of the public peace and security in the normal times which we earnestly pray may soon take the place of the present dislocation of social order.  Already in districts where the National Army has completed its task against disorder the Government has despatched members of a force which it has raised and trained, under the name of the &ldquo;Civic Guard,&rdquo; and which it is gratifying to know has been received with every indication of popular pleasure wherever it has appeared.</P>
    <P>A Bill will be laid before you to provide for organisation and maintenance on a permanent footing of the Civic Guard and for the regularising of the position of those who have been already enrolled and sent forth to discharge these important duties to the public.</P>
    <P>A Bill relating to your National Defence Force in time of peace will be shortly offered for your consideration.</P>
    <P>The wanton havoc which has been inflicted on the country during the year and a half since the Truce with the British Forces carries with it the heavy responsibility of meeting the Bill for compensating those upon whom individually the suffering and loss have been inflicted.</P>
    <P>A measure will be submitted to you for the purpose of improving the legal procedure in relation to such claims and of extending the jurisdiction of the courts in relation thereto, and of relieving local authorities from part of the burden, and also of making other amendments which have been found necessary in the Criminal and Malicious Injuries Acts.  You will also be asked to pass a measure giving legal sanction to the work of the Compensation Commission set up to deal with pre-Truce damage.</P>
    <P>The subject of the completion of land purchase in Ireland is engaging the earnest attention of my Ministry, and it is hoped that it will be possible at an early date to submit to you a Bill providing for the completion of this problem of urgent national importance.</P>
    <P>A Bill will be submitted to you for the purpose of giving statutory sanction <Col N="6" /> to certain improvements effected in the administration of Local Government and of Poor Law.</P>
    <P>A Bill will be submitted to you, securing, by legal sanction, the amnesty and indemnity proclaimed by the late General Michael Collins in favour of the members of the British Forces engaged in the military operations prior to the Treaty.</P>
    <P>The existing disorder prevents even the enforcement of decrees judicially made by various authorities and many suiters have thereby been prejudiced. To remove doubt and correct this mischief effective legislation has become necessary.</P>
    <P>Bills will also be presented to you dealing with other matters consequential on the severance of government and our new Constitutional Status.  These will include a Bill for the establishment of a Patent Office, and dealing with the law as to the Registration of Patents, Trade Marks and Designs, a Bill adapting the existing law of Copyrights; and a Bill or Bills providing for necessary consequential adaptations of other existing laws.</P>
    <P>Members of Dáil Eireann, the Estimates of the sums required for the service of the Irish Free State for the year ending on the 31st March, 1923, will be laid before you in due course and in accordance with the provisions of Article 37 of your Constitution, and will require your most earnest consideration.</P>
    <P>Provision for members of the National Army who have become disabled and for the Dependants of those who have laid down their lives in defence of the people's rights, is a national obligation, and with the object of suitably meeting that obligation a measure will be submitted to you at an early date.</P>
    <P>Members of the Oireachtas, it is my prayer that the labours upon which you are now entering may be blessed and bear great fruit for our country.</P>
