      <P>It would seem that every Senator has taken the Oath, and to put ourselves in order, as a temporary measure we should appoint a Chairman until we can decide among ourselves who is to be our permanent presiding officer. Therefore, I beg to move, as a tribute <Col N="3" /> to our oldest member, that Dr. George Sigerson be appointed Chairman for this day only, until the Seanad shall decide who shall be its permanent Chairman. The appointment can be made on the understanding that we can come together to-morrow, at an hour which is found generally convenient, to appoint our permanent Chairman.  That being so, I have the honour to move that Dr. Sigerson take the Chair for this day.</P>

      <P>I am glad to second that proposal.  We have only had notice handed to us as we came in of the business to-day, and we need a little time for consultation. It would be to us an honour if so learned and faithful an historian of Ireland would take the Chair for this day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel MAURICE MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose that a Committee to enquire into the Standing Orders for the Seanad should be appointed.  I have made some enquiries and I find that Standing Orders have already been adopted for Dáil Eireann, and I think that it would be a good plan, as we must have some Standing Orders to carry us on, if we could accept for the moment the Standing Orders of Dáil Eireann so far as they may be applicable to the Seanad, until such time as the Committee which we could appoint now considers the matter and draws up suitable Standing Orders.  I will not make any suggestion as to the names of the Committee for the moment until the motion has been seconded and somebody else makes suggestions.</P>

      <P>I would move that Lord Glenavy, Sir John Keane, Mr. Douglas, Mr. Kenny, Mr. Moran, Mr. Goodbody, Lord Granard, and Lord Dunraven be members of this Committee on Standing Orders.  This Committee would, of course, have power to add to its numbers.</P>

I understand that the Governor-General is to make a speech to-morrow afternoon at 3 o'clock, and that Dáil Eireann will be meeting and that it is desirable the Seanad should sit here at the same time. I, therefore, propose that we adjourn until 3 o'clock to-morrow.  I understand <Col N="6" /> the other room will be available after the speech for the further sitting of the Seanad.</P>
