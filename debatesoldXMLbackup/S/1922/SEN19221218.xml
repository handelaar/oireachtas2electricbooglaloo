      <P>The first business on the Agenda is the Report of the Committee on Standing Orders.  You probably have seen that Report already, and I just want to say to the members that, as they all got it at very short notice, they probably will be anxious to look into it and consider these Orders for themselves.  They are not yet complete, because it will be necessary to make certain Orders, arranging as far as it is practicable for inter-communication between the two Houses, with regard to the attendance of Ministers and matters of that sort.  I would suggest to members that as these Standing Orders are not now pressing, because it is probable after to-day we shall not require to meet again until the 2nd or 3rd of January, the consideration of these Orders be held over until we meet again, and in the meantime the Committee should remain in office with the purpose of bringing forward on that day any additional Orders they may think necessary, because, as I have said, undoubtedly additional Orders will have to be framed, and I think it would be more businesslike to make a single job of it.  Therefore I suggest that the consideration of the Report stand over until next meeting.</P>

      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;&ldquo;That the consideration of the Report of the Committee on Standing Orders be adjourned until the next meeting of the Seanad.&rdquo;  It is obvious that this is a matter that will require some little consideration.  The matter is somewhat complicated, and for that reason as much as for the necessity there may be of drafting additional Orders, I think we ought to postpone it.</P>

      <P>I now put the motion:&mdash;&ldquo;That the consideration of the Report of the Committee on Standing Orders be adjourned until after the Christmas Recess.&rdquo;  I have put it in that form because I have just received a communication from the President of the Dáil stating that it is possible he may ask us to meet on Wednesday, and I think it is better that this question should stand over until after the Christmas Recess.</P>
      <P>Question put:&mdash;&ldquo;That the consideration of the Report of the Committee on Standing Orders be adjourned until after the Christmas Recess.</P>

      <P>The next business is the consideration of the Report of the Committee on Articles 21 and 23 of the Constitution, and on suggested appointments and remuneration of officers of the Seanad. This Report I could not possibly allow to come up for discussion in its present form, because the Committee&mdash;perhaps the matter was somewhat rushed upon them, and it was left a little vague&mdash;seem to have completely misconceived the subject matter of the reference, which was not a reference to appoint officers, as the Committee themselves say it was.  I find in their Report that they say:&mdash;&ldquo;The Appointments Committee selected by the Seanad to consider the scale of remunerations of officers and members of the Seanad, and to appoint a Clerk and Deputy Clerk, etc.&rdquo;  There was no such reference.  They were asked to make a Report as to the number of officials that would be required and as to what their duties would be.  The Seanad never delegated to them the appointment of named officials, and to that extent the Report is <i>ultra vires</i> and beyond the terms of reference.  Now, what I would suggest to the Seanad is this.  It is quite obvious that the Committee omitted to consider a great number of matters essential to this official staff. They have to consider and report what <Col N="55" /> their duties should be, what their qualifications should be, what accommodation would be required in the shape of offices, and a variety of matters of that kind, which they entirely omitted to consider.  There is another point I want to impress on the Seanad.  When we get regularly down to our work and begin to introduce legislation members will find that they will want to have at their elbow some official with qualification and training who will be able to frame amendments and explain various provisions and assist them by his advice in drafting amendments and bills.  That is an official who is absolutely essential. We would not be able to get on without him.  The Committee have not considered that.  Therefore I think it would be wise for the Seanad to refer, as in the case of the other Committee, this matter back to the Committee, with a definite reference specifying the subject matters upon which we expect them to report to this House, and to give them the interval between this and the expiration of the Christmas recess to consider and complete the Report, because at present it is practically of no use. All it does is to appoint two named officials, a matter that was not left to them in the reference.</P>

      <P>Might I refer you to your remarks at the time?  You said:&mdash;&ldquo;It is not desirable to have this Committee too large.  I should say at the outset that five or six would be enough.  Probably Senator Moore would be satisfied if the Committee he wishes to set up with regard to officers is embodied in this Committee, which could then deal with the duties of Chairman and Deputy Chairman, the remuneration of members and travelling expenses, and the appointment of officers.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Yes, on the way they are to be appointed and their qualifications, but not the actual appointments. Here is the reference in the official Report, page 45.  It states &ldquo;that a Committee be appointed to consider and report to this Seanad upon the matters contained in Article 21 and Article 23 of the Constitution, and also to report on similar matters in connection with the official staff of the Seanad.&rdquo;  There was never any reference <Col N="56" /> or delegation to appoint officers. There was a delegation to make a recommendation as to what appointment should be made, what the staff should consist of, what their duties should be, and matters of that kind, but it was certainly never contemplated that the Senate would delegate to this Committee the right to appoint officers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>As the person who proposed the motion I am quite willing to accept your ruling on the matter. When I proposed it I confess that my view of the matter was that we were to recommend certain people to act as Clerk and Assistant Clerk.  All the members of the Committee, I think, were under that impression at the time. At the initial stage there was no question raised.  If we were wrong, as apparently we were, I think it would be very much better, as you suggest, to refer the matter back to the Committee. We were very hurried at the time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Seanad appreciates that fact.  You were rushed in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel MOORE Colonel MOORE">
      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>We were rushed even to interview the people we recommended, and we were very much divided on the matter.  It was rather a Majority Report than a universal Report. I think it would be very much better, and I am very pleased it can be arranged in some way so that more deliberation and more care can be given, and we can get a list of candidates and go into the whole question.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the Seanad will understand I am not in the least bit attempting to disparage the names of any persons put forward.  Nothing of that kind is present in my <Col N="57" /> mind, but the matter is one that requires great care, thought and consideration not merely with regard to any one individual, but the entire official staff, as to their qualifications and duties, so I think it is obvious that it will require much greater consideration than it has been able to get.</P>

      <P>I am quite certain that the Committee in this matter acted somewhat under a misapprehension. We did not really bear the exact words of the original motion in mind, and we acted under a certain misconception, but of this I am perfectly certain&mdash;I had the honour of attending two meetings of the Committee, but I was not there the whole time&mdash;no member of the Committee had the least idea of imposing anything upon the Seanad.  We were only to make certain suggestions, and leave it, of course, to the good sense of the Seanad to make its own decisions. As a way out of the difficulty, and to make the matter perfectly plain, I beg to move this:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Report of the Committee be referred back to the Committee to report upon the number, qualifications, duties and remuneration of the official staff of the Seanad and the accommodation required.&rdquo;  Now that we have reached this stage in our operations I would like very much to urge the enlargement of the Committee. It may be remembered that when this matter was first discussed I suggested your name, Sir, and the name of our Deputy Chairman as members of this Committee, and I think we might revert to that original proposition.  Therefore, I would add to the end of my resolution:&mdash;&ldquo;That Lord Glenavy and the Deputy Chairman be added to this Committee.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Lord MAYO</NameTxt>
      <P>Before you put that motion I should like to draw attention to two points you spoke of.  You spoke of an official who was to help us with amendments when legislation was introduced into this Seanad, and also to help in drafting Bills.  That is a most important official, and the words &ldquo;definite reference&rdquo; must, I think, with all due respect to you, Sir, be framed on that definite reference to the Committee. You have referred it&mdash;Senator <Col N="58" /> Sir T. Esmonde's motion is to refer it&mdash;back to the Committee, but they have not a definite reference.  And I should like to have that definite reference, especially with regard to that particular official.  That is a most important item.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>You see, Lord Mayo, this motion of Sir Thomas Esmonde's purposely leaves that open. The proposal includes it in the reference because it is a reference to the Committee to report <i>de novo</i> as to the whole staff, not merely as to this official or that official, but as to the whole staff that they will think requisite, and, of course, one of the matters, I take it, that the Committee will discuss will be whether they may not consider it essential that one of the members of the staff should be a trained expert in the matter of drafting Bills, and report accordingly.  I do not think you want to hamper the Committee more than you have done in this reference, because the reference is as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;To report on the number, qualifications, duties and remuneration of the official staff and the accommodation it will require.&rdquo; I think that covers the entire ground.</P>

      <P>Before you put the motion I wish to say I support it, and I think it would be to the credit of this Assembly if we did send back this Report, because it would not be very creditable, I think, to the common sense or business ability of this Assembly if we were to accept it, for in my opinion, it has been rushed.  It has not got the attention that it deserved.  My name appears as having signed the Report and having been present at the meetings.  I was not present at the meetings, nor did I sign the Report.  I was elected on the Committee, but unfortunately the Commission on Prices was meeting that day, and I, as a member of that Committee was there, and was not able to be present at this meeting. I want to call attention to the fact that my name was signed to the Report, and I am given as attending the meeting.  That is not correct.  I hope the Seanad will unanimously send back this Report to the Committee, so <Col N="59" /> that it will get the attention it deserves, and that we will start to do our business on a business basis, and that we will not be rushing matters.</P>
      <P>Question put:&mdash;&ldquo;That the Report of the Committee be referred back to the Committee to report upon the number, qualifications, duties and remuneration of the official staff of the Seanad and the accomodation which will be required.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>

      <P>I wish to impress upon the members of the Committee the importance of giving attendance.  It is one of the most important things you have to deal with, because the qualifications and skill and extent of your staff will largely control the success of our deliberations; and I hope that the Senators who are nominated upon this Committee will kindly give as much attendance to it as they possibly can.  We will probably meet on three or four occasions between this and the expiration of the Christmas recess, and the members will get timely notice.  I will try to consult their convenience both as to the dates and the hours.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">
      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, you see, Sir, that is a matter on which I think there is a little confusion. The Seanad has nothing to do with the Government; we cannot call upon the services of officials of the Government.  This Seanad has nothing to do with the Government in that sense; it is independent of and outside it; it is a House of its own. Under the Constitution it has got to appoint its own staff.  The Government, of course, have got expert officials at their elbow, legal and others, in all of these matters to advise them, but we have no right to call upon them to advise the members of our House, and this is a matter that the Committee will have fully to consider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelODea" hpid="Mr. O'DEA Mr. O'DEA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'DEA</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I put the question is this, that it may be very <Col N="60" /> difficult to get the services of a competent Clerk who will be conversant with the drafting of Parliamentary Bills. Such a person may be found; I do not know whether it is possible in Dublin to find anyone, but I think it will be difficult to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="AN CATHAOIRLEACH AN CATHAOIRLEACH">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelODea" hpid="Mr. O'DEA Mr. O'DEA">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'DEA</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be the means of crushing out an otherwise very suitable person if the Government draftsman was available for this Seanad.  I do not see why we should make it a test question with regard to the appointment of a Clerk.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>You cannot have the Government draftsman here during your discussions, because he will be in the other House.  We will want a draftsman who will be present when we are discussing Bills which are sent up to us or Bills which we originate in our own House.  It is not due to want of respect for the members of the Senate when I say that the majority of them have not any technical training in matters of this kind, and when they come to draft Bills and amendments they will find it essential to have at their command some gentleman of experience and training who can guide them in the matter.  But all that will be considered by the Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>AN CATHAOIRLEACH</NameTxt>
      <P>The next business on the Agenda is the Adaptation of Enactments Bill, which has been sent up from the other House.  I had intended to suggest to the Senate that in view of the technical nature of these Bills, both of which are very urgent, and deal with matters which require prompt and <Col N="61" /> immediate attention, and at the same time are of a complicated and technical character&mdash;having regard to the position in which we find ourselves, that a proper and a graceful act on the part of the Seanad would be to allow these two Bills to go through without discussion. The members of the Seanad are not in a position to discuss them.  For myself, I only saw them for the first time about an hour ago, and I expect the members of the Seanad are in the same position.  They are technical matters that really do not directly concern this House, and they are at the same time matters of procedure which require, as I have said, immediate legislation in order to enable the machinery of the Government to be carried on.  I therefore suggest to the Seanad that, having regard to the emergency connected with these Bills, it would be a gracious act on our part to suspend the Standing Orders and put these two Bills through without delay.  I find, however, that we cannot yet do that with the first one, the Adaptation of Enactments Bill, because I have just received an intimation that the Government wish to make one amendment in it, and as we will have to meet again on Wednesday probably the wisest course to adopt with regard to that Bill would be to adjourn its consideration until Wednesday, when the Minister will be present and will move his amendment.  If that is the wish of the Seanad then we can pass on from that first Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasEsmondeBart" hpid="Sir T. ESMONDE Sir T. ESMONDE">
      <NameTxt>Sir T. ESMONDE</NameTxt>
      <P>Then, Sir, the thing to do would be to move that consideration of the Adaptation of Enactments Bill be adjourned until Wednesday next.  Of course, if the Government really wanted to make any amendment in this Bill all they had to do was to send up their amendment, and somebody here could be put on to this matter for them.  However, that is a matter for themselves.</P>

      <P>Do you think that, having regard to the fact that we propose to pass these two particular Bills through without amendment, save in so far as the Government may wish them to be amended, would it not be a simpler course to suspend the Standing Orders in respect of both of them, and pass them through without amendment or <Col N="62" /> discussion, save in so far as the Government amendment applies?  I think it a more businesslike proposition than to go through the formality of a First and Second Reading and a Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I do not know.  It will be purely a formal matter, because it is some defect the Government has found in one clause. We may pass it over, because the Government may come in a little later and move their amendment.  I only mention Wednesday because they may require us to meet again on that day.</P>

      <P>The other Bill cannot take effect or be considered until the Adaptation of Enactments Bill is passed; so that if we adjourn one we have got to adjourn both.  I have sent over to find out if it could be possible for any Minister to attend here this afternoon.  We could then get the amendment and move it.  If it is the wish of the Seanad we will pass over the consideration of these two Bills on the Agenda for the moment.  The next business is a motion by Senator Moore.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel MOORE</NameTxt>
      <P>My object in bringing this proposal before the Seanad, is that all Senators may be given some special work to engage their minds, and that whatever subject may be brought before us there will be a certain number of persons fully qualified, by previous study, to discuss it.  I beg to move:&mdash;&ldquo;That, as Seanad Eireann is in the peculiar position of having no Ministers, it will be in the interest of business for Committees to be appointed to study and report to the Seanad on the following subjects:&mdash;Industry and Commerce, Finance, Home Affairs, Foreign Affairs, Fisheries and Agriculture, Education and Local Government.&rdquo;  You see, I am, to a certain extent, following the particular Ministries.  I have made a mistake by the omission of a couple, and I would like to have those added; they are <Col N="63" /> Labour, which is a very important one; Fine Arts, which I think is also very important, and another is Defence. There is an immense mass of legislative work before the Oireachtas, generally described as reconstruction.  However well qualified the Government or An Dáil may be, it would be very difficult to find time to think out and work out the mass of details involved.  It ought to be our duty, in consultation with the Government, to lay the basis for a number of Bills, small or large, that may eventually come before the Oireachtas. In this way we shall be able to give great assistance in the legislative projects that may be before us.  I have spoken of this matter privately to some Senators, and it seemed to receive such commendation from them that I hope the proposal in some form or other will be accepted by all.  With regard to the method by which these Committees may be got together, I suggest that an organising committee be now appointed for the purpose.  It occurs to me that it should be composed of one Senator for each of the Committees named,' and that the person most closely connected with the class of work of that committee be chosen.  I put the following list forward for consideration, but it must be understood that the names in the list I put forward will be merely an organising committee, one for each of these committees that I have named.  It will take some little time before this can be done.  It cannot very well be done within the next few days. These people named could go round and consult the wishes of the different Senators as to what Committee they would like to serve on, and get the names together. They could meet again and make proper arrangements.  I suggest the following list for an organising committee: Senator Andrew Jameson, Sir John Griffith, Sir John Keane, Colonel Maurice Moore, Senator Butler, Mrs. Costelloe, Senator Yeats, Senator Farren (or some other Labour member), Sir Bryan Mahon.  Each of these could take one particular subject and arrange a committee of members.  For instance, Senator Jameson might arrange a Finance Committee, and so on.  Senator Yeats could arrange a Committee on Fine Arts.  For Agriculture and Fisheries we might have Senator Butler; Home and Foreign Affairs, Sir John Keane; <Col N="64" /> Industry and Commerce, Sir John Griffith and Mr. Goodbody; Education, Mrs. Costelloe; Defence, Sir Bryan Mahon. It will be the duty of the Organising Committee to enquire into the wishes of the Seanad and arrange the Senators into the most suitable committees.  I propose that motion.</P>

      <P>May I suggest to Senator Moore that it would be desirable to withdraw the motion.  Personally I have a good deal of sympathy with him, but I do not agree with him as to the exact form, and I should very much like to see members of the Seanad consider the whole question as to what committees should be appointed, and the possibility of effective joint committees with the other House.  We have no right to appoint such committees, but it is quite possible by mutual agreement it might be arranged, and it might be very much more powerful in many matters. I do not suggest that we should adjourn this generally as though we disapproved of it, but I think it would be wise to defer it a little further, and for that reason I suggest it be postponed.</P>

      <P>I am quite willing to do what is suggested.  My view was that in some of these matters, for instance finance, it would be a good thing to have a joint committee of the two Houses.  My idea was that these Committees when once formed might get into touch with the Ministry, or members of the other House.  If both sides agree to Committees of that sort, they might get outside help or specialists to advise <Col N="65" /> them.  It would be well that members of this Seanad, instead of going back to their homes without anything to do, perhaps for the next week or fortnight, should, instead of waiting for instructions to be put before them, form a number of different bodies of this Seanad for special work which they could study, so that they could come back and be in a position when a Bill is proposed to give us some advice as to what the heads of the Bills should be and so forth.  I think one of the Senators who has spoken seems to have misunderstood the motion.  It was merely a suggestion that those people I have mentioned should organise different Committees, not that they should form Committees themselves, but that each one should organise the Committee to which their names are attached, but if it is thought desirable to postpone the matter, and have a general talk on the question afterwards, I am perfectly willing to agree.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Seanad is very grateful to Senator Moore.  I think there was much that is very helpful in his suggestion, but at the same time I think it better that the matter should be considered as a whole rather than taken piecemeal.  When we meet again after the recess, we will have the benefit of his views before us, and I am quite sure we will be able to utilise them and produce a good general scheme.</P>

If it is the wish of the Seanad to fall in with the suggestion I made, namely, instead of going through the tedious formality of all the stages of a Bill, that we do not intend to discuss or amend, save in so far as one amendment goes, the wisest and best course would be to suspend our Standing Orders and for some Senator to move the amendment first, and then move that the Bill as amended do pass this Seanad.</P>

      <P>I want to say this.  I am conscious in asking the Seanad to take the step they are taking that it is an unusual one, and one that is not to be treated as a precedent, but we are sitting under unusual conditions.  We have no staff as yet, we have no offices, and we have nobody to refer to in connection with these Bills.  It is impossible for us to discuss them.  If they were Bills that could afford to wait I should never think of asking the Seanad to rush them through in this way, but having regard to our peculiar position and that for the next fortnight we will not have the machinery that will enable us to deal with these, and as these two Bills are of pressing emergency, I ask this Seanad to make a departure from precedent, but I think it is not one that deserves repetition.</P>

I can tell you what in effect it means, <Col N="67" /> but I am not an authority upon it.  I have no right to pledge the Government to what it means.  I can only give you my construction of it if you care to have it.  Under the laws existing prior to the establishment of the Free State, in many Acts of Parliament provision was made that certain things were to be done by Order of the King in Council, or by Order of the Privy Council, or they named individuals.  It is to provide a substitute for that, to meet the altered conditions in this country that the change proposed becomes necessary. The proposed change is this that instead of these things being done as heretofore by an Order of His Majesty in Council or by His Majesty's Council they should be done by Order of the Governor-General with the consent of the Executive Council of the Free State Government. That is the whole thing.</P>

      <P>I was going to suggest that after the word &ldquo;Executive&rdquo; in Clause 18&mdash;&ldquo;Every Order made by the Executive Council under this Act&rdquo;&mdash; that there be an addition relating to any regulation made by the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance has power to make regulations that are very important.  If it is necessary that those orders are to be left on the Table for 21 days, when they are made by the Executive Council, it appears to me that they should also be laid on the Table for 21 days when they are made by the Minister for Finance.  I have no technical <Col N="68" /> knowledge of these Acts of Parliament. Still, I believe that it would be necessary that the regulations made by the Minister for Finance should be left on the Table. We have had this Bill in our hands since Saturday.  As to what appears to be an omission from Clause 18, it seems that an order made by the Minister for Finance is just as important as an order made by the Executive Council.  I will move an amendment to that effect.</P>

      <P>If you will take a suggestion from me, I would recommend you not to move it.  In the first place, it might involve delay and difficulty in what is called the recommitting of this Bill.  Apart from that, this is not a matter that has been overlooked.  The Dáil may have thought there was a real distinction; there is an obvious distinction between an Order of the Executive Council, which is much higher and more serious than the Order made merely by one Minister.  They may have thought it necessary that the Orders of the Executive Council should remain on the Table before they are operative, but that that should not apply to the Orders of a single Minister.  I am quite sure they had some good reason of their own in making the distinction.  I do not think it is an oversight.  At the same time the attention of the Dáil will be called to this, and when it goes back to them they can insert the amendment, and the fact that you have drawn attention to it will be present in their minds.  If they consider you have put your finger on a blot they will remedy it.</P>

      <P>Section 12 is in connection with the orders of the Minister for Finance to make regulations in connection with Customs Duties, and so on.  I only received this Act of Parliament, for I may now call it an Act of Parliament, three quarters of an hour ago, and I did not have time to go very closely into it.  But I think the Senator is quite safe in accepting your suggestion.  Presumably the action of the Minister for <Col N="69" /> Finance, in connection with any Customs Regulation will be made with the authority of the Executive and with the approval of the Executive, and will be discussed and determined beforehand. Therefore, we might be fairly safe in taking it that no Regulation will be made other than Regulations the object of which the Dáil and the Ministry have discussed and debated and agreed upon beforehand.  I imagine you are quite safe in leaving it as it stands.</P>

I only suggest that it is quite possible that an adaptation or modification made suitable to England might not possibly be suitable to Ireland, and to allow that to be read into the Act would seem to me to be unwise.  If you think there is anything in it I am sure you will suggest it to the Government.</P>

It is quite natural he should have put this down in its existing form, but if he looks at the Standing Orders, under which we are at present working, he will find that a Standing Order has been expressly framed to avoid discussions of what I may call a barren nature &mdash;discussions on things that lead to nothing. In other words, he will find a Standing Order which provides that every motion must take the form of a resolution, and it must ask the Seanad to resolve something.  It is not to be merely sterile, and it is not to call for a mere expression of views; it is to ask the Seanad to take action in some respect. That is the object of that Standing Order, and as long as we have that, this motion of Colonel Moore's contravenes it.  It does not ask for any action, or suggest the passing of any resolution.  It simply says he wishes to call attention to certain things.</P>
