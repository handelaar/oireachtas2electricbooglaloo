	<P>I have received notice from Senator O&rsquo;Toole that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">Recognising the difficulties currently being experienced by the children of St. Dymphna&rsquo;s and St. Nicholas&rsquo;s special schools in Ballina, County Mayo, due to the lack of progress in the new school building plan, the need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline the timescale for the implementation of the building plan for a new school to house these two special needs schools.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I regard the matter raised by Senator O&rsquo;Toole as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Leader agree that, in light of the extraordinary developments we have witnessed in the past five to six days in respect of the peace process, a strong message of support should be sent from this House to members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for their sterling investigative work during the past weeks and months? While everyone regrets that North-South co-operation, as outlined in the Good Friday Agreement, is not as it should be, it is welcome that there is now exceptional co-operation between the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Does the Leader also agree that it is time politicians in this country spoke with one voice in respect of the remaining issues from the peace process which must be resolved and the need to bring about an end to criminality in this country and on this island forever?</P>
      <P>We must also state with one voice that money laundering, summary executions, racketeering, surveillance and all of the apparatus of a paramilitary political party will not be tolerated in a free society. I make these points as a means to highlight the support on this side of the House for the various institutions of this State which must do their jobs. No politician on this or the other side of the House has a right to stand in the way of the Garda in its investigations or in bringing about prosecutions where evidence exists to pursue such prosecutions.</P>
      <P>I regret the difference between the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in respect of the question of who may or may not be members of the army council. While that is an important issue, we need to go beyond it and work out a strategy which will ensure that democratically-elected parties can take their seats on the Executive in Northern Ireland and that everyone&rsquo;s voice in that jurisdiction will be listened to and respected. I hope that, in the current vacuum, there will be space to bring about a situation where all parties will at least come together and meet on a regular basis. As I said two weeks ago, the way that could be done is through the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation and I ask the Government to consider that proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I also ask the Leader to extend the House&rsquo;s congratulations to Commissioner Noel Conroy for the extraordinary work he has done. I recall saying on the occasion of his <Col N="775"/>appointment that he would do us proud. His record is substantial, both on the ground and in management, and he has proved himself over the past while.</P>
      <P>We had a debate on Northern Ireland a couple of weeks ago. One of the issues that arose then was the shape of political reality for the future. The only difference of opinion that emerged was whether it would be a year, two years or more than four years before any political progress was made. The events that have occurred in the meantime have clearly set back the likelihood of political progress. I would like another debate immediately on the Northern Ireland situation, but it should not be about Sinn F&eacute;in or the IRA, or even the rights or wrongs of democracy. It is clear we are all in agreement on these matters. The Government has acted well and correctly in this regard.</P>
      <P>I would like to hear proposals from Members of the House as regards how the peace process can be moved on to the next stage. I do not believe that to bring back the forum, which I support, will create the required political initiative. As I have said previously, the only way to create the political initiative is to deepen community involvement, North-South and east-west. New issues must be examined that politicians can become involved with, such as economic, social and professional issues as well as issues of disadvantage, so we can find out how processes and approaches on both islands may be merged and maintained. This is the way forward.</P>
      <P>More than anything else I want a debate on these issues where Members are confined in their speeches to proposals and no one repeats what he or she previously said. The newspapers have been tedious over the past few days. It is the same story over and over. It is important that these matters are reported, but I want to hear what proposals Members have. We are elected public representatives and everybody should have some idea on how to move matters forward. Senator Brian Hayes has suggested we begin by bringing back the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. That is a positive suggestion, but we have to look way beyond that move. No progress will be made if it is kept only at the level of elected politicians. Elected representatives have to do the talking, create a direction and make it happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree we need to look at the mechanism for establishing a new context for the peace process in Northern Ireland. It is our duty as Members of the Oireachtas to look at how that context may be created and the mechanism. I do not know what that mechanism could be but it is important that we start to look for it quickly. In line with this, we should ask the leadership of Sinn F&eacute;in, which has appeared to indicate a level of leadership and commitment to the peace process in recent years, to state its position in this regard. What does this commitment look like and what will it be in the future? I spoke to a member <Col N="776"/>of Sinn F&eacute;in in Nenagh over the weekend, who is involved in democratic politics in the town, and he said he was devastated by what has emerged in recent weeks. I asked him, as I would any member of his party, who runs Sinn F&eacute;in. Do the hard men run the party? We are at a crossroads and it is time for the Sinn F&eacute;in leadership to declare its commitment to the peace process and also to indicate who owns it.</P>
      <P>For our part, ownership of the peace process from the nation&rsquo;s viewpoint must be based on democracy and the rule of law. What has been emerging, however, is a secret world of illegality and criminality that has gone on for far too long and the extent of which has shocked and horrified many people. That must end. This is an opportunity to end it, but what must happen is for the leadership of Sinn F&eacute;in to declare it over, once and for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>I too wish to be associated with the praise for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the sterling work it has done in uncovering a great deal of activity that we have been invited to close our eyes to over a number of years and to believe the collective lie that such actions were not occurring. The suggestion that we take the easy option this time and do not spell out where we wish to go is wrong. The Good Friday Agreement is the only peace process that I know, which was endorsed by an overwhelming majority of the people of this island. It is not the peace process of Sinn F&eacute;in or of any other party. We must ensure that the Agreement is protected and I would like to compliment our senior Ministers and the Taoiseach on the work they have been doing to ensure that criminality will be brought to an end. After a ten year peace process and over six years since the Good Friday Agreement, it is unfortunate that we have come to the stage where the English language has been debased. It is only now we are uncovering the seedy developments of Sinn F&eacute;in. It is as if some people do not want to accept what is going on. For the past number of months, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Government have been asked to put up or shut up. Over recent weeks, money laundering activities have been uncovered and people still refuse to accept that Sinn F&eacute;in might be involved. It is quite simple &mdash; the emperor no longer has any clothes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>As Senator Brian Hayes has just said, there have been extraordinary developments since we were last here. We congratulate the garda&iacute; on their successes and wish them well in the ongoing investigations being conducted. It is important that we not only speak with one voice, but that the Government also does the same. I would like to hear the Leader on this issue. The Taoiseach said that there is no firm proof. We all accept that believing something and hard evidence are two different things. That is for the garda&iacute; to decide and we know they are doing their best. At the same time, the Minister for <Col N="777"/>Justice, Equality and Law Reform has said he is absolutely confident in his assertions, while the Minister for Foreign Affairs said these are not issues that should be vented in public. Following today&rsquo;s Cabinet meeting, I hope the Government will be able to speak with one voice. I strongly support the request by Senator Brian Hayes that the Government re-establish the forum. We can only go forward on an all-inclusive basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon"><NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
	<P>Following the visit by President Bush to Europe this week, I ask the Leader to organise a debate on the defence implications of the new Europe, its alliance with NATO and so on. I have my own views on this while others have different views, but it would be timely to have this debate before we discuss the new constitution.</P>
      <P>I would like to comment on the ongoing IRA activity, which we all abhor. At one level, perhaps one could understand why this organisation came into being, but not why it continues. It seems to be fostered by the reluctance of the British authorities to co-operate on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. We also see the same with the Pat Finucane case, which is another case of obfuscation. I call on the British authorities to co-operate in both of these investigations. By doing so, we remove a reason for the IRA to continue to exist. That is very important to all of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with others in saying how pleasant it is to have the Cathaoirleach back restored to full health. I reassure him that the shop was well minded by his deputies in his absence. I would not like him to think that things were out of control. He is not completely irreplaceable, except in human terms. I join with my colleagues in their views on the current difficult situation in Northern Ireland. This is where one ends up if one believes in the combined strategy of the armalite and the ballot box. It is now make your mind up time. It is either the armalite or the ballot box; people cannot have it both ways although they are attempting to do so. It is leading them into very dangerous areas. An overwhelming body of circumstantial evidence suggests there is a very serious and growing involvement by the IRA in criminality. I have been saying as much for quite a number of years and have drawn a parallel with the Mafia and Camorra, both of which began as organisations to protect the oppressed from landlords and other rapacious members of society. Gradually, they evolved into total criminality including drugs, extortion and prostitution, which we are now seeing here.</P>
      <P>Among the most sinister things I have read was of the visit to Bulgaria to meet with crime syndicates there. What does the involvement of such people in drug and people trafficking say about the human rights aspect of Sinn F&eacute;in and IRA policy? It is very dangerous and unpleasant water to get into. I am very proud of the way the Garda unearthed this mess and I hope the Criminal Assets Bureau will be brought into the investi<Col N="778"/>gation. There are pubs and businesses all over Dublin which everyone knows and which were very suddenly acquired by people of unexplained wealth from very ordinary backgrounds. Everyone seems to know it is the result of IRA money but we should find out for certain by supporting CAB investigations.</P>
      <P>It is a pity to take up entrenched attitudes. Punishment beatings are not just a republican phenomenon, but exist in the Unionist community also and are the result of inadequate policing. There must be movement on policing. It is also dangerous to take up entrenched attitudes. I have just been listening to Joe Duffy&rsquo;s radio programme on which a Sinn F&eacute;in supporter was asked about the current mess and recent series of incidents. The first thing he said was, &ldquo;I think the British and Irish Governments are a disgrace.&rdquo; I do not know how he reached that conclusion from the initial starting point.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Senator Wilson who, with others, organised a concert for the Irish homeless in London, which was most moving. I acknowledge also the involvement of Senators Mooney and &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and many others. It would be useful to have a debate on this subject to encourage the Government to act further. When one of the centres for the homeless in London was in difficulty, the Government stepped in. It has appointed two officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs to address the matter, which is very important. In a period of prosperity, we cannot abandon those who went to England with high hopes. Perhaps they were disappointed and after working very hard could not come home as they had not been as successful as they thought they would be.</P>
      <P>Can the House be provided with a report on the metro? We are receiving confused signals. A report would be very helpful especially in view of the difficulties being encountered, as some of us prophesied, with the Luas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>From the beginning, the peace process was built on first constructing a democratic, Nationalist consensus into which people would buy and then a democratic consensus involving both Unionists and Nationalists. There is complete unity in Government, this House and, with very few exceptions, the D&aacute;il as to what an exclusive commitment to peace and democracy involves. While there are many useful suggestions which can no doubt be made as to how one might progress with politics, we should not allow ourselves to be distracted by side issues. The overwhelming priority and need is to ensure that everybody who will play a part in the peace process and, at some future date, Government North and South, signs up to and shares the same understanding of an exclusive commitment to peace and democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>With the indulgence of the Cathaoirleach, I take the opportunity to apologise for the words I used during the debate on the Civil Part<Col N="779"/>nership Bill last week. It was never my intention to offend anybody through the use of the word &ldquo;homophobic&rdquo; and I apologise sincerely to anyone I offended and hurt. I express my sincere apologies for the hurt and offence caused by the word. However, it was never intended to target any person or group of people. I hope my apology is accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon"><NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>Thank you. With regard to the Order of Business, I would like to draw Members&rsquo; attention to the media campaign, End the Silence, which began yesterday and which deals with domestic violence. The campaign will highlight the level of domestic violence in this country. According to Women&rsquo;s Aid, 107 women have been murdered since 1996, 69 of those in their own homes. We have a very serious problem with regard to domestic violence and I welcome this media campaign which will hopefully encourage women to come forward and seek help if they are living in situations of domestic violence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>In the past two weeks, Geraldine Finucane travelled to England seeking justice for her murdered husband, the Northern Ireland solicitor Pat Finucane. Judge Cory examined this case and found evidence that the RUC Special Branch, MI5 and the British Army force research unit all colluded in his murder. The Finucane family were given an undertaking that there would be a full and transparent inquiry, but this is now to change. Legislation being brought through Parliament will place restrictions on that inquiry to the extent that evidence cannot be published and public involvement will also be limited.</P>
      <P>It is particularly important that we support the Finucane family at this time. It makes one feel particularly uneasy when such action is taken in consort with the non-co-operation of the British Government with regard to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. It is no less reprehensible coming from a sovereign government.</P>
      <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole, O&rsquo;Meara and Mansergh have all struck the right note today about moving forward. Senator O&rsquo;Toole said a time should come when we as parliamentarians should get involved in this discussion and try to find a way forward. Perhaps the time has come for a commission for truth and justice as we have seen in other areas of conflict in the world. We should no longer leave it to the media. Truth and justice are required. I agree we need truth from all sides, and there is unanimity on that issue. It would not be premature to invite the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to the House to debate the issue with us so that we in this House, and hopefully those in the other House, would take ownership of this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Brian Hayes and others welcomed the enhanced co-operation between the <Col N="780"/>Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI, which was marked yesterday by the signing of an agreement between the two police forces. There is a far more accountable police service in Northern Ireland thanks to the implementation of the Patten report. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill 2004, currently before the D&aacute;il, has taken account of some of the Northern Ireland measures. However, the Minister has not taken account of the most radical measure, namely, that there is an independent policing board in the North with democratic representation that oversees the police force, decides matters of strategy, and so on. The next meeting of the board will be held on 2 March in Belfast and members of the public can go along and watch democracy being implemented with regard to their police force. That is the most important measure in the Patten report and we need it here.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris commended the work of individuals in Fianna F&aacute;il with regard to charity fundraising for homeless Irish emigrants in the UK. That should not permit Fianna F&aacute;il to hide from the fact that the Government has not kept to the recommendations of its own task force on funding for organisations working with homeless Irish emigrants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to be associated with the remarks made by Senator Mansergh. I also concur with the many Members who have spoken in support of the Garda Commissioner and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell. Too often, we tend to criticise Ministers when something is not working out but great credit is due for the work they have done.</P>
      <P>Members of Sinn F&eacute;in who have been involved in local organisations over the years were seen as whiter than white, while concurrently at night-time they moved many gangsters around the country who were murdering and robbing in the name of republicanism. It is wrong and they are now being seen for what they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Like other Members, I am delighted to see you back in the Chair today in good health, a Chathaoirligh. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the House for a debate on why the Government axed grants for householders to engage contractors to remove radon gas. The procedure costs from &euro;3,000 to &euro;5,000. The grants that were made available in the past helped to save many lives. A survey published in today&rsquo;s national newspapers reveals that over 250,000 people are at high risk from radon gas, which affects some 91,000 homes. A kit, which costs &euro;45, is available from the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland to test one&rsquo;s home for the presence of radon gas. In the interests of safety, we should encourage householders to avail of that kit. Approximately 200 people die each year as a result of lung cancer so it is important that the House debates this matter in the near future. People throughout the country are at risk <Col N="781"/>from radon gas so this time bomb should be eliminated as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to see you back, a Chathaoirligh, and I wish you well. I compliment the Government and the Garda Commissioner on the fine investigative work undertaken by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, not today or yesterday but over the past months, in achieving what has occurred in the past couple of weeks.</P>
      <P>Many Senators have asked how we can advance the matter further. I would like the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation to be reconvened as a platform for reflecting many views. The Northern Ireland issue is being discussed not only in the Oireachtas, but also by the public. It is timely to continue such discussions so that everyone is aware of what is happening. I ask the Leader to convey to the Government the desire of the House to reconvene the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation in order to continue the ongoing process of reflection.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Terry&rsquo;s call for a debate on domestic violence, an issue which has received wide coverage in the news media in recent weeks. Such a debate would be timely in order to focus on this serious and frightening issue. How many young women lose their lives as a result of domestic violence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The time allocated for the Order of Business is drawing to a close and four more Senators are offering. I will accommodate those four Senators. I ask them to be brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure Senators will be aware of the dreadful event which occurred in Mayo at the weekend where the body of a newborn baby was found by children. Some very ill-informed comment was made in the press by people who should have known better about single mothers and their children. Many Senators deplore what was said. The Leader of the House has been very good in providing time for debates which I have sought recently. I call for a debate on the Crisis Pregnancy Agency report of last year, which we never got around to debating. We might be able to think of some useful propositions to make to Government. Unfortunately, newborn children both alive and dead are still being found every few months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Glacaim leis an &ldquo;F&aacute;ilte romhat ar ais&rdquo; freisin.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Bannon&rsquo;s call for funding to tackle the radon gas problem. Radon is a carcinogen and many areas throughout the country have serious levels of it. The incentives and inducements that previously existed to encourage people to do the test were of benefit and should be reintroduced.</P>
      <P>I concur with many of the comments made about the current state of the peace process, in particular with what was said by Senator &Oacute;<?oasys [jy?>Murch&uacute;. It is very important that the British <Col N="782"/>Government gets into the frame of mind where it fully co-operates with the inquiries established here. An independent judge of international stature &mdash; Judge Cory &mdash; recommended that there should be a public inquiry into the killing of Pat Finucane and it is incumbent on the British Government to fully co-operate with those inquiries. Unfortunately, its failure to do so weakens its credibility, and that of other parties, as well as its call to induce others to fully subscribe to and embrace their obligations under the Agreement. Co-operation is a two-way street and I do not see evidence that it is forthcoming from the British Government, which is regrettable. The House should debate the matter at an early stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with most of the comments made by other Senators about the Northern peace process. I call on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to publish information available to him to remove any lingering public doubts. The public are cynical and sceptical and we need to remove any such thoughts from their minds. It is very important that we publish the facts and let the public make up their own minds.</P>
      <P>I have lost confidence in the Government in regard to the Northern peace process. This dates back to over a year ago when the SDLP was excluded from vital talks by the Taoiseach. The middle ground parties have been squeezed out at the expense of the peace process. A few weeks before Christmas the Taoiseach spoke about releasing the killers of Jerry McCabe and the Minister for Foreign Affairs discussed going into coalition with Sinn F&eacute;in. We now discover that major money laundering and other illegal activities are taking place. Surveillance of Members of the Oireachtas is also a most worrying development which concerns all of us in the House. We need to have all the facts put before us so we can make up our minds.</P>
      <P>I agree with the call for the setting up of a truth and reconciliation forum. That would be an important step as there is truth on both sides. It is also important to acknowledge that people in MI5 and the secret service saved many lives, Catholic, Nationalist and Unionist. We should recognise the work they have done in advancing the Northern peace process to the stage where it is today. We must look at the full picture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Cathaoirleach is welcome back hale and hearty.</P>
      <P>I too share the calls for a debate on the peace process. At this stage it is apparent that Sinn F&eacute;in is not prepared to leave behind people who continue to carry out murder or other criminal acts. It is incredible that its members can continue with the peace process on the one hand and criminality on the other hand. They have a responsibility to the republican electorate they represent to leave the criminals behind. This money has become rotten and useless because it is now no more than biodegradable fuel. The money has placed the <Col N="783"/>peace process at risk and the movement is now reaping the whirlwind. It is time for it to disengage from the criminals because its members have a great responsibility to this nation and they must do so now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Lest I be out of step with other Senators, I am also glad to see that the Cathaoirleach has returned to the House.</P>
      <P>Senator Brian Hayes raised the House&rsquo;s appreciation of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Garda Commissioner, Noel Conroy. He particularly referred to the sterling North-South work in which the PSNI and Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are engaged. In an odd way, it is sad that it is this area of North-South co-operation which is flourishing. The two forces signed agreements yesterday which follow up on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Police Co-operation) Act which came before this House in 2003 but I am sure they also used the opportunity to talk over the matters at hand.</P>
      <P>The Senator asked that all of us support the institutions of the State. He also suggested that we should avoid the blame-game, with which I agree. The whole unfolding saga is like a Jeffrey Archer novel, about which one might gasp at reading, but this drama is being played out in front of us and it is appalling. People wonder what they will hear on the radio when they wake up in the morning. I strongly commend the bipartisan approach taken by the Fine Gael and Labour Party leaders. I heard Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s comments this morning and thought them extremely helpful.</P>
      <P>Senator Brian Hayes also asked about the reconvening of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, a point he raised last week. I mentioned the Senator&rsquo;s suggestion to the Taoiseach when I met him on other matters the evening the Senator raised it. It is one of the options being considered and it would be helpful if the forum was reconvened.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole also applauded the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as did other Senators even if they did not say so. The Senator asked that, if we have a debate on this matter, we should not go into the &ldquo;who said what to whom and when&rdquo; issues but rather examine how the House can work to develop and strengthen the North-South and east-west relationships and make proposals thereon.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Meara stated that we have to establish a new context for peace and ask who owns it. The people own the peace because they voted for it. She also stated that democracy and the rule of law should win the day, with which I agree. Senator Morrissey also praised the Garda and congratulated senior Ministers and the Taoiseach. Senator Coghlan stated that the Government must speak with one voice. However, I believe it is doing so, although different ways to express points of view are used by different personalities. It is necessary that these different emphases are <Col N="784"/>used by personalities according to their calling rather than everyone using the same sentence.</P>
      <P>Senator Lydon requested a debate on the defence implications of a new Europe. He also raised the reluctance of the UK Government to co-operate in matters which affect it, a point echoed by Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;. There are inquiries which could be set up by the Irish Government but which require the co-operation of the UK authorities, which is a very important point. Senator Norris raised the issue of organised crime links to Bulgaria and praised the work of the CAB. He also praised Senator Wilson for helping to organise a conference on Irish homeless people in the UK. I also congratulate the Senator for that important work.</P>
      <P>Senator Mansergh referred to the peace process as being built on a democratic consensus and pointed out that we must ensure everyone is included. That is the point; no matter what is happening, the end for which we all crave will not come if we do not include everyone. It is hard to envisage that now but the Taoiseach says so all the time.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Terry for her apology, which I fully accept. On the day she made her point in the House, I stated that I hoped she did not mean what she said. The Senator raised the issue of domestic violence, the End the Silence campaign and the fact that 69 people have been murdered in their homes in the past few years. We will seek to have a debate on the issue.</P>
      <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; referred to the Finucane case and the fact that there was to be a full and open inquiry into it but that hindrances had now been put on it through legislation. I accept the Senator&rsquo;s point that the British Parliament should be forthcoming in reciprocating with this Parliament on these matters. Both are sovereign Governments and we need whatever evidence the British Government might have to ensure it is a complete inquiry.</P>
      <P>Senator Tuffy mentioned the enhanced co-operation between the PSNI and the Garda and referred to the meeting of the policing board in Northern Ireland which will be held in Belfast in early March and which will be open to the public. She said we should have the same in this jurisdiction. She also mentioned the task force on emigrants. The former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, had incrementally begun to implement some of the recommendations. I am sure the current Minister will do the same. It is sad and thought provoking to listen to their voices as they tell their tales of years and decades of silence and neglect. These people left because there was no future for them here.</P>
      <P>Senator Moylan praised the Garda and the Minister and put the blame squarely where he believes it should lie. Senator Bannon raised the issue of radon gas in the environment. We heard an horrific statistic about that on the radio this morning. I am not attempting to be simplistic but it is said that the best remedy for this problem is for people to open the windows of their houses, <Col N="785"/>although it has been a little cold lately to have the windows open.</P>
      <P>Senator Ormonde complimented the Government and the Garda. She wondered how to proceed with the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. She also supported Senator Terry&rsquo;s call for a debate on domestic violence. Senator Henry referred to the Mayo baby. It is so sad; the post mortem showed that it was a newborn. It is sad that the mother should feel she had to do that, given that she had seen the baby. The Senator asked for a debate on the crisis pregnancy report. It would be helpful to have such a debate and I will try to arrange it.</P>
      <P>Senator Jim Walsh asked about funding to deal with radon gas. He also said the British Government should co-operate with the various inquiries being held here. It is vital that it give whatever information it has. It would be most helpful because people would feel that what we are saying and doing in that regard is important. Senator Browne said the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, should put the facts before the public. It is often not proper to do that; sometimes it is not the right thing to do in circumstances where there are ongoing developments. I believe that is the reason for it.</P>
      <P>Senator Hanafin also raised the peace process and expressed the wish that proposals be brought forward which would lead to helpful stages being implemented.</P>

	<P>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas le Ceannaire an T&iacute; as ucht an chuiridh theacht anseo chun labhairt ar an tuarasc&aacute;il f&iacute;or-th&aacute;bhactach seo faoi thodhcha&iacute; oideachais ag an tri&uacute; leibh&eacute;al d&oacute;ibh si&uacute;d a bheidh <Col N="786"/>ag freastal ag na hollscoileanna agus ag na hinstiti&uacute;da&iacute;. It is an important time to discuss the OECD examiner&rsquo;s report. I know several Members will have a particular interest in the recommendations made and how they can be progressed and, in the first instance, finding with which recommendations they agree. I look forward to the contributions of Members, which will enable me to give further consideration to the report.</P>
      <P>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has a long and productive history of engagement with the Irish education system. I need only remind the House of its involvement in the 1966 report on investment in education. This landmark report not only provided the rationale for the creation of free secondary education but also fed into the deliberations of the Commission on Higher Education, which, in turn, led to the creation of the Higher Education Authority. Another OECD study, on technician training in Ireland, led to the establishment of the regional technical colleges, now the institutes of technology. These structures have been the foundation on which we have built our economic and social progress in the past 30 years. In recent years in particular, unprecedented levels of economic growth were made possible by the numbers and quality of skilled people produced by our education system.</P>
      <P>Of course, growth on the scale we have experienced poses its own challenges. Ireland today is a very different place from what it was some 40 years ago. In 1965, some 21,000 students were in higher education. Now, there are over 137,000 students, pursuing a range of study opportunities that would have been unimaginable a generation ago.</P>
      <P>The enormous strides we have made in the development of higher education are down to sustained investment by successive Governments and to the leadership and flexibility of those in the higher education sector who have responded to the demands placed on them for greater and wider provision of higher education opportunity. Having come through that period of sustained growth, it is timely to ask ourselves whether the structures and policies in place are still adequate to meet modern demands. What is working well and what is not? Have we structures in place to enable us to adapt as quickly as the pace of social, economic and technological change demands?</P>
      <P>The world around us is changing rapidly. The nature of Irish society, the profile of global economic competition and the frontiers of knowledge are all advancing before our eyes. The role demanded of higher education is changing. It is no longer simply a third level educational tier, providing qualifications for professional careers or a platform for curiosity driven research. It is now identified as an essential engine of knowledge in a national innovation system.</P>
      <P>At a broader level, higher education has key roles in promoting social cohesion, supporting individuals to achieve their life potential, promot<Col N="787"/>ing cultural and civic understanding and contributing to our overall quality of life. It is in this overall context that the OECD was invited to conduct an independent, wide-ranging review of our higher education system. A central purpose of the review was to identify current strengths and weaknesses in the system and to make recommendations that would support Ireland&rsquo;s strategic ambition of placing its higher education system at the front rank of OECD countries. As part of its deliberations, the distinguished team of examiners appointed by the OECD met with a range of bodies and individuals within and outside the sector during a visit to Ireland in February 2004. In addition, some 88 submissions were made to the review group.</P>
      <P>The report makes 52 far-reaching recommendations. These address structural and institutional reform, as well as wider policy and funding issues, including financing, management and modernisation of the sector and the wider co-ordination of Government policy on higher education and research. It recognises the very substantial achievements of the system to date but states that Irish higher education is now at a crossroads. Our strategic national objectives for economic and social progress place a premium on knowledge, skills and innovation. These are the key foundation stones on which our future prosperity, and the wider social dividends flowing from that, will be based. Our higher education system is therefore a key piece of our national infrastructure for meeting the challenges of the knowledge era. The Government&rsquo;s enterprise strategy report and Ireland&rsquo;s national action plan for research and development to 2010 each emphasise that key role for higher education.</P>
      <P>Recognising this central role the report makes a series of recommendations and I would like to use this opportunity to outline and consider them. The report identifies the need to create a national strategic agenda for higher education and to align this strategic agenda with policies for investment and funding. This is at the heart of the challenge for Ireland to successfully complete the transition from being a technology-importing low cost economy to a technology-based innovation one. Reflecting the centrality of higher education, the report recommends the creation of a national council for tertiary education, research and innovation to be chaired by the Taoiseach. This is intended to provide for a whole Government approach to the establishment of key national objectives for the sector.</P>
      <P>The report also recommends the creation of a new tertiary education authority, which would have responsibility for both the university and institute of technology sectors. The new authority, replacing the existing Higher Education Authority, would be centrally positioned to develop funding and other mechanisms to promote unified strategic planning for the sector in support of the national strategic agenda.</P><Col N="788"/>
      <P>Continuing distinct roles for the university and institutes of technology sectors and a clear differentiation of mission between them are recommended. This is intended to ensure a continued provision of a progressive range of awards &mdash; from certificate through to PhD level &mdash; needed to meet the needs of individuals, society and the economy. A particular role is recommended for the institutes of technology in promoting regional development.</P>
      <P>The thinking behind these recommendations is based on a clear logic. Higher education is central to a range of Government objectives. There is a need, therefore, to harness wider inputs into the development of the key national objectives for the sector. The mechanism proposed &mdash; a national council &mdash; is one of a number of possible options for achieving this.</P>
      <P>The importance of aligning the key strategic objectives with policies for investment and funding is of course crucial. The recommendation for a single policy and oversight body for the university and institute of technology sectors is consistent with long-standing policy thinking. The recommended single authority would have a crucial role in ensuring that the overall strengths and potential of the system are maximised through the promotion of greater inter-institutional collaboration. It would also be well placed to ensure that individual institutional strategies complement one another and are consistent with regional and national social and economic priorities.</P>
      <P>As the report outlines, the institutes of technology have brought great strength to the Irish system through their differentiated focus on supporting regional development, the applied nature of their roles and their emphasis on sub-degree provision. This diversified model has been extremely successful for Ireland in meeting the varying needs of students, the economy and society and I welcome the report&rsquo;s recommendation that it should be maintained into the future.</P>
      <P>It is important to ensure that higher education opportunities continue to be available on a regional basis at all levels. This is necessary to promote access to higher education through providing a foothold on a ladder that can lead to further progression through the levels. The development of the national framework of qualifications by the NQAI has been a major breakthrough in opening up new possibilities for progression and transfer. Its potential is based on the availability of adequate opportunity at every level. The needs of industry and regional economies are also relevant. These suggest that there will be a continuing need for a distinction of institutional mission between those that will seek to develop as research leaders and those that will primarily focus on the provision of the human capital skills required for the labour market of the future.</P>
      <P>In the interests of the ability to respond to opportunity and change, the report recommends major internal structural reform within higher <Col N="789"/>education institutions. It recommends that the size of university governing bodies should be substantially reduced and that the governing bodies of all third level institutions should contain greater levels of representation from wider stakeholders. The need for greater flexibility in salary structures and a concomitant need for greater rigour in processes for obtaining academic tenure are identified, together with a range of measures aimed at ensuring greater internal managerial effectiveness within institutions. These are complex issues that will need to be worked through in partnership with leadership in the sector, my Government colleagues and other interests.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>A number of institutions are embarked on far-reaching programmes of internal restructuring and reform and some have already made significant progress on this front in recent years. These are very welcome efforts to confront the issues faced in creating, on an agreed basis, the structures and processes necessary to develop institutional capacity to meet the challenges ahead. It is important that these modernisation objectives are supported. I have previously stated that I see an important role for the funding allocation mechanism in supporting and promoting reform efforts that support national strategic objectives. This will form an important element of my approach to the implementation of the report&rsquo;s recommendations.</P>
      <P>The funding allocation mechanism is also critical to promoting progress on a range of wider key policy objectives. The report recommends a new funding allocation model that would align funding to the achievement of key policy objectives to a much greater extent. Work is already being advanced by the Higher Education Authority on the basis of these principles,</P>
      <P>The examiners recommend a continuation and strengthening of measures to improve access for disadvantaged groups and mature students. The recently established National Office for Equity of Access to Higher Education has an important contribution to make to the development and implementation of policy in this area. A particular need is identified to substantially increase levels of part-time provision across the sector, in a lifelong learning context, to meet the skills needs of the economy and to promote social inclusion. There is some important thinking to be done in identifying potential funding mechanism approaches to promoting progress on this front.</P>
      <P>Clearly, higher education&rsquo;s role in research and development is now critical to our national economic development strategy. The OECD report acknowledges the huge strides made in the provision of public funding for research and development in recent years through measures such as the programme for research in third level institutions, PRTLI, the establishment of the two research councils and the creation of Science Foundation Ireland. Substantial ground has been made up over the past seven years. However, that investment will only yield dividend if the commit<Col N="790"/>ment to funding is sustained. The Government&rsquo;s action plan for promoting investment in research and development to 2010 has spelt out the challenge.</P>
      <P>The OECD report points out that international experience strongly suggests that research needs to be institutionally concentrated in order to build critical mass and develop world standards of excellence. It recommends that the role of the institutes of technology should continue to be primarily focused on applied research and should act as technology development partners with industry. On the challenge of achieving the Government&rsquo;s investment objectives for 2010, the report identifies the need to double the number of PhD students in our universities within that timescale. This requires a much greater concentration of efforts and investment in postgraduate support than hitherto.</P>
      <P>The importance of co-ordinating structures for research funding and policy in supporting a sustainable research culture is emphasised. Important recent progress has been made on this front with the appointment of the Government chief science adviser, Dr. Barry McSweeney. I was very pleased last week to attend the first meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Science, Technology and Innovation. This committee, which is supported by a high level interdepartmental group of officials, will co-ordinate strategy across Departments, review departmental spending plans in the areas of science and technology and address any co-ordination and cohesion issues arising. It will have a vital role in advancing progress towards the 2010 goals.</P>
      <P>Underlying the overall OECD report is the need for further investment in higher education. Given the economic and fiscal realities facing Ireland, the authors do not believe that it will be possible to create a globally competitive higher education system and research capability by relying on State funding alone. The report argues that higher education institutions are constrained by their over-dependence on State investment and that the quantum leap in funding that is required can only be met through the re-introduction of an enlarged student contribution. It recommends the re-introduction of tuition fees for undergraduates, accompanied by a targeted grant scheme to assist low income and other special needs students.</P>
      <P>The recommendation for the re-introduction of fees has been clearly rejected by this Government and is off the agenda. The need for greater investment and the challenge of identifying potential means for realising that remains very much on the agenda. This is a significant implementation challenge. In addition to the major strides on research and development funding, the Government&rsquo;s commitment to higher education has seen day-to-day funding for the sector more than double since we took office.</P>
      <P>I have previously stated that higher education funding will be a priority for me in the future. However, as Members appreciate, there are many <Col N="791"/>competing demands on the Exchequer that inevitably limit the ability to make a quantum leap in funding for any one sector, whatever its strategic importance. The challenge of securing increased investment for higher education is one that must be shared between Government and the sector itself. Clearly there is a need for institutions to diversify their funding sources. The report identifies some potential avenues. Equally importantly, there is a need for Government and the sector to work closely together in ensuring that the conditions for diversified funding are facilitated. I intend to work closely with the sector in exploring possibilities in this regard.</P>
      <P>The authors of the report clearly took a great deal of care and attention in arriving at their recommendations. The report was informed by a comprehensive consultation process and by the distinguished expertise of the examiners themselves. It clearly behoves us to take the recommendations seriously. There can be no disputing the central thrust of the report, which is that we must &ldquo;up our game&rdquo; on a number of fronts if we are to forge ahead in an increasingly competitive global market.</P>
      <P>We have a higher education system of which there is much to be proud. It has contributed in huge measure to our economic success and social progress over recent years through its ability to absorb a huge growth in demand for participation. We do not have the option of standing still. The world is rapidly moving on and we need to anticipate and respond to the demands of tomorrow. The challenge is to ensure that our higher education system has the capacity and dynamism to lead and respond to that change. The importance of this extends far beyond the field of &ldquo;education&rdquo; as narrowly defined.</P>
      <P>I will be working closely with a number of my colleagues in Government on the agenda that the OECD has presented. I will also be working closely with the Higher Education Authority, leadership in the sector and the wide range of other interests that have a stake in our successful progress. Only last week, along with officials of my Department, I met representatives of the Higher Education Authority, the Conference of Heads of Irish Universities, the Council of Directors of Institutes of Technology and the DIT to consider in depth a number of the report&rsquo;s key recommendations. This meeting is part of an ongoing dialogue with interested parties that will inform the approach to key priority actions that I will be seeking to advance over the coming months. I will be reporting back to the OECD on implementation progress in two years&rsquo; time &mdash; when I hope I will still be Minister for Education and Science. In the meantime, I am delighted, as Minister, to have this report available to me as a crucial instrument in developing policy for higher education in Ireland in the 21st century.</P>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to share some preliminary thinking on this subject and I look forward to the contribution of the Senators, many of <Col N="792"/>whom have first-hand experience of the third level sector. Their contributions will enable me to formulate my further thinking on this important report.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I welcome the discussion on this important report. The Minister will appreciate the urgency of many of its recommendations, which need Government attention and need the Minister in particular to respond positively.</P>
      <P>I welcome many of the indications given by the Minister today, in particular the fact that the re-introduction of fees is off the agenda. Members will recall that around this time last year we were discussing this issue as it was a recommendation of the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor. I am delighted it is now off the agenda.</P>
      <P>I am also glad that the Minister involved herself in consultative talks last week with all partners in education at third level. That is an important and welcome development. She will be aware, from her meetings with those groups, that high, if not uppermost, on their agendas is the inadequacy of the funding available at third level. Many of those present at the meetings would have indicated that there is a near crisis in funding in many universities and institutes which is strangling them in terms of their hopes to advance and develop. I hope this report might represent the first step in, once and for all, putting in place a strategy and plan for the funding of third level education.</P>
      <P>The OECD review of higher education in Ireland resulted in its publication last September of an important and detailed report. It was a comprehensive study of where Ireland lies in relation to other OECD countries. This document reaffirms the critical importance of education in all respects. The OECD report is clear that the importance of tertiary education to Ireland&rsquo;s economic and social development, which cannot be disputed, should not obscure its role in the intellectual and artistic life of the nation or the contribution it makes to citizenship and civil society.</P>
      <P>The September OECD report clearly shows that educational attainment has expanded greatly in recent decades. For example, 77% of those between the ages of 25 and 34 have completed at <Col N="793"/>least upper secondary education. This is a welcome development as it is above the OECD average. The figure, however, for those between the ages of 55 and 64 is only 37%, far below the average. This displays that Ireland has come a long way towards a position of relative strength from one of relevant weakness. Lifelong learning, widening participation and the encouragement of mature students to enter tertiary education have not been given much emphasis and must be reinforced in the future if Ireland is to capitalise on its success during the past decade.</P>
      <P>It is clear that Ireland&rsquo;s economic strength and success are linked to investment in education not only at higher level, but at all stages. Some of the findings in the OECD&rsquo;s report should ring alarm bells in this regard. Ireland&rsquo;s investment in the education system, as a whole, is lower than the OECD average. In terms of public expenditure, it ranks 25th out of 30 OECD countries. Between 1995 and 2000, public expenditure declined from 4.7% to 4.1%. Furthermore, expenditure per student in tertiary education in Ireland is also below the OECD average. In that regard, we rank 14th out of 26 countries. The CHIU claims that direct State support per student in the university sector fell by &euro;1,240 between 1995 and 2000.</P>
      <P>Of considerable concern also is the question of expenditure in the area of research and development. As a proportion of GDP, Ireland&rsquo;s research and development budget is well below the EU and OECD averages. From a lifelong learning perspective, the OECD found that the proportion of mature students entering higher education is extremely low. On the question of educational disadvantage, it noted that great disparities exist in terms of the participation of students from families of different socio-economic backgrounds at third level. In 1997, the proportion of new entrants aged 26 and over to university level education was only 2.3%. This compares to a figure of 19.3% in other OECD countries.</P>
      <P>Despite the great expansion in student numbers, to which the Minister referred, and the introduction of student grant schemes in 1968 great disparities continued to exist in the participation of students from families of different socio-economic status. This did not change significantly after the abolition of tuition fees for undergraduate studies in 1995-96.</P>
      <P>The OECD&rsquo;s findings in respect of inadequate funding did not come as a major surprise to even casual observers of the Irish education system. The Conference of Heads of Irish Universities has frequently referred to the often precarious financial position in which those institutions find themselves and likened the decision of the Government to freeze increases in university funding in 2004 to an equivalent cut in funding of &euro;800 per student.</P>
      <P>The president of UCD, Dr. Hugh Brady, recently outlined that, for the first time in its history, the university is in the red. He indicated the serious consequences this will have for develop<Col N="794"/>ment and stated that UCD is &euro;3.5 million in debt at present. This figure will continue to rise during the year. That is a clear example of an institution on the border of crisis. Nothing the Minister said earlier indicates that she will support universities and other educational institutions throughout the country that are in major financial difficulties. During last year, Trinity College made soundings similar to those of Dr. Brady.</P>
      <P>It should be remembered that education at all levels requires enhanced support. We need to tackle problems such as early school leaving and absenteeism in order to retain the highest possible number of young people in education. The Government has made a commitment that by the end of this decade 90% of all people will complete the leaving certificate examination. Encouraging high achievement rates at second level will have a corresponding effect on third level participation rates and success. To date, however, the Government has made painfully slow progress in respect of this commitment. Each year, at least 18% of secondary school pupils leave school before completing the leaving certificate. It is an indictment of successive Governments that this high level continues to obtain. In addition, it is of serious concern that more than 1,000 children fail to make the transition from primary to secondary school each year. Participation at third level is hugely dependent on people&rsquo;s earlier experience of education. When children are lost to education at the ages of 11 or 12, it is a mammoth task to encourage them to re-enter the system.</P>
      <P>There is considerable merit in the OECD&rsquo;s recommendation that a tertiary education authority be established. As envisaged, this would be a single funding authority for the universities and institutes of technology which at present come under separate funding arrangements. The current system is outdated and may stifle the further development of the institute of technology sector. I am anxious to hear the Government&rsquo;s plans, other than those outlined earlier by the Minister, in terms of progressing this recommendation. Governments all over Europe are devolving responsibilities and freedoms to educational institutions. This is balanced by tough accountability mechanisms which encourage them to act more innovatively and to be more adaptable and responsive to local opportunities.</P>
      <P>On the question of the return of third level fees, many people who saw this as a threat will welcome the fact that the Minister has clearly outlined the position. Fine Gael, as the main party in the Government that abolished the fees in 1990, will not agree to their return in any form. The former Minister for Education and Science favoured their return, but such a response to the funding difficulties of the universities and the institutes of technology would only compound educational disadvantage. Furthermore, I believe that if the Government reintroduces third level fees in any form, this could then be used as a reason to cut its contribution to the higher level education sector. The net result would be to <Col N="795"/>charge students tuition fees while leaving universities and institutes of technology in the same financial situation. It is absolutely unacceptable.</P>
      <P>The OECD has already recognised this possibility and has made a key recommendation on page 28 of its report which states:</P>
      <P LI="1">In order to incentivise HEIs to actively seek external sources of funding, the Government should make a clear statement that income they generate from the sources outside those provided by the State, will not be the subject of offsetting against State funding.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The Minister may have failed to do that but perhaps she will comment on this later. The Government should now make such a statement as higher educational institutions require greater stability in funding.</P>
      <P>It has been noted many times that considerable damage is done to the work of these institutions when their funding situation is chopped and changed or is unreliable and piecemeal, as has happened in the past. There is something of a contradiction in the report as regards the fees questions. While on the one hand it does not insist that students should not share the cost of their tuition, on the other hand it recognises the difficulties that may be caused by these fees. On page 30 of its report, the OECD review group states:</P>
      <P LI="1">Another important area is part-time education, which is normally seen in many countries as the established route through tertiary education for students, often mature students from disadvantaged backgrounds. In Ireland the attractiveness of such a route is dissipated by the fact that unlike full-time students, part-time students are not eligible for maintenance grants and have to pay their fees.</P>
      <P FLI="0">That is one particular aspect that must be addressed by the Minister in the near future if we are to recognise the contribution that many people at work could make, by furthering their education along the steps of the ladder she referred to earlier, if they were given equal status with full-time students. I am aware of a foundation course in an institute of technology that failed solely because the students were forced to pay fees. Little recognition is given in the report to the fees students have to pay in another way, namely, registration fees. Nobody would have believed that these would have gone from the nominal fee as originally intended up to the current levels of &euro;700 plus.</P>
      <P>It is crucial that the question be asked whether the reintroduction of fees for full-time students might have the same negative effect upon education participation. There are recommendations that the educational institutions need to take on board as well as regards third level structures including outside experience in the college management equation. In addition, the report states clearly that Government bureaucracy should not <Col N="796"/>frustrate enhanced co-operation and interaction between universities and institutes of technology. The OECD report refers to an attempt by University College Cork and the Cork Institute of Technology to develop a joint marine and nautical research and teaching centre. It finds that this initiative was frustrated by the inability to arrange complementary funding from national sources, within the work timeframe.</P>
      <P>We know Ireland lacks a national strategy agenda for change in the third level sector. More than anything else priority in education demands that the Minister put together a third level plan for funding in particular. This would allow the third level institutions to progress with confidence, enhancing the solid foundation they have already established for themselves through their wonderful initiatives to give the Irish workforce an added advantage when we are competing for outside investment. If there is a doubt in anyone&rsquo;s mind that there is not wholehearted support from the State as regards funding for the management of third level institutions, that could precipitate a rot which will be difficult to redress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister whose contribution I found interesting. Some points were more interesting than others. She emphasised at the outset that this was a major report into third level education. While I agree with some of its conclusions I have reservations about others. Senator Ulick Burke referred to a number of issues about which he has concerns. I am sure the Minister will address those in her concluding remarks.</P>
      <P>As an independent review of higher education in Ireland, this is an important report. It is probably one of the most comprehensive evaluations made in a generation. It would be remiss not to compliment the OECD on the high-powered team it engaged to carry out the task, people of high calibre and international experience. This reflects the degree of seriousness it gave to the task as well as the central importance of higher education in the priorities of the Minister and that of her predecessor, Deputy Noel Dempsey, in charting future social and economic progress in Ireland. The Minister pointed out that Ireland was at a stage of transition as regards economic development and the world market and is facing rapid change. Our broad strategic objective is to make Ireland a world leading knowledge-based society. In that sense this report is timely.</P>
      <P>For over 40 years, as the Minister said, the OECD has played an important role as a catalyst for change in Irish education. Its 1960s review is widely regarded as a defining moment in Ireland&rsquo;s recognition of the vital link between education and the social and economic development of the country. There is widespread consensus that the Celtic tiger would not have emerged in the absence of a well-educated young population. There were many other factors, but that one was of central importance. Even though the report identifies enormous challenges facing <Col N="797"/>higher education in Ireland, it must be acknowledged that great progress has been made in recent times. The whole higher education landscape has changed beyond recognition, in many respects.</P>
      <P>Ireland was one of the first countries in Europe to grasp the importance of the link between education and the economy. In 1965, for example, only about 11% of those completing second level education went on to third level. At present the percentage is in the order of 57%, so that a significant sea change has taken place. This change has been accompanied by an almost threefold improvement in average material living standards.</P>
      <P>Although we have made great progress, the Lisbon Agenda and Ireland&rsquo;s strategic objective of placing its education system in the top rank of the OECD necessitated an in-depth evaluation at this time. We all acknowledge the critical role education, research and innovation have played in our social development. Our priority is to sustain education as the driving force behind the engine of that progress, socially and economically.</P>
      <P>The report sets out the nature of the challenges that face the country, the Government and even the Minister. These challenges are to ensure that our education system is properly placed to perform its key role in the knowledge society. It tells us very clearly that higher education is at a crossroads. If we are to have the capacity to respond to the new challenges, notwithstanding the great progress that we have made, the system has to undergo a number of changes. One of these is the quantum leap in funding.</P>
      <P>The funding issue is central to where we go and the obvious prescription put forward by the report is the re-introduction of fees. The Minister has taken that off the agenda. We had a big debate on that last year in the House. The Minister&rsquo;s predecessor was strongly in favour of the re-introduction of fees, but the current Minister has seen that there is no support for such a move. She has rightly decided to talk to the heads of education establishments about diversifying investment sources. That is very important and I commend her in that regard.</P>
      <P>The recommendations are set out against the background of a high wage economy in Ireland. They make clear that if we are to retain our new found wealth, we must develop into an innovative, knowledge-based economy. We can no longer compete for high volume manufacturing jobs with the low cost economies of Asia and eastern Europe. We must therefore concentrate on attracting higher value activities rather than higher volume. Our ability to attract inward investment will depend to a growing extent on the ability to offer access to a highly skilled labour market. An example of this is the fast pace of change in the needs of the world market. We can no longer be sure of the skills we will need a few years from now. In the next decade, five out of six jobs created will be for third level graduates <Col N="798"/>with degrees, diplomas or certificates. There will be a greater demand for degree holders and, by 2015, they will represent the largest group in the new economy. The pace of change means that skills and occupations can become obsolete within a few years.</P>
      <P>The challenge for the higher education sector is its capacity to upskill its workforce. To deal with these changes, the higher education institutions will have to restructure internally. They will have to show enough flexibility to succeed in a new and constantly changing environment. A number of these institutions have already embarked on internal reform in preparation for the new challenges they are already facing. I commend the Minister on the way in which she is supporting them in their attempts to reform.</P>
      <P>Senator Burke referred to UCD and the fact that it is in debt for the first time in its history. I commend UCD on the manner in which it is attempting to reform its structures. There are a number of institutes across the country that are doing likewise. This approach is consistent with one of Ireland&rsquo;s key objectives during its Presidency of the EU, which was the promotion of the Lisbon Agenda on competitiveness. It acknowledged that lifelong learning has a key role in ensuring that the workplace is adaptable and capable of reacting to frequently changing demands. Wealth creation for the future will be based on our ability to produce and to apply knowledge. The recommendations reflect those of the Government enterprise strategy group. People are of the view that there is no strategy, but I believe that the recommendations reflect the views of the enterprise strategy group set up by the Government, as well as the national action plan for promoting research and development until 2010.</P>
      <P>The fundamental message coming from all sectors and from the report is the same. Our key competitive resource is knowledge and our higher education sector has a critical role in delivering that national resource. The call for a quantum leap in funding has been seized as a stick with which to beat the Government. It is claimed that inadequate action has been taken recently. That is totally contrary to the facts as we know them. There has been much investment in research and the development of infrastructure in the higher education sector. It has been transformed to an unprecedented extent since 1997.</P>
      <P>Funding has doubled in the higher education sector. Student numbers have increased from 104,000 to 137,000. Participation rates have increased from 44% to about 57%. At the same time, the research and development programme has changed beyond recognition. The programme for research in third level institutions, which was launched in 1998, has funded 33 new research centres across a range of disciplines. To date, it has supported 1,400 research posts and 90,000 sq. m. of dedicated research space. In addition, the Government set up two new research councils &mdash; the Irish Research Council for the Humanities <Col N="799"/>and Social Sciences and the Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology. These councils support individual research projects across the various disciplines and they have a combined annual budget of &euro;23 million. Science Foundation Ireland was set up to fund strategic areas of research in ICT and biotechnology. Between 2000 and 2006, it has an investment budget of around &euro;646 million.</P>
      <P>Despite all this investment, the issue of funding the increasingly critical role of higher education has to be confronted. It is a central, critical issue and the report sets that out. The main prescription for that is the reintroduction of fees. Having considered that throughout last year, the Minister and the Government have quite rightly taken that off the agenda.</P>

	<P>The Senator is on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Very cogent arguments were made last year in support of the motion that was tabled, which were contrary to the one-liner that was thrown at us by the Opposition. Nevertheless, I put up my hands and accept the political realities. That is where we are at and we have to go forward from there.</P>
      <P>One of the other recommendations to address this issue was that of internationalisation. The Minister and her predecessor have been abroad to a number of countries to establish contacts and to make links. If the programme of internationalisation can be promoted further, it will help to generate revenue for Ireland and it will improve standards here as well. For it to be successful, we have to guarantee the quality of our education system in a way that will enable it to be recognised and validated internationally. We must have an international quality brand for our higher education system. I assume the Minister&rsquo;s recent trip to China was interesting in that context. I look forward to hearing from her about initiatives she took while there and the subsequent developments that have taken place.</P>
      <P>One of the areas of focus for the report was our binary system at third level. The university sector is long established in Ireland, but the institutes of technology began in 1970 with the establishment of the regional technical colleges. They filled a vacuum that was there at the time and they have worked very efficiently under the remit that was given to them. In addressing this issue, the report acknowledges that there has been mission drift, with universities and institutes of technology taking over work that is more appropriate to the other at different times. There were proposals to dismantle the system and I would have concerns about such a move. In Britain, many polytechnics were promoted to university status with disastrous consequences. Our disproportionate share of US technology investment, when compared with that of England, owes <Col N="800"/>as much to the contrast in our education systems as it does the differences in the incentives we give to these investors. That is very much a plus for the continuation of the binary system here. I support the report&rsquo;s recommendation that both sectors should concentrate on their defined and distinct functions and to an extent on those which are complementary.</P>
      <P>The report recommends the unification of the third level funding system under a new tertiary education authority to prevent mission drift in any direction through the use of a funding approach based on individual institutional contracts. The report states that if Ireland is to become a world player as an information driven, knowledge-based economy, it will have to double its output of doctoral graduates by 2010, which is a significant challenge. The report also states that doctorate awarding powers should be confined to the universities, a view with which I tend to agree.</P>
      <P>Among the strongest criticisms of the report is that it pays little or no attention to the humanities and the arts. I agree with the Minister that there is a major social dividend to be derived from the progress of education through economic development. There is no conflict between the humanities and arts sector and industry, research and innovation, which are quite complementary. I compliment the Minister on the proposed initiatives she outlined today and those she has already taken in the short few months since she came into office to implement the recommendations of the report. Significant challenges face the Minister which I have no doubt she will embrace as opportunities rather than consider daunting prospects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank her for participating in this debate. The report is staid, unimaginative and uninspiring and the Minister should ignore most of it. I will guide her in my contribution through those aspects of it about which she needs to think. I am sure she can produce something a great deal better on her own than the contents of the report.</P>
      <P>I was delighted that Senator Fitzgerald, the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesman on education in the House, referred to the extraordinary manner in which the report disregarded the arts and humanities. It worried me to note a point in the Minister&rsquo;s speech which implied she bought into the report&rsquo;s perspective in this regard. She referred to the continuing need to distinguish between the need to develop research leaders and labour market needs. While I have no objection to that approach, if it is the whole story, we will produce a generation of robotic Gradgrinds who do not know how to run a country. Hand in hand with that approach, we want a policy which seeks to create a generation of innovative, creative, strategic and tactical young people with leadership qualities. The great flaw in the report is its failure to consider this model.</P>
      <P>The report is political as evidenced by the fact that its most significant point was that our investment in education as a percentage of gross <Col N="801"/>domestic product is not only reducing but less than that of the other OECD countries listed. I hope it is a matter the Minister will bring to the Cabinet&rsquo;s attention. The statistic represents perhaps the only value the Minister can derive from the report as she can flag the fact to Government. We cannot do the business with such a low level of investment in education. The Minister touched on some of the important points made in the report which we should take on board. It described the institutes of technology as like a curate&rsquo;s egg in that they are good in parts. While the report is patronising to the institutes on one level, it is supportive of them on another. We should take note of what is positive.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, the report suggests it is crucial to create one tertiary education authority to deal with universities and institutes of technology, which the report describes as institutes of tertiary education. While the terminology is unimportant, we should support the recommendation and I call on the Minister to do so. I acknowledge that there is a process to go through first, but the Minister was overly coy in her speech. I would like to hear her say that is her view. If it is her view, she by ministerial order or the Government by statutory instrument can create circumstances in which institutes of technology can come under the HEA. That is my understanding of the legislation, although I see the Minister shaking her head.</P>
      <P>While most of the report&rsquo;s recommendations on the structures and governance of colleges would require legislative changes to implement, I thought from my reading of existing legislation that it would be possible by order to make changes on funding arrangements. It is a matter I would like teased out. While I would not expect her to provide it today, perhaps the Minister can make available legal advice in her own time. I would like to know the ins and outs of the matter.</P>
      <P>Whether one&rsquo;s idea of the university accords with the medieval thinking of Peter Abelard, that of Cardinal Newman 100 years ago or modern thinking, autonomy within a third level institution is crucial. It is nonsensical, as the report points out, that an institute of technology must obtain the permission of the Department of Education and Science to establish a degree course. The practice has never been sustainable, but as a gap needed to be filled 20 years ago, we had to put structures in place quickly. As she is an educationalist herself, there are certain matters on which the Minister does not require a great deal of advice. This is one of them. Everyone here knows the practice is wrong. I suspect that in providing institutes of technology with autonomy and bringing them into the same funding structures as universities, the Minister&rsquo;s greatest problem will not come from her Department but from Merrion Street. We should take on the officials from the Department of Finance and bring them here to defend their point of view. From an educational perspective, what they are trying to do in this area is unacceptable.</P><Col N="802"/>
      <P>The seven universities and the 13 institutes of technology should be brought under the same authority. Clearance systems would have to be established in the structure whereby any course it was intended to establish achieved a certain level of quality. That has always been the case in universities and it should continue. The report states that one of the difficulties institutes of technology face is the lack of a quality assurance scheme. However, it also states that we should not rush ahead while we are waiting for the Bologna declaration to be implemented all over Europe. It will be some time after the Minister has been re-elected for another term before the Bologna declaration comes into effect around Europe. We will still be arguing about whether a degree takes three or four years to complete and whether four years in an institute of technology is equivalent to three years in a university. We should ignore the process. If we need quality assurance, we should have it. If we had introduced it previously, one of the most serious rows in third level education in recent times would have been avoided.</P>
      <P>The point brings me neatly to another of the great failures of the report. While it referred to the knowledge society, of which Senator Fitzgerald spoke also, lifelong learning, globalisation and the international context, it made no reference to e-learning. Does it contain anything about e-universities or the selling overseas of courses based in Dublin? Who are its authors? They must constitute the most unimaginative group to manage to write a full report on internationalism in third level education without dealing with e-learning and e-knowledge. It is astonishing that this has been produced by the OECD. The authors should be kicked out of its base in Paris to see something of the world. They seem to be retired people, although I do not want them to take this personally. However, they were simply having a couple of days&rsquo; enjoyment in Ireland. I certainly did not see any fresh thinking or new learning. They avoided the political issues, because the OECD is so political. They point out that we have a huge gap in investment, but do they say we should put more State investment into the system? No. They talk about the need to improve private income stream and fund-raising. They make a valid point that universities, third level institutions and institutes of technology which manage to attract research funding, fund-raising and donations should not be penalised in any way in terms of what they get from the State. In fact, if anything, they should be rewarded. I would go along with that assertion.</P>
      <P>These people are politicians and therefore avoided any embarrassment to their Government by going back to whoever might be in Paris next year at the next meeting of the OECD to ask, &ldquo;Who are those people to tell us we should put more money into education?&rdquo; However, we should say it, the Minister should say it and we should do it. If the Government decides it will not do so, at least we will know where the difficulties lie.</P><Col N="803"/>
      <P>If we had quality assurance in education, together with e-learning proposals and plans, we would not have had a row last year with regard to Hibernia College and the colleges of education. The colleges of education are good, e-learning is great and e-qualifications are a brilliant idea. Before there was any row, we all thought it was great. Now we have a situation whereby somebody has started to provide e-learning and there is significant opposition. Is that right or wrong? There is only one way we will know, which is through quality assurance. We got into a debate that opposed e-learning. My instinct is to support e-learning until somebody tells me why I should not do so, whereas most of the educational establishment oppose it until somebody tells them why they should support it.</P>
      <P>We need to keep moving on the issue, and the only way to do so is through quality assurance. If quality assurance was in place and somebody came to the Minister or her predecessor and said they had compared e-learning and the traditional way and found no difference between them in that one was as good as the other, then we should carry on. If they said that one was better than the other, then we would have a problem. Which is better? Which comes up best in a comparison? People must allow the decision to be made. The issue of e-learning is another gap in the OECD report and the matter should be raised and returned to.</P>
      <P>How dare these people tell us about our regional programme. I refuse to discuss this simply on the basis that it is an educational document from the OECD. I will tell the Minister one thing and she can come back to me on the matter: if we implement what the report is suggesting there will be no university north of a line from Dublin to Galway. That is what it means. The BMW region, with the exception of Galway in the south west of the region, will not be entitled to seek a university, never mind places such as Waterford which has made a substantial case. It is anti-competitive, to use the OECD&rsquo;s type of language, to state that institutes of technology cannot award degrees. It is anti-competitive for the report to patronisingly state the institutes of technology are not good enough to offer doctorates. It is also quite patronising to state we should have doctorates in universities and perhaps a sidekick supervisor also based in the institutes of technology. I see no reason for this. If an institute of technology focuses strongly on an important aspect of education, learning or technology and wants to bring that to doctoral standard, it should do so. We should not place artificial restrictions on where a university might be situated. That is not what it is about, neither does it fit into our spatial or gateway strategy or review of the BMW region. It is unacceptable that the BMW region would not be entitled to develop university education in its own way.</P>
      <P>The idea of waiting for the Bologna process to come into play will only slow us down, and the <Col N="804"/>Minister should ignore that idea. The issue of overseas and international students also ties into what I said regarding the importance of e-learning. However, it does not just relate to e-learning. In terms of getting more people into third level education, the report ignores whole groups in society. What is our strategy? Let us take an example of a woman in her home in north-west Mayo who would like to go to university and get a degree but has domestic responsibilities. She is bright enough to easily get through a degree and make a contribution to Ireland&rsquo;s economy and social capital. E-learning is the way for her to achieve this. Harvard can do it, so why can we not do likewise?</P>
      <P>Why can we not sell Irish literature programme degrees based in Dublin to Boston? They do so in the United States. Canada sells such degrees into Chicago. What we are doing here is restrictive. These people are not opening their eyes. They are probably restricted by national boundaries. They are absolutely right in their criticism that we have not sufficiently opened up to international students. However, one codicil to that criticism is that we have had difficulties with the Royal College of Surgeons in that some would say it is allowing in too many international students to the detriment of Irish students who should take priority. There is no doubt about that. However, that goes back to the fundamental point that we do not invest enough in tertiary education. My understanding is that the Royal College of Surgeons does not have enough money to extend places and it is very much reliant on the income stream it gets from international students. That is a catch-22 situation and we cannot allow it to happen. The Minister must hammer the Cabinet table and say it cannot be done. If we want more GPs and consultants, this is a problem which we must unblock. That is where we go.</P>
      <P>E-learning would similarly bring mature students into the system. If somebody is working in a job in the BMW region, far from a university, and he or she wants a university qualification, he or she should be able to do so through e-learning.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I should look at my script. I have pointed out some of the issues which I thought the report dealt with well. I am sure the Leas-Chathaoirleach will agree with one of the issues, and spoke about it last year. The report states there should be no distinction in terms of fees between part-time evening students and full-time students. That is only right and proper. There is a sense of inequity in that area which offends us all.</P>
      <P>The OECD made points regarding doctoral awards, not allowing doctorates at institutes of technology and not allowing such institutes to become universities. However, these points are not proven in its report.</P><Col N="805"/>
      <P>Regarding the implication that there would be no university north of a line between Dublin and Galway, Senator MacSharry recently talked about the importance of developing an educational strategy. I am sure he will say more about that today.</P>
      <P>I did not get a chance to address the issue of research and development. I am absolutely appalled to learn from the report that two thirds of the money invested in research and development in Irish universities comes from foreign non-nationally owned companies. That will kill our future. Fifteen years ago we were the worst among our European colleagues in terms of investment in research and development. I thought the situation had improved, but that simple statistic bothers and worries me. We should insist that indigenous industry gets involved in research and development and that two thirds figure should be inverted as quickly as possible.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I wish the Minister well and thank her for coming into the debate. I hope she takes some points on board, in particular that the institutes of technology should be moved into the same funding arena as universities, that they should not be restricted in their development, that they should be given a quality assurance scheme to allow them to develop, and that they are not restricted from developing in the direction of becoming universities if they so wish. The latter is not a necessity unless it suits them. The famous Massachusetts Institute of Technology has never found it necessary to become a university. I am not putting this forward as an issue regarding status. It is about what they feel they need for their community, students, area and regional development. The people from the OECD who tell us about regional development have much to learn. The Minister could tell them a lot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House. It is my first opportunity to wish her well with her new brief. I know, perhaps more than many, that she will do a very good job.</P>
      <P>The OECD report on third level education represents a sort of brain-storming exercise. It is perhaps also a foundation for policy making. As the Minister said in her speech, it is something on which the future of higher education will be based. I compliment the team that produced the report because it made me reflect on what is involved. I would welcome another opportunity to discuss this report. I began reflecting upon it over the weekend along with other activities but my thinking is somewhat scrappy and I am not sure I have got it right in my own mind as to how the report&rsquo;s various recommendations should be handled.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity we now have to move third level education into the 21st century. The structure of tertiary education has not changed much over the years since I was in college, which was neither today nor yesterday. The governing bodies have not changed very <Col N="806"/>much and neither have the heads of departments. The key recommendation on changing structures is a good starting point because when one implements any policy one must examine the existing structures. Unless those structures are altered, one will not have a fluid operation within the system.</P>
      <P>The Minister is to establish a new tertiary authority, with policy-making and funding roles, which will incorporate the universities. The university sector has changed over the years. At one stage there was only the National University of Ireland. When Maynooth became a constituent college it comprised four universities. The Royal College of Surgeons is also part of the sector.</P>
      <P>We started off with regional technical colleges, which became institutes of technology &mdash; a plethora of which have since been established all over the country. Within the past 25 years there has been a sea change in the development of third level education. Access to such education must now be re-examined. I am glad the tertiary authority is to be established as it will define the divisions between universities and institutes of technology.</P>
      <P>The Minister is also establishing two committees to supervise the management of universities and institutes. However, there is to be only one chair, so I wonder how that will work. I am worried about whether it can work. Perhaps I have not read the report properly but that proposal appears to be somewhat clumsy.</P>
      <P>The report recommended a reduction in the number of governing bodies and that their composition may change from 36 to 22 members. The report also recommended an emphasis on the non-academic membership of governing bodies but I am concerned about how such a change might be implemented. I am all for outside representation on governing bodies, which reflects the views of the public, but one also needs heads of departments to be represented. The balance between academic and non-academic staff in the composition of governing bodies must be right. I would like the Minister to clarify what she proposes by changing the numbers and composition of such bodies.</P>
      <P>I agree totally that we should change the management structure relating to departmental heads whose role should rotate. Heads of university departments can often become staid in their thinking so opportunities should be provided for new people with experience and skills to enter the system and alter course content. I would welcome such movement in the composition of university departments and those of institutes.</P>
      <P>In order to widen access to universities and institutes of technology, we must examine the three leaving certificate formats, namely, academic, vocational and applied. Some students may wish to improve their skills by attending a post-leaving certificate course. From there, they can progress to certificate and diploma courses before eventually obtaining a pass degree. The <Col N="807"/>plethora of courses coming on stream is mind boggling.</P>
      <P>Access to third level education must be examined in light of the participation of part-time students, the phenomenon of lifelong learning and the provision of structures for those opting for an indirect route to university. There is a knock-on effect involved in such developments. Students who try so hard to gain access to third level courses &mdash; sometimes sitting the leaving certificate four times &mdash; but fail to do so, should be allowed greater access to tertiary education. The Minister should examine that matter carefully to see what she can do about it.</P>
      <P>The Minister is proposing the establishment of a new council because the institutes of technology are so fragmented. Courses are also duplicated and I am worried that in some places we will see courses in dish washing being offered. We should not take the route of some American colleges because I want to see courses on offer here with a high quality of content. From attending such courses students will be able to shape up and obtain access to degree courses. Postgraduate studies will also evolve naturally if the fundamental principles are correct. I would encourage that approach in order to harmonise courses offered by the institutes of technology, thus avoiding fragmentation. Such a development would involve not only the Department of Education and Science but also the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
      <P>As regards third level funding, we need to develop further the knowledge-based system which has boosted our economy over the years. The humanities must not be forgotten, however. I come from that background and I would hate to think that I would not be considered as good a manager because I did not have a degree in science and technology. I would like to think that the Minister will not overlook the humanities in her consideration of tertiary education.</P>
      <P>There is a big challenge ahead but the Minister is able for it. As regards change, she must take into account the current composition of universities as well as the fragmentation of the institutes of technology. Business and community links must be developed also when it comes to providing funds for third level education.</P>
      <P>The OECD report is a brain-storming exercise which has forced me to reflect on many current issues facing tertiary education. Before the Minister formulates any major new educational policies, I hope she will afford us the opportunity of debating them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to return to a section of the OECD report on page 30 which has already been cited by Senator Ulick Burke. In the context of part-time education, the report states that in many countries it is normally seen as an established route through tertiary education for students, often mature students from disadvantaged backgrounds. As Senator Ulick <Col N="808"/>Burke stated, the report underlines that the attractiveness of such a route is dissipated by the fact that unlike full-time students, part-time students are not eligible for maintenance grants and have to pay fees. Tallaght was given as an example of an industrial area where there would potentially be a significant market for part-time programmes if fees were omitted.</P>
      <P>It strikes me that the OECD is trying to have it both ways on the fees issue. It states that fees are a disincentive to part-time study while at the same time calling for one regime for part-time and full-time students. It is ludicrous to suggest that fees are a disincentive but if they were brought in for both full-time and part-time courses they would be less of a disincentive. That does not make any sense.</P>
      <P>The initial reference I made to the OECD report brings me to a point I have made a few times in the Seanad, namely, that looking at and dealing with inequality in the education system involves not just the most recent year&rsquo;s group of school leavers. Approximately 50% of school leavers do not go to college. In the 1980s that figure was in the region of 80% and the percentage before then was higher again. In 1992, 64% of school leavers did not go to college. School leavers who left school in 1980 are in their 40s now and those who left school in the early 1990s are in their 30s. Most of these people are either actually or potentially in the workforce. They should have expectations to be in employment for many years to come.</P>
      <P>I recently analysed some figures from the Central Statistics Office regarding educational qualification levels of adults in the workforce. They show that 46% of people aged between 40 and 54 left school with, at best, a junior or intermediate certificate. Of those aged between 35 and 45, only 36% left school with only either primary or lower secondary level qualifications. A substantial part of our workforce is disadvantaged in regard to their educational qualifications. We need them in our workforce but in order to have a competitive workforce we have to improve their qualification levels. That is a very central part of what we need to do in addressing the OECD report and the many other reports that have referred to the area of lifelong learning.</P>
      <P>The promotion of lifelong learning is essential in tackling disadvantage. In addition to helping those who have lost out on our education system in the past it would also help those who cannot access third level education in the traditional way. The leaving certificate should not be the only route by which one can get into college and the traditional model of three to four years full-time study should not be the only way to pursue further education. If lifelong learning was central to the way third level education was delivered, we would not have the same pressures to get leaving certificate points and the points race would not have the pre-eminence it currently has in determining access to college. The most <Col N="809"/>important part of the OECD report is the need to implement our White Paper on lifelong learning.</P>
      <P>In order to put lifelong learning at the core of our education system, we must remodel the way third level education is provided. Third level institutes must be encouraged to provide a more flexible model of education that is credit-based. People should be allowed to study part time during the day or at night, go back to study or go from one level to another.</P>
      <P>I have a small amount of experience in education in that I worked as a clerical officer in the admissions office of Bolton Street college which is part of the DIT. One of the things which most impressed me was how one would see students who started in the college doing a part-time certificate programme at night but who ended up doing postgraduate studies, having progressed through diploma stage and the full-time degree programme. The institutes of technology have led the way in that regard but much more needs to be done. UCD recently introduced its horizons programme which is based around the idea of building up credits. It is a flexible system which allows one to do different types of subjects, such as biology with an arts degree or whatever. I welcome that type of initiative. That has to become the way in which our education system is delivered.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science must do more to force the education providers to offer a flexible model of education. One way to do that would be to fund education courses on the basis of their provision of credits as opposed to the provision of years. The effect of that would be to blur the differentiation between part-time and full-time education and encourage mature students into the system. This would allow all students to be treated in the same way in regard to fees. Thousands of full-time course places that are currently vacant could be filled by part-time students if the provision of third level education was looked at imaginatively.</P>
      <P>That type of model would also help reduce the number of people who drop out from college. If students could go from a full-time degree to part-time study along the way perhaps they would stay within our system. In the past it has very much been the case that if a person left a full-time degree course there was little chance of he or she returning to complete it. That was certainly the case when I was in college.</P>
      <P>I very much welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement that fees are off the agenda. I hope she will continue to take this approach. It is a Labour Party initiative that I do not want to see taken away. It has been an important step in improving access to third level institutions. Although a great deal of evidence is not yet available to show how participation levels in education have improved, the figures that exist point to an improvement and that is the important thing.</P>
      <P>I hope next year&rsquo;s Clancy report will show increased levels of participation since 1998 when the last Clancy report was published. Even if it <Col N="810"/>does not, different factors have to be taken into account such as, for example, the many school leavers who would have been encouraged during the healthy Celtic tiger economy to earn money for their families rather than enter third level education. In dealing with access it is important to look at the way education is provided as opposed to whether there are third level fees.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that the OECD report identified the fact that it now costs much more than it did in the past to provide third level education. It should be borne in mind that it is not the provision of third level education that has contributed to its increasing cost but the increasing demands placed on third level institutions, especially in regard to research and development. Business benefits in that regard. Those are the people we should look at in terms of providing more funding for the education system if the State cannot do so. Third level students are the State. They and their parents pay the taxes that are used to fund the third level sector. Students are not contributing to the increasing cost of third level education and they should not be landed with the burden of having to pay for those increasing costs. The business sector needs to be brought on board in that regard. A number of people in the institute of technology sector have told me that, in implementing this document, we must recognise the importance of the institutes of technology and the role they can play in delivering improvements in research and development. They have a great record of providing education which is based around applied sciences and can play an important role in delivering applied and enterprise-based research. However, they need the funds to enable them to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Senator Kenneally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful for the opportunity to make some points on this issue. I welcome the OECD report. It is timely to have a review at this stage. Moreover, there is no better person in either House than the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, to make the necessary improvements and changes as Ireland evolves and requires more specific and strategic planning. It is clear from speaking to the IDA, Enterprise Ireland or any other agency that human resources are the most valuable currency in the procurement of foreign direct investment into the future. We must seek to breed, create and attract more intellectual property. In order to do so effectively, it is clear many of the recommendations of the OECD report will have to be adopted.</P>
      <P>I have some concerns regarding the institutes of technology. As Senator O&rsquo;Toole rightly pointed out, I would like to support the possibility of a university, or a group of institutes <Col N="811"/>becoming a university, being established north of the line between Dublin and Galway, particularly in the context of the national spatial strategy. It is vitally important that, in any implementation of any of the plans in the OECD report, the institutes of technology have equality of status with the seven universities. The proposal for two committees with one chair under the new body which is to be set up is a good one. However, if statutory instruments are required to establish the committees they should not be too rigid in order that institutes of technology could respond in terms of fulfilling their remit by reacting to the needs of the students and by filling the various voids in the regions in which they operate.</P>
      <P>The term &ldquo;mission drift&rdquo; is one of those new phrases like &ldquo;going forward&rdquo;. In the case of mission drift, the mission should not be too clearly defined in terms of either type of college. I fundamentally disagree with my colleague, Senator Fitzgerald, that doctorates should only be within the gift of universities. That feeds into the issue of the area north of the line between Dublin and Galway. There was a very heated debate about St. Angela&rsquo;s College in this House but there is no constituent college of the NUI north of the line between Dublin and Galway. We are very proud to have St. Angela&rsquo;s in Sligo, we have excellent institutes of technology in Sligo and Letterkenny, as well as GMIT. We could also examine the possibility of cross-Border institutes, taking in Fermanagh or Derry, as well as St. Angela&rsquo;s College to establish a group of campuses to form a north-western university or something to that effect.</P>
      <P>I realise that may be difficult but it needs to be acknowledged as an aspiration and we should seek ways in which we can make it a reality. If we are ever to achieve our aspirations under the national spatial strategy, we will have to examine the issue of creating critical mass in the region and, in order to do so, we must have the full range of educational facilities available which includes university status of sorts.</P>
      <P>I would like to see the institutes of technology having increased autonomy in terms of expenditure, specifically in terms of how that expenditure is used on infrastructure. A number of the institutes of technology have driven good initiatives through their own strategic plans and we should examine and salute the many positive developments which have derived from them rather than knock them down. Traditionally, there has been an issue with the elitism of the universities being compared with the innovation of the institutes of technology, thereby creating two tiers. We need to move away from this view.</P>
      <P>Although this is a debate on the OECD report on third level education, Senator Ormonde referred to second level, the points system and how many people have to sit the leaving certificate several times in order to qualify for a course they want to study. I did not attend a third level institution because I did not achieve the points <Col N="812"/>required for the courses in which I was interested. No other facility was open to me. I know people who studied medicine because it required the highest number of points. Although such people might have had the academic ability to achieve those points, they had the acumen of librarians.</P>
      <P>While we are examining second level as part of a bigger plan, we need to seek to introduce a greater focus on nurturing and harnessing the natural entrepreneurial flair which exists in young people and which we are losing. If we could do that, we could breed our own icons and role models, rather than always looking to the likes of Michael Dell or Bill Gates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator MacSharry for sharing his time with me and welcome the Minister to the House. I had wished to speak about the issue of fees in regard to third level funding but there is inadequate time to do so. Some sort of incentive is required whereby third level institutions which are performing well are rewarded. I do not agree with much of the OECD report. However, I agree with a section which states:</P>
      <P LI="1">The success of the institutes sector needs to be nurtured and celebrated so that its differentiation from the university sector is not seen as conferring lower status but defining it as an equal partner in a dynamic higher education system which covers a diverse range of functions but, if it is to be fully realised, some of the organisational disadvantages of the present structure need to be addressed.</P>
      <P FLI="0">When the Minister visited Waterford Institute of Technology she informed me that she is well-disposed towards changing the way in which funding is allocated because institutes of technology are suffering. One of the recommendations is that the differentiation of mission between the university and the institute of technology sectors is preserved and that, for the foreseeable future, there will be no further institutional transfers into the university sector. As a representative of Waterford and the south east, I cannot accept that view. We have been making the case long and hard. There are deficiencies in the area which can only be addressed through the provision of a full university.</P>
      <P>In making the case for my own region, I am using some of the data from a recently-published IBEC south-east document entitled Time for Action, which is a strategy document on the infrastructural needs in the south east. It is generally recognised that the south-east region is underperforming in terms of the economy, enterprise and employment. However, the potential for growth in the region should not be underestimated. With a young population, the south east already has one fundamental element in place. The challenge is to put in place the necessary infrastructure without delay.</P>
      <P>The south-east region has much to offer but it now needs the essential infrastructure to enable it to capitalise on this potential in terms of econ<Col N="813"/>omic growth and employment generation. One of the priority projects for implementation is a university for the south east. To meet the Government and EU-stated policy objective of creating a knowledge economy, new regional higher education networks which generate and sustain new ideas, people and business are paramount. Education has long been accepted as a critical basis for economic growth and regional development. OECD figures suggest that each additional year of education raises output by 6%. Regions with strong autonomous learning institutions economically out-perform regions without such institutions. However, the south east has a clear deficiency of third level infrastructure. The population estimate for the western part of the country for 2004 was 394,300 people. That part of the country has a university. The estimated population of the mid-west is 345,400. It, too, has a university. The south-east region, however, with an estimated population of 440,400, which is bigger than the population in either of the two regions I mentioned, does not have a university and, if this report were to be taken on board, it will not get one in the foreseeable future. I cannot accept that.</P>
      <P>The south east also fares badly in terms of participation levels in third level education. The proportion of the population over 15 years of age with a third level degree or higher is 6.53%, while 8.17% have a third level non-degree education. The OECD report also shows the relatively low level of expenditure on research and development in this country. The percentage of national research and development grants going to the south east is 0.69%. That puts the region further behind. This must be addressed.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept the recommendation regarding further education needs in the south east. Our campaign for a university for the region will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I broadly welcome the report, which offers us the opportunity to discuss higher education. The report provides a framework for ongoing development and outlines parameters for legislative provision. It also suggests constructive pathways forward in terms of governance, the size of governing bodies, the need for greater flexibility in salary structures and so forth.</P>
      <P>However, the report does not select the right options in a number of key areas. As Senator O&rsquo;Toole pointed out, there is no mention of e-learning in the report, which is unbelievable. Parity of esteem between the institutions of higher education must go beyond the rhetoric in the report. An inclusive legislative framework is required to underpin and structure institutions in a way that is inclusive and equitable. The tertiary education authority recommended in the report is the principal device by which inclusivity can be accomplished. It is important that the institutes of technology and the universities are not set apart from each other, as the report recommends. Other speakers referred to the situation with doc<Col N="814"/>torates. That is crazy. If the report&rsquo;s proposal were to be implemented, it would be divisive and unworkable in the long term. It smacks of a partitionist mentality.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Senator Kenneally, spoke about Waterford and the south east. Recommendation No. 1 in the report is unacceptable, although there may well be circumstances in the future which we cannot anticipate now which would change this perspective. The south east is the only geographical region without a university. Are we now to accept that Waterford and the south east will never have a university? Such a recommendation goes against the grain of democracy. It is a cause of concern for the people of Waterford and the south east.</P>
      <P>The deficit of higher education provision in the south east has long been recognised in previous officially commissioned reports, particularly the Sexton report. Waterford is the only gateway city not to have a university and an institute of technology. The region is dependent on traditional manufacturing and agriculture for much of its employment. With those sectors in decline, however, the region must create knowledge-based industries if it is to create sustainable employment. This cannot happen without the appropriate research infrastructure. A university is required to provide it.</P>
      <P>Participation in education is a cornerstone of the development of a sustainable workforce. However, under the OECD report the opportunities to participate would be severely limited for regions which do not have university access. Waterford Institute of Technology, although successful, cannot continue to provide for all the imperatives within the current legislative and resource boundaries. It must be given university status to enable the region to maximise its economic growth potential. The region is well below the national average in many economic indicators, such as employment in advance sectors, disposable income, university participation rates and research funding.</P>
      <P>The south east does not want a replica of other universities. It needs a different, regional model which is inclusive rather than exclusive. A university model that is inclusive of all the needs and purposes of the region should be planned and supported. It should be a model for future inward investment, a sustained instrument for economic growth, a key factor in widening participation in third level education and, indeed, a core component in meaningful plans for decentralisation and the decongestion of Dublin.</P>
      <P>Only 22% of the south-east region&rsquo;s workforce has a third level education, compared with a national average of 30%. Disposable income <i>per capita</i> in the south east is the lowest in the country, even lower than that of the BMW region. It is the first destination for only 3% of graduates. Employment in advance sectors in the south east is only 25% of the workforce, compared with 62% in Dublin, 54% in the mid-west, 51% in the west and 46% in the south west. Less than 1% of <Col N="815"/>research grants are awarded to the south east. This is a scandal. People might think that the south east is prospering but these are the facts.</P>
      <P>The campaign for a university for the south east is irreversible. The case has been made and the facts are irrefutable. Leading academics, even in the university sector, accept this privately and, in some instances, publicly. Now is the time to end this injustice to the people of the south east.</P>
      <P>Some of the recommendations in the report should be considered but the recommendation in this regard should be binned, like several others. This point was made by Senator O&rsquo;Toole and other speakers. While the report addresses certain important matters it cannot be considered, and should not be taken as, a blueprint for third level education in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I will try to be brief so I will not stymie the university voice in the House.</P>

	<P>The Senator is very gracious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Over the past 40 years the OECD has played an important part in stimulating the development of third level education and, indeed, science policy. The Minister cited figures that illustrate the enormous expansion in third level education. It received a new wind in the late 1980s. I recall attending some of the meetings at the time between the then Minister, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, and the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey. The expansion that started or restarted in the late 1980s was very much economic policy driven. At a seminar held in the Royal Irish Academy in 2003, Dr. Frank Rhodes pointed out that universities &mdash; this applies to all third level institutions &mdash; now act as gateways to professional practice, primary agents of scholarship and research and great agents of social mobility. Tremendous investment has been made in the infrastructure of our universities and third level colleges. If one visits them at an interval of four or five years, one is liable to get lost among the new buildings that have been erected. There are similar plans for the future, including the move of the DIT to Grangegorman.</P>
      <P>I strongly endorse the comments of Members from the south-east region, including Senators Cummins and Kenneally. It is essential from a regional policy perspective that some of the expansion of the universities and third level institutes takes place in the south-east region. I appreciate much has been done in broadening the Waterford Institute of Technology by spreading outreach programmes to Kilkenny, Wexford and so on. Equally, I appreciate the establishment of the Tipperary institute in the Minister&rsquo;s home town of Thurles and Clonmel, where there are further welcome developments such as the establishment of a facility of the institute at Ballingarrane House. However, the Government needs to open its mind in regard to the south-east region which has, compared with most other regions, <Col N="816"/>fallen somewhat behind in terms of <i>per capita</i> income.</P>
      <P>Another welcome development was the establishment of the research councils for science and the humanities in the past two years. There was a check a couple of years ago when a significant cutback in research funding occurred, although this was to a large extent restored last year. If I understood the Minister correctly and there is an ambition to double the number of people studying for PhDs by 2010, the money for this must be provided. I would not have as negative a view as Senator O&rsquo;Toole in regard to private funding for research, particularly in the area of science. It can and should play a valuable role.</P>
      <P>The Minister&rsquo;s predecessor did much to try to improve equality of access by increasing maintenance fees. However, we live in a democracy and the people&rsquo;s will counts for something. Whatever reservations we may have had about the abolition of fees, the decision has been taken. I do not see it as reversible or that there is any public support for such a move. The disadvantage is, as some heads of universities never cease to remind the Minister, that it makes third level colleges exceptionally and directly dependent on State funding. As the Minister stated, this sector must fight with other priorities, although given a choice between improving a road or any part of our education system, it would be my priority to improve the education system and wait another five minutes in traffic. One of the ways out of the situation would be to attract full-fee-paying foreign students but I hope this would not be at the expense of Irish students.</P>
      <P>We must make academic careers attractive to young lecturers who are to spend their lives in the university system. At present, young academics move from six to 12 month contracts and getting onto the ladder seems very difficult. It is easier in many careers to get onto the ladder and have a reasonable degree of security. There is intense insecurity among young academics and this may be prejudicial to quality. One needs to be very determined to make an academic career these days whereas there was a security of tenure 30 years ago.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to avoid the mistake made across the water and not to over-bureaucratise matters by constantly hassling and harrying lecturers with performance tests so that they spend half their time responding to them. By and large, staff in these positions are highly motivated and should be allowed to get on with the job.</P>
      <P>Although I do not propose a solution, I wish to reflect on a major dilemma &mdash; a problem common not only to Ireland but to the whole of western Europe. This is the competition with the highly funded American system of higher education. The Americans have no hang-ups about elitism and money buying education. It was said to me that middle class parents in Europe try to pay off their mortgages whereas in America they pay for university fees of up to $35,000. The problem is that there has been a brain drain to America. The <Col N="817"/>best professors and lecturers get offers and many of them go to America. How do we compete? Is there a case for us to encourage the establishment of a private university with some guaranteed State access for disadvantaged groups? While I do not know the answer, the question must be posed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House. She will certainly go home with food for thought, having had this report ripped apart. I also take issue with a fair amount of it. The first point with which I took issue was that the humanities and social sciences were totally disregarded, apart from subsuming the Irish Council for the Humanities and Social Sciences into Science Foundation Ireland, which was ridiculous. Having listened to Senator Mansergh, this is sending us into the area of American universities, which are research based with very little emphasis on learning and teaching the spirit of inquiry. I understand the complaints of Senator Cummins and others in regard to the way regional institutes of technology are to be denigrated so that they will do little more than teach technicians while keeping away from research. How can good staff be retained if this is the case, never mind that one cannot have tenure until one has worked in an institution for five years?</P>
      <P>Ireland has made huge economic strides because far more people were involved in third level education, including far more women, who are now in the workforce. However, despite the free fees, we have not done well in getting people from lower socio-economic backgrounds into the workforce. I accept the free fees policy has only been in place for ten years and the Minister is right not to scrap it. However, it shows that for these areas of society we must invest far more at pre-school, primary and secondary level because if one does not get through those levels, one will not get to university.</P>
      <P>An area to which reference was not made is the failure rates for some courses, with which I am very concerned. For some first year courses in universities, particularly science courses, failure rates are close to 30% and for some regional institutes are close to 50%. Overall, only 10% of those who go to university do not finish but this figure is as high as 30% for some institutes of technology.</P>
      <P>I am glad Senator Ormonde, with her background in counselling, is present because this problem apparently arises due to students choosing the wrong courses. We need far more counselling of students at school because too often students who applied for various courses told me when they were successful that they did not know why they had applied for them. Students never consider that they might get their fourth choice. <Col N="818"/>I am delighted with the idea of bringing in more international students, especially at postgraduate and post-doctoral levels. It is important to remember that we will be competing with some non-English speaking countries now running these courses in English. We must have a sufficient number of Irish graduates in disciplines such as medicine. Not even one third of the number required are graduating. All that is needed is money. There was not a single application for a consultant post in this country from a non-EU graduate recently.</P>
      <P>Lifelong learning is incredibly important but we are currently paying it lip-service. People must be considered for part-time release from work if they are to upskill and progress in their industries. Having worked as a researcher, I am glad to see basic research promoted. During the debate on Science Foundation Ireland I nearly had to drop to my knees in search of information on this subject. Quoting the Scandinavian educationalist Skoie, &ldquo;Squeezing research out of people that have no training, aptitude or inclination for it inevitably generates tensions.&rdquo; It is essential that the teaching and pastoral care of third level students are given importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my colleague, Senator Henry, for making time available and Senator Mansergh for his courtesy in cutting short his interesting remarks to allow us to participate. I welcome the Minister to the House. It is appropriate as, like me, she was a teacher.</P>
      <P>I have read a report of a speech made in Cork by one of this report&rsquo;s principal authors, Professor Shattock. He highlighted two major issues, namely, the massive increase in funding and the large-scale internal reorganisation and restructuring of universities. The first may cause difficulties for the Minister and the second may cause difficulties for academic staff. It is true and has been acknowledged on the other side of the House that there was a period of cutbacks totalling 14%, 6% of which has been recouped. We are still in a situation of shortfall.</P>
      <P>The figures are stark. We are 14th of 26 OECD nations. We are often told about our wonderful educational system and spending but this ranking is factual. Overall investment in education is below the OECD average and investment in research and development taken as a percentage of the wealth of the State lags well behind both OECD and EU averages. The report points to low numbers of international mature students and students from traditionally disadvantaged areas. We must either make further investment or adjust the way in which finance is used.</P>
      <P>This review coincides with a readjustment of university management structures. This will cause concern as increased business presence in university governance is called for. Expecting universities to be efficient and to take account of the so-called &ldquo;real world&rdquo; are issues but if they are driven too far in that direction there will be considerable dangers. What is the cost-benefit analy<Col N="819"/>sis of imagination, for example? In the old days it was the university versus the marketplace. Perhaps that was wrong and we should try to ride both horses simultaneously but it would be disastrous if we simply introduced the values of the marketplace wholesale to universities. There are examples &mdash; Queens University, Belfast, closed its department of classics and music departments are suffering the same fate in Britain. The president of the students&rsquo; union, Francis Kieran, said: &ldquo;We must be aware of the commercialisation of third level education as, at the end of the day, attending college &mdash; sentimental as this may sound &mdash; is meant to be about broadening the mind and experiencing new ideas.&rdquo; He is absolutely right. We must find a way to combine these ideas.</P>
      <P>A problem exists regarding fees. There are no free fees, regardless of the intention to abolish fees. If the point of this was to encourage individuals from lower socio-economic areas into universities, it has been a disastrous failure. The rate of increase of participation in Irish higher education by lower socio-economic groups has actually slowed compared to the 1986-92 period when targeted student grants were the policy instrument. In other words, if they are targeted then the disadvantaged are reached. A recent report entitled Supporting Equity in Higher Education shows a disparity of almost five to one &mdash; 79% to 21% &mdash; between the higher, professional socio-economic group and the unskilled manual work group in total participation in third level education. The current approach is not working. When considering the result of money directed from taxpayers, the benefit to the individual student is a benefit to society as a whole.</P>

	<P>I anticipated there would be a good debate on the OECD report. I thank the Senators for their contributions. It is useful to hear from people with first-hand experience in the third level sector as students, lecturers or so forth. It affects us all.</P>
      <P>It is evident that people have spoken from regional perspectives as well as with regard to issues of access. Much of the debate resolves around the institute of technology-university divide. It is important to reiterate that maintaining their equal status as part of a higher education structure, but with different roles, is envisaged in any changes. Both are essential to our higher education for progression and regional development, as well as for degree, postgraduate, undergraduate, certificate and diploma levels. The aim of each of the sectors and all of the institutes in the country is to continue to improve, upskill and upgrade.</P>
      <P>There are seven universities in this country and nine on this island. I can envisage everyone taking advantage of this fact through further co-operation, a greater mix of students and staff and sharing experiences. Each region desires a top <Col N="820"/>quality, third level education and institution. This will improve student participation rates, attract industry and ensure a regional balance throughout the country. One institute that has been mentioned, Waterford, is well known for the top quality progression and courses it offers. On behalf of the institutes, the director of the Waterford institute made the presentation at the round table talks during our recent visit to China. The institutes have carried out good work.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that GMIT is a world-class university but is not a university, as was stressed by Senator O&rsquo;Toole, neither are the Geneva Institute nor the London School of Economics. What is important is to have quality education and access to it for as many people as possible.</P>
      <P>I accept Senators&rsquo; comments on the humanities and the arts. We did not particularly ask the OECD to examine these areas. We did not ask it to avoid examining them, hence they should not have been ignored completely. I have a humanities background and, in the context of a broad education where students can reach their potential and gain a balanced outlook on life to contribute to society and culture, we must have an advanced humanities and arts programme. I will not accept the proposal that the humanities council will be subsumed into Science Foundation Ireland. We could not hope for it to retain its identity if that occurred. I see no threat in this report to humanities and the arts in institutes and universities.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I, too, met one of this report&rsquo;s authors and told him he had given me the blueprint for higher education. He replied that he had not but that he and his colleagues did give us a set of proposals from which to choose. There were many discussions on funding, which is crucial. There were some discrepancies in that people said that on the one hand the universities need to be funded but, on the other, requested that there be no fees for evening and part-time courses. A balance has to be found. It is important to note that funding has increased by 90% in the universities sector in seven years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been reduced in proportion to the money given to the institutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Funding has increased by 102% for the institutes although student numbers have increased by only 28%. The level of research has also improved. Under the national development plan, &euro;2.5 billion is being spent, with &euro;605 million of that figure going on the programme for research in third level institutions, PRTLI.</P>
      <P>One of the key proposals talked of was the idea of placing the institutes under the HEA. Subject to the approval of Government, it was my intention to do so immediately in terms of their administrative basis to give the institutes the status and recognition. However, as I indicated to them at the colloquium last week, the legal advice is that <Col N="821"/>I cannot do so without legislation. In the next few weeks we will be bringing a document to Government regarding how we might move ahead on the OECD report but unfortunately I cannot move on the issue in question as quickly as I would have liked, although the intention was there.</P>
      <P>Internationalisation was mentioned. E-learning was not covered, but that is a whole new ball game which will develop separately but also as part of the development of the third level institutes.</P>
      <P>Regarding internationalisation, we had a very successful visit to China. We are encouraging and attracting people on the basis of a quality education. We are not looking for many thousands of students but for top quality students to come and receive a top quality education. We want to ensure that we can meet our targets on the Bologna process but also to guarantee that Irish students will not lose places simply because we are trying to attract foreign students.</P>
      <P>All Senators have noted the importance of access and the ladder of progression. Senator Henry talked about the investment needed at pre-school level. Senator Ormonde spoke about second level and Senator Tuffy spoke of disadvantage at that level, which we are currently working on, drafting and redrafting proposals. We will shortly come back to that matter.</P>
      <P>Access has been improved. What I am concerned about in the third level sector is retention and supports for people. There seems to be an attitude in some of the institutes that once they attract students who are deemed to be disadvantaged for whatever reasons, those students can survive on their own, when in reality they cannot do so. I have to challenge the universities and institutes to ensure they have proper support programmes in place for these students when they attract them to their institutions.</P>
      <P>This important report has raised a range of topics. I do not intend implementing it word for word but I intend to implement the key recommendations which can allow Ireland to further develop the quality third level education we have in this country with a view to fostering the type of industrial spirit we have, to foster the knowledge economy, to ensure we can meet Ireland&rsquo;s future needs in the world economy and also to ensure that all students are given an opportunity to reach their potential whether it be in the humanities, arts, sciences or medicine.</P>

    <Title>Child Care Services: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to make a statement to Seanad &Eacute;ireann regarding the implementation of the equal opportunities child care programme.</P>
      <P>The programme for Government and the progress of the equal opportunities child care programme are confirmation of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to developing child care services and to keeping child care at the forefront of its social <Col N="822"/>agenda. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has responsibility for the development of child care to meet the needs of working parents and those in education and training preparatory to labour market participation through the implementation of the equal opportunities child care programme or EOCP, the current phase of which covers the period from 2000 to 2006.</P>
      <P>The EOCP has both an equal opportunities and a social inclusion perspective and aims,<i> inter alia, </i>to increase the supply of centre-based child care places by 55% by the end of the programme. The broad objectives of the equal opportunities child care programme are to improve the quality of child care and to maintain and increase the number of child care facilities and places and to introduce a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of child care services.</P>
      <P>The EOCP is structured into two measures of the regional operational programmes with significant European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, European Social Fund, ESF, and Exchequer supports available. The programme makes capital grant assistance available to community-based, not-for-profit child care groups and to private child care providers to facilitate the creation of new and enhanced child care places. Community-based not-for-profit groups which provide services for very disadvantaged families can also receive grant assistance towards their staffing costs to enable them to support parents who would not be able to afford the full cost of child care.</P>
      <P>The key criteria against which project proposals are appraised for funding to provide new and enhanced services and to support the staffing costs of services in disadvantaged areas include the socio-economic and demographic profile of the area, the quality of the proposal, the capacity of the group to implement the project, the level of integration and co-ordination and the costings and value for money. In Ireland in the 1980s and 1990s, as more mothers tended to return to the workforce, the child care needs of parents continued to be most frequently met by family or neighbours. The potential of the female labour force as an impetus for future economic growth, together with the economic needs of many couples, continues to contribute to an increase in female participation in the labour force. EU equality legislation endorsed the need for expanded opportunities for women.</P>
      <P>The overall result of these changes was an increased awareness of the need for expanded child care services to support the participation of both parents in the labour market. The first meeting of the expert working group on child care established under Partnership 2000 was held within a month of the Government changeover in 1989 and all the evidence shows that child care has been high on the agenda of the Government since that time. It has consistently moved promptly and purposefully to facilitate the development of a top quality child care service <Col N="823"/>across the country. The achievements in respect of child care are a testament to that commitment and have helped in no small way to support the child care needs of parents in employment, education and training and assisted many of them to break the cycle of disadvantage.</P>
      <P>The recommendations of the working group were published in 1999. The Government proceeded to implement these through the National Development Plan 2000-06. The working group made recommendations in respect of both the supply and demand side of child care. On the demand side, the Government has, to date, favoured the use of child benefit to assist parents with the costs of parenting, including those relating to child care, because it is income-neutral and affords parents choices regarding the arrangements they choose to make in respect of the care of their children. It has increased the monthly child benefit payment since 1997 by a significant 272%. The annual cost of child benefit is now over &euro;1.9 billion.</P>
      <P>Our focus in this debate is on the EOCP, which largely addresses supply issues. The supply side of child care was supported through a major investment in the national development plan. The action is being supplemented by capital tax incentives, provided by Government, which have also led to the development of large-scale cr&egrave;ches and have further increased the availability of child care. The Department of Finance has also made funding available to expand the provision of cr&egrave;ches for civil servants. Since it was launched in 2000, the total funding package for the 2000-06 phase of the equal opportunities child care programme has increased from &euro;317 million to &euro;499.3 million, or by 57%. The most recent increase was that of &euro;50 million announced in the budget. These increases took place for a number of reasons and are worth acknowledging.</P>
      <P>In the first instance, the programme budget increased from &euro;317 million to &euro;436 million, with an increase in provision made at the time of the social partnership agreement on the anti-inflationary package. Actual funding for child care increased in recognition of the need to further develop the child care sector, while responsibility for the development of child care for school-going children also transferred to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. As part of the EU-supported national development plan, the EOCP was reviewed at mid-term stage and was deemed to be very successful in working towards its end targets. The Government considered it appropriate to increase the funding package by a further &euro;13 million, including the provision of some additional EU funding from the performance reserve.</P>
      <P>Such has been the dynamic for the development of child care which has grown at local level since the start of the EOCP that there was something of a funding crisis in terms of capital development last year. The Government has <Col N="824"/>responded positively to the arguments put forward at Cabinet by the Minister, Deputy McDowell, and his officials and, as a result, the budget provided a Government commitment to the injection of a further &euro;50 million in capital funding under the current programme and a further &euro;40 million in additional capital funding in the next phase of the EOCP to the end of 2009. The latter decision facilitated the largest ever single announcement by the Minister of capital funding grants, totalling some &euro;35 million, for child care in December 2004, almost as soon as the budget provision had been revealed. While some groups were naturally somewhat disappointed that they were not included in that announcement, I give them every assurance that the Minister and the Department, together with our partners in ADM who appraise all applications, are working to approve, as soon as possible, all capital projects which clearly address local child care service gaps and represent good value for money.</P>
      <P>I understand the Minister hopes to be in a position to announce a further large-scale capital allocation at Easter, if not before, and that he also hopes to make further announcements of capital funding in a planned manner later this year and thereafter. In light of the large amounts of public funding involved, there is an onus on the Department to manage the flows of capital funding broadly in line with its annual funding provision which can sometimes cause necessary delays in making grant applications.</P>
      <P>Total funding already committed under the EOCP to date will, when fully drawn down, create 33,254 new child care places throughout every county in Ireland. Of these, 20,500 were already in place by June 2004. This represented an increase of 36% in the supply of child care places in four short years. The funding remaining to be allocated will further increase the supply of quality child care places throughout the country. Every county has already benefited from the creation of additional child care facilities under the EOCP. All groups which benefited from the programme are encouraged to provide services to the maximum allowed in respect of their particular services under the child care regulations and to remain open for at least 46 weeks per year to facilitate parents in employment. These new places offer parents greater access to child care as they meet their work and family needs. The EOCP also contributes towards the staffing costs of child care services which support parents who are at a disadvantage to enable those services to offer differential fee scales to benefit less advantaged families.</P>
      <P>We are aware that the number of women participating in the labour market has grown significantly from 483,000 in 1995 to 771,000 in 2004. The need, therefore, for child care has increased enormously during the period. It is estimated that as many as 220,000 children require child care while their parents are in employment or education or training in preparation for labour <Col N="825"/>market participation. The Government&rsquo;s policy is to offer parents choices in respect of child care. The survey of child care undertaken by the Central Statistics Office in 2003 shows that involvement of the extended family and child minders to provide child care support remains the preferred choice for child care in many families. While much of the focus of the EOCP is on centre-based child care, the Government recognises that many parents prefer to use child minders and it has put in place an initiative under the programme to enhance quality awareness among child minders. The latter is being delivered by the city and county child care committees.</P>
      <P>As a result of the relatively high adult carer to child ratios that are essential to ensure the delivery of a safe, quality child care service, the cost of delivering child care is necessarily high. It is in this context that the EOCP helps new community-based facilities with their staffing costs in the early days as they move towards sustainability. Similarly, it is likely that a number of community-based services located in areas of significant disadvantage will require ongoing contributions towards their staffing costs. However, given the importance of labour market participation in breaking the cycle of disadvantage, the advantages to society in the long term of these supports will outweigh their cost in the short term. We are currently reviewing the arrangements for the continuation of staffing grant assistance to community groups that provide services for particularly disadvantaged parents. Again, the range of issues to be addressed is quite wide. The Department is, however, cognisant of the needs of the child care groups and hopes to be in a position to advise them on any new arrangements at the earliest opportunity.</P>
      <P>I am aware there has been considerable media discussion regarding the comparative cost of child care in different countries in recent times. It is my view that an international comparison of the cost of child care can only be drawn by considering the full package of taxation, central and local, and other supports, direct and indirect, made available to child care providers in each country, together with a review of the structure and disposable income of family units. I am unaware of the existence of any thorough and up-to-date study which shows a valid comparison of the cost of child care in Ireland against that which obtains in other countries.</P>
      <P>The increase of over 30,000 new child care places and the rapid expansion of the child care sector have had a considerable and positive impact on employment within that sector. These new child care places are likely to lead to the creation of up to 4,000 new employment opportunities for child care practitioners. The opening of new quality facilities will afford progression opportunities to appropriately trained staff. These will contribute to the creation of a better developed child care sector where people can work in well appointed facilities and can seek promotion opportunities either within their cur<Col N="826"/>rent place or employment or elsewhere. Such factors are important in sustaining a high-quality workforce in the sector.</P>
      <P>As previously stated, the availability of tax benefits has also stimulated the availability of child care places. I understand that the child care directorate of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is considering carrying out a survey of families in each county which will serve for forward planning of services. This survey will also help us assess Ireland&rsquo;s progress towards the Barcelona targets for child care provision, under which each member state of the European Union aims to provide places for a third of all children under three. In addition, the aim is for an early education place for 90% of children from age three to the time they start compulsory education. These targets are again linked to labour market participation, particularly for women. Writing almost two years ago, the OECD group, which under the thematic review of early childhood education and care in Ireland on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, noted:</P>
      <P LI="1">To have launched such an ambitious programme is already a real achievement in the Irish context, where few or no models were available. Moreover, the programme has been able to maintain a focus on equality of opportunity, staff support affordability and social inclusion, with 92% of funding going towards the community sector.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This is praise indeed for the efforts of the Government and also those involved in the delivery of the EOCP, be they administrators of the programme or applicants and project developers for the community and private child care sectors. Apart from making considerable progress in increasing the supply of centre-based child care places, the Government is enhancing the awareness of quality issues across a widened range of activities being supported under the EOCP. The programme focuses on many of the equality issues identified in the national child care strategy and aims to ensure a co-ordinated approach is taken to the delivery of child care services throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Central to the development of child care at local level are the 33 city and county child care committees. The remit of the 33 committees is to advance child care service provision with local areas through the following: the development of a co-ordinated strategy for child care provision in an area based on analysis and needs, overseeing effective implementation against targets set by the committee; the development of an information strategy concerning the provision of child care within the county, which updates and develops the baseline provided in the national children&rsquo;s census; and the development and support of local countrywide networks and initiatives, which target all categories of child care providers.</P><Col N="827"/>
      <P>Membership of each city and county child care committee is broadly based and representative of the key stakeholders in the child care sector concerned. Committee members give freely of their time to the process. It is recommended that the structures be balanced to include representation from the statutory sector, social partners, local development partnerships, national voluntary child care organisations, parents and the providers of child care. The establishment process was facilitated by the health boards. The first such committee was established in Galway and is very much a success story.</P>
      <P>The county child care strategy is implemented through a series of annual action plans, which are also subject to thorough appraisal before applicants are approved for funding by the Minister, through a programme appraisal committee structure. The committees are engaged in a wide range of developmental work to advance the availability of quality child care within counties. As regards the broader issues of early childhood care and education, a number of different pieces of interdepartmental work are ongoing. These include the high level group on child care and early childhood education chaired by the National Children&rsquo;s Office, which was established to consider the issue of co-ordination in the child care and early education areas, while the National Economic and Social Forum is currently reviewing developments since the publication of the White Paper on early education and the national childhood strategy in the 1990s. Both of these pieces of work will inform our future thinking.</P>
      <P>In closing, it is only fair to emphasise that the equal opportunities child care programme has been central to the development of child care in Ireland over the past five years. We all recognise the child care sector has flourished over the past seven or eight years and will continue to do so under the careful stewardship of the Government which has recognised the need to foster the sector and which has provided significant funding, both directly and indirectly, to support that growth. The panoply of supports made available under the EOCP and the broader range of Government initiatives to support the child care sector is a testament to its commitment to support parents in meeting both their child care and employment needs for the economic and social betterment of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is again welcome to the House for this important debate. It is of great concern to many of us and we have managed to debate it while discussing other Bills in this House because of its importance to women. As the Minister of State can see, only female Members are in the House, despite fathers being parents with responsibilities as well. In this House, it always appears to be the women who speak on family issues. It is a pity we do not see more men, but I expect some men may speak on <Col N="828"/>this issue during the course of this afternoon&rsquo;s debate.</P>
      <P>By and large I welcome and support the work being done under the equal opportunities child care programme. While we are playing catch-up in the area of child care, at the same time one must welcome the work being done under the programme. That work and funding have resulted in more community child care places being made available. There are also more trained personnel and children from disadvantaged areas in particular are benefiting. I welcome and commend the work being done by the various county child care committees. The couple of disadvantages I have to highlight include the fact that funding will run out. I ask that it be continued after the National Development Plan 2000-06. Perhaps the Minister of State in his reply might address what will happen when the funding runs out. Even the current programme needs additional funding and I would like to see that happening.</P>
      <P>We are playing catch-up as regards the provision of child care. Irish society is completely different from what it was 30 years ago. In 1971 there were far fewer women in the workplace. Today, the increase in the percentage of women working is 140%. That is an enormous change in our society and the stresses and strains it puts on families is evident every day. We hear more and more about this from families who are under stress. They are demanding the implementation of more family-friendly policies in every area of life. While the Government is responding, it is doing so slowly. We need to see greater and faster change in this regard. OECD studies show that Irish women&rsquo;s participation in the workplace is at the EU average of 56%.</P>
      <P>We are going to see some changes and I want to quote from a press release issued by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions which asserts that child care costs and availability will drive women from the workplace. It is headed,&ldquo;Working families burdened with equivalent of second mortgage&rdquo;, and states:</P>
      <P LI="1">Childcare costs and availability risk driving women from the workplace unless there is immediate action. For too many working families the monthly cost of childcare is almost the equivalent of a second mortgage.</P>
      <P LI="1" el="0">Many younger working families find that burden very very difficult to deal with and it has led to one or other partner giving up work, or cutting back on working hours in order to reduce the childcare bill. Most often, it is the woman who will make that sacrifice. In addition, many working families cannot access childcare facilities in their locality.</P>
      <P LI="1" el="0">A recent survey found that almost two-thirds of cr&egrave;ches had waiting lists at the end of 2003. This has huge implications for employment equality, the role of women and indeed, continued economic growth. After all, a key factor in driving recent growth has been the increased number of women in the workforce.</P><Col N="829"/>
      <P FLI="0">Congress also cited ESRI figures from 2003 that showed a 2.5% drop in female workers aged between 20 and 24, as well as a 1.6% drop in female workers aged between 25 and 34. This the first time such a drop has been seen in a decade. Congress went on to state that it believed such worrying figures reveal that women are being forced to choose to stay at home because child care costs are so prohibitive. It will be a sad day for women if they have to give up their jobs because they cannot afford child care costs.</P>
      <P>Many families with one child will struggle to meet those costs along with their mortgage or rent costs. When a second child comes, it is really crunch time for many families. Couples feel restricted in the number of children they can afford to have and that is a pity. If we look to some of the countries in Europe, where they have found that couples are having only one child, incentives are now being put in place to make it easier for parents, usually the mother, to stay at home for a number of years. While they may have an ulterior motive, which is to encourage them to have more children due to the drop in population and concern about the provision of pensions in the future, it is also for the good of the child. That could also happen here in a few years time. The principal reason must be to support the child and to ensure that he or she has a good upbringing.</P>
      <P>When we talk about child care to enable parents to go to work, we must also remember that early education is a beneficial provision for a young child. We know that children benefit from early education. It is not right to target people from disadvantaged areas, but they are usually in the lower socio-economic division and children from those areas will benefit greatly from early education. I would like to see much more being done to make it more available and accessible to parents from disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>I suggest that we take a broader view and look at our infrastructure. When we build schools and community centres in developing areas, we should not just look at the provision of primary and secondary schools. We should take an holistic view of the entire life cycle of the community and look at the provision of facilities for pre-school children as well as after-school provisions for older children. Such facilities should be built into complexes. We should think about how working parents have to plan their day, where they take the young child to a cr&egrave;che and the older child to school, often in different directions. If we look at how we plan our infrastructure, it would be of great benefit to families. We should provide early education locally in a complex that deals with all types of education for children.</P>
      <P>A number of private child care providers have pointed out to me that they have to pay rates on their buildings. I have also been contacted by families who used these private cr&egrave;ches because the cost of the rates is enormous. It is very difficult for child care providers to make a profit and the cost of those rates are being passed on to parents. Child care facilities should be treated in <Col N="830"/>the same way as schools. The private sector is providing a great facility and service and we need more private sector cr&egrave;ches. Making them affordable is what they are trying to achieve. If they could be excluded from rates, it would help in keeping the costs down. We would be doing a service to providers and to parents, who are the users of the child care facilities.</P>
      <P>This is one the biggest issues facing families today and if we do not address it, we will lose women from the workforce. These are women who are well educated and who have a contribution to make to our economy. They have already made a contribution to the economic growth in this country. If parents have to leave work because of child care costs, that is a loss to our economy. It is very hard to regain that loss, as these women come from a skilled base of acquired knowledge. Women are slow to give up their jobs. They know that by taking many years out of work, it is hard to get back into the workforce again. We do not make it easy for them.</P>
      <P>Last week we debated the Parental Leave (Amendment) Bill 2004 and I remind the Minister that this Bill does nothing to help parents during their working lives. This is particularly the case for parents on low income as they cannot afford to take unpaid parental leave. I ask the Minister to look at this issue again and to introduce paid parental leave. We need flexible work friendly practices so that women can participate in the workforce and are not excluded. Lone parents feel most excluded from the workforce because they find it so difficult to meet their rent or mortgage costs on one salary, as well as trying to pay for child care. It is almost impossible for them to do so, yet they are criticised for staying at home. A stay at home mother makes a great contribution to society. I applaud women and couples who take the decision to stay at home unpaid. The contribution they are making to society goes unrecognised.</P>
      <P>When a number of parents were surveyed in 2002, 62% of mothers and 86% of fathers in Ireland stated that they would like to spend more time with their family. While one in six of the population is in part-time work, over 70% of such workers are women. Much of that would be down to the provision of child care. I welcome what the equal opportunities child care programme is doing.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that we are playing catch-up, there is no guarantee that funding for the programme will continue to be provided. While some women are at risk of being driven out of the workforce, others do not get the recognition they deserve for staying at home to look after their children.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, to the House. I am the first speaker from my party as Senator Kett, our spokesman in this area, was good enough to allow me to use his slot to give me more time to make my points. It is not the case that he is not <Col N="831"/>interested in the subject as he will speak later in the debate. There are many men in Fianna F&aacute;il who are interested in the child care issue.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that the Minister of State and I are west Galway colleagues as we may not be friends at the end of the debate.</P>

	<P>That is not possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>Of all issues which have arisen since I entered the House in 1997, none has caused me greater concern or made me feel more of a failure in Fianna F&aacute;il than the Government&rsquo;s approach to child care. Despite attempts on many occasions to solve the problem, I stand here in 2005 to note that we have not done so. I have had two children since becoming a Senator and after the birth of each I thought circumstances would improve. Sadly, they have not, for which I must share the collective responsibility as a member of my party. We have failed and continue to do so. When one listens to fine words like those of the Minister of State this evening, the reason becomes obvious. We have not listened carefully enough to identify the real cause of the problem.</P>
      <P>I make my point in recognition of the action which has been taken. Child benefit has been increased on foot of its adoption in the programme for Government as the universal mechanism to tackle child care costs and child poverty. As the mother of four children who receives child benefit every month, I acknowledge how fantastic the provision is. However, it fails to address child care costs. While the essential policies the Government adopted to create more child care places have been successful and I recognise the foresight and effort of Ministers in formulating them, there are still not enough spaces and nothing has been done to reduce costs. I also recognise the role of the Ombudsman for Children and the difference the office will make to the care of children.</P>
      <P>Senator Terry&rsquo;s views on parental leave, which was discussed in the House over the past two weeks, were correct. Parental leave is only of benefit to those who can afford to take time off or who work in organisations which can afford to provide them with one or two days off per week over a given period. The economy is based on the success of small and medium enterprises. Until we create a context in which employers can allow people to take 14 weeks off work by providing paid leave, parental leave will be of no benefit to most workers. If one works for the HSE, a local authority or Department, one can take a day off per week per child for the next five years, which is excellent. However, the Government must listen to the pleas of small businesses which cannot afford to make such provision. We must solve the problem by discussing parental leave and providing a payment to cover it. Perhaps it is time to examine the mix of child benefit and parental leave to help people meet the costs involved.</P><Col N="832"/>
      <P>Our talk of family, work-life balance and the creation of a sexy agency to distribute wonderful posters is a waste of time. Those of us who are working mothers do not have the time to think about these matters. We do not know how to deal with the stress of trying to address the work-family balance. If one still has two hours of work to do at 6 p.m., one may wonder if one will get out the door and who will pick up the children. An argument is inevitable when one phones one&rsquo;s husband to say he must collect the children and he insists it must be the other way around. In that context family-friendly policies and the idea of a work-life balance are a joke. We must take real actions, such as the provision of a double-tax relief on the incomes of workers in companies which allow their employees to go home during family-friendly hours.</P>
      <P>Additional moneys should be granted to companies to put in place policies to support people who need to work fewer hours or job share. My focus is on support for small organisations as Departments, local authorities, the HSE and multinationals can cope. Small organisations employ people on a daily basis and create the wealth we enjoy which allows us to make choices about how we use our resources. We must cease to make the work-life balance a joke. We all need the Government to make a difference.</P>
      <P>While the national children&rsquo;s strategy is wonderful, more needs to happen to follow it through. The children&rsquo;s ombudsman is crucial in this context. I acknowledge that the initiative was put in place by the current Government with the involvement of the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, in one of his previous roles. While county child care committees are great, has the Minister of State ever received a call from someone in the constituency to say his or her facility had been deemed by a committee to have one child too many or to be too small and will, therefore, be closed? Subsequent to such a call, 25 mothers will be on the phone to ask what they will do when the cr&egrave;che is closed within days. Complete pandemonium ensues. Improved communications and a flexible approach to regulation are required. It may even be time to review the regulations in this area. In a large cr&egrave;che, does the absence of an additional 6 sq. ft. of space make such a difference that parents must be required to wonder where to bring a child the following week when it is closed?</P>
      <P>The real problems are the cost of child care, a lack of recognition and unpaid parental leave. It is very cost effective to employ a child minder if one has three, four or five children and to deduct tax from the salary, pay PRSI and insure the house to allow someone to come in. However, one does not receive a tax-free allowance to do so. As a Senator, I receive a salary of &euro;50,000, which translates to &euro;3,000 per month. It barely covers the cost of a child minder. It is net income on which tax has been paid but then I pay more tax and PRSI for which I get no recognition. All <Col N="833"/>any parent wants is some form of recognition and support to make life easier.</P>
      <P>In the good old days we used to laugh at the idea of a double income with no kids, but now it is a case of a double income with kids and it is bloody hard. A couple may have a mortgage and two car loans if they work in different locations, but if they have a child, they must also pay &euro;1,000 per month to a cr&egrave;che. Senator Terry was right to point out that people begin to wonder if they can afford a second child, which would mean &euro;2,000 per month, and wonder what would happen if there were a little mistake. It goes on and on. We have created a new stratum of social disadvantage which exists not in our local authority estates but in middle-class estates where men and women pay taxes, PRSI, doctors&rsquo; bills, as they do not have medical cards, and fund activities for their children which create additional facilities and incomes for people. They contribute continually to our economy but we ignore them. We are certainly not making life easy for them.</P>
      <P>At issue are recognition and equality for women. If a couple have a second or third child, the question arises as to who will give up work. In many cases it is the mother, not the father, who does so. Fair play to the mother, because she is walking away from a lot. She went to school and college and worked really hard at her job for the first five, six or seven years. She is giving it all up to leave the workforce and come back in five six or seven years&rsquo; time. It is not easy. I run a recruitment agency in Galway and know what it is like. I know how difficult it is for women to return to work after six, seven, eight, nine or ten years. It is virtually impossible, unless these women can up-skill. That is another challenge for us.</P>
      <P>The cost of child care discriminates against women and middle-class families where both parents go out to work and pay child care costs. What can we do? What sort of ideas have we got? It is not about bashing the Government; it is about coming up with a solution. When we asked for this debate, we talked about coming up with a solution. Child benefit is not the answer to child care costs. It is part of the solution but it is not the entire solution. I will say as much at parliamentary party meetings and we need to keep saying it.</P>
      <P>We must also recognise the importance of both parents working. We must address the issue of parental leave and ensure that parental leave is available to both parents and that there is some form of payment. We recognise this issue with regard to carers and maternity benefit. Why can we not recognise it with regard to parental leave? We should start small and increase it time by time. If we stop increasing child benefit payments by huge amounts we can perhaps look at how to allocate payments over a broader spectrum. Let us look at financial initiatives for organisations. What additional tax incentives and grant aid supports can be given, particularly to small organis<Col N="834"/>ations, to assist them in introducing the type of initiative we seek?</P>
      <P>Senator Terry referred to infrastructure. Has anybody tried to get up at 7 a.m., make six bottles, get the children up, feed them their breakfast and get the first child ready for the cr&egrave;che drop-off at 8 a.m.? Senators must remember that this is what can be involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>It happens to everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>It does. Has anybody tried to do all this, then get the children ready, put them into the car and do the drop-off at the cr&egrave;che? School does not start until 8.50 a.m. but one must be in work at 8.30 a.m. and everybody is going in different directions. It is impossible. What is one like when one gets to work at 9.30 a.m? We should probably not even consider that.</P>
      <P>Earlier I alluded to the regulation of cr&egrave;ches and child care committees. The system is not very flexible. When one makes an appeal to a child care committee and speaks to the person in charge, including the inspector, they are reasonable in their response. However, they put the fear of God into the person who runs the cr&egrave;che and the mothers and fathers who have children there. It is neither fair nor right. That additional worry is not needed. While it is important to ensure children are well looked after, there must be some flexibility. A person who runs a cr&egrave;che recently said that when a worker is out sick most organisations can get cover for them. However, if one is running a cr&egrave;che and a worker is out sick, woe betide if that is the day an inspector calls to the premises because there is no way he or she will believe it just happened like that. It is that simple.</P>
      <P>Why can we not disregard all income in respect of those who look after children in their own home? The Government introduced a disregard for &euro;6,000 in respect of the rent a room scheme. We are essentially saying it is better to get &euro;6,000 from renting a room than from looking after children. We could immediately create a whole new economy, not a black but a legitimate one, by providing a similar disregard in this area and giving value to the work done by those women at home.</P>
      <P>When one gets pregnant, the first date one makes is not with the gynaecologist but with the cr&egrave;che. The cr&egrave;che is going to take the baby, so one does the tour of the cr&egrave;ches. I do not know what it is like in Dublin, but I know what it is like in Galway. If one is an employer, female employees will come in devastated and in tears, not because they are unable to come back to work but because they are unable to find a cr&egrave;che. It is impossible.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State is a straight talker and he referred to making comparisons with the situation in Europe. It is a bureaucratic approach to say that a comparative approach will be taken on the question of structures and supports. The Minister of State should forget these and look at what people pay on a daily and weekly basis and <Col N="835"/>compare those instead. That is what we need to address and until we do so we will not deal with the cost of child care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Cox&rsquo;s excellent contribution was very interesting because it reminded me of the situation of 30 years ago. Sadly, no progress whatsoever seems to have been made in the area of child care. It is depressing that I have been in this House for 12 years and that one of the first things I did was to look, with Deputy Mary Wallace, for a site which would be suitable for child care within the environs of Leinster House. We located several places, but there is nowhere for staff or members of either House to have their children looked after. We will have a swimming pool and a gym before we have somewhere for children to be looked after, despite the great demand.</P>
      <P>Senators Cox and Terry spoke about the involvement of women in the workplace. The issue of women in education has made a huge difference in the involvement of women in the workplace and in the economic success of the country. We have just discussed the OECD report on higher education. Part of it showed more women than men now attend our third-level institutions. There has been a huge increase in participation by women. More women also go on to do postgraduate degrees and post-doctoral research. They are not just staying in education until the age of 24 or 25 years, but perhaps until they are 30 and involved in research, which is extremely important for the success of the country. These women have serious difficulties in terms of child care because they are on much lower grants and funding than those in employment. They are in a serious situation. I am a member of a trust association in Trinity College which tries to help students with difficulties. Appeals for funding for a cr&egrave;che in addition to the one we already have is one of the most urgent issues we must address.</P>
      <P>There is another issue which I have raised over the years and which I consider would be helpful in the area of child care. Senator Cox mentioned that one cannot get tax relief on child care or elder care, etc. It is terribly difficult, because one is, after all, employing another person. France, which has good municipal child care, has a system whereby one can buy special books of cheques in banks, building societies or post offices which can only be used for employing people in one&rsquo;s home. One can buy cheques each year up to the approximate value of &euro;5,000 to &euro;6,000, and use them to pay for child care, elder care, grinds or piano classes. One does not pay tax on the money, nor does the person receiving the cheque. It cuts out the black economy. It is a very useful way of ensuring people can get other people to work in their house for a certain amount of time. It gives them tax relief without costing the State a great deal of money. Perhaps the Minister of State could raise this issue again. I had hoped the former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, <Col N="836"/>would look favourably on the matter before he went to higher places, but it did not happen. Perhaps the present Minister, Deputy Cowen, will do something when I put it forward.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State and Senator Terry raised the very important issue of child care for children in disadvantaged areas. As we saw in the OECD report, free fees have not resulted in more people from poorer socio-economic backgrounds accessing third-level education. These people fall out of education at a much earlier stage and must be helped at pre-school, primary and secondary stages. In parts of Dublin, the success of breakfast, dinner and homework clubs shows how much they are appreciated. They are extremely popular and seem to play an important role in keeping young people at school.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The issue of parental leave, which we discussed last week, was addressed. Without such leave, a great number of people could not avail of programmes to enable them to return to education. As I pointed out in last week&rsquo;s debate, this is one of the most important factors in retaining people within the workforce. Mr. Peter Sutherland seems to think that we will not need 45,000 immigrants annually but almost double that figure to fulfil our economic requirements.</P>
      <P>Recently, there have been some extremely ill-informed and malicious comments concerning teenage mothers. It was stated that they were becoming pregnant to avail of the State&rsquo;s largesse. That stupid idea had been put firmly to rest, however, because there is plenty of international evidence to show that is not so. Nonetheless, it is true that teenage mothers are likely to remain in poverty for the rest of their lives. It is vital to get them back into education as rapidly as possible.</P>
      <P>In the course of this debate someone said such mothers should not receive the lone parent&rsquo;s allowance unless they go to school. They will go to school but in some cases they may have fallen out with their families and so there is no one to mind the baby. Another problem is that in order to obtain the back-to-education allowance that might be used to pay a child minder, one must be out of education for two years. I cannot speak for the Minister of State, but if I had left the education system at 16 years of age, it would have been much more difficult for me to re-enter it at 18. It is easier to recommence schooling after taking only a short gap to give birth. I hope the Minister of State will be able to get the Department of Social and Family Affairs to change its rules on this matter because they are not a good idea. Even attending a Youthreach programme counts as being in education. The existing rules do not constitute a good way of encouraging young people to resume their studies.</P>
      <P>Parental leave is extraordinarily important, particularly when children suffer from illness. The financial situation is difficult enough for two-parent families where both partners are working, but it is impossible for lone parents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and compliment him for batting out on the issue of child care on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; last Thursday. As previous speakers and the ladies in the Gallery know, child care is the most important issue facing thousands of parents in all income groups with babies and young children, as well as those couples hoping to have children. The availability of quality and reliable child care places at reasonable cost is a major concern for parents.</P>
      <P>Currently, 70% of child care places are provided in the informal economy, by neighbours, relatives and local child minders. However, the availability of such people is shrinking because unemployment is at an all-time low level and, in particular, women of all ages are pursuing careers. The remaining 30% of child care places exist in the formal economy, comprising a mix of full or part-time private and community services.</P>
      <P>Listening to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, one would think it was the other way around and that 70% of child care places were being provided in the formal economy. Despite all the talk of money being invested in child care, it is the informal economy that accounts for some 70% of child care places. I do not to have to spell out what that involves.</P>
      <P>There is no question but that, since 2000, EU-backed funding of community child care places has increased by one third, but the number of places available is woefully inadequate in every community. Much good has been achieved but the Government does not realise how inadequate the current child care policy is. For instance, the Government&rsquo;s reliance on child benefit as the main instrument of financial assistance does not make best use of the money spent. The payment of child benefit is largely irrelevant for well-off families and, given the cost of child care, it is of marginal assistance to most families.</P>
      <P>In reply to a parliamentary question on 11 May 2004, the former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, stated, &ldquo;It has been decided that child benefit will be the main fiscal instrument through which support will be provided to parents with dependent children. Unlike tax relief, child benefit provides support to parents irrespective of their income status&rdquo;. However, I would like to know why at least 12 or 13 official Government documents have suggested that tax relief is the major instrument by which child benefit should be provided. There has been an anti-poverty strategy, a National Development Plan 2000-06, the national child care strategy working group, the national children&rsquo;s strategy entitled Our Children &mdash; Their Lives, the report on consultation for a national action plan against poverty and social exclusion, and the White Paper on Early Childhood Education entitled Ready to Learn. The list of reports continues and most of them stated that tax relief was the way forward. When these documents were drawn up by professional people and sent to the Government, the Department of Finance officials decided to approach the issue by way of child benefit.</P><Col N="838"/>
      <P>In November, I made a presentation on child benefit to the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party. Most people sitting in that room did not know that such benefit for the first and second children amounts to &euro;34.50 per week. What in God&rsquo;s name would that sum contribute to child care costs? The cost of child care in Dublin is &euro;800 to &euro;1,200 per month. There are waiting lists for such facilities. The cost to parents with two children in a cr&egrave;che is the same as having a second mortgage but the downside is that there is no tax relief. The situation is disastrous.</P>
      <P>I have studied all the fabulous reports to which I referred earlier but what happened when they went to the Government? Officials from the Department of Finance said, &ldquo;No, we will do it by child benefit because we want it to be equal for everybody&rdquo;. In that respect, child benefit is a complete and utter farce.</P>
      <P>My proposal for tax relief would include parents on low incomes. If they use child care facilities they should get tax allowances or tax credits for their child care places. I do not wish to eliminate anybody but using child benefit as a policy instrument was a good way of avoiding the problem. It was said that the provision of child benefit helped everybody but that argument is pathetic.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>No politician will do away with that allowance but the way of dealing with child care and contributing towards it financially, is not through child benefit, which is a farce. Last week the House had a very good discussion on parental leave. Ireland is one of the few countries in Europe where the State does not make a financial contribution for parental leave. It was discovered that more women from the higher income groups avail of parental leave because women in lower income groups cannot afford to take it. I have studied this matter with colleagues for the past three months, as a result of which I call for tax relief on child care costs and I also call for&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>Would that not increase the cost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>No. Tax reliefs are utilised by Government for economic measures such as urban, rural and hotel developments. When there is an economic or social crisis the Government decides to use tax benefit to develop and grow areas where the need is greatest. Tax reliefs are commonly used fiscal instruments.</P>
      <P>The Celtic tigresses are now deciding they cannot have a second child because if they do they will have to stay at home. That is a fact. I talk to such people all the time. This is another bad example of fragmented Government activity. A total of 11 Departments deal with different aspects of family and child benefits. I call for a co-ordinated Government approach, which to <Col N="839"/>date has only been successfully achieved in one area. When the former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, came up with the proposal for a financial services centre he decided to take a co-ordinated Government approach. We now have a successful financial services centre contributing &euro;720 million to the economy.</P>
      <P>The present system is no way to help families. Other speakers referred to those who are disadvantaged. My child policy is a child-centred one. Every child should be the responsibility of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>That would be interference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>No. There were 12 people in my leaving certificate class. People could only go to school when Donagh O&rsquo;Malley provided free secondary education. We must have vision in regard to how we look after children. We must have a strategic child-centred policy. We do not want anybody to be excluded. I have visited cr&egrave;ches in recent weeks and witnessed the high degree of intellectual stimulation available to children who attend them. However, it is children whose parents can afford to send them to cr&egrave;ches that benefit from such a positive start for their children. The child of a single parent who cannot afford to send his or her child to a cr&egrave;che is missing out on the tremendous intellectual stimulation children attending cr&egrave;ches receive. In one cr&egrave;che in Herbert Street, children of one and a half years of age were painting. Every three year old in the country should be entitled to 15 hours of pre-school education per week. Children usually go to school at the age of four when they attend junior infants and then senior infants. We have to change the mindset that currently prevails.</P>
      <P>I have to be a little brash and say that in countries where there are more women in Parliament, such as in the Nordic countries where the percentage of female representation in parliament is closer to 40% or 50%, more family-friendly policies are enacted. There is no doubt that is the case in Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland.</P>

	<P>I believe in them. I have to win this debate. I urge the Government to change its mindset and introduce tax reliefs for child care and pre-school education. Everybody should be included. The approach taken must be child-centred. No child must be excluded. Children from low income families should not be excluded from all the exciting and stimulating programmes that exist for children. We now know that the early childhood years are critical for brain development.</P>
      <P>One can tell who will end up in trouble from observing children at the age of four. It is those who are disadvantaged. The implementation of <Col N="840"/>all the proactive measures to which I referred will help the country in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, to the House for this debate which I requested. I thank the Leader for facilitating statements on the important issue of child care.</P>
      <P>Other speakers have noted that so far all those who have spoken on the subject, with the exception of the Minister of State, have been female. That is not unusual in this House. I hope it is not an indication that this policy area is feminised, in other words one that is only of great concern to women. That said, I would not wish to undermine or downplay the passionate support that many women in the Oireachtas give to this subject. I acknowledge the work of Senator White in this area. I hope her party and the Government begin to listen to her soon.</P>
      <P>I will limit my remarks to the equal opportunities child care programme which is the subject of today&rsquo;s discussion. The Minister of State referred to the purpose of the programme. It is clear that the programme and the level of investment in it has made a great difference. We must bear in mind that it was coming from a base where there was effectively nothing. Prior to its inception, health boards were involved in the provision of a small level of child care in the community. The purpose of the equal opportunities child care programme is to improve the quality of child care in Ireland, increase the number of child care facilities in place and to introduce a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of services.</P>
      <P>I am a member of the board of the Nenagh child care centre which is a state-of-the-art facility that was opened last September. The Taoiseach visited the centre last Friday. It is a great centre that was built beside the county council offices with support from the council, the health board and the usual funders, including the programme under discussion. It is a fine facility which is doing very well, as I have no doubt it will continue to do. The facility is not the kind of one about which I would be concerned. It is in a heavily-populated area with enough support to allow it to successfully operate within the market.</P>
      <P>Two weeks ago I visited some child care facilities in Tallaght with other female members of the parliamentary Labour Party. This arose from concerns expressed by people &mdash; again mostly women &mdash; who were working in child care facilities and who were concerned about the crisis they face. The problem is not on the capital side. The Minister of State referred at length to capital funding in terms of the programme and the high level of grant aid available, which is excellent. It has resulted in the building of a state-of-the-art facility in Tallaght. The crisis arises in the context of staffing grants. Staffing grants are made available but they are not 100% staffing grants. Facilities operating in disadvantaged areas such as Tallaght simply cannot manage because the people who were using the facilities &mdash; who are <Col N="841"/>those one would want to use them &mdash; cannot meet the costs which the centre has to charge in order to stay in business.</P>
      <P>The EOCP is an excellent programme but it falls short. While a great deal of funding has gone into the programme &mdash; Senator White may be interested in hearing this &mdash; support for it is less than what the Government affords to the horseracing industry. The Government is giving greater support to the horseracing industry than it is to child care. That fact speaks volumes. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, has announced what appear, when examined on their own, to be considerable amounts of capital funding for this sector. However, the sector is underfunded when one considers what is required on the ground, given that the daily requirements of these centres are not being met, despite this capital funding.</P>
      <P>A recent OECD report on this sector stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">Without public management and sustained public funding, market-led child care provision remains fragmented and inequitable. For this reason, governments in the English-speaking countries are obliged to intervene constantly by increasing child care allowances, reviewing quality provision and even directly funding parts of the system.</P>
      <P FLI="0">We need to consider directly funding part of the system in Ireland, particularly in disadvantaged areas. We are only at the first block or foundation stone of building this process.</P>
      <P>The OECD report on early childhood education in Ireland was published in December 2003. It was published against the background of the Barcelona declaration, to which the Minister of State referred, and states that, as EU partners, we are committed to providing child care to at least 90% of children aged between three years and mandatory school age and at least 33% of children under three years of age by 2010. However, we are nowhere near achieving that target.</P>
      <P>The current Irish coverage for the three to six age group is the second lowest in Europe, which includes the primary sector. The pre-primary and pre-school sector barely exists. We must recognise and acknowledge the contribution of the voluntary sector, particularly pre-school playgroups and the nurseries association. We must also acknowledge the work done by these groups which are mostly comprised of women battling away to provide a service and a place where children can get the best start in life and receive high-standard provision at an affordable level.</P>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, is not in the House to respond to this issue but I will raise it nonetheless because it was raised with me. I did not see the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme on child care last week because I had a prior commitment. However, I understand the issue of low pay in the child care sector was raised and the Minister of State responded by stating that at least such workers were receiving the minimum <Col N="842"/>wage. If that is not the case, I apologise, but that is what was reported to me.</P>
      <P>I would be very disappointed if the Minister of State&rsquo;s attitude was that it is acceptable to operate on the basis of the minimum wage in the child care sector since that reflects a Government attitude that low pay is acceptable in that sector and is being tolerated. Child care in many areas also depends on community child care facilities, F&Aacute;S workers, CE scheme employees and so on. This is not necessarily a bad thing but it goes to show how unstable and relatively unsupported the entire sector is. I know people employed on community employment schemes who are doing excellent work, having been well trained on F&Aacute;S schemes.</P>
      <P>The Centre for Early Childhood Education and Development in Drumcondra, of which Heino Schonfeld is a director, points out that to operate at that level demonstrates a lack of full support and commitment to this area. It is not where we need to be. It would be acceptable in the interim or if it was sporadic but to find that most child care facilities rely on community employment workers to keep costs down and maintain staffing levels is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>The capping of staffing grants, to which I have already referred, is having a detrimental effect on child care facilities in disadvantaged and sparsely populated areas. I come from a rural constituency, as the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, knows since his base is next door to where I grew up. He will know that the population is insufficient in places such as Templederry and smaller areas where the community is trying to develop mother and toddler groups and other daytime child care facilities. Women in these communities are struggling to put in place some facility for their children and by not supporting these women we are cutting off our nose to spite our face. There is much evidence to show that investment in pre-school and early childhood education pays off greatly. This view is supported by the OECD and every other expert.</P>
      <P>The Competitiveness Council is not exactly an expert on child care but it is a Government body which is presumably committed to pointing out to us what we need to do to stay competitive. It has stated that the absence of targeted pre-primary initiatives is having an economic impact. It also points out that the school drop-out rate remains the same now as it was during the 1980s when times were much harder. Why is it that despite our economic prosperity and our investment, we are stuck with an unacceptably high level of early school leaving, which means that 18.2% of students currently do not complete second level education? The Competitiveness Council describes this as an untapped resource for the economy which represents a decrease in the average productivity of our workforce. It refers to the merits of targeting pre-primary interventions and states that potential long-term competitiveness benefits have not received much attention. In other words, we have looked at it from the child&rsquo;s <Col N="843"/>point of view but not from that of the long-term health and competitiveness of the economy. It is unacceptable to have that number of students not finishing secondary school, particularly considering our stated objective of becoming a knowledge-based economy. The only way to break this trend is to have well-resourced, targeted intervention at pre-school level.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>In other words, we should target those parts of the community in which the school drop-out rate is highest. We know where these are because there have been sufficient reports to almost identify where every child is but we are not doing anything about it. We need to intervene early and support poor families and lone parents. God knows there has been enough talk in recent weeks about lone parents. We could put in place a whole set of initiatives. For example, in Tallaght one could support lone parents in their homes, parents who are struggling with low or no incomes or those with a family history of social dependency. However, the most important factor would be that people would have access from day one to high quality pre-school and cr&egrave;che facilities in the community. The only way in which this will be done is by spending money but it will be an investment well worth making and it will pay off. However, this investment is not being made and, if that continues, we will remain stuck with the same problem recycling itself over and over again.</P>
      <P>If we are to prevent the cycle repeating itself, we must consider the assistance we are giving communities, the head start being given to a child and the support being given to the family. In purely economic terms, one must consider the contribution that a particular child could make as an adult in his or her own family and community. When one considers the cost of social deprivation and poverty to this economy and community, is it not worth examining this proposal? This is where this programme comes into its own as it could deliver our objectives.</P>
      <P>The equal opportunities child care programme was always supposed to be seen in the context of targeted interventions, particularly for children from disadvantaged communities. A town such as Nenagh would not have the same problem as some of the really deprived areas of our cities which are suffering major deprivation. The child care centre in Nenagh also gives huge support to children from those families through other initiatives, such as the ADM funded initiatives. That offers the chance to break down the cycle.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to examine this programme, particularly staffing grants. He should consider giving full funding to those areas that need it. He should also talk about sustainability in the long term rather than the short term. I understand from somebody in this sector that the Department has issued letters stating that the <Col N="844"/>centres must be sustainable by September 2005. Is that correct? If so, that is too short a term. It will take years for many of the facilities to be up and running. The facility in Nenagh is working well but centres in many other parts of the country will require far more support than they currently get.</P>
      <P>I have no wish to run down this programme; it is a great programme. Looked at in the context of what is required and the fact that it started from nothing, I must acknowledge, as the OECD does, that the structured approach that was put in place, that is, the county child care committees and the committees involving all stakeholders, is a good one. Setting it up was a laborious process and it took long enough. However, it is in place now and is working well. The right people are on the committees. The co-ordinated structure is in place but, again, it only scratches the surface of what is needed. It needs to be working better, particularly in disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>I am informed that the centre in Tallaght, which is due to open in March, is in danger of not opening because of underfunding for staff and the capping of the staffing grant. The centre simply cannot make up the additional income needed to sustain it. It is a scandal. The centre is a state-of-the-art facility and it is an integral part of how Tallaght is developing. It is also supported by the local authority. Will the Minister give his attention to that? I have received letters about this from people in all parts of the country. One letter is from a group in Charleville that is severely strapped for funding due to the staffing grant problem. This problem is arising everywhere and the Minister must respond to it.</P>
      <P>I have run out of time. I will raise this issue again, under a number of headings. As Senator White said, this matter does not belong to one Department but to many. I intend to find some way of targeting every Department on this issue. I have received great support from the Leader of the House in facilitating this approach. I am looking forward to a rolling debate and I certainly look forward to seeing results.</P>

	<P>I feel inadequate and vulnerable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The Senator is not inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett"><NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;after listening to Senator Cox&rsquo;s in-depth, realistic life experiences and knowing that Senator White has made this one of her main issues since becoming a Member of the House. Not having the in-depth knowledge or the hands on experience of these ladies, I am thankful at this stage that my family is almost reared.</P>
      <P>There has been massive social and economic change in this country, particularly for women, in the past 30 years. My wife worked in the Civil Service, as did Senator White. They had to give up their jobs when they got married. It was only <Col N="845"/>in the mid-1970s that women started to remain in the workplace after marrying. Even then, the majority more or less disappeared when they had their first child. They did so for different reasons. One was undoubtedly the shortage of child care, the subject of our discussion this evening. Many of the women who remained in the workplace &mdash; I am sure most of them needed to do so &mdash; did so because they probably had a family member or a good neighbour to assist them with child care.</P>
      <P>I was struck by some of the information in the document on the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006, particularly on the participation of women in the workforce. The survey showed that participation rates for women had increased to 49.5%, as distinct from 71% for men. That is a considerable increase since 1997. The relevant growth was 8%, which masked growth in absolute terms of 31%. The number of women in the workforce increased from 588,000 in 1997 to 770,000 at the end of December 2004.</P>
      <P>It is significant to look at the number of women in part-time and full-time employment in those figures. In the period 1997 to 2004, the number of women in full-time employment grew from 406,000 to 530,000, an increase of almost 31%. In the same period the number of women in part-time employment increased from 182,000 to 240,000, an increase of almost 33%. There is another interesting statistic in the document. A total of 13,000 women deemed themselves to be under-employed in 1997 but only 1,900 deemed themselves under-employed in 2002.</P>
      <P>This appears to suggest that women are quite happy to work part time. In my place of employment, women comprise between 75% and 85% of the workforce. I talk with them and deal with their requests for job sharing. An increasing number are seeking job sharing opportunities. There are a number of reasons for that. From the financial point of view, they probably consider it a better proposition to work part time and pay half the child care fees than to work full time and pay the full amount of fees. Although they lose in their net pay, they gain more by paying half fees for child care. That is a simple fact. My colleagues suggested that some assistance be given, whether it be as a tax break or in some other financial guise. Without doubt, in certain circumstances there is a need to give serious consideration to that issue. Our job as legislators is not to question whether people should work but it is our job to make choices available to them.</P>
      <P>The situation of lone parents has been discussed at length. I read in an article some time ago that, according to the 2002 census, there are 150,000 lone parents in the country, 85% of whom are lone mothers. Statistics show that lone parents are over-represented in the category of families living in poverty. Apart from families headed by somebody with a disability, lone parents are most in need of targeting in that regard. Despite what Kevin Myers might have thought, relatively few people decide to become lone parents. While people become lone parents <Col N="846"/>for a variety of reasons &mdash; death, separation, divorce, unplanned pregnancy, a member of the family being put in jail, or otherwise &mdash; it is traumatic whatever the circumstances. Moreover, lone parents are at high risk of falling into the poverty trap. Employment may be available but it may not be feasible for a lone parent to work, for a variety of reasons. I am sure not many employers would allow a lone parent to leave work to collect a child at school, for example. Serious consideration is required in this regard.</P>
      <P>Although I do not say this in a broad, sweeping way, many female lone parents would have less education and, hence, would probably find themselves in insecure jobs. It is impossible for such women to consider paying child care fees. In 1994, one-parent families accounted for one in 20 of those in consistent poverty; that figure in 2003 was one in five. Much work remains to be done to bring about a situation where lone parents can feel that we, as legislators and as a country, are in some way concerned with their well being.</P>
      <P>It is heartening to see the changes brought about by the equal opportunities child care programme. This is due in no small way to the great efforts of community based, not-for-profit organisations working in every corner of the country, trying to make it possible to deal with local child care needs. The number of new child care places being created under the programme is on the increase and, as a consequence, women can make their own choices in this regard.</P>
      <P>We are moving in the right direction. In recent months, the House passed the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Act 2004 and debated the Parental Leave (Amendment) Bill 2004. The latter Bill was much maligned by some but, whether one likes it, it is not a regressive but a progressive step. While we may in future find a way to encourage Government to make some form of payment or to lengthen terms, we are moving in the right direction in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I listened with interest to the debate and thought all the contributions were excellent. I thought it would be a case of &ldquo;Blessed art thou amongst women&rdquo; but as Senator Kett has intervened, I am not alone here. It has been the case with many men over the years that we have not taken our share of the responsibilities for child care, and I put my hand up in that regard.</P>
      <P>Ireland has changed significantly in the past ten to 15 years. Social and cultural changes have had a profound effect. Many families have two parents at work due to the necessity to pay for mortgages. They are forced to juggle the needs of their children and the demands of their careers or education. The squeeze is often harder on those lower down the income scale and those who are caring alone. The traditional pattern of the family, with the male earner and the female dependant at home caring for the children, is no longer the norm in Irish society.</P><Col N="847"/>
      <P>The Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 is an attempt to address the need for affordable, quality child care facilities. I acknowledge that the funding to date has made a difference in many areas. However, the Minister will be the first to acknowledge that much more needs to be done. The number of applications for capital assistance for deserving and worthwhile projects that have not received funding to date is a cause of great concern to the organisations involved. One example is my own constituency of Waterford. In Waterford city, of five community based projects, only one, the Larchville-Lisduggan project, has had funding allocated to date. There is a pressing need for child care facilities in this area, which I have represented for well over 20 years, and I have no doubt that the money would be well spent.</P>
      <P>Another positive aspect of the equal opportunities programme and the capital assistance scheme is that the grant aid is normally allocated for the full amount, allowing organisations to access it without the necessity of a local contribution, which was always a stumbling block in disadvantaged areas. While I am pleased with the allocation in the Larchville-Lisduggan area, four other projects in the city &mdash; at the St. Brigid&rsquo;s family centre, Farran Park, Ferrybank and the women&rsquo;s centre in Manor Street &mdash; are still in limbo. They do not know whether they are to receive funding this year or in coming years.</P>
      <P>The situation in County Waterford is similar. Dungarvan has received no funding for community based groups under the equal opportunities programme and capital assistance scheme. Likewise, Lismore has received no funding to date. County Waterford is in receipt of the lowest level of funding of all counties. Dungarvan, for a town of its size, has no purpose-built child care facility although there is an acute shortage of child care places across the spectrum of child care services. Even those who can afford to pay are faced with long waiting lists. There is evidence to suggest that many people are losing out on opportunities to participate in employment, education and training because of the lack of child care facilities in Dungarvan.</P>
      <P>Another important point which is mirrored throughout the country is that many parents active in community groups and, therefore, in contact with educational and training services, are unable to get involved due to the lack of flexible and affordable child care. This is particularly so for women and lone parent families. Will the Minister indicate when these projects will be reappraised? Is it likely they will receive funding this year or in coming years?</P>
      <P>OECD studies show that female employment in Ireland is at the EU average of 56%, an increase of 140% since 1971, which is a staggering development. Women&rsquo;s participation in the labour force is expected to grow by a further 218,000 by 2011. However, the number of parents raising children alone has risen. Employment <Col N="848"/>rates among lone parents are low and lone parent families are disproportionately at risk of poverty. Child care and other supports are necessary to allow them to access work, training and education, where necessary, to support their families.</P>
      <P>There is a growing awareness of the balance of rights and responsibilities among families, from children to parents and even grandparents. It is possible to have a society which values and supports childhood and the family, and to have public policies which enhance that value and support. Family support must be concentrated on meeting the needs of families. It should include more than health and well-being needs and should extend to the wider social inclusion needs of the family.</P>
      <P>For lower-income families, the gap has widened. Not all families can afford transport to visit dispersed family members, child care for working parents or the latest in electronic games to compensate for the lack of local play facilities. For other families on the average industrial wage, the need for both parents to work to pay the mortgage or to provide for family medical bills is a prerequisite. For many, there is no element of choice for one parent to work or stay at home to care for the children.</P>
      <P>The growing pressures facing families have been ignored. Rapid development has heaped disproportionate burdens on young families but especially young mothers. Work-life balance has become an issue because of wide-ranging economic and social changes. Over recent decades the support of extended families and communities has been diluted.</P>
      <P>When surveyed in 2002, 62% of mothers and 86% of fathers said they would like to spend more time with their families. While one in six of the population is in part-time work, over 70% of such workers are women. There is a general feeling in Ireland that those people who avail of initiatives such as job sharing and part-time work are less serious about their careers than those who do not have these opportunities. This is especially the case for people in higher status jobs. A recent survey shows that over 75% of respondents were reluctant to take parental leave, feeling that it would hinder their chances of promotion at work; 50% said they could not afford to take unpaid parental leave, an issue we have addressed. It is not financially possible for a family to avail of unpaid parental leave. One in five respondents said their employers would not facilitate taking such leave, another issue that has been addressed.</P>
      <P>This must change if we are to promote family-friendly working arrangements and a greater sharing of gender roles. Parents at work need more flexibility to deal with both longer term child care and emergencies involving their children during the day. Employers must remember that it is family members they employ and not just productive units. If families are dislocated firms will not be immune to the effects. Employers and the State must accept responsi<Col N="849"/>bility for this. We should review labour law to recognise the changes needed to accommodate a situation where both parents work and share in the obligations of parenting. We should also incentivise employers to assist the development of family-friendly work practices.</P>
      <P>Increasing the provision of adequate child care means more than encouraging women to return permanently to the workforce. Child care should be primarily a caring, developmental and early education service for the child and a service for parents. The policy focus on child care has been on its benefit to the labour market or its use as a poverty relief measure rather than as a support system for contemporary Irish families to show that they are valued. Parents today have difficulty finding local, affordable, accessible and high-quality services for their children. This must not continue. I echo the call for the long overdue tax relief on child care expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to what has been a good debate on the equal opportunities child care programme. My first-hand experience of this is in the north inner city of Dublin. Over recent years it has provided opportunities in training, education and employment to communities ravaged by four or five generations of unemployment. It gives people a choice. Whatever mechanisms are used, be it tax relief or otherwise, we should not forget that the original thrust of this programme was to provide opportunities for people to advance themselves and their families.</P>
      <P>Child care was at the bottom of the list of priorities for several years in many communities. It was provided by mothers and grandmothers as structured child care did not exist in these areas. In the overall context, though, the programme has come very far. The Minister outlined figures for improvement but we must keep in mind the programme&rsquo;s aim.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator White that the earlier a child is brought inside a structured environment, the better for the community. At that stage the benefits of the investment will come to fruition. The programme has been a step in the right direction but there is still work to be done on it. There are issues to which we must adapt due to recent developments in economics and so on, issues such as infrastructure and the provision of services like child care. I hope the rate of progress is maintained as the programme has done much to improve the situation in what was always an area overseen by women. I bow to their superior knowledge regarding this but it is not a women-only issue.</P>
      <P>The tenor of family life and the family unit have changed. Families can comprise a single mother or father or both parents working. However, the burdens are the same for everyone. We must concentrate on relieving these to some extent. This is a hugely important issue, not only for disadvantaged areas but for the country as a whole.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State. I will not go into great detail but there are two matters I wish to have examined. First, part of the cost of child care is due to the relevant regulations. They are top of the range but are more restrictive and demanding than in any other European country. This drives up the cost. Second, has the Minister of State considered the fact that we give tax breaks to the suppliers of child care but not to the users? People should be allowed tax credits on the cost of child care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their contributions. This is a timely debate and of interest to parents throughout the country. As Senator Brady said, child care is not just an issue for parents but is of central importance to the ongoing support of our economy and the need to achieve better social inclusion. This is why IBEC and ICTU keep the issue at the forefront of social partnership talks. It is also why the Government has increased the level of support for the equal opportunities child care programme to almost &euro;500 million and has made a commitment to ongoing support for the programme following the completion of the National Development Plan 2000-2006. The case for tax breaks and reliefs have been well made. It is an issue that will be examined.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Fahey, outlined the many successes of the equal cost opportunities child care programme. I know from personal experience in Mountmellick, Ferbane and An Daingean that such schemes can give a large boost to communities. In terms of overall commitment 20,500 new child care places have been achieved and funding has been approved for a further 13,000. The first phase of the EOCP was never expected to satisfy all of the needs of the child care sector, of parents or of Irish society. It was to be, and indeed has been, a large step in that direction. The Government has, however, increased its financial commitment to the child care sector on a number of occasions over the past five years and, without doubt, the completion of the programme and its successor will go a long way to achieving a level of quality child care which will compare favourably to the rest of Europe.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, indicated that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, expects to announce <Col N="851"/>further capital grants in the near future, possibly before Easter. The Minister will make further announcements of capital funding for community groups to address local needs thereafter. Value for money is a major criteria in these situations. Some of the programmes I have recently encountered have focussed on how to take best advantage of the funding in value for money terms. When Members reflect on the achievements to date in terms of Government intervention and the response of community groups on the ground, they will acknowledge that we are at a very exciting phase in developing this service from a very limited base.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>We will consider the many useful comments made in the House today. They will feed into and inform our future thinking. Contributions such as we have heard this afternoon are essential to supplement the feedback we already receive through the city and county child care committees which enables us to get a clear picture of the concerns on the ground. I appreciate the contributions. The debate has been totally uncontentious on both sides of the House. Even in gender terms, the ladies dominated at the outset but the gentlemen who contributed later showed a clear understanding and, like myself, an admittance that our own involvement in child care was less than ideal. There are new men out there now with a different perspective. I thank all for their contributions to a most interesting debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, to the House.</P>
      <P>The issue I raise concerns two special schools in Ballina, County Mayo. This is an ongoing issue which I have been slow enough to raise, but there has been no progress on it over the past few years.</P>
      <P>There are two special schools involved, and because of time constraints I will outline some of the difficulties in just one of them. The matter has been before the Department of Education and Science for some time. Meetings began in 1998, so that the issue is as old as the Good Friday Agreement, with even less progress. It is quite unacceptable that the matter is being kicked back down the line.</P>
      <P>These schools have been left behind because they have not got political clout or as much ability to apply pressure as other places might have. It would be scandalous if they were omitted from <Col N="852"/>the Minister&rsquo;s list, which is still unavailable. We are close to the end of the second month of the year and we still do not know the building programme and budget and what projects will go ahead this year.</P>
      <P>I am talking of two special schools and I will outline the situation in one, St. Nicholas&rsquo;s school. The school has 17 pupils ranging in age from four to 17, with all sorts of difficulties including autism and various other multiple difficulties which the Minister of State would well understand.</P>
      <P>Any person will respond to the following. The school in question is a two-storey, semi-detached house. Only six of the 17 pupils are physically capable of climbing the stairs so the majority are taught downstairs. This is a quite impossible situation for parents, pupils, teachers or the school board. It is grossly unfair and there is a lack of equity about it. The rooms are hopelessly inadequate for the needs of the school, particularly in view of the increase in the number of pupils with multiple disabilities and their need for equipment, for access to the curriculum, for seating, handling and movement. It is impossible to provide adequately for those needs in the present situation. Safety issues are involved, including a fire issue. I am sure the Minister of State can easily visualise the situation when she considers how such a school can be run with children with profound needs and high levels of dependency, in what is effectively a private dwelling with &ldquo;pretend&rdquo; classrooms.</P>
      <P>I asked a school board member and some of the staff to tell me how the school worked. One class has five pupils with profound difficulties of various types. Three pupils are taught in a downstairs room which is a small converted garage. All three are completely blind, and two fully physically dependent, necessitating wheelchairs, bean bags, mats and so on, for access and care. That description is probably enough to visualise the scene. That is just one class in the school.</P>
      <P>The three blind pupils require nappy changing but access to the changing room is through two other classrooms. One can imagine the disruption, with blind children who need full support all the time, while the other children also need to be looked after. There are assistants to help the teachers but no teaching is going on if the teacher is involved with one of the pupils in this way. He or she cannot spend time with the others, who are then left to be helped by the assistants in whatever way they can. The assistants also need support.</P>
      <P>This is a one-to-one situation. The pupils who need to be changed must either go through the classrooms to the other side of the building or exit the front door, cross the garden and enter through another door. These are blind, highly-dependent children who need nappies changed. At the same time the teacher is expected to teach the older pupils in the only other available room, a small bedroom upstairs.</P>
      <P>The situation is intolerable for all concerned. The teacher is literally expected to be in two <Col N="853"/>places at once. The lack of space combined with the needs of the children makes effective classroom management almost impossible. The Minister of State will understand that I could give her further examples and that this is just one. I know she will respond in a humane way to the situation. Negotiations with her Department began in 1998 and it was agreed shortly afterwards that the two special schools in the area would share facilities in the same building but would continue to exist as separate schools in order to facilitate the diverse needs of the pupils, who have a wide range of disabilities, needs and dependencies, some of which are multiple. All that needs to be tackled at the same time.</P>
      <P>In March 1999, planning was initiated and a design team was appointed. In October 1999, the design brief was received from the team and sent to the Department of Education and Science, which agreed on matters such as location. The land became the property of Western Care in November 2000. In January 2002, a meeting was held in Tullamore at which the chairpersons and principals were assured that the project would then go ahead as planned.</P>
      <P>There has been no progress since then. A revised design brief was sent to the Department and in October 2002 the schools were informed that the project was ready to move to stage 1 or 2 of planning. The design team was instructed accordingly. The design, accepted by the Department, consisted of a new building to accommodate both schools with a shared area for facilities in between. However, we are still awaiting instruction from the Department to continue to the next stage. There is a problem with health and safety and humanity which in St. Nicholas&rsquo;s school has reached crisis point. There must be immediate action.</P>
      <P>Can anyone give me a reason that school cannot be a number one priority for the Department of Education and Science? How can we ask the staff and pupils to face into another year of difficulties? Even if the go-ahead were given now, it would still take a certain period of time to complete the school, so it faces another two years of trouble. If it does not get something now it is like facing an eternity of waiting. It is grossly unfair. I appeal to the Minister of State to do the decent thing and give the go-ahead to the project.</P>

	<P>The Minister, Deputy Hanafin, apologises for not being able to be present for the debate. She is, however, taking a particular interest in this case.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator O&rsquo;Toole for bringing it to the attention of the Seanad. He made a plea for the dignity of the students and highlighted the fact that some if not all of them have considerable or multiple disabilities. From his experience in the area of education and his time with the INTO, he has a particular understanding of educational issues. It is clear he has a particular interest in this case.</P><Col N="854"/>
      <P>I am pleased to advise the Senator that the design process is already under way for a new school building which will house both St. Nicholas&rsquo;s and St. Dymphna&rsquo;s special schools. The brief comprises all necessary accommodation to enable the schools to operate in a modern learning environment. Each school will have distinct areas for its own classrooms and staff. However, specialist accommodation, including a GP room, kitchen-dining areas, occupational-speech therapy-medical rooms and other specialist rooms, such as a woodwork room and living skills room, will be shared between the schools as a total of only 46 pupils attend both. The Senator already indicated that there has been a coming together of the schools in terms of sharing facilities. However, clearly there is a need to cater further for the needs of the students.</P>
      <P>This project is for schools catering for children with special needs and accordingly it has been given a band 1.2 rating by the Department of Education and Science in accordance with the published criteria for prioritising large-scale projects in 2005. I am anxious that the design of this project will be progressed as speedily as possible and I understand that the Department&rsquo;s professional and technical staff will shortly be issuing comments to the design team in respect of to the proposed design.</P>
      <P>The design of this project was not sufficiently advanced to be included in the recent announcement of the 122 school building projects which will proceed to tender and construction over the next 12 to 16 months. However, the Department&rsquo;s planning and building unit will keep the progress of this project under review and it will be considered in the context of any future announcement of projects proceeding to tender and construction.</P>
      <P>I again thank the Senator for raising this matter. Although it does not strictly come within my remit as Minister of State, I will bring it to the attention of the building unit and ask that it be given immediate consideration. I am aware that this project is under review by the Department and the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, has taken a particular interest in it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for her reply. I feel worse now than I did at the outset because it appears that it will be 18 months before the project will even obtain approval to proceed to construction. That is an impossible situation. As the Minister of State indicated, comments on the project are being awaited from the technical team. However, it has been with the team for a long period and there is no excuse for the delay with the exception of there being a political view that the project should not be advanced. As a public representative, I am embarrassed that we cannot take action in order to cater for the needs of these children. I appreciate the Minister of State&rsquo;s commitment to communicate with me further and I will contact her <Col N="855"/>in the coming weeks in order that we progress the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>I would welcome any further information the Senator could bring to bear on this issue. He indicated his concern that schools of this kind may not have the necessary political clout. I wish to put his mind at rest in that regard. Cases such as that to which he refers are of sig<Col N="856"/>nificant importance to us in terms of identifying what we might do to alleviate the great difficulties experienced by students and teaching staff. Like the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, I would not entertain a situation where political clout might win the day. There is a set of criteria to be followed and we want to be fair to all.</P>
