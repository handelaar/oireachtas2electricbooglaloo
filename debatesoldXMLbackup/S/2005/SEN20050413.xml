	<P>I have received notice from Senator Dooley that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to outline the action he proposes to take in light of recent job losses announced by Microsemi in Ennis.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Morrissey of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to address the implications of capacity constraints at Dublin Port.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Browne of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to undertake a review of the disabled person&rsquo;s grant scheme with a view to ensuring a faster delivery for those availing of it.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Kitt of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Communications, Marine, and Natural Resources to provide high-grade broadband for the town of Tuam, County Galway.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by Senators Dooley, Morrissey and Browne as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Kitt may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, a sessional order as agreed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, to be taken without debate; No. 2, statements on the rights of migrant workers, to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 1.30 p.m., with the contribution of spokespersons not to exceed 12 minutes, those of other Senators not to exceed eight minutes, all may share time, and the Minister to reply not later than five minutes before the conclusion of statements; No. 3, Statute Law Revision (Pre-1922) Bill 2004 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, to be taken at 2.30 p.m. until 5 p.m., with the contribution of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes, those of other Senators not to exceed ten minutes, the Minister to be called upon to reply not later than five minutes before the conclusion of Second Stage; and No. 20, motion 13, to be taken from 5 p.m. until 7 p.m. There will be a sos from 1.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It is likely that we will see significant industrial action from the security industry tomorrow, following a number of raids on cash-in-transit vans in Dublin and surrounding counties in recent months. It is a very serious situation. The matter was not helped by the comments of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who ratcheted up the problem for those who work in the industry. Can I ask the Government if action will be taken at this late stage and if it will do everything in its power to avert this industrial action which would cause considerable inconvenience for people who use ATM machines throughout the country?</P>
      <P>We need a debate about how much the banking industry pays for security. This is a disgrace, given that it was revealed yesterday that banks charge &euro;26 million a year so that people can access their own accounts while they provide only a paltry sum of money to secure their money as it is moved around the country. I support what the Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, said on the matter in recent weeks but now we want to see some action. The banks should have to pay for the security that the State provides for their money to be carried around the country. I ask that time be provided to discuss this matter in the coming weeks, particularly so that the Minister for Defence could outline his views further on this matter.</P>
      <P>There was an alarming scene yesterday in the Morris tribunal where the key witness, Mr. McBrearty, walked out of the tribunal and its proceedings. Can I ask the Government if in the next few days it could clarify if a guarantee would be given to the McBrearty family that all of the legal fees surrounding their participation at the tribunal will be guaranteed?  As a colleague of mine said earlier, if Mr. McBrearty is not at the <Col N="1747"/>tribunal it would be like staging <i>Hamlet</i> without the prince. It is important that this matter is cleared up as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it in order to discuss this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The tribunal was established by this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that but I do not think the procedures of the tribunal can be discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking that the Government would do everything in its power to ensure that a guarantee would be given on the issue of costs because that is the problem concerning Mr. McBrearty&rsquo;s participation.</P>
      <P>Finally, I note that as I speak, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, is issuing new guidelines on rural housing. We will have to wait to see the guidelines before knowing whether they have any teeth or are just another smokescreen, like that proposed by his predecessor, Deputy Cullen, in September 2003. I ask for time to be provided next week for a full debate so that the Minister may outline and explain what the effect of these changes will be on the rural community in order that people from a particular area may live there and ensure their families grow up in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The first report of the Morris tribunal has not yet been debated in either House of the Oireachtas. It is an issue of great concern to many people and is being widely discussed in the media and other places. As far as I recall, it was published in early July last year. I do not believe we have had the opportunity to debate it, but I am open to correction on that. I have not contributed to any debate on the matter, which I do not believe was on our agenda.</P>
      <P>I know Members of the Oireachtas are concerned over what is going on there. It has been suggested to me that people who were found guilty of perjury by that tribunal are still giving evidence in the courts on behalf of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I do not know whether this is true but I believe these are issues which should be aired and discussed. I would welcome the opportunity to do that.</P>
      <P>We have had discussions on a number of occasions in this House with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the issue of immigration. The Minister has today produced a pretty extensive document &mdash; a discussion document that is neither a Green Paper or a White Paper &mdash; on immigration. On glancing through the document, it touches on many of the issues which we have asked be discussed, although no decisions have been taken. I believe that this is the House where that should be debated and I ask the Leader to raise this matter with the Mini<Col N="1748"/>ster for Justice, Equality and Law Reform within the next few weeks so that the Seanad may have the opportunity to discuss the document which deals with such issues as economic migration, family reunification and all the relevant matters we have discussed. Now is the time to influence legislation before it is published.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Killeen, on ignoring the whingeing, selfish and ungenerous shouting and bleating from IBEC, the employers&rsquo; body, over recent weeks. He has introduced a much welcomed increase in the minimum wage. It is part of what we wanted and expected and it is significant that he has had the courage to do that. We did not have IBEC representatives on hand yesterday to look at the exploited workers and the disadvantaged firms in Ireland, as regards the Gama issue. Neither are they on hand today to look at people who are at the lowest level of payment in this country. This is something which the House should welcome and we should thank the Minister of State for moving swiftly in this regard. Finally, I welcome the fact that the Buckley review on higher level salaries in the public sector and other places is being re-established by the Minister. I would like to advise the press, media and the House that this initiative is 18 months late. It should have been brought in a year ago. This does not affect Deputies and Senators, as was the case previously, but is to be welcomed, nonetheless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome publication by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of an extensive outline policy proposal on immigration and residency. The publication facilitates public debate on this matter and like Senator O&rsquo;Toole I call for a debate in this House on those proposals. I commend the Minister on publishing the proposals as just that in advance of the publication of a Bill. I suspect he would welcome such a debate in this House and I ask the Leader to schedule one at an early stage because there are many issues on which we need to get a much clearer perspective with regard to immigration and residency. One arises this morning regarding migrant workers and is just one of the issues to be reviewed. One of the purposes of the establishment of the Morris tribunal was to allay public concerns about certain behaviour in one part of the State. It is now clear this is not happening. The issues need to be reviewed, particularly the representation of Mr. McBrearty and the costs for his family at the tribunal. The tribunal cannot go ahead without the participation of the McBreartys.</P>
      <P>The House must have a debate on one-off rural housing as the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has published guidelines on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Draft guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1749"/>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>The House is aware that it is not a simple issue as there is much pressure for development. While development will be good for many areas, we want to see every area getting its share of economic development and prosperity. At the same time, rules and guidelines are needed. It is not an easy issue but if Members give their views on these guidelines, they can make a considerable contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the calls for a debate on the Morris tribunal. For those of us who have followed it, the events unfolding there are disturbing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I have explained to the Leader of the Opposition, the Chair has been consistent in not allowing matters before tribunals to be discussed in the House. Specific matters may be raised when the report of a tribunal is placed before the House. At this stage, it is not in order to raise the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise, a Chathaoirligh, I was referring to the interim report of the Morris tribunal.</P>
      <P>The recent publication of immigration policy by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform must be discussed in the House as it is an important issue. I ask the Leader to convey our wishes to the Minister on this matter.</P>
      <P>Last weekend&rsquo;s Progressive Democrats national conference debated road safety and the numbers being killed on the roads. The issue of enforcement has also been raised in the House on many occasions. Last weekend, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform made a proposal that as enforcement crosses both the Departments of Transport and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, it should be brought under the aegis of one Minister and Department. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to explain this proposal in more detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>It is almost eight years since the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Administration came into power. For almost eight years, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Harney, has held the second most powerful position in the State. Last weekend I listened with great interest to the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s speech, particularly her comments on health, at the Progressive Democrats national conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think we can discuss the Progressive Democrats conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no intention of discussing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>We like the Senator talking about us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I saw Senator Brennan there and he looked very well.</P>
      <P>Will the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children explain to the House the ten point plan <Col N="1750"/>for accident and emergency services? We all know of the protests yesterday and of the 325 patients left on trolleys in accident and emergency wards. All Members appreciate the discomfort patients experience as a result of this. I want the T&aacute;naiste to explain when this will end. Last September, she promised the problem would be resolved by the end of March but it is still acute. As there will be a series of further protests, it is time for urgent action. The Government has had eight years to resolve it. It is a shocking indictment of the Administration that this problem still exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>There are many positive developments on the employment front for us to welcome. Unemployment now stands at 4.3%. The year 2004 saw the lowest number of days lost in strike action, a tribute to social partnership. This morning the House will debate the rights of migrant workers and we welcome the appointment of inspectors. We must debate the proposals for a fundamental revamp of immigration policy.</P>
      <P>However, another matter which should be debated relates to people in the community of an older age who have difficulty finding employment. The community employment schemes are useful in that regard. The rules for the schemes should be re-examined. There might be a case, which should be debated, for returning to the <i>status quo ante</i> 2000. I am not referring to the numbers on the schemes but the rules of operation. The schemes are important not just for the people concerned but also for a myriad of community organisations which would collapse without the assistance they get from people on community employment schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>Child care is an example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Finucane&rsquo;s call for a debate on accident and emergency services. The situation is truly as shocking as the nurses describe it. Hundreds of people are on trolleys every day but there are 1,000 fewer beds in the acute hospital service than there were at the end of the 1980s. There are hundreds of thousands more people in the country and they are older.</P>
      <P>The Minister&rsquo;s solution appears to be to set up minor accident centres on a private basis. The people on trolleys do not have minor injuries. They are so seriously ill they must be admitted to hospital. What is being proposed will probably be counterproductive because it will take people away from general practitioners, where they should have gone in the first place. The Minister should come to the House to explain the plan she is bringing forward. I was told three years ago that the situation in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital would be sorted out in six months but I am now told by my colleagues there that it is worse than ever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, am grateful to the Minister, Deputy Roche, for issuing the guidelines on one-off housing.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1751"/>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has not seen any houses yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader should invite the Minister to come to the House next week to discuss this matter. I congratulate him on taking 12 months to receive and consider submissions. Each local authority has produced its development plan but problems still arise in rural areas. In cities one can build 15 houses to an acre but a person on a 40-acre farm finds it impossible to build a house for a member of his or her family. The Minister is correct to listen to his colleagues and to the parties in Government, as well as Members from all parties. Nobody has a monopoly on wisdom. The Minister listened to everybody before bringing his proposals forward. I look forward to a debate on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Like other Members, I seek a debate on the Morris report so we can discuss the issues that need to be addressed. I welcome the thrust of the planning guidelines but I am anxious to see the details because the devil is in the detail. Does the Leader know if they are simply guidelines? When the previous Minister, Deputy Cullen, first spoke about the guidelines on one-off housing, I asked that they be put in the form of a directive.</P>
      <P>There is a need for uniformity throughout the country because there has been a lack of common sense in some areas. Some planning officers are too rigid in their attitude, as I have heard from public representatives throughout the country. It is important that these guidelines be issued in directive form to ensure there is uniformity. If that is the intention, I will welcome it. Everybody wants an open and courteous service from local authorities. In the case of one-off housing in rural areas, there should be on-site consultation where it is required in the interests of the customer.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Mansergh&rsquo;s call for a debate on community employment schemes. There is a need to refine the rules and to return to the previous position given the importance of the schemes for so many organisations and the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>The new planning guidelines on rural housing are eagerly awaited by people in rural areas. They follow extensive debate and consultation. Ultimately, this is not just about housing but about the regeneration of rural Ireland. This will enable people in rural Ireland to avail of opportunities when they come their way. Some of the comments we hear about bungalow blight are not sustainable; there is no research to underpin some of these. One is tempted to say that if the same scaremongering headlines had applied to urban development, we would not have some of the planning outrages we now have in urban Ireland.</P>
      <P>As a co-founder of the Irish Rural Dwellers Association I have come across many cases of anguish, disappointment and frustration in young <Col N="1752"/>married couples who had the confidence to want to live in rural Ireland. This is something we all wanted to achieve. We are talking about civil rights. I see nothing wrong with a landowner selling a site to help his or her children through education or to develop a career. Landowners have been among the best custodians of our environment.</P>
      <P>We must establish that the guidelines will be implemented. I understand the new guidelines insist planners be accessible to people. People will be able to discuss the issues with planners and not be stonewalled. I compliment the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell. I read a letter Deputy McDowell sent to the Irish Rural Dwellers Association in which he was particularly supportive. I believe this is true of all political parties. Let us avoid party political issues and think only of the people of Ireland. Ultimately, the land of Ireland should be for the people of Ireland. That is what the Minister is endeavouring to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome a debate on planning guidelines but I do not agree with my esteemed colleague, Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;. I think the opposition he drew between the people of Ireland and vested interests was emotive. I am very concerned by these guidelines. A very populist line is being followed. The Government is not taking a clear lead in policy. On the wireless today I heard that only 2% of Ireland is covered by concrete and these new guidelines will merely increase this by 1.5%. That is almost doubling it. That is worrying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us create a rural zoo in Ireland in order that Senator Norris can come and look at the wildlife.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Could Senator Dardis shout a little louder because I have a cold and I cannot hear very well? I am sure his contribution is frightfully interesting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>If Senator Norris seeks a debate on these guidelines, we will discuss all these points but we cannot have a debate at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, I am looking for a debate because in addition to planning guidelines, there is the question of services. I am worried to hear someone I respect from the Government side saying he sees nothing wrong with landowners selling a few sites for various purposes. That is a dangerous road to go down. I look forward very much to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>People want to sell sites to educate and feed their children. It is all right for the property owners in the cities.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1753"/>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senators should leave all these points for the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I look forward to Senator Dooley&rsquo;s contribution to the debate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure Senator Dooley will be given an opportunity by the Cathaoirleach to contribute to the debate but I am not going to try and take this debate now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Dooley must wait for the debate, as must Senator Norris.</P>

    <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support what Senator Mansergh said on community employment schemes. I know of situations where communities have benefited significantly from these schemes. This is something that needs examination. I suggest that we have some discussion on the case of Dean Lyons. There are points of principle to be raised about the behaviour of the Garda. A man was convicted who plainly could not have committed the crime. He produced a confession containing details that only the garda&iacute; could have known. Also there is a serious difficulty with the fairness of justice on behalf of the families of those murdered women. The sister of one of them contacted me. There has been no trial in her sister&rsquo;s case and the wrong man was convicted in the other case. There is no possibility for emotional resolution for those left behind by this tragic event. A discussion on this matter would be worthwhile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Some Senators have asked that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government attend the House. We have had a farce here this morning whereby the Opposition, which is so used to opposing matters, is against the guidelines even before they have been issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not know what they are. The last ones were not even implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Order please. Senator Hanafin without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an issue in the south east.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot have a debate on the guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Minister attended the House we could also take the opportunity to ask him about better local government. Local councillors are, in theory, expected to pay a fee to consult planning details but in most cases the fee is dispensed with. It should be dispensed with in full, however. We could also examine the implementation of the special policy committees and how they should operate.</P><Col N="1754"/>
      <P>We could also ask the Minister to provide a facility for councillors whereby they would have access to specialised information. As we know, city and county managers have access to such information when it comes to implementing policy in their respective areas but councillors do not, unless they pay for it. That situation could easily be addressed through the centralised provision of information to councillors around the country so they would be better informed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the proposal to invite the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to attend the House as soon as possible to explain these guidelines fully. The last guidelines proposed were, for the most part, never implemented. In fact, where they were implemented they were far more restrictive than had previously been the case. Until then, there had at least been some discretion with planners but the earlier guidelines amounted to a straitjacket which added further to planning bureaucracy.</P>
      <P>Unless the Minister attends this House and indicates clearly that he is giving a direction to county managers or directors of planning services, this proposal will be meaningless. I hope that in this instance the guidelines will mean something and that the Minister is serious about what he is proposing.</P>
      <P>Prior to the last guidelines, in County Galway &mdash; the area I know best &mdash; approximately 18% of planning applications were refused. As of last week, six out of every ten applications were being refused, so something has gone seriously wrong in the interim. It is accredited to nothing more than the guidelines which were issued by the previous Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Therefore, if the current Minister outlines a series of guidelines to us they will be of no use. He has introduced a humanitarian element but can he implement such a proposal? Unless the Minister directs managers and directors of planning services throughout the local authority system to implement the guidelines, it will not be done and, as a result, we will have even more refusals than heretofore.</P>

	<P>I wish to support what Senator Mansergh said about revisiting the CE schemes, with regard to child care in particular. As a result <Col N="1755"/>of my meetings with public and private cr&egrave;che representatives, I know they have a problem due to the lack of guarantees regarding CE schemes. They had been using people on such schemes which were very helpful in getting people started on a career in child care. I support Senator Mansergh&rsquo;s call to re-examine the CE schemes and revert to the previous position before we lost them.</P>

	<P>Three weeks ago, a friend of mine was admitted to an accident and emergency unit following a fall in a hospital.</P>
      <P>I will not name the hospital or my friend. Her injured arm was put in a sling and she was sent home. She had asked for Anadin for the pain but the doctor said she did not need it. She returned three weeks later as requested, last Friday, and underwent an emergency operation for seven hours the next morning to have a plate put into her arm and what is called a &ldquo;cup&rdquo; on her shoulder.

Regarding the announcement by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the changes expected in the guidelines for rural housing, that issue has been well debated in this House and will no doubt be debated again over the next week or so.</P>
      <P>I want to know the legal standing of county development plans. We should not lose sight of the fact that the executive powers which managers have allow them to grant permissions. The role of local authority members has been gradually degraded in recent years, not least with regard to setting the level of refuse collection charges. That power was taken from councillors by Deputy Cullen when he was Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The latest move is a cynical attempt at auction politics, buying votes for the next general election. I will wait to hear details of the plans before making a more informed statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonLydon"><NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the calls made for the discussion of the report of the Morris tribunal. When the debate takes place, we might widen it to consider the cavalier fashion in which some tribunals treat witnesses and over-ride their consti<Col N="1757"/>tutional rights, as well as the aggressive manner in which the tribunals appeal to the Supreme Court, High Court decisions which go against them. That does a grave disservice to Irish jurisprudence and we should debate the matter.</P>

      <P>Will the Government say when it intends to amend or reform the Coroners Act? We saw a ludicrous situation recently involving a coroner being unable to compel a witness to attend an inquest. It is of vital importance that this archaic Act be urgently amended and reformed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call for a debate on the situation in our accident and emergency units and for the T&aacute;naiste to come to the House. However, I know that many untruths are going around in some of the stories we hear. That is not to say there are no problems, there are, but they are not all on the scale of those we know of in Dublin. Perhaps when we have the debate we can look at the area of the health care professional and the onus on him or her to provide and deliver the service. The medics should stick to their jobs and stop trying to play politics. If consultants and doctors want to be politicians, let them put themselves up for election. We might have a better accident and emergency service if we had doctors who worked to capacity instead of blocking politicians who try to make the system work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to arrange that the Minister responsible, who was appointed by the President and the Taoiseach, come to the House and explain what has been happening at Dublin Airport with regard to the security breaches in the past two days. It is alarming that simulated bombs and other dangerous items got through security and could have been smuggled on to aeroplanes without apparent difficulty. The security at the airport is appalling.</P>
      <P>The Minister should come to the House, not just to clarify that situation but also to open a wider debate on the second terminal, which is apparently paralysed for about the 20th time. We need him to come here or to the D&aacute;il to inform us of what is happening. The two issues are connected. The Dublin Airport Authority, which is responsible for security, is apparently in line for responsibility for the second terminal. In light of what has happened over the past two days, we must ask whether this body is fit to operate and own a second terminal.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;culture&rdquo;&mdash; I use that imprecise word deliberately &mdash; in Dublin Airport has not improved under the Dublin Airport Authority. It is the same as it was under Aer Rianta, only now it operates under a new name. We need to exam<Col N="1758"/>ine the matter in a robust way in the House immediately. We can no longer allow this issue or the issue of security to be put off because they are linked. Will the Leader ask the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, if, at long last, he has the power to make a decision on this, which is doubtful, and to come here and tell us what is happening at the airport and with regard to the terminals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader invite the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, to the House to discuss rural development, particularly with regard to how it correlates with planning guidelines? As a rural person like myself, the Leader is aware that many schools, post offices and such services have closed in rural areas because of depopulation and planning difficulties.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to the fact that the sale of a couple of sites by farmers would help them educate their children. In some cases that is what serves to keep them in business. I do not agree with what Senator Norris said. I believe there is a serious issue with regard to rural planning.</P>
      <P>Senator Hanafin mentioned better local government, but I wonder about that because of the current situation. When I entered the local government system in 1979 one dealt with the county manager, the county secretary or the county engineer and got a response and a service. I do not say one cannot get them now but it takes a hell of a lot longer. Rural development and planning guidelines should be addressed in an exploratory way because the structure that obtains currently is not working. I commend the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the consultation process in which he engaged and on bringing forward the guidelines.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Ross&rsquo;s call for the Minister for Transport to come to the House to explain the disturbing security breaches at Dublin Airport. Knives, an imitation bomb and a replica gun were smuggled through security. The Government is not doing enough to ensure the travelling public&rsquo;s confidence is secured in air travel. It is not as if costs are decreasing at Dublin Airport. The daily rate to park a car has increased by 50% from &euro;20 to &euro;30. However, we are not getting the security we deserve and the Minster should come to the House immediately to explain this serious problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Brian Hayes raised the proposed industrial action before the weekend by security industry workers. He asked how much banking interests pay towards security. The Minister for Defence has been loud in his call that they should pay the full cost. I fail to see why not, given that they incur the costs by having money transferred by special means. I will ask the Minister to come to the House for a debate in which he can elucidate on his ideas.</P><Col N="1759"/>
      <P>The Senator asked about Mr. McBrearty and the Morris tribunal. He also requested a debate on one-off housing next week, as did other Members. However, I sat beside the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government at our parliamentary party meeting yesterday. I seized the moment and said that the House would be looking for him next week. He said he would not be around next week but he would come to the House when he returned the following week. It is not that he will not come here next week as he will not be in Ireland. However, he is keen to come to the House.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred to the Morris Tribunal. I understand we cannot debate the issues involved. However, the interim report was not debated in the House and, therefore, we can seek to have a debate on it. The Senator also referred to the document on immigration circulated to Members earlier by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I checked through them quickly and many of the issues that have been raised in the House are mentioned. The document provides the basis for a coherent debate. The Senator is also glad, as we all are, that the minimum wage has been increased. Equally, he stated a review, which will follow up on the Buckley report, will examine emoluments for senior public servants. We come under the benchmarking process.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Meara raised the publication of the immigration proposals by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the McBrearty case and rural housing. The guidelines on one-off housing will be published later. We received an overview earlier. They are concise but I take Senator Coghlan&rsquo;s point that they should be issued in the form of a directive. They will be issued in circular form and they will be quite definite regarding what can and should happen.</P>
      <P>Senator Morrissey sought a debate on immigration policy. He also referred to road safety policy, which is divided between two Departments. He wishes that it would be placed in one Department.</P>
      <P>Senator Finucane raised the accident and emergency issue and asked for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children to come to the House. She always comes to the House when requested. She does not shirk appearances in the House. I will put this request to her.</P>
      <P>Senator Mansergh referred to the small number unemployed, which is, thankfully, the case, and community employment. Difficulties have arisen when rules that pertained to CE some years ago have been disregarded. I will ask the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Fahey, to come to the House to discuss the issue.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry asked for a debate on accident and emergency services. Senator Brennan raised one-off housing guidelines. The previous guidelines were a draft, and these are permanent. His voice is added to those requesting a debate. <Col N="1760"/>Senator Coghlan raised the Morris tribunal and the guidelines, which he says should be in directive form to tie people into dealing with matters and acting on them. I did not know that Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; was a co-founder of the Irish Rural Dwellers Association, but he quite rightly made the point that it is not simply about housing; it is about the reinvigoration of the rural community. He welcomed the documents from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris is worried about the guidelines, based on what he has read to date. Let us wait until they are issued. He said that he cannot hear anyone because he has a cold but, while sorry about that, I am glad to hear that he is in good voice himself. He spoke of the Dean Lyons case, agreeing with Senator Mansergh. I understand that Deputy McDowell is appointing a solicitor or barrister to review that issue, so let us wait to see what happens.</P>
      <P>Senator Hanafin raised the question of better local government. He made the very strong point, with which I agreed, that we should have access to specialised information. As we know, it is all programme managers for this, that and the other now. There are the managers, programme managers and planning officers. The trouble lies with the planning officers&rsquo; regime, since neither the programme managers nor the manager have any say over planning officers. That is where the difficulty arises. People seek pre-planning meetings and on-site planning meetings, and it is all a great fudge. It is not very clear and sometimes there is not that much courtesy in the whole affair until it gets further up the chain of command, although people are entitled to courtesy. We never read the specialised information&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but it seems that in this area the planners have great influence and clout, and middle and top management seem unable to put in their oar. I cannot quite understand it, but I have found that constantly to be the case. I deal with many planning applications from sons or daughters of landowners. Why should they not want planning permission to build on the land of their own father or mother? It is the most basic thing that one could do. However, the hopes and aspirations of a couple who simply want a house for themselves and their future offspring on family land are never taken into account. The hurt occasioned to them when they are refused planning permission is extraordinary as it involves land owned by their parents. I always think that the &ldquo;sterilisation&rdquo; game must surely be open to constitutional challenge. If one owns one&rsquo;s land, why should one have to &ldquo;sterilise&rdquo; it? I currently have a substantial case for one house. The land has been &ldquo;sterilised&rdquo;, and the manager is sticking to it.</P><Col N="1761"/>

It is a matter of people looking for their rights.</P>

      <P>Senator White wishes the T&aacute;naiste to come to the Seanad; she also spoke about Deputy McDowell. Hand on heart, I can say that I have many disagreements with the Progressive Democrats, but they certainly turn up when one asks. If they have legislation or one has a debating point or paper, they will attend this House. They show no fear or favour. They will come and explain their position, and I am sure that both will be keen to come to the House. It is proper that we should put that on the record.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to address the Seanad on an issue which is helping to drive Ireland&rsquo;s social and economic development. Immigration, which is and will continue to be essential to the development and prosperity of Irish society, is a relatively new phenomenon in this country. We have known the other side of the coin for generations. I want to send a clear message that people who come to Ireland seeking employment are welcome. It is a shared expectation on the part of Ireland, its people and its new arrivals that the experience will be beneficial to all. Ireland needs to overcome its skills shortages if it is to deliver the essential services and infrastructure which are demanded and expected and will benefit everyone.</P>
      <P>I am heartened when I hear of the excellent welcome afforded to those who have come to this country to participate in and contribute to Ireland&rsquo;s vibrant society. I am deeply disappointed when I hear of instances in which the expectations of such people are not met for any of a variety of reasons. It infuriates me when I hear of instances of deliberate mistreatment, which do a great disservice to Ireland and its people. The despicable people who engage in such practices prey on the inexperienced and vulnerable and have no place in our business community or society. The business community does not condone such sharp practices. Although those who work with migrant workers and the Irish people as a whole do not condone such practices, they continue to occur. I commend those who help migrant workers to settle and integrate. I <Col N="1763"/>commend them on the support they provide in interacting on behalf of migrant workers. I urge work colleagues and neighbours of migrant workers to extend the hand of friendship and to offer support. It will be an enriching experience for everyone involved.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Irish experience of the vast majority of migrant workers is positive. Many extended families in Europe and further afield are aware of the Irish experience of their loved ones and we are all saddened when we hear of instances where people are mistreated and can only imagine the distress that causes for friends and families. We all appreciate the harm it does to Ireland&rsquo;s reputation abroad.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the keen attention which this House pays to topical issues of concern to the Irish people, the business sector and, indeed, migrant workers. I would like to update the Oireachtas about an allegation made by Deputy Joe Higgins in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 8 February 2005 to the effect that Gama Construction Ireland demands excessive hours of its workers and pays between &euro;2 and &euro;3 per hour. I described allegations such as this as infuriating in that, if true, they besmirch the good name of Ireland and Irish employers at home and abroad. I immediately asked the duly authorised labour inspectorate in my Department to open an investigation and this it did the following day. It conducted a thorough investigation of the allegations and where it encountered issues outside the immediate scope of the allegations, it made limited observations and directed issues to the attention of other regulatory bodies that could have a role to play.</P>
      <P>The inspectorate brought its key values of independence, fairness, thoroughness and speed to its investigation. It consulted widely with current and former workers, industry associations, trade unions, the company&rsquo;s professional advisors and secured the co-operation of Gama itself to the process. Gama also gave a series of assurances to the labour inspectorate that no Turkish workers would be relocated or repatriated without reference to the inspectorate until further notice.</P>
      <P>The investigation started from the premise shared by many parties &mdash; my Department, the unions and the industry associations &mdash; that Gama was a good employer. This shared belief was based upon assurances given by Gama, its auditors and its legal advisor to all the above parties and the media until recently that Gama pays the going rate and was fully compliant with employment rights legislation. The going rate, also called the joint industrial council norm for skilled construction workers, is &euro;16.20 per hour, whereas the only legally enforceable rates are those in the registered employment agreement, which range from &euro;8.09 per hour for craftsmen to &euro;7.36 for construction operatives, grade 1. While the statutory minimum rates are not in line with the going rate, it is a matter for the employers and unions to review the position &mdash; this process <Col N="1764"/>has been stalled since 1998 by reason of a judicial review.</P>
      <P>All employees in Ireland are covered by Irish employment rights legislation and to avoid any doubt, section 20 of the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001 grants that coverage, particularly to workers posted to Ireland, irrespective of nationality or place of residence. I received a report of the investigation from the labour inspectorate into alleged breaches of employment rights in the sites of Gama Construction Ireland and other companies on 6 April. On receipt of the report I immediately made known my wish to publish it as soon as possible but I am currently prevented from doing so pending the resolution of High Court proceedings initiated by Gama.</P>
      <P>Having read and considered the report, I fully accept and endorse the recommendations which are addressed to my Department, other Departments, the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and a range of regulatory bodies. It is my intention to forward the report to these bodies to enable them to look into the consequences arising. It is my objective, however, that all workers in Gama, past and present, are given their due entitlements and that their terms and conditions are in accordance with the law and are honoured in full.</P>
      <P>The labour inspectorate is continuing its investigations and if breaches of employment legislation are found they will be enforced in full. I sought and obtained assurances from Gama that no reassignment or repatriation of workers would take place without prior consultation with the labour inspectorate. I acknowledge that Gama has to date honoured its commitments in this regard.</P>
      <P>I met yesterday with ICTU, SIPTU and the Construction Industry Federation, which all have concerns about these issues. I want to see a partnership approach developed to oversee compliance and restitution and to ensure instances such as this do not re-occur. I intend to meet with Gama senior management and have opened contact with the Dutch bank where it is maintained the Gama workers have their accounts.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I also strengthened the labour inspectorate by sanctioning an increase of 50% in the number of inspectors assigned. These additional inspectors will place a specific emphasis on sectors where migrant workers are concentrated. The additional inspectors will strengthen the labour inspectorate&rsquo;s capacity to ensure that workers in these sectors receive their entitlements under employment rights legislation. This expansion of the inspectorate will bring the authorised number of labour inspectors to 31 and they, together with support staff and their colleagues in the employment rights information unit and the prosecution unit, make up an integrated group dedicated to ensuring people get their entitlements.</P>
      <P>For the benefit of the House, I should explain the policy framework regarding the admission of <Col N="1765"/>migrant workers to this country. Consistent with international practice, our policy is based on economic needs and seeks to address identified labour and skills shortages. Obviously, our policy must respond to a constantly changing environment. Our labour market needs are continually changing as our economic performance changes.</P>
      <P>For many centuries Ireland was a country of net emigration, with large numbers of young people emigrating to find employment overseas. However, this all changed in the 1990s, when rapid economic growth transformed the country from one of net emigration to one of net immigration. From 1997 to 2000, in particular, Ireland experienced an exceptional level of growth. This led to an enormous growth in jobs and employment. Since 1997, the numbers in employment have grown by nearly 450,000. At the same time, the number unemployed has fallen by almost 80,000, with the unemployment rate falling from 10.4% to 4.7%, about half the EU 25 average. The number of long-term unemployed has dropped by almost 60,000 from 5.5% to 1.4% per cent, about one third of the EU 25 average.</P>
      <P>As a consequence, labour and skill shortages have become apparent, necessitating the recruitment of large numbers of overseas workers, principally from the European Union, but also from a wide geographic spread of destinations. The scale of this is evident in the numbers of work permits issued to nationals from outside the European Economic Area in the past number of years. The EEA consists of the 25 EU member states, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and for this purpose, Switzerland. In 1999, 6,000 work permits were issued. By 2003, this figure had increased to 48,000. A total of 110,000 non-EEA nationals entered employment in the State in the last five years.</P>
      <P>Our future economic outlook is good. The Irish economy is forecast to grow in 2005 by 4.7% in GNP terms, twice the rate of the EU-25 average. This positive situation has been recognised by the European Commission which, in its commentary on Ireland&rsquo;s stability and growth pact 2005-07, notes our strong growth and sound public finances. The good economic outlook means that a considerable future expansion of employment and demand for labour is also expected. This will mean increasing the numbers in our labour force. Given the falling numbers of young people coming into the labour market, there will be a need to mobilise labour supplies from other sources, including from other countries.</P>
      <P>Not only must we supply the numbers of workers we need, we must also ensure that we supply the skills that our labour market needs in the future. The enterprise action plan published in March included the development of a skills-based immigration policy as a key task. This will support enterprise development as part of the strategy to move the economy to one which is both knowledge-based and innovation-driven. Forf&aacute;s and the expert group for future skills needs are currently engaged in research and con<Col N="1766"/>sultations on the detailed issues entailed in the implementation of this policy, including the types of skills for which permits should be granted. This work will form the basis for a policy paper to be published by my Department later this year.</P>
      <P>My Department is also currently in the final stages of preparation of a new employment permits Bill, which will govern the issue of all employment permits for nationals from outside the European Economic Area. The Bill will put the existing employment permit administrative arrangements on a legislative footing and thereby provide greater accountability and transparency. The Bill allows for a more managed economic migration policy and enables the introduction of a green card system for highly skilled migrant workers. It will also enshrine a number of protections for migrant workers. Employers will be prohibited from deducting from the remuneration of migrant workers any costs associated with their recruitment and from retaining personal documents belonging to migrant workers.</P>
      <P>Our economic migration policy must change as Europe changes. In advance of the recent enlargement of the EU, the Government, in an expression of solidarity with the new member states, decided to allow full freedom of movement to citizens of those states from the date of their accession to the EU on 1 May 2004. In this context, the Government decided that any future labour shortages should in the first instance be met from within the EEA, particularly as there are approximately 19 million people currently unemployed in the EU.</P>
      <P>A significant proportion of work permits in recent years were granted to citizens of the new member states who no longer require work permits. This has resulted in a significant reduction in the number of work permits issued since 1 May 2004. The number of new work permits issued in 2003 was 22,000 while the corresponding figure for 2004 was 10,000.</P>
      <P>It might be useful to the House to describe the manner in which the current employment permits system operates. Nationals from any state other than those in the EEA must obtain an employment permit before entering employment in the State. Generally, employment permits take one of the four forms of work permit which are work authorisation or visa, inter-company transfer authorisation or permit to facilitate services contracts. The work permits system is the main vehicle for nationals from outside the EEA to enter the Irish labour market. Work permits are issued to employers who employ non-EEA nationals to fill specific vacancies they have been unable to fill from within the area. An employer is required to undertake an economic needs test which requires it to advertise for four weeks the employment position it is proposed to fill with Ireland&rsquo;s national employment service, F&Aacute;S, before it is permitted to offer the job to a non-EEA national.</P>
      <P>Work permits are issued for a maximum of one year but can be renewed annually. While the criti<Col N="1767"/>cism has been made that the issuing of work permits to employers leaves an employee open to abuse, it should be noted that a new work permit can be issued to an employee&rsquo;s new employer if he or she changes jobs for genuine reasons. The second type of work permit is a working visa or work authorisation. Such permits were introduced to provide greater access to the labour market for non-EEA workers in possession of skills in very short supply in the economy. The relevant skills categories include those of health and medicine professionals, information computing technology workers and professional construction qualifications including, for example, those of architects, engineers and town planners.</P>
      <P>Unlike work permits, working visas and work authorisations are issued to individuals rather than to their employers. Working visas apply to residents of states in respect of which a visa is required upon entry into Ireland and work authorisations to states in respect of which a visa is not. The scheme is operated through Irish embassies throughout the world. Recipients of working visas or work authorisations are free to change employment within the economic sector of their visa. In addition, working visas and authorisations are granted for two years and can be renewed thereafter by the immigration authorities. Over 1,300 working visas and work authorisations were issued in 2004.</P>
      <P>The third type of employment permit involves the inter-company transfer facility. This allows companies to bring in senior managers or skilled staff from an overseas branch of a multinational corporation to the Irish branch of the same organisation to fulfil a specific and short-term role. As such work is by definition temporary, employers are not required to advertise the positions in question with F&Aacute;S. Since October 2002, inter­company transfer concessions have been granted on a case-by-case basis.</P>
      <P>I would like to provide the House with up-to-the-minute information on my work on the position of Gama workers in Ireland. Members will understand if there is some disjointedness between these and my earlier comments. Contact with the Dutch institution concerned, Finansbank, was formalised this morning when the Irish ambassador to the Netherlands contacted it to seek clarifications on behalf of the workers. I spoke with representatives of the bank this morning to discuss the putting in place of a mechanism to facilitate immediate access of individuals to their account balances. I was provided with absolute assurances and guarantees that all moneys held in the relevant accounts in Finansbank in the Netherlands will be given to the workers concerned. I will make a further statement on the matter today. I came to the House fresh from my telephone call with the bank, which is why I was late to arrive. Apparently, some workers have provided instructions on their accounts and, apparently, a substantial volume of <Col N="1768"/>instructions have issued from Gama on behalf of workers.</P>
      <P>I will meet with the workers and their representatives this evening when I will be in a position to provide them with the latest information I have. I have also arranged to meet with senior management from Gama International to apprise them of my serious concerns about the operations of its subsidiary in Ireland. My officials will maintain contact with Finansbank today and a member of the Department&rsquo;s labour inspectorate will visit it in the Netherlands accompanied by a small delegation of workers&rsquo; representatives to establish a mechanism which assures access to accounts by workers and the honouring of instructions they make on the moneys. The Department will officially monitor the mechanism in conjunction with workers&rsquo; representatives. We met with SIPTU and ICTU yesterday and they asked for such a mechanism to be put in place. As Members will be aware, Deputy Joe Higgins sought similar reassurances in the D&aacute;il on behalf of the workers he has represented over recent weeks.</P>
      <P>While I am constrained by court order from commenting on the inspector&rsquo;s report, we are robustly submitting the Department&rsquo;s case for the lifting of the injunction from Gama Turkey. If we succeed, I will be enabled to publish the report to the House. It is a matter of substantial public interest to publish the report and there is a strong expectation within both Houses that it should be. The Department was served with notice of a further injunction against publication from Gama Ireland. I have instructed that this injunction should also be opposed vigorously.</P>
      <P>I hope I have succeeded in providing the House with an insight into my approach to migrant workers and clarifying Government policy in the detail required to inform the debate on this important issue. I look forward, a Chathaoirligh, to the debate, although I hope it will be appreciated that other Ministers will also attend as I must continue to address the matter in question for the rest of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and his final comments on how strenuously he will oppose today&rsquo;s court action by Gama. Hopefully, the Minister will win and both injunctions will be lifted. While I accept everything the Minister stated about his and his officials&rsquo; contacts with the Finansbank in the Netherlands, do we know for certain that the moneys in the names of the workers are in the correct and appropriate amounts? I would like the Minister to reassure me on that point in his reply.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party believes the recent revelations of the shabby treatment of migrant workers in Ireland disgraces us all and that all of those involved should be ashamed of themselves. That exploitation based simply on nationality or even the colour of one&rsquo;s skin could thrive in 2005 is a sad indictment of our circumstances. Recent revelations of the exploitation of foreign workers in Gama Construction and similar documented <Col N="1769"/>cases are shameful. I commend the good work of our D&aacute;il colleague, Deputy Joe Higgins, in seeking to address the plight of the Gama workers as well as the follow-on work of the Minister. It is my sincere hope that the labour inspectorate of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will investigate, prosecute and punish those responsible for any impropriety, exploitation and fraud which has taken place.</P>
      <P>If any good is to come of this matter and the recent events surrounding the deportation of young Olunkunle Eluhanla, it should be the emergence at last of a proper rational debate on immigration and a proper, thought-out Government policy on the matter. Fine Gael contends that Ireland should be honest about the need for immigration, the benefits it can bring and the repercussions of failing to welcome inward migration. It is a simple fact that Ireland will need to import the skills required to ensure that our economy remains a world-class player. The Minister has said as much. The economy has the potential to post cumulative growth of 45% between now and 2016, a performance which will be fuelled by immigration according to a new commentary from Goodbody Stockbrokers. Growth of this magnitude would see Ireland&rsquo;s economy expand at more than twice the average eurozone rate over the next decade. Goodbodys went as far as to say that inward migration will be vital to achieve the outlined trend in growth.</P>
      <P>It is against this background that we have seen the absurd farce of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform deporting and then bringing back a leaving certificate student while construction companies pay migrant workers &euro;1 an hour to build this country. As a public representative, I am tired of this phony debate and the constant problematising of the immigration issue. While it may be politically astute to give the nod to the baser instincts of some sections of the electorate, it is foolish to think the economy can survive without a flow of migrant labour to staff the service and construction industries.</P>
      <P>Such was the level of ridiculousness in the recent deportations that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform did not himself seem to know the law. Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 requires the Minister to consider personally representations made on the granting of permission to remain in Ireland. Furthermore, the Act sets out 11 criteria to which the Minister must have regard in determining whether to sign a deportation order. Essentially, he is exercising a quasi-judicial function in giving consideration to these statutory criteria. The normal protocol of ministerial delegation, as cited in the D&aacute;il by the Minister, does not apply in respect of the exercise of powers on issues of significant importance where the Minister is required to act personally. It now appears that the Minister, Deputy McDowell, failed to carry out his obligations under the Act. While junior officials considered the issues in question, the Act puts the onus on the Minister to examine the case before making a <Col N="1770"/>deportation order. In his statements, the Minister used the formula that the case &ldquo;was examined&rdquo; but failed to state by whom.</P>
      <P>The Government needs to adopt an integrated, planned immigration policy. Immigration policy is shaped by political kite-flying like the recent news on a green card system. That might get a Minister through a news slot but does not provide an alternative. Things are happening too slowly. The sight of long queues at the immigration centre in Burgh Quay in Dublin is not fitting for a modern nation. The continued limbo in which many immigrants find themselves, which allows exploitation to thrive is causing misery and it is damaging the economy.</P>
      <P>Let us be up-front and honest. Let us establish the economic case for immigration, set a level and put in place a sensible, compassionate immigration policy that will allow the engine of the economy continue to run. It is essential to reduce waiting times for the assessment of applications to allow people to work and contribute to their new society, and avoid simply assigning them to the human scrap-heap until some official manages to get round to their application form.</P>
      <P>In its latest quarterly report, the Economic and Social Research Institute has called for immigrants to be given the fullest opportunity to contribute to the economy. In its spring economic commentary this Government-backed body has predicted growth in the economy of 5.7% this year and a similar figure for next year. According to the main author of the bulletin, Mr. Danny McCoy, research shows immigrants in Ireland are not using their educational and other qualifications to their full potential, with many holding jobs for which they are overqualified. The ESRI believes that if more migrants worked in occupations that utilised their educational abilities it would increase real gross national disposable income by 1% rather than the 0.4% currently attributed to them.</P>
      <P>As a modern European nation, it is time to say to ourselves that an economic imperative exists for us to facilitate migrant workers in addition to a moral duty for us to accept immigrants. The ESRI paints a picture of educated teachers, doctors and lawyers arriving here in an effort to improve their lot and failing to have their expertise recognised and valued. It is the case, for example, that a former television news editor, responsible for the main Venezuelan TV news, is currently working in a sandwich bar in Dublin.</P>
      <P>I implore the Government to establish a proper immigration system, one which takes into account skills shortages and the net benefit inward migration can have which would uphold our commitments as a wealthy, economically advanced nation. This is one of the most pressing social and economic problems we face. I say to those inside and outside these Houses who frown on such an agenda that without immigration, who will build our roads, nurse the sick, operate on us, drive our buses, serve us in restaurants? In short, who will <Col N="1771"/>keep this country running? It will not be Irish people alone because there are not enough of us.</P>
      <P>These are challenging times. Our country is changing every day. Immigration is a necessity, but so also is proper respect and dignity for our immigrant population. Decent pay and decent conditions is all they ask. Let us hope they do not have to ask for too much longer. I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s response.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister on the approach he has taken to the Gama issue. This matter must be examined. The report must be published in the interests of fairness to those employers who have employed migrant workers here and to those migrant workers who are providing an invaluable service. There is no doubt that rogue employers exist.</P>
      <P>The one aspect of this matter which puzzles me &mdash; I hope it will be covered in the report &mdash; is that a process has to be followed when an employer wishes to recruit a migrant worker. Section 4, page 2 of the permit form relates to salary or gross wages per week. The form states that our national minimum wage should be taken into account. I want to see copies of the permits issued by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to see the figure that was entered for salary. It is only when we learn that figure that we will know the amount to which Gama workers are entitled, and what balance should be in these infamous accounts.</P>
      <P>I do not know of any small or medium-sized Irish company which has also engaged in this practice and I would be amazed if there are other people engaging in it. If they are doing so, it would have to be with the knowledge of the employee.</P>
      <P>We bring migrant workers here who, through no fault of their own, have a big disadvantage in terms of language, especially those coming from non-EEA countries. I have witnessed this on a personal basis. We are dependent on these people, and a recent ESRI report proves that we will be dependent on migrant workers for many years to come. As a caring nation it behoves us to ensure that we integrate legal migrant workers who are assisting the State. In many cases, the only way these people interact is by going to Lidl or Aldi, primarily on Saturdays and Sundays, where they can speak their own language or meet friends from other countries.</P>
      <P>In a typical small company, such as mine, it is difficult for employers to give advice or proper instructions about machinery. It is also difficult <Col N="1772"/>for migrant workers to explain themselves. Some form of State assistance must be made available. It does not have to cost a great deal of money. Language training would help these people to integrate and access State services. It is not good enough that migrant workers would have to go to the local VEC to access language courses. I have spoken to some of these people who are the best people in this country. They have told me they do not see any point in watching television on Saturdays and Sundays. They would rather do something productive. They would not mind going to language courses at the weekend, even at their own expense. That is something we must examine.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s reference to permit renewals. In some cases permits might not be renewed after a year, through no fault of the employer. The reason may be due to a downturn in business or some such matter. These people are living here and they have PPS numbers yet they are often forced to go on the run when their permits are not renewed. It is not easy to get another work permit as, technically, people have to go to their home country where the entire process has to begin all over again. Some recognition must be given to a system which allows those people to seek further permits to stay in the country with other employers, without having to go through the laborious process of advertising through F&Aacute;S and the workers having to return to their home countries prior to being re-employed in Ireland. Before the Minister departs, I ask him to pay heed to this.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>It is appropriate that statements should be taken on the rights of migrant workers in the House today. A cursory glance either at the media or the streets outside the House or the Four Courts will yield sufficient evidence that problems exist in this area, which we have a duty to address. A woman from the Philippines was hired to work on a ship for just over &euro;1 an hour. On the streets of Dublin, Turkish workers protest that money belonging to them has been paid into Dutch bank accounts without their knowledge. I am sure the House will join with me in hoping that the findings of that investigation will soon be made public.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding these public cases, I want to bring some personal experience to the debate. Media reports of the ill-treatment of migrant workers are worrying, but they tend to focus on the extreme end of such treatment. At a much lower level, migrant workers daily fail to receive the treatment a caring society should offer. I employ migrant workers, for example, from the Ukraine. My experience is that migrant workers are not being treated by this society in a most caring way. One key issue is the lack of language skills. Migrant workers typically have poor English, through no fault of their own. This is not merely a handicap to them in the workplace but is also a barrier to greater integration within the wider society. The House well knows that such <Col N="1773"/>integration is imperative for the well-being of migrant workers and society, but the language skill issue is not being properly tackled. It is not enough to say that the appropriate forms and paperwork are being translated. Neither is it sufficient to point them in the direction of the local VEC. We must do more. Specific, inexpensive and flexible language programmes for migrant workers should be available. This is vital for their integration and social well-being. We cannot have a situation where the sum total of migrant worker interaction takes place on Saturdays and Sundays at Lidl or Aldi.</P>
      <P>Another lesson from my experience is the State&rsquo;s requirements as regards payment rates for these workers. That is why I bring this form to the attention of the Minister. There should be a mechanism on this form which would require bogus employers to return it once a year to the Department. This would greatly reduce the work of the inspectors and obviate the need for them to go out to these 110 employees. I fail to see why there should not be a form that an employer must return at the end of every year, showing the number of people on his or her books, the rates of pay, the PPS numbers and indicating whether people are still employed. In many cases work runs out and while a permit might be valid for a year, it does not ensure 12 months employment.</P>
      <P>Some of these people may be in the country several years, where the work permits have run out, but they have not gone home. They work long hours, up to 100 hours a week, for example, in the security industry. In one specific case I know of a non-national without a permit who is working over 100 hours, making great money. They call Irish money &ldquo;gold&rdquo;. The situation is that although such people are not regularised, they are contributing by working in this society. They do not cost the State money and neither are they looking for free accommodation or services. They are afraid to go to the doctor. They are afraid, if they do something wrong, that the Garda might pick them up and bring them to airport immediately.</P>
      <P>I would urge an amnesty for some of those people from Moldova or Romania who have been working here for a number of years. Employers find themselves facing a &euro;250,000 fine for employing such people. Yet if they let them go, employers know well that they cannot recruit local Irish labour because of the employment shortages. If they have to go through the whole rigmarole of advertising through F&Aacute;S for four weeks and a process of recruitment the only people, from my experience, who will reply to the advertisements will be workers from Moldova, Lithuania and Latvia through agencies in those countries. One will probably only get one Irish person to apply for any task in this country at the moment over a three-week advertising period. That is the experience of Irish employers, yet there are people in Ireland who are effectively on the run, and I believe this situation should be regularised. People are sending money home <Col N="1774"/>because they are afraid to bank it here. If they were able to bank their money, they could buy their own homes and stay in this country. They are an advantage to rather than a drain on our society.</P>
      <P>It is time we recognised that changes must be made in our permit system sooner rather than later. Migrant workers are among the most hard working honest people that I know. They do not miss Mondays. They work 39 hours a week and want to work overtime, including Saturdays and Sundays. This may be their land of opportunity, but it is also to the benefit of Irish society. The figures show how they have been employed over the years and how the economy depends on them. I call on the Minister to make the necessary changes to the permit system sooner rather than later.</P>

      <P>It is a privilege to listen to people such as my colleague, Senator Morrissey. This is what the Seanad is all about, where people with direct practical experience of a situation with political implications may lay this before the House. I hope that the Minister and his replacement today, the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, have taken notes on this. I was particularly impressed by the suggestion of a paper trail based on the mandatory documentation. I heard Senator Morrissey last night on &ldquo;Tonight with Vincent Browne&rdquo; where he was also very convincing. I hope the necessary action will be taken in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>He was a brave man to go out there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>He was, but he is able to bat on his own wicket comprehensively. I have raised these issues over a number of years. Even this year I recall raising the question of two Sri Lankan workers interviewed on RTE television, who were in tears because they had come here on foot of certain undertakings given by Irish employers. They wanted to send money home to their families, something with which Irish people can identify. It is ingrained in our culture that our people went abroad to work, in England and America particularly, and helped to keep Ireland afloat by sending money back to their families. The Sri Lankan pair were baulked in this regard and were not able to do this because of the way in which they were swindled and cheated. The image of two grown married men in tears on Butt Bridge was a reproach to this country.</P><Col N="1775"/>
      <P>Then there is the question of the Filipinos, which has being going on for a long time. Many of our nursing services are being run on Filipino labour and these workers are not as well treated as they should be, as regards reunification with their families, general working conditions etc. We may very well lose them and then the health service will be in even worse trouble than it is at the moment. In addition, conditions almost amounting to slavery have been exposed where Filipinos are used as housemaids, child attendants and so forth.</P>
      <P>I raised the question a short time ago of a group of Polish workers brought to Donegal by an employer who let them down extremely badly. They were stuck there, not paid for the week they worked and told they had no jobs. Were it not for the wonderfully warm and human response of the woman who ran the guest house and cancelled her holiday to look after them, their situation would have been much worse. She went on the radio and secured employment for these people who otherwise would have been stranded, through media publicity. I was proud of her as a decent Irish woman, but I was ashamed of the employers.</P>
      <P>While abroad recently, I listened to the BBC World Service. It did not make me feel proud when I heard the case of Ms Salvacion Orge, the Filipina hired to work as beautician on Irish Ferries and paid 75 cent an hour. When she had the temerity to do an interview with RTE television, she was sacked. How is that for freedom of speech? Are we proud of this? Thank God for the trade unions and her co-workers who stood up for her and helped her to get to court where she got a settlement of &euro;30,000.</P>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, is no longer in the House. That does not mean I have any grudge against my former colleague in the House, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe. Although I praised Deputy Martin when Minister for Health and Children and I know him to be a decent and caring man, this is not a good day for either him or his Department. They should be thoroughly ashamed. His speech was more waffle, blather and tripe about the economy. There was so much padding and filling, it meant sweet damn all.</P>
      <P>The first action the Minister must take is to congratulate Deputy Joe Higgins of the Socialist Party. But for him, we would not be debating this matter. Where was the Department when this scandal was going on? It was only ventilated when Deputy Joe Higgins entered the arena. The Minister made the big announcement of asking the Irish ambassador to the Netherlands to contact the bank involved in the case this morning. Again, he is trailing after Deputy Joe Higgins who has already gone to Amsterdam with some of the employees to demand their account details from the bank. That was real action. The House <Col N="1776"/>must record its congratulations to Deputy Joe Higgins for doing the State and Parliament a service. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment must also acknowledge his efforts.</P>
      <P>An apology is due to the workers for the lack of care for their welfare and interests by State officials. It is clear the workers were the victims of a massive and scandalous fraud. Will the Minister explain how his Department could be unaware of their plight when Deputy Joe Higgins was aware of it? It is essential that we follow the advice given by Senator Morrissey to monitor these situations.</P>
      <P>Several years ago when in Turkey with the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, we were besieged by massive conglomerate building corporations, including Gama, all anxious to get into Ireland. Now we know why. Gama won many contracts, including the Ballincollig bypass, where it underbid other competitors, including Irish ones, by &euro;15 million and the Ennis bypass, where it underbid by &euro;5 million. It is easy to see how it could do so when it did not pay regular wages. The Minister skated over this by saying one can only get certain agreed regulated wages. However, Gama was forced by to admit it underpaid its workers. Again, it was Deputy Joe Higgins who forced them into this admission.</P>
      <P>Several weeks ago on radio, a public relations spokesperson for Gama called Deputy Joe Higgins a liar.</P>

It imports workers from its homebase in Turkey who, by and large, do not speak English. Their passports and work permits are controlled by the company. The company accommodates them in what amount to army barracks and concentration camps. It works them from cockcrow to nightfall in all weather conditions without breaks. It is shameful that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is unaware of these conditions. That Turkey tolerates these types of work practices calls into the question its fitness to join the European Union.</P>
      <P>In addition to the exploitation of the workers by paying them less than the minimum wage, the company engages in the noxious practice of using High Court injunctions to suppress publication of reports into its activities. This suggests there is some matter of concern which it seeks to hide. It is clear it relates to the bank accounts in Amsterdam. Although I have not had access to the report, I understand these workers were brought to Ireland <i>en masse</i>. The company knew the majority did not speak English, yet shortly before landing in Dublin, forms in English were pushed under the workers&rsquo; noses which they were told <Col N="1777"/>they must sign. This was the legal authorisation for the company to open and operate bank accounts on behalf of the individual workers, an extraordinary and unheard of practice.</P>
      <P>This debacle also calls into the question the operations and standards of the Finansbank, which I hope will be indicated to the Dutch authorities. Under pressure, the spokesperson admitted all the procedures were highly unusual or irregular as I call them. He prefaced this by saying people should be careful of what they sign. <i>Caveat emptor</i>; let the buyer beware. This is a mean-minded, legalistic get-out from scurrilous practices by the bank and the company. The spokesperson confirmed no statements were ever sent to the workers. The accounts were opened in a face-to-face manner. They were unaware that the moneys were then transferred into Ryder Investments, a company whose owners, controlling interests or beneficiaries are unknown.</P>
      <P>The sums involved are between &euro;20 million and &euro;40 million. This must be cleared up by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The operation of Gama Construction in Ireland must come under question. I am aware of concerns in some housing estates in Dublin city as to the quality of work by Gama. While I support the Department&rsquo;s efforts, I hope it has listened to Senator Morrissey&rsquo;s practical suggestions. This is still a black day for Ireland. Deputy Joe Higgins must be congratulated while the Department should hang its head in shame. We must apologise to the workers for allowing them to be systematically defrauded by their employers.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Norris for sharing his time. I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise the issue of those migrant workers, doctors and nurses, who come to Ireland at our invitation on working visas to prop up the health service. Without them, we would be unable to run it. Over the years, I have frequently raised the issue of the difficulties these workers have in bringing relations to Ireland for short visits such as weddings, christenings or for Christmas. It is both humiliating for them and for me that I have to appeal to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for people, who are often distinguished individuals in their own countries, to be allowed into Ireland for several days. On one occasion I had to ask for a Nigerian Minister to be given a 24 hour visa to see his son receive his degree from the Royal College of Physicians. The man was in London and simply wanted to be in Ireland for only one day. Why would a Nigerian Minister want to stay in Ireland? These situations arise over and over again. These workers are indispensable to the health service and it is disgraceful they are treated in this manner.</P>
      <P>As my services in this area had not been sought for approximately a year, I thought the situation had improved. However, that is not the case. In <Col N="1778"/>today&rsquo;s <i>Medicine Weekly</i> I read the following, under the heading &ldquo;Visas solution for non-EU doctors&rdquo;:</P>
      <P LI="1" el="3">Non-EU doctors are requesting a further meeting with the Department of Justice to resolve the ongoing difficulties with short-term visas for family members.</P>
      <P LI="1" el="0">Last year the IMO Non-EU Doctors Advisory Committee agreed an interim process with the Department, where members who were having difficulty securing holiday visas for family members could communicate with Department officials through a dedicated e-mail service.</P>
      <P LI="1" el="0">However, Committee Chairperson Mr Syed Jaffry said this was only intended to be a short-term measure and it was now time to find a more long-term resolution to the problem.</P>
      <P LI="1" el="0">&ldquo;The Department of Justice is acting with a single-track mind,&rdquo; Mr Jaffry said. &ldquo;They are not willing to change anything and want to stay where they are. But we are planning another meeting to express our dissatisfaction with the system and ask for suggestions on how to improve it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P FLI="0" el="3">This is terrible. Similar cases to the one I described earlier occur all the time. One case involves a girl from China who is doing vital research work in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital. When her husband wanted to come to this country for Christmas with their son it was thought that he would never return even though he had an excellent job in his home country. St. James&rsquo;s Hospital was worried that the girl would return to China with the research uncompleted.</P>
      <P>I am aware of another case where a man is seeking citizenship. He has filled a post in the medical service for 14 years, a post we have nobody else to fill. One would think that after 14 years the man concerned could get some type of advice as to why he is not granted citizenship. Of course, the Department is not obliged to state why citizenship is not being granted but what more can the man do? He has done all the required examinations and he is vital to this country.</P>
      <P>Another matter which has been brought to my attention is also covered in <i>Medicine Weekly</i>. It is a problem I understood had been resolved. We undertake massive recruiting drives in the Far East, particularly in India, Pakistan and Malaysia, and we recruit some of the best personnel. We bring them to jobs in this country which are supposed to last for two years. A number of anaesthetists are now particularly aggrieved. They were told they would not have to sit the temporary registration assessment scheme examination. In fact, they were warned not to take it. They were instead &ldquo;subjected to a rigorous appraisal by the various consultants with whom we were working&rdquo;. They continue: &ldquo;Nearly every one of the doctors recruited to work in Ireland under section 7.6 have extremely healthy appraisals submitted <Col N="1779"/>to the Medical Council by these senior colleagues.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>They came to this country on the understanding that they did not have to take the TRAS examination. However, after a number of years the council then said they had to take the examination. Why were they told they were suitable to work here without taking the examination only for them to discover a few years later that they must take the examination? They have been working satisfactorily here for a number of years. The Department will have to establish clarity between it and the Medical Council before bringing people to this country under what could be described as false pretences.</P>
      <P>More than money is a problem with regard to the rights of migrant workers in this country. There must be clarity so this country is not seen internationally as using and abusing people. The same has happened with the nursing profession. Nurses, particularly Filipino nurses, were told their spouses would be allowed to come to this country and work. We cannot run the health service without these nurses. However, numerous nurses have told me that when their husbands tried to get work permits they were refused.</P>
      <P>There are many issues to be addressed by the Minister. People we have enticed to this country are being treated as badly as those who could be described as having come here to further their own positions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment the Minister, Deputy Martin, on his speedy response to this crisis. I thank him for his comprehensive speech and for his hands-on approach to this issue. He has been in contact with the bank in the Netherlands and our ambassador is dealing with the matter.</P>
      <P>One point which has not been made clear is that the Gama organisation is Turkish owned. In this case Turkish employers are exploiting Turkish workers. Our responsibility is to uphold the employees&rsquo; rights under Irish law. It is appropriate that we have this debate today and I compliment the Leader on arranging it so speedily. I had hoped the report prepared by the inspectorate of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment would be published in this House. It should be published. I hope the injunction will be lifted and that the Minister can issue the document to the House to clear up this matter. It is important that the issue is clarified. It would also be appropriate to examine the legislation in this area.</P>
      <P>Each year millions of men and women leave their homes and cross national borders in search of greater security for themselves and their families. Most are motivated to migrate by the quest for higher wages and better opportunities but some are forced to do so because of famine, natural disasters, violent conflict or persecution. Historically, emigration has been economically beneficial to host countries as well as to the <Col N="1780"/>migrants. Many of the fears surrounding the impact of immigration on developed economies are unfounded or exaggerated. There is no evidence, for example, that immigration significantly reduces wages or increases unemployment.</P>
      <P>Immigration is one of the most important challenges currently facing Ireland and the other member states of the European Union. As a society, it is imperative that we deal with the issues posed by immigration in a positive, coherent and humane way. It is a relatively new phenomenon in this country, dating from the mid-1990s. We have changed radically from a country of emigration to being a receiving country. The experience of Irish emigrants in many countries was often one of discrimination and hardship. We should ensure that we give an opportunity to the people who come here and not treat them as our emigrants were treated in the United States and the United Kingdom in the last century. Our experience exhorts us to treat immigrants to this country humanely and with respect.</P>
      <P>We have an opportunity to manage the phenomenon of immigration in a positive, non-discriminatory, person-centred manner which will benefit both immigrants and the Irish society and economy. We must recognise at a legal level the rights of migrant workers and the important contribution such workers make to the European and Irish economies. According to the 2002 census, almost 7% of people living in Ireland are immigrants. This has significant implications for the workforce. In many towns, approximately 10% of the population is made up of non-EU nationals.</P>
      <P>According to research, difficulties in processing work permits remains a problem for more than a quarter of employers. To combat these delays the immigration system must be made more streamlined to provide for greater access to information, shorter work permit processing times and the provision of automatic permits for spouses. This will ensure Ireland has an adequate labour supply to sustain economic growth. Far from taking our jobs, migrant workers are often highly skilled and motivated. In general, having the enthusiasm to leave one&rsquo;s home country and seek a better life is a sign of determination and great enterprise.</P>
      <P>The Minister announced today that he is appointing an additional 11 labour inspectors, who will place a special emphasis on sectors where migrant workers are concentrated. The group will consist of a team leader and ten labour inspectors. The additional inspectors will strengthen the labour inspectorate&rsquo;s capacity to ensure that workers in these sectors receive their entitlements under employment rights legislation.</P>
      <P>The current system whereby employers hold the work permits is nothing more than bonded servitude. As a result, employees who are unhappy with pay and conditions are not free to change jobs. The Minister clarified the different categories but the fact that the permit is issued to the employer imposes a control on the worker and makes their life, in most cases, difficult. This has been highlighted in the case of the Gama <Col N="1781"/>workers. Almost 35,000 work permits were issued in 2004 compared to 45,000 in 2003. This is mainly due to the change in employment rights for citizens in the European accession countries who no longer need permits. There was concern on 1 May 2004 that there would be massive immigration here from the ten accession countries. This did not materialise. Our policy at the time was that we did not need permits for those from the 25 member states. This policy was correct. The highest proportion of work permits are issued to citizens from the Philippines. Some 864 permits were issued to them in the first quarter of 2005. This is appropriate because of the need for skilled workers, particularly nurses and other medical staff, in the health services. They are very welcome and the Minister and the Department should be commended on issuing permits for people&rsquo;s partners or spouses to allow them to come and work here.</P>
      <P>Shortage of certain skills can slow economic growth and by filling these gaps migrant workers boost the economy and create more jobs. Migrant workers also provide short-term relief from the pressure an aging population is putting on pensions and health services. We need migrant workers in the Irish economy. In most towns in the country we have people who are from outside the European Union. In my area, Roscommon, the majority of workers are from Brazil. They are skilled in the workings of the beef industry and other industries and are making an important contribution to the economy. This has created an enlightened attitude in the area and the workers have integrated successfully. The Minister is aware of the number of people who have come to this country and are making a contribution.</P>
      <P>We should be proud of our economy. Instead of our people emigrating to find work we are creating jobs in Ireland. Nothing succeeds like success. The more successful we are, the more people come to our shores. They must be treated with respect and I commend Deputy Joe Higgins on highlighting the situation of the Gama workers. I am sure that if this case had been brought to the attention of any Member of this House or of the D&aacute;il, he or she would have dealt with it in a similar manner and ensured that the rights of the workers were enhanced. There is great acceptance of the role of migrant workers in the economy.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is bringing forward a Bill that will put the employment permit arrangements on a legislative footing. This will provide greater accountability and transparency. The Bill will allow for a more managed economic migrant policy and enable the introduction of a green card system for highly-skilled migrant workers. I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern, and am delighted to see his involvement in this issue.</P>
      <P>This is a crisis as far as Gama workers are concerned. I believe the matter will be resolved suit<Col N="1782"/>ably. I hope the injunction will be lifted and we will have an opportunity to discuss this issue when the report is published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern. It is good that we are debating this issue. However, the reason for this debate is a source of shame to this country. That a company in the third millennium would treat workers in this fashion is disgraceful. The company has handled this matter very poorly. It has deliberately rejected factual information put to it by the media. In the High Court it has suppressed factual information gathered by the inspectorate at the Department, thereby adding insult to injury.</P>
      <P>Since coming to this country five years ago the company has worked on four major sites, including the Ballincollig bypass, the Ballymun regeneration project and the Ennis bypass. I was a member of Cork County Council when contracts were signed for the Ballincollig bypass. Councillor John Mulvihill, a former Member of the Lower House, asked questions about the treatment of workers and the remuneration they received. He also pointed out that this company had submitted a bid that was &euro;15 million lower than the nearest competitor. Even a cursory glance reveals this to be a huge amount of money, particularly in contract work, and particularly when most bids are within &euro;3 million or &euro;4 million of each other. Now we know the reason it could do this job at this price. It also bid for the contract for the Ennis bypass. This time its bid was &euro;5 million lower than the nearest competitor.</P>
      <P>These projects are vital for sustaining progress and encouraging infrastructural development. However, when contracts are signed by local authorities involving the National Roads Authority and funds from the EU there is now an onus on the State to ensure there is a clause that examines the rights of workers and employers&rsquo; obligations regarding contract law, workers&rsquo; rights and legislation affecting workers. This would be a proactive approach and would prevent situations from getting out of hand. This is no guarantee that workers will not be abused, that shortcuts will not be taken, or that such commitments will be honoured but the inspectorate could deal with that if the situation were to arise. At least there would be a structure in place to deal with this.</P>
      <P>Let us consider the 2003 accounts for Gama Construction Ireland Limited. It employed an average of about 1,000 people. Staff costs and wages were in excess of &euro;28 million. The average wage for workers was &euro;26,000. The figure is extraordinarily low when one considers the industry-wide minimum wage is &euro;12.60 per hour. Given the length of the working week one would not have to be a mathematician to know something is seriously wrong. It took the courage and foresight of Deputy Joe Higgins to reveal this scandal. Without him, we would not be discussing this. When it was discovered this money was kept in <Col N="1783"/>accounts in Holland it was, to all intents and purposes, money-laundering. This money was robbed from workers who did not have a command of the language and who worked from early morning to late in the evening. Years ago Irish workers abroad were the first to crow about these kind of conditions. Irish workers have never lost the mindset ingrained from years of working abroad.</P>
      <P>Documents in English were signed by workers. One presumes this was the way signatures were obtained so that money could be held in Dutch accounts. It was hypocritical and wrong for a representative of the company to appear on national television and rebut the information put to him and to claim workers knew this was happening. It was a lie. The company changed its position as events unfolded, which makes the matter worse. In some cases Turkish workers were being paid &euro;2.20 per hour, far below the minimum wage. We know about signs that went up on building sites and in shop doors in the UK to the effect that no Irish need apply for positions, yet this debacle happened in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Shortly after Senator O&rsquo;Rourke launched a book in Trinity College she raised the issue of female migrant workers. One woman who came to the country late in the evening got up early the next day and found a list of jobs to do. She had to complete tasks such as washing the dog and cutting the neighbour&rsquo;s grass. The woman had no time to settle in this country and probably did not have breakfast that morning. That list of tasks was drawn up by someone who knows better, someone who has benefited from the Celtic tiger and was in a position to hire staff. This is how that person abused workers&rsquo; rights.</P>
      <P>It is particularly sad when one considers that many of these workers leave behind young spouses and families. They came to this country to make money. The difference in remuneration is clear. They came to work in a country where they knew nobody. They were open to exploitation and were abused left, right and centre. In many cases, they came here just to improve the basic standard of living for their loved ones back home. There was no great financial reward for them. They were not buying yachts or holiday homes, they were simply trying to create a better standard of living for their loved ones.</P>
      <P>The very fact that no payslips were issued to these workers tells its own story. It is a disgrace and is a violation of Irish law. It was clearly designed to fool workers by using a paper trail to cover up where the money was. We all know now that it was in a bank in Holland.</P>
      <P>I know many steel fixers who are carrying out contract work in the Cork area. The levels of payment are well known. However, a 24-year-old steel fixer from Ankara claims he is owed &euro;33,000 by Turkish standards. That fact tells its own story because if it is &euro;33,000 by Turkish standards, one can be guaranteed it is a lot more by Irish standards. Other trained, skilled members of the workforce are being paid well below the grade <Col N="1784"/>that members of that profession would earn in this country.</P>
      <P>It is not good enough for Gama to go to the High Court because it adds injury to insult. It is despicable that the company has gone to the High Court in an attempt to suppress the inspector&rsquo;s report. I appeal to the Minister of State to fight, through every possible avenue, the legal attempts by Gama to block this information from coming into the public domain. We need to examine this information and we owe it to the workers who were abused by Gama to ensure it is released.</P>
      <P>When this matter was first revealed in early March, the statement issued by the company took some beating. Gama at first denied there had been any underpayments, while knowing full well that the money must have been in Holland all the time because they are the people who had put it there. The company then released a statement saying that an administrative error was responsible for an underpayment of 8%. That is despicable and the person who defended that position has no credibility. They blamed an administrative error for an 8% underpayment but do they think the Department inspectorate&rsquo;s officials are fools, or that the politician who revealed this scandal was at a loss to understand the English language?</P>
      <P>Since 2002, the money has been transferred to these Dutch bank accounts. I will repeat the figures involved. The workers claim they were being paid &euro;2.27 per hour, as against an industry standard minimum wage of &euro;12.60. The difference equates to about &euro;4,000 which is exactly the amount of money that was being lodged every three months in a bank account in Holland. It is clear, therefore, that the money was being deliberately deducted from the employees without their knowledge and being lodged in that account.</P>
      <P>An article by Michael Clifford in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> stated that one of the employee&rsquo;s accounts in the Dutch bank listed his address as Netterville Manor, Meath, Dowth, Ireland. The address in question is an old Irish house offering up-market bed and breakfast facilities. It is fair to say that there is not necessarily any link between the people who run this bed and breakfast establishment and the advertisement itself. It is a world away from the Second World War billeted accommodation that those people were used to. A website listed a telephone number for this particular employee, which was the number of Gama Ireland&rsquo;s headquarters in D&uacute;n Laoghaire. That is disgraceful. It is clear that they concocted this information to make it look as if it was a genuine operation.</P>
      <P>I was driving along Molesworth Street yesterday and I came across the protest by the affected workers. I wound down my car window and was able to listen to the case being made by Deputy Joe Higgins. A good number of Turkish workers were outside the gates of Leinster House bringing their protest to the national Parliament.</P><Col N="1785"/>
      <P>It was a scandal that this case was allowed to happen but at least action is now being taken. It illustrates the extent to which people were prepared to go in order to break the law and abuse workers rights &mdash; one of the fundamental principles of social justice and equality for which my party was established over 80 years ago. It is a scandal that this has been allowed to continue in the third millennium. I appeal to the Minister of State to fight at every available opportunity the legal efforts being made by Gama. We owe it to the workers to publish the inspector&rsquo;s report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to be able to speak on this issue. Over the years, we have had little experience of migrant workers because of emigration patterns. That does not, however, excuse in any way what has occurred in this case, far from it. It is difficult to imagine Ireland having a difficulty with migrant workers, given the way Irish emigrants were treated in other countries in the past. Senator McCarthy referred to the Gama company, which is the most obvious case. It has been cited in all the newspapers and while we all know about it, it is only the tip of the iceberg. The Gama case is instructive, given what it has highlighted. I am glad that Deputy Joe Higgins raised the matter and I regret that his work in this regard has not been commended. We are inclined to say, &ldquo;Oh, that fellow&rdquo;, but I feel he did the State a service by raising this issue. Who else would have stood up for the Gama workers? I do not know. I did not see anybody else on the horizon willing to do the rounds that Deputy Joe Higgins undertook. He deserves to be praised for having raised the matter, as do the workers for highlighting their case.</P>
      <P>I was at the gates of Leinster House yesterday afternoon and was glad that the workers were able to bring their case to the Houses of the Oireachtas. It was a good day for the workers and for democracy. Over the years, so many Irish were badly treated abroad, working in run-down jobs for low pay. There was nobody to stand up for them, while the establishment lorded it over them. The previous speaker was right to point out that the sign &ldquo;No Irish Need Apply&rdquo; appeared in some places.</P>
      <P>When there is a chance of highlighting such cases, they should be brought to public attention. We should begin at the beginning. Gama was able to quote a low-cost estimate for the work involved. All those jobs would have been hotly contested by various contractors, yet Gama was able to provide a cheap estimate because it was paying its workers &euro;2.27 per hour when the going rate was &euro;16.75. The Minister also quoted the figure of &euro;12.60.</P>
      <P>Much has been made of the fact that they knew the other money, which they should have been receiving, was going to a Dutch bank account. I do not understand why they were asked to sign a form in English, which meant their money would go to the Dutch bank. It is daft because those workers spoke very little English. When the issue <Col N="1786"/>was first raised we were told that no complaints had been received from Gama workers, but how could they complain? They did not know where Kildare Street was, or the labour inspectorate or the Department. Neither did they know how to go about contacting departmental officials or the Minister. They are in another country where they cannot speak the language and do not know the relevant addresses, so how could they know where to go with their complaints? Gama&rsquo;s contention that it had received no complaint from the workers was the silliest response to the matter. The workers did not speak the language and did not have the know-how to formally lodge a complaint.</P>
      <P>I hope the Department will henceforth be much more proactive in dealing with migrant workers in order to see whether their complaints are well founded. Departmental officials should search for the relevant workers and ask them for information, rather than waiting passively. The Department should undertake a proactive campaign rather than merely stating that no complaints by Gama workers were received. That is shameful. The Department inspector should be out among migrant workers, asking if there are problems. If they do not understand English, the inspector should hire someone proficient in Turkish, Romanian, Croatian or whatever language is spoken by workers on the site. Those who speak the language of the country in which they live have a distinct advantage while those who do not are at a clear disadvantage.</P>
      <P>I still do not understand why money was being lodged in Dutch bank accounts, or why the Gama directors will not allow the report to be published. They have asked the courts twice or perhaps three times for an injunction against the publication of the report. I understand the report was carried out by the inspectorate and the Department. The Minister said he will circulate it to the Garda and other bodies. It is a pity he did not do so on the day he received it because we would then understand the situation better. There must be something in the report injurious to Gama management, since it does not want it released. There can be no other explanation. If the report clears the management, why should it not allow it be released? I expect that the report is very condemnatory of the way in which Gama management has carried out its business. Gama was able to quote very low estimates for many jobs because it was paying much less to its workers than Irish employers observing labour law and paying the requisite rates. An injustice has been done in that regard. I do not know how the report will be released. If I were the Minister I would be considering that issue.</P>
      <P>Senator McCarthy is correct regarding female migrant workers. I launched the relevant report in early December and it would make the hair stand on one&rsquo;s head. Those workers are in bonded slavery in this country. Women are brought in as cr&egrave;che workers, housekeepers, nannies or whatever but in many cases are badly <Col N="1787"/>treated. Their cases are documented in black and white. I cannot recall the name of the report but it was startling. I heard someone ask how these workers dared tell their stories of employment. Why should they not tell them and talk of what was happening to them, and in so doing highlight their cases? Many are terrified. It is easy for us to suggest they be brave and speak up. If one is in another country, dependent on passage home, does not speak the language and does not have friends, one&rsquo;s instincts are to play safe and not speak up.</P>
      <P>Senator McCarthy is correct. I read of a woman who arrived at Dublin Airport at 11 o&rsquo;clock and went to the house where she was to work as a housekeeper or housemaid. The employer greeted her and gave her a list of jobs to be done in the morning. She was first to wash the dog, then to mow the neighbour&rsquo;s lawn. There were about 20 other instructions. Presumably she was expected to work like this every day.</P>
      <P>I talked to many of these workers. We do not have enough interaction and are inclined to return to our old grooves and say these workers are lucky to get jobs and to be here. How could that be so? Their passage costs are stopped from their wages, which is fair if the arrangement has been entered into. I can understand that, but I cannot understand how they are treated as menials by jumped-up jackasses barely a day or two removed from whatever they worked at before. That they see fit to treat people in that fashion is a serious indictment of Ireland.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister has promised 11 more labour inspectors. The jobs must be advertised and interviews and appointments must take place. That the numbers are to be increased by 50% almost overnight shows the Minister recognises the shortage. I congratulate the Minister on getting Cabinet approval so quickly for these appointments.</P>
      <P>The employment laws must be obeyed. It is very good news that there will be more labour inspectors but I urge that they be proactive and not weakly wait for complaints to come from people who do not speak English and do not know where Kildare Street is. Can one imagine someone from another country marching to the gates of Leinster House and demanding to speak to someone who would ensure his or her rights? One would get short shrift if one tried that game. Accordingly, a more proactive approach is needed on the part of labour inspectors.</P>
      <P>However it turns out, the Gama situation is only the tip of the iceberg regarding what is happening in other towns and areas. There are also numerous instances of great rapport between Irish employers and workers from other countries. I know of a mushroom industry outside Athlone which employs Latvians and Lithuanians who have been properly paid and housed and who have a great relationship with their employer. Many good stories do not surface but <Col N="1788"/>each bad story we hear is a blot on Ireland and on our record of how we treat employees.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. The appalling conditions experienced by many migrant workers in this country are a national disgrace. Unscrupulous employers are responsible but the Government must share the responsibility for its failure to take prompt and decisive action in the area. Employers found to be in breach of the regulations should if possible be jailed. The Leader was correct in saying that the Department must take a more proactive role. There is no point in waiting until it hears of problems. The Department should seek out problems and find out what is happening with migrant workers.</P>
      <P>Gama has been regularly mentioned, but we have seen breaches of regulations in the Irish shipping industry, in the health service and in many other areas. The minimum wage legislation has been breached and very little action has been taken against the culprits. Under the relevant Act, the penalties for non-compliance are derisory and should be urgently changed.</P>
      <P>We have about 17 inspectors to inspect and police the labour force of probably 1.5 million workers. The number of dog inspectors, about 50, is more than the number of inspectors policing the workforce. I welcome the 11 extra labour inspectors. It is a case of &ldquo;too little, too late&rdquo; but they must be welcomed. Their brief should be to be proactive, as the Leader said, rather than wait for complaints. Their job is to go among the workforce, into the factories and wherever people are working.</P>
      <P>It was stated recently in a newspaper article that last year, the then Minister for Finance, the former Deputy McCreevy, wanted to increase the number of labour inspectors but the initiative was obstructed and sabotaged by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Did this happen? The question needs to be answered. At the time, the Minister in that Department saw its main duty as smoothing the path of business, with no obvious need for labour inspectors despite the repeated allegations of abuse of migrant workers. As a result of public opinion, particularly with regard to Gama, the situation has clearly changed.</P>
      <P>However, we have seen little action. When will legislation be introduced to ensure adequate penalties are put in place to penalise people who do not comply with labour law and regulations?</P>
      <P>The Minister alluded to the work permit situation. I thought his response very woolly. We need legislation to deal with this area as the current policy does not work and only adds to the suggestion that what we promote is a type of <Col N="1789"/>slave labour. The Department states that its policy should be informed by the imperative to address the identified labour and skill needs in the economy. Giving work permits to employees rather than employers will not affect that; it may actually help. There is a need for radical restructuring of policy in the area. We need it now. The time for reports and promises is long gone. We need action from the Minister rather than words.</P>
      <P>Some people may be prepared to see our roads, tunnels and other important infrastructure being built by workers who work ridiculously long hours for ridiculously low pay, workers who are vulnerable and afraid to speak out in many instances. I am not prepared to see this proud country sink to such a low, which is what is happening. The Government must act to ensure justice is done and seen to be done in this regard. I understand the Department is in possession of a recent report which suggests reforms that will ensure the burden of compliance will be switched to firms. Greater penalties are also suggested. When will the legislation be introduced?</P>
      <P>I note from the Minister&rsquo;s speech that he received a report of the investigation of the labour inspector into alleged breaches of employment rights with regard to Gama. He further stated that the labour inspectorate is continuing its investigation and that if breaches of employment legislation are found, the legislation will be enforced in full. Does this mean we will receive another report following the current one? The Minister&rsquo;s speech is confusing because he mentions that he cannot publish the current report because of the High Court challenge, but he still speaks of a continuing investigation. Will the Minister of State clarify that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Cummins for sharing his time with me as I am anxious to speak on this issue. Times have changed from little over a decade ago and the previous century and a half when many young Irish people relied on other countries for employment. The Irish diaspora travelled to the United Kingdom, Australia, the United States and many other countries and were well taken care of. Our rights were undermined at times, sometimes by our own people. Anybody who went to the United Kingdom would say that the employers and the government there were very fair to Irish workers and introduced holidays etc. Unfortunately, it was sometimes the Irish employer or colleagues from their community who abused and undermined the rights of the Irish workers.</P>
      <P>Now many years on, the ball is at our foot. We cannot allow a situation where a Filipina could work on an Irish ferry for a paltry &euro;1 an hour. We cannot allow Turkish workers come into our country and work for &euro;2 to &euro;3 an hour, as is alleged. We must ensure this does not happen and not just give lip service to this important issue. I was embarrassed that a woman would be paid &euro;1 an hour and that this woman was paid off by a highly visible company with &euro;25,000. This is <Col N="1790"/>not acceptable. The rigours of the law must be enforced to ensure that any company that undermines workers rights or that underpays workers should face the full rigours of the law.</P>
      <P>Over 20 years ago we took great pride in the &ldquo;buy Irish&rdquo; campaign and in goods that were guaranteed Irish. As a small shopkeeper employer who finds it difficult to operate profitably I welcomed the introduction of the minimum wage. However, it is difficult to compete with large supermarkets and companies that do not pay the minimum wage as the minimum wage is not enforced by regulation. Years ago people would support Irish products and businesses, but I urge the people to boycott those businesses that do not pay the minimum wage. How far will Irish consumers go in this regard? Unfortunately, consumers are driven by price, not by service. They do not care what happens behind closed doors as long as they get value. The market must be sorted out, but we must sort ourselves out also.</P>
      <P>I am delighted the inspectorate has been increased by 50%. This has come a little late, but is welcome. We must enforce our policy and ensure that migrant workers are welcomed into the country and that they receive the same respect and rights as the Irish worker. I welcome this debate in which we all have a role to play.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Senator Hanafin.</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I would be delighted if this debate was unnecessary. However, as it is necessary, I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on it. As a person who was an emigrant and who worked across the water I can speak from practical experience and say that I did not share the fate of the Gama workers or their recent experience. Whether we speak to employers of the Gama workers or others, there can be no hiding place for people who treat workers in this fashion. It is a typical example of man&rsquo;s inhumanity to man.</P>
      <P>Some years ago we all read and heard about the Irish tatie hokers who went to Scotland. We know how much attention that story drew and how their treatment was condemned. The influx of the Gama workers and others to this country is an enrichment of the work force. They should and must not be treated any differently from others. If they are doing the job, they deserve the same pay. It is outrageous that people must take to the streets in protest, as we have witnessed. Having heard this debate from its inception it is clear the issue is not the preserve of any section or side of the political divide. This matter exercises the mind of every Member of the Oireachtas and must be addressed appropriately.</P>
      <P>The only access to Ireland, a country on the periphery of the European Union, is by water or air. There are difficulties in a number of trades, not least the catering and construction trades, <Col N="1791"/>where it is difficult to get certain categories of workers. If we have created a situation where we welcome through advertisement in the international media non-national workers to our shores, proper working conditions, proper levels of pay and, above all, proper treatment of those workers should obtain. Nothing less is or will be acceptable.</P>
      <P>I strongly support the comments of every speaker. One of the disadvantages of speaking later in a debate is much of what one would like to say has been said but we will not boil the cabbage twice. The Minister of State has an in-depth interest in ensuring migrant workers should be treated the way we would all like to be treated, fairly and squarely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s commitment to support migrant workers. The deliberate mistreatment of such workers is not done in our name and the Government will introduce the necessary legislation to ensure not only that these workers get their fair share but that they have a positive experience in Ireland and receive a c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte. The demands placed on the workforce by the expanding economy means migrant workers are needed. They are welcome and they enrich us in many ways. Occasionally, we forget how much Ireland benefits from welcoming people of different nationalities, culture and skills, which make the country wealthier. The skills needed to work in the tourism or mushroom picking industries might not be as high as those required by the medical profession and so on but some migrant workers in these industries have greater skills and it was recommended in a recent report that they should be allowed to use their skills for the benefit of the country so that we can continue to develop.</P>
      <P>The sign, &ldquo;No Irish Need Apply&rdquo;, still lingers in the memory and while it is not comfortable to recall such signs, it is good to recall that the Irish were not always welcome abroad, yet they enriched the countries to which they emigrated, particularly the United States. Approximately 44 million people in the US are of Irish descent while in the UK one in seven people is of Irish descent and 30% of the Australian population is of Irish descent. They are an intrinsic part of these communities. We must also be open and the Government is absolutely committed in this regard.</P>
      <P>The Irish experience of the vast majority of migrant workers is positive. I take pride in the efforts of their Irish co-workers to ensure they return home with a positive experience of Ireland. However, we can also benefit and we should concentrate on this. The workers in Gama have become an important reference point for all of us. The Government is totally committed to them to ensure their full rights are vindicated.</P>
      <P>Ireland was a country of net emigration for many years but it has become a country of net immigration. We are coping with this challenge <Col N="1792"/>and working positively to ensure migrant workers who are entitled to the minimum wage of &euro;7.65 per hour, which will be introduced in May, receive it and, more important, to ensure they can develop their skills and lives. I await with interest the proposals to ensure migrant workers have security of tenure during their stay in Ireland. The Government has introduced a number of initiatives, including the appointment of 11 additional labour inspectors, and it is committed to ensuring migrant workers have a fair and positive experience of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State. No Irish person will have been proud on reading about the plight of the Gama workers. Anyone who has worked can only feel sad about workers who have been allegedly treated like them. Other companies who employ migrant workers look after them as best they can and ensure their accommodation is top class and their wages are looked after in an orderly manner but, unfortunately, a number of companies which paid workers a fraction of the official union rate tendered successfully for contacts against companies who paid the appropriate rate. The Government must step in and penalise such companies. Many migrant workers are not housed in appropriate accommodation by these employers. In a number of cases senior company officials have purchased accommodation to house their migrant employees who, in turn, pay the mortgages for them.</P>
      <P>We were grateful to take in migrant workers because there was a significant skills shortage a few years ago. Some of these workers had trades and other skills, which ensured production levels were maintained by many companies so that they could meet the urgent requirements of the marketplace. We would not be where we are if it were not for those workers. They have been employed in every factory in every town and village in the State and they have made a major contribution to our development and wealth over the past few years. It is disturbing to read about the low pay some of them received. The increase in the minimum wage is welcome and it at least provides a floor regarding what workers are entitled to be paid. I compliment the Minister of State in this regard.</P>
      <P>Companies engaged in tourism and meat processing would have closed down years ago if it were not for migrant workers. Ireland has a highly educated population, many of whom have graduated from low skill to high skills jobs. As a consequence, migrant workers are required and it must be ensured they are looked after because many of them will return home to set up businesses and more of their compatriots will be required to ensure our economy continues to expand. Many Irish people have travelled abroad on work permits and it would be a sad day if we thought our emigrants had been treated in the same way non-national workers have been treated by a number of domestic companies. It <Col N="1793"/>would be a sad day if we thought that Irish emigrants in Australia and other countries might be treated in the fashion in which it appears some companies have treated non-national workers here. In examining that, we must not lose sight of the very good companies that paid the required rates and looked after employees as the permits ensured they would. I am aware of several in my own town in the midlands who are certainly being looked after and paid well. Unfortunately, from what we read in the newspapers, several companies have not honoured their commitments and have let down this country and the Government that gave them the permits to allow them to enter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend the Seanad on having facilitated this very important debate. I strongly support the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, in his undertakings in this regard. I also greatly appreciate the work of the labour inspectorate and departmental officials, particularly over the last few weeks, in which an enormous amount of work was done in a very short time. I thank those Senators who contributed to the debate and I will try to respond to the points made. Sometimes that is a little difficult, since I tend to pick out one or two when people may have made much more rounded contributions.</P>
      <P>Senator Coghlan asked a very important question when he sought assurances that each Gama worker would get the full amount due to him. As the Minister said in his opening address, that is our intention. Every effort will be made to ensure that all Gama workers, past and present, are given their due entitlements and that their terms and conditions of work are in accordance with the law and honoured in full. I can certainly give that assurance.</P>
      <P>Senator Morrissey asked several questions, among them how the work permits section checks when work permits are being renewed that people have been paid the amount undertaken in the original application. That is checked through the P60 system which document is sought for renewal of a work permit. Senator Norris made several points. Previous examinations of this situation and others did not throw up the facts that appear to have come to light in this instance, and that is regrettable. Senator Henry referred to family reunification issues, something we will have to address as a nation as realistically we have a very large number of non-nationals working in the economy, many of whom are likely to wish to stay here for a considerable period or perhaps for the rest of their lives.</P>
      <P>Senator Leyden congratulated the Minister on the work he had done to date and made the very important point that we must publish the report. One hopes that, when the injunction is lifted, that will be the case. Senator McCarthy, among other issues, questioned the awarding of contracts. That <Col N="1794"/>is one of the issues that has not been a central focus owing to fears and concerns regarding the workers, but the Government will consider it. It is very important that there be a level playing field and fair play in that regard.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Rourke made the point that there ought to be more formal interaction with migrant workers to enable them to make the inspectorate and others aware of any difficulties regarding their employment. That is one of the difficulties that we have had, since we have not really been able to get that information as readily as one would from English-speaking workers. In that regard, I pay tribute to Deputy Joe Higgins for his work on this problem and also to SIPTU, which has consistently argued for an increase in the number of labour inspectors, pointing out that there have been concerns regarding migrant workers. I also met representatives of the Migrant Rights Centre, which I found extremely helpful in pointing out what difficulties there might be. It is fair to say that, all things considered, a considerable amount of additional light has been cast on the entire area of migrant workers, their contribution to our economy, how they are being treated and how they should be treated. We certainly need to go forward from here to ensure that such issues are dealt with.</P>
      <P>I heard several speakers, including Senator Cummins whose central point concerned the need for additional vigilance and stronger legislation and enforcement. Inevitably, that will emerge from this debate. Senator Feighan referred, as did other speakers, to the historical change in our own role from being the people who were the migrant workers to being those whose economy now needs such workers. Senator Glynn regretted the need for the debate, while simultaneously welcoming it. In a sense, that encapsulates what we all feel about this situation.</P>
      <P>Senator Hanafin welcomed the Minister&rsquo;s commitment, given in his speech this morning and his work over recent weeks, which I strongly support. Senator Moylan once again made the point about competition in a situation where some employers may not be paying the correct rates or may have people working longer hours than is legal. It is impossible for those who comply with the legislation to compete for the awarding of contracts. It is perhaps also suggested that we should check more carefully regarding other migrant workers.</P>
      <P>There are already some positives emerging from today&rsquo;s debate and what has happened since 8 February. First, there is the appointment of the additional labour inspectors, a step to which I committed myself very soon after my appointment in September 2004. I am delighted we will have 11 more people in this role. It will have an enormously positive impact on the quality of the workplace for everyone in employment, something of which we sometimes lose sight. We have very successfully increased our workforce from just over 1.1 million to over 1.9 million, but we must also consider the quality of that experience for people, since there are factors besides pay <Col N="1795"/>that encourage people to participate. I am delighted that we will have the additional labour inspectors to assist us in that regard. It is also important to point out that it would not matter how many inspectors one had if one did not have the evidence and co-operation of workers to ensure that matters alleged can be pursued. One hopes that we will see that in the outcome of this case in the coming months. I look forward to the publication of the report when the injunction is lifted and welcome what the Minister said in that regard earlier today.</P>
      <P>As many Senators may be aware, I announced the national minimum wage increase with effect from 1 May. The minimum wage area ties in very closely with much of what has been happening over the past few days regarding what the inspectors have been trying to establish and what speakers have been seeking here. We must remember that the minimum wage can be enforced, as can the registered employment agreement rates. However, currently, in the construction industry, these range from &euro;7.36 to &euro;8.09 per hour. A difficulty regarding the rate means that it has not been updated since 1998. The joint industrial council norm is &euro;16.20, but that is currently not enforceable, something that may well turn out to be a problem.</P>
      <P>It is also important to reiterate what the Minister said regarding the entitlements of migrant workers. They have precisely the same rights under our labour legislation as everyone else, and those rights will be vindicated. Sometimes the State may move slowly and is frequently the butt of criticism for the fact that procedures are somewhat slow and may seem tedious. However, there are very good reasons for that. We operate within the law, expecting and demanding that employers and others do the same. We must be prepared to do the same ourselves and if matters go to court, they are adjudicated on at that point.</P>
      <P>I should also point out that we have an enormous amount of labour legislation, a very confusing corpus with a great number of Acts and provisions that cross over each other. I hope to draw all that legislation together, making the machinery of labour relations considerably more user-friendly than at present. It is something of an ordeal for someone to work through it. Ultimately, that will be to everyone&rsquo;s benefit. I am glad to report that I have the support of the social partners and the Government in seeking to make that move. It will make a very positive contribution to resolving difficulties such as those we are discussing today.</P>
      <P>Several speakers referred to the number of work permits. In 1999, we issued only 6,000 such permits. By 2003, that figure had risen to 48,000. An enormous workload was imposed on the section. To be fair, most people would agree that the most important requirement of the State was that the positions that needed to be filled and the workers necessary to enable to economy to grow were provided. Perhaps we did not provide as <Col N="1796"/>much expertise or support to those issuing the work permits as we should have done. We certainly have lessons to learn from today; we will do so and act on them.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the proposed employment permits Bill and the possibility of introducing a green card system. While such a system would address some of the difficulties, I am not sure that it would not create other small difficulties. We will need to be vigilant to ensure that a good balance is struck. The current system has some advantages for employees &mdash; for example, employers are eventually checked when they make applications. That process would become more difficult if authorisations, in the form of green cards, were held by employees. We can examine that aspect of the matter carefully in the context of the debate on the forthcoming Bill.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, people from the accession states and elsewhere in the European Economic Area have had full employment rights in this jurisdiction since 1 May 2004. Ireland&rsquo;s decision to give them such rights was warmly welcomed by other EU member states, particularly the accession states. It has drawn admiration from some countries which have been EU member states for a long time. They are impressed that a small open economy with a relatively small population has taken what is acknowledged to be a brave step by allowing people from the accession states to work in this country without work permits. The system we have introduced has worked well. The House should bear in mind that there are over 19 million unemployed people in the EU. As a member of the Union, Ireland is obliged not to walk away from such people.</P>
      <P>We often refer to work permits, but we should remember that there are four different forms of work permit &mdash; I refer to the work authorisation system, the visa system, the inter-company transfer authorisation system, which is very important, and the system of permits for service contracts. The area is much wider and more complex than people realise. Perhaps it was inevitable that difficulties would arise, but the Government and the Parliament need to respond by taking action on foot of what has been discovered. I assure the House that will be done.</P>

    <Title>Statute Law Revision (Pre-1922) Bill 2004: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>The Statue Law Revision (Pre-1922) Bill provides for the repeal of 91 Acts that predate the foundation of the State. These are statutes that were enacted before 6 December 1922 that are no longer in force and are considered to be spent or are still in force but are no longer of practical utility.</P>
      <P>This Bill is intended to help streamline the Statute Book and it forms part of the Government&rsquo;s overall commitment to better regulation and regulatory reform. When the Taoiseach announced his intention last year to bring forward this legislation, he noted that when it comes to the Statute Book, we tend to add and never subtract and that we need to remove the dead wood from the pre-1922 Statute Book. This is a sentiment that many of us agree with as elected representatives who have had occasion to piece together the law in particular areas. If Senators and Deputies &mdash; and indeed public officials whose job it is &mdash; have difficulty at times sourcing and interpreting the law in particular areas, what chance has the ordinary citizen, small company or community group? The introduction of this Bill takes a step towards improving the overall accessibility of the Statute Book and it represents delivery of a key commitment in the Government&rsquo;s White Paper, Regulating Better, which was published in January 2004.</P>
      <P>Before outlining the substance of the Bill, it might be useful if I provided a brief background to the wider better regulation agenda and, as part of that, the contribution that Statute Law revision can make. Better regulation is increasingly used in EU and OECD countries to describe government efforts to improve the quality and, where necessary, reduce the quantity of regulation. Regulation is generally taken to include both primary and secondary legislation as well as subsidiary rules including administrative circulars and red tape. It is important to stress that better regulation is not simply deregulation. In some cases, removing regulations may be the answer while in other cases greater regulation or regulations which are more easily understood, may be required.</P>
      <P>At the core of better regulation is the idea that we need to tackle both the flow of new legislation and rules and the existing stock of laws and regulations. The principal way in which the flow of new regulations is being tackled is through the introduction of regulatory impact analysis. This approach involves Departments consulting more widely before regulating and analysing in greater detail the likely impacts of Acts and statutory instruments before presenting them to the Oireachtas. In this way, proposed Bills and statutory instruments will benefit from being subjected <Col N="1798"/>to comment by interested parties and will be fully evaluated in terms of downstream impacts.</P>
      <P>The second element of a good regulatory system is managing the stock of existing laws and rules and this is where today&rsquo;s Bill fits in. While it is critical to improve the quality and even stem the flow of new regulations that are coming on stream, we must simultaneously tackle the body of existing laws and regulations. Some of these laws and rules are archaic and are a heavy burden on the economy and society as a whole. That is why the Taoiseach asked the Attorney General last year to examine if it is necessary to carry forward into our Statute Book laws that were enacted as far back as the 13th century. The Bill presented today is the first step towards removing some of the redundant legislation &mdash; the dead wood.</P>
      <P>Statute law revision is the process of removing legislation that has lost any modern purpose from the Statute Book. As Members of this House will know, the term &ldquo;Statute Book&rdquo; is a loose and non-technical term referring to all primary legislation &mdash; statutes or Acts &mdash; and secondary legislation &mdash; orders, regulations, rules, schemes and bye-laws &mdash; currently in force.</P>
      <P>The Bill being discussed today, however, deals only with primary legislation. While we would all like to see as much as possible of the dead wood being cleared away, including obsolete statutory instruments, this process is resource intensive and time consuming. For the moment, resources have been focused on primary legislation but in time the Taoiseach and the Attorney General both wish to see similar measures being taken with regard to secondary legislation.</P>
      <P>Unlike the process of law reform, law revision does not change the substantive nature of law. Its primary objective is to facilitate the users of the law, including judges, lawyers, officers of registries and bodies and the public generally. Furthermore, all Departments and the drafters of our legislation also benefit and Members of these Houses stand to gain from statute law revision.</P>
      <P>For example, where a statute has been on the Statute Book for quite some time, and needs to be modernised or otherwise amended in the normal course of business, extensive research of subsequent statutes has to be undertaken to see if they have any effect. This involves time consuming examination of statutes many of which may be spent or otherwise deleted but which are technically unrepealed. Unless they have been formally repealed, for example by way of a Bill such as the one we are debating today, there is no way of knowing their status, short of examining them.</P>
      <P>Ultimately, law revision facilitates the administration of justice, the enforcement of law and order and the management of the public and private sector. Removing the dead wood facilitates the process of regulatory reform and contributes to the maintenance of an updated, relevant and coherent Statute Book. It enables the legal system to operate more efficiently because it reduces time spent locating and consulting the <Col N="1799"/>Statute Book to determine the law on a particular point. Given the rapid growth in the size of the Statute Book, the value of statute revision can probably most usefully be seen by considering the likely size of the Statute Book in the future if nothing is done.</P>
      <P>The pre-1922 statutory provisions comprise a complex mosaic of Acts of Irish, English and British Parliaments and Parliaments of the United Kingdom that are not available electronically. The principal sources of this legislation, consisting of public general statutes, can be divided into different periods during which the law was enacted by different parliaments as follows: Irish statutes passed by Parliaments sitting in Ireland before the union with Britain between 1200 and 1800; English statutes passed before 1495 which were applied to Ireland, largely by virtue of Poynings Law in 1495; a small number of English statutes passed between 1495 and 1707 which were applied to Ireland; a small number of British statutes, namely, statutes passed after the union of England and Scotland in 1707 but before the union of Britain and Ireland in 1800, which were applied to Ireland; and Acts of the late United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland passed after the Act of Union in 1800 but before the establishment of Saorst&aacute;t &Eacute;ireann in 1922.</P>
      <P>This general body of statute law was continued in force by Article 73 of the Constitution of Saorst&aacute;t &Eacute;ireann and Article 50 of the Constitution of Ireland, subject to that Constitution and to the extent to which it was not inconsistent therewith. Legislation, therefore, spans as far back as 1200. Most of this legislation was enacted by the Parliament of the former United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.</P>
      <P>The industrial revolution and the development of trade in the 19th century led to increasingly detailed trade protection laws. The butter, coal, linen, tobacco and hosiery trades were all regulated during this time. From the mid-19th century onwards legislation began to reflect greater concern for individual welfare and legislation was passed dealing with a wide variety of topics such as chimney sweeps, bath and wash-houses, accidents during dangerous activities and tuberculosis.</P>
      <P>Only a few statute law revision measures in the past two centuries have been enacted to clarify, repeal and reform the entire body of law remaining on the Statute Book. Several major statute law revision Acts in the Victorian era repealed a considerable quantity of pre-union Irish legislation. This type of omnibus repealing legislation was not repeated until 1962 and 1983. The Statute Law Revision (Pre-Union Irish Statutes) Act 1962 covered the years 1459 to 1800 and the Statute Law Revision Act 1983 dealt with English and British Acts which were passed during the period from 1235 to 1796 which by one means or another applied in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Other efforts to clarify pre-1922 law included the Fisheries (Statute Law Revision) Acts of 1949 <Col N="1800"/>and 1956 and the Short Titles Act 1962. This latter Act assigned short titles to certain pre-union Irish statutes and English statutes that applied to Ireland in order to facilitate their citation.</P>
      <P>Some attempts have been made to reform the post-1922 law and some legislation has updated these laws, for example, the Canals Act 1983, the Stock Exchange Act 1995 and the Criminal Law Act 1997. Ten major consolidation Acts have also been enacted which replaced a significant quantity of pre-1922 legislation.</P>
      <P>The need for statute law revision in Ireland was recognised through the establishment in 1999 of the statute law revision unit in the Office of the Attorney General. The unit was responsible for drafting the Bill which represents the first broad-ranging statute law revision exercise for over 20 years. In the United Kingdom, more than 2,000 Acts have been repealed and at least 2,600 more partially repealed by the statute law (repeals) legislation drafted by various law commissions.</P>
      <P>The process of repealing large amounts of legislation was made possible by the systematic undertaking of the work involved since 1965. Other EU and OECD countries have initiated similar programmes to streamline and codify their respective statute books. Senators may recall commitments made by various administrations in the USA to reductions of the order of several thousands of pages of federal regulations and even of reductions in pounds weight of internal administrative rules. In recent times, the European Commission has given commitments to the reduction by 25% of the <i>acquis communautaire</i>, which is the existing body of Community treaty and subsidiary law. The process of weeding out redundant EU directives and regulations is ongoing.</P>
      <P>The Bill deals exclusively with those statutes passed before 6 December 1922 which are no longer in force and considered to be spent or which remain in force but are no longer of practical utility. Many Acts from the period continue to form the cornerstone of Irish law including the Conveyancing Act 1634, the Statute of Frauds 1695 and the Sale of Goods Act 1893. These Acts will not be affected by the Bill.</P>
      <P>When the initial review was launched, it was decided from the point of view of time and resources to confine the exercise to an audit of legislation that was available only from <i>The Statutes Revised</i>, a UK publication. It was also decided to exclude private, local and personal Acts. The main source of pre-union Irish statutes was a revised version also known as <i>Cullinan&rsquo;s Irish Statutes 1310 to 1800</i>, but other sources going back to 1200 were also examined. The cut-off year of 1922 is, of course, the date from which the Irish State began to legislate for itself.</P>
      <P>The process followed involved an examination by the statute law revision unit of <i>The Statutes Revised</i> to ascertain the extent to which the legislation outlined was still in force in Ireland by reference to the chronological tables pre and post-<Col N="1801"/>1922. The tables show how and when legislation has been amended since its enactment.</P>
      <P>As a result of the review, a list was compiled of all legislation identified as being in force which dated from the period between 1200 and 1922. It was decided to exclude from the review areas legislation known to be the subject of active policy consideration by Departments or part of the programme for Government such as criminal law, conveyancing and land law, revenue law, liquor licensing law, water services law, consumer law, merchant shipping and fisheries law and the law relating to harbours and railways. Some 800 Acts were therefore isolated by the initial review, of which approximately 110 were identified by the statute law revision unit to be in possible need of repeal as while they were still in force, they were not, on a preliminary view, of practical utility.</P>
      <P>The next step was to hold consultations with the public and Departments. An Internet-based public consultation process was undertaken which lasted several months while Departments were supplied with a list of Acts relevant to their respective areas of responsibility and asked for agreement with the preliminary view formed by the review unit on those Acts proposed for repeal. In many instances, multiple consultations with many officials and sections within Departments were required. It was also essential in various instances to consult subsidiary bodies and agencies with responsibility for or an interest in particular legislative provisions. It often transpired that Acts which no longer appeared to be of practical utility were, in fact, still in use. Officials were also invited to make suggestions on the modernisation of that legislation which remained in force. The result of the exercise was the list set out in the Schedule to the Bill of legislation which it is now proposed to repeal.</P>
      <P>Since the publication of the Bill on 25 November 2004, the Office of the Attorney General has continued its detailed research on legislation which could be repealed. To determine the exact status of each Act enacted prior to 1922, the office undertook a demanding exercise of re-examination of the comprehensive source <i>The Statutes of the Realm</i> which now comprises the annual volumes of United Kingdom legislation. This is a more comprehensive source than <i>The Statutes Revised</i> as it contains, for example, the texts of Acts which may have been repealed in the United Kingdom but remain in force in this jurisdiction. The revised edition did not include those Acts. As a result of the more detailed analysis, it is expected that a significant number of additional Acts will be included for repeal in the Bill. This will be effected if the House permits by the amendment of the Schedule on Committee Stage. A draft list of additional Acts will be published over the coming days on the website of the Office of the Attorney General. Senators will have more interestingly named Acts to consider than they do already.</P><Col N="1802"/>
      <P>A separate exercise would be needed to repeal legislation enacted after independence which remains in force but is no longer of practical utility. While there are no firm plans to undertake such an exercise, it would be a very useful continuation of the Bill&rsquo;s streamlining approach which could be undertaken if resources permit. Work could also be undertaken to review local, personal and private enactments, secondary legislation and charters or other instruments dating from before the establishment of the State which do not take the form of statutes but nonetheless have, or potentially have, statutory effect.</P>
      <P>The Bill before the House is short but effective. Section 1 provides for the repeal of pre-1922 legislation which consists of the public general statutes enumerated in the Schedule. Section 2 is a standard saving section and section 3 is the short title. As I indicated at the outset, the Bill should not be viewed in isolation. It is merely one step in an ongoing programme of reform of the Statute Book and the wider better regulation initiative.</P>
      <P>The Government plans to introduce a number of other measures including a project which has commenced within the Office of the Attorney General to devise a comprehensive database of all pre-1922 public general legislation. The database will provide a template for future revision and will be electronically accessible by the public. Projects to assess pre-1922 local, personal and private Acts and pre-1922 secondary legislation will be devised after the completion of the study of public and general statutes. It is envisaged that a programme of repeal of pre-1922 legislation and re-enactment in modern form where necessary will be commenced on a Department-by-Department basis.</P>
      <P>The repeal of the Acts identified in the Bill and of any additional Acts included for repeal on Committee Stage will create a more accessible, coherent and transparent Statute Book. The Bill falls squarely within the Government&rsquo;s agenda for better regulation which will bring benefits to society and the economy through lower legal and transaction costs while increasing the credibility of the legal system. The complete updating of the Statute Book is a significant task which will best be accomplished through a phased programme of measures. The Bill is an important first step and I commend its enactment to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. The last time I heard of Poynings Law was in history class in national school, which was several years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>1495.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Despite the fact that we spend most of our time debating Bills and Acts, it is rare that we get an opportunity to discuss legislation in a general sense. I very much welcome the Bill and the opportunity to discuss the state of our Statute Book and the ways in which it might be <Col N="1803"/>improved. Special mention must be made at the outset of Mr. Edward Donelan, the director of the statute law revision unit, who has brought the pre-1922 project to fruition against the odds. The Bill is a testament to his commitment not only to public service life, but to the improvement of the Statute Book.</P>
      <P>While the Bill which seeks to improve the Statute Book will not solve the problem of inaccessible legislation, it is undeniably a step in the right direction. It focuses on the period prior to 1922 and removes a significant amount of dead wood from the Statute Book. Sadly, its purpose ends there. The purpose of such legislation in England is to pave the way for the publication of a new edition of revised statutes. Just as textual amendments are neatly and precisely made to the mythological Statute Book in the hope that the changes effected will some day be incorporated in their intended locations, statute law revision Acts are passed to ensure that any newly-published series of statutes is more relevant and reflective of contemporary statute law. The central point is that the benefits of a Statute Law Revision Act can never be fully appreciated until a set of revised statutes is published. It is evident from the Statute Book that many Acts have been amended and many others have been repealed. The difficulty for users is that we have to piece together all of the different Acts on a given topic before we can know what is the law. The publication of revised statutes would fully address this matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister will tell me that statute law restatements are the answer to this problem, but that is not the case. Codification is not the answer either, or at least not at the rate at which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform produces it. In 2002 he promised to codify liquor licensing legislation and criminal law. Three years later, there is still no sign of either.</P>
      <P>The reality is that for the Government and successive Governments, improving the Statute Book takes a back seat to everything else. The Interpretation Bill is a case in point. It was published in 2000, yet five years later it still has not been enacted. This is a demonstration of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the Statute Book.</P>
      <P>Improving the Statute Book has never been a political aim as it does not garner votes for any party. The task of tidying up the Statute Book does not lend itself to immediately visible results and it is a tedious and expensive task. The level of finance expended on this task is not always fairly reflected in the amount of progress that is apparent. The high cost of rendering some order to the Statute Book can provide ammunition for those who are cynical about the merits and effect of such efforts.</P>
      <P>The pre-1922 statute law revision project which gave rise to this Bill could not have commenced without the support of the Attorney General and, possibly, the Taoiseach also, but it should not end there. A great deal more work must be done if <Col N="1804"/>real improvements are to be made to the Statute Book. I welcome this Bill, not as an end in itself but as a tool towards improving the Statute Book for the future. Go raibh maith agat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Government Chief Whip, Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Tom Kitt. When he was Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs he was regularly in the House but we have not seen him since his appointment to the Departments of the Taoiseach and Defence. It is nice to see him. He has come on a mission which is entirely practical and overdue.</P>
      <P>I remember when the concept of better regulation was launched. The Minister&rsquo;s speech was most practical, succinct and understandable and I commend whoever compiled it. One does not often get that. Many ministerial speeches come in weighty tomes without a beginning, middle or end. Today&rsquo;s speech was most concise and well put together.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State outlined, better regulation does not mean deregulation. In the course of the general election in the UK it has been proposed to wipe thousands of kilos of legislation off the British Statute Book and do away with this and that regulation. In many cases this does not in fact happen. It is not about deregulation but better regulation. This Bill marks an important step forward in that process.</P>
      <P>I am most interested in this issue in which I was involved from the start. We embarked on such a programme when I had ministerial responsibility for labour affairs, trying to consolidate various items of legislation which were out of date. When I read the Bill yesterday I was struck by the names of the Acts that are scheduled to be repealed and how instructive they could be in terms of a social and commercial history lesson. I was especially interested in the many Acts on minerals in Ireland, such as the State Minerals Act. I would not have considered that we were rich in minerals although Parnell did write on his mineral finds.</P>
      <P>The legislation from 1310 to 1800 was most interesting and led me to consider the people who enacted it. One can just imagine the clothes they wore as they rode to Parliament, and the mores they adopted and encapsulated in law. It is heartening in terms of continuity to know that legislation has been enacted for the betterment of people from the beginning, albeit that much of it is no longer relevant. I refer, in particular, to the Mining Leases Acts, the Spinners Act and the Burning of Bricks (Dublin) Act 1770. We talk about vandalism now and how it affects urban life. The Long Title of the Burning of Bricks (Dublin) Act 1770 was An Act to Prevent the Pernicious Practice of Burning Bricks Within the city of Dublin &mdash; they had alliteration then. Senator Norris will be interested in that law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1805"/>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Act stated that the inhabitants of the city were grievously annoyed and the lives of many &ldquo;weakly&rdquo; persons have been lost as a result of the large quantities of bricks being burnt. One would wonder where they got them or if they were lying around. Did bad builders leave material piled up on the pavement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>All will be explained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I was looking for the Pavements Act but I could not find it so we must be keeping that. It must be deemed necessary.</P>
      <P>The Pillory Abolition Act is being repealed. Pillory was a punishment where a person was locked in stocks with his or her head and hands sticking through holes, and turnips or whatever else people could spare were thrown at him or her. Perhaps it would be good to still have that practice. One could have a great time sticking one&rsquo;s enemies into the stocks and throwing whatever one wanted at them.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I also think of the people who drew up the legislation and their job in Parliament. Women did not have votes until much later. One must pay tribute to the legislators of those days for the way in which they wished to better the lives of people, as exemplified in the regulations relating to chimney sweeping. One had to be under the age of 21 to work as a chimney sweep. Various movements in Britain at the time attempted to outlaw some of these pernicious practices in which children were employed. An example of such legislation was the Children (Dangerous Performances) Act 1879. If one was under 14, one could not be in a public exhibition or performance where the life or limbs of a child could be endangered.</P>
      <P>I loved the Captive Birds Shooting (Prohibition) Act which prevented one from releasing captive birds for shooting. We often think of royalty and members of the aristocracy out shooting. Perhaps they do not shoot captive birds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>They still do it in County Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>All of those Acts are most interesting. Some of the titles which appealed to me were enacted during the so-called Act of Union. The National School Teachers Residences (Ireland) (Amendment) Act 1884 is interesting. Some schools in rural Ireland still have residences attached, where the principals have adjoining living quarters. In some instances they are physically joined to the schools, while in others they are detached. Just imagine that such a small matter as building a residence for a school principal had to become an Act. There must have been an earlier Act, because it is an amendment that I am reading about here. In an historical sense this is very interesting. All of the 19th century was interesting since many of the great figures such as Daniel O&rsquo;Connell and Parnell had to soldier over <Col N="1806"/>and back across the Irish Sea to make their way to Parliament at Westminster and pass laws.</P>
      <P>There was the Employment of Children Act 1903 and the Street Betting Act 1906. Then there was the Tuberculosis Prevention (Ireland) Act 1906. Perhaps Senator Mansergh can tell me whether that was the time when Gladstone&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it was Asquith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;when Asquith was endeavouring to improve the lot of the people. Earlier, there was the whole period of killing Home Rule by kindness, with the Irish being bombarded with wonderful legislation on harbours, etc., when they were to become compliant and very demure, not harbouring seditious thoughts against the British Government. They were expected to be so pleased over what was being done for them, but of course they were not and did not lie down.</P>
      <P>The Post Office (Sites) Act 1885 was about getting sites for post offices all over the country, many of which are still there, I am quite sure. Then there was the Wicklow Harbour Advances Act 1897. Many harbour laws were introduced in that period for the betterment or the building of new harbours and piers. This was also part of the killing Home Rule by kindness strategy as were various Acts brought in at the time.</P>
      <P>There were two interesting Acts passed in 1909, the Labour Exchanges Act and the Irish Handloom Weavers Act. Then there was the Local Authorities (Ireland) (Qualification of Women) Act 1911. I do not know whether that was about the vote for women or women going forward for election. It may have had to do with the poor law guardians legislation. There are so many Acts which trace the progress of history and that is really interesting.</P>
      <P>The Charitable Pawn Offices (Ireland) Act 1842 would have been passed in Daniel O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s time. I wonder what he said about it. One would love to follow all of that up to see what the various pieces of legislation provided for. There was the Mining Leases (Ireland) Act 1848, the Bridges (Ireland) Act 1850 and the Betting Act 1853. Then there was an Act about the adulteration of tea and later one about the adulteration of coffee. I do not know whether one is meant to feel guilty about drinking those beverages. The Adulteration of Coffee Act 1718 set out that even &ldquo;disposed persons have, after the roasting of coffee, made use of water, grease, butter, whereby the coffee is rendered unwholesome and greatly increased in weight to the prejudice of the health of subjects&rdquo;. A considerable penalty of £20 applied. I am very interested in that because this would have been an enormous fine in that period. I do not know what the present-day equivalent is, but it is a great amount of money &mdash; for adding substances to coffee or tea. It does not specify that whiskey could not be added or a drop of brandy, which might greatly improve the coffee or the tea.</P>
      <P>There is an honesty Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1807"/>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That is going too far in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry, that should be Hosiery Act, specifying I suppose, what type of hosiery one could or could not wear. There was a wide variety of legislation on piers, harbours, tolls, etc. The general thinking was that Ireland would be a better place with all those Acts in place, but it was part of the whole strategy to kill Home Rule with kindness. The Irish were to be quiet and demure and accept the <i>status quo</i> because great things were being done on their behalf. There was the National Health Insurance Act and the National Health Insurance (Prolongation of Insurance) Act, both passed in 1921, and the Treaties of Washington Act 1922. This is a minefield of wonderful adventure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader has two minutes left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Two minutes out of 15 minutes &mdash; I could go on for ages. This is a minefield of social and commercial history. When we reflect on all that happened in Ireland since 1300, we think of Poynings Law, the Statutes of Kilkenny, Cromwell and his Roundheads, the Famine period, the commercial activity and the people who made laws. Even then legislators were imbued with a sense of the common good, as reflected in the laws that were passed to deal with what needed to be corrected within the community.</P>
      <P>It is an amazing corpus of legislation because of what it evokes in the historical memory. The Government is right to appeal those Acts and I am quite sure the Attorney General has paid great attention to what might still be relevant in the old legislation. I hope he has because there might be pieces of legislation that are still relevant and we would not be any better off by repealing them. He is very thorough, however, so I am quite sure he has spent much time in deciding whether legislation should be replaced or incorporated into a new Bill for enactment.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State. He is sponsoring an efficient, historic and interesting Bill. I am pleased that he is here and that I have had the opportunity to use more than my allotted 15 minutes in responding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the House&rsquo;s indulgence in requesting that I share time with my colleague, Senator Quinn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Leader in rising so magnificently to the challenge posed on this side of the House when it was suggested &mdash; with an impertinence I find breathtaking &mdash; that she might not find the resources to fill the 15 minutes. As she pointed out, rubbing it in beautifully in her final comments, she took some extra time and could have gone on forever, as she said. Let this not be a surprise. I regard this afternoon, where <Col N="1808"/>I am making only a short contribution, as one of the treats of legislative life. We followed the delightful antiquarianism that so seduced the Leader down the byways, with increasing interest, as she painted such an historic picture.</P>
      <P>In many of these pieces of legislation we do in fact enter historic periods. We enter, with the Chanceries Act into the world of Dickens, &ldquo;Jarndyce and Jarndyce&rdquo; and the endless peregrinations of the law. I am very glad that tribute was paid to Mr. Edward Donelan from this side of the House. I did not know he was the person involved. He was a student of mine in Trinity for a period and he managed not to be too damaged by that experience. I have spoken to him unofficially about various legal matters and always found him to be the soul of courtesy and scholarship. I am very glad that tribute was paid to him here today.</P>
      <P>The principle involved in this legislation is the one enunciated by an interior decorator in the 1920s, namely, &ldquo;less is more&rdquo;. The less the legislation the more effective it can be. I am glad to see this happening. It makes matters more accessible and user-friendly. It is more logical. Perhaps we could have achieved more by taking the direction the French took under Napoleon, namely, codifying the whole law. That would have been helpful, but it is an enormous undertaking. Nonetheless, I hope this State will embark upon it at some stage.</P>
      <P>I will follow on the coat tails of my distinguished Leader, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, in just looking at a couple of these intriguing and delightful titles. It is like a core sample going down through the earth where all types of strata are picked up. The Bill is a general broad sweep moving from legislation brought in under Poynings Law, that was restrictive of the Irish, to the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919. It moves from a period of oppression to a moment of the liberation of suppressed classes in society.</P>
      <P>Within my lifetime, I was intrigued that the utterance of the phrase &ldquo;Crom ab&uacute;&rdquo;, the war cry of the Ormonde Butlers, was a capital offence. They were the traditional enemies of my Gaelic Irish family on my mother&rsquo;s side. Has that law been excised or have I, in the precincts of Parliament, committed a capital offence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>We will pillory Senator Norris. We will put him in the stocks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been pilloried before only in the metaphysical sense, never in the physical sense. There is just a chance I might enjoy the attentions of those armed with vegetables. It might be a particularly recondite and spicy pleasure.</P>
      <P>The Burning of Bricks (Dublin) Act 1770 was not introduced to prevent citizens pulling bricks out of buildings and setting them on fire. Without being arrogant, I believe this concerned the <Col N="1809"/>manufacture of bricks. During the Dublin building boom of Luke Gardiner, there was a huge demand for bricks and several unlicensed brick yards were set up. All over Dublin there were brick fields, many of which still exist in name. The noxious vapours caused in the industrial process of manufacturing bricks were the subject of this legislation.</P>
      <P>I admit I am not sure what the Statute of Winchester refers to but it sounds lovely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I will explain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That will be a treat.</P>
      <P>The Leader took some of the other plum titles in her speech such as the Adulteration of Coffee and Tea Acts. However, it must be remembered tea was an expensive commodity. I have an 18th century porcelain tea caddy, passed to me by my great-grandmother. Tea was kept in it under lock and key and doled out in small amounts because it was so expensive. That explains why the adulteration of tea and coffee was a serious offence. Does it not take us back to the time of Addison and Steele and the London and Dublin tea and coffee houses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>There was also the Boston Tea Party two years before the Act was introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>How interesting. The Chimney Sweepers and Chimneys Regulation Act 1840 sounds charming, recalling the song &ldquo;Chim Chimney, Chim Chimney, Chim Chim Cheree&rdquo;. However, the activity was unspeakable with small children forced up chimneys to dislodge the soot with their bodies. They were so thin and developed the most grotesque cancers from exposure to the hot soot. Despite, the fun one can have with its antiquarian aspect, this was a shocking and disgusting period when people were brutally exploited.</P>
      <P>The Adulteration of Seeds Act is still appropriate as we deal with Monsanto and genetically modified food. People are again worried about what is happening with seeds. The Street Betting Act reminds me of the Dublin phenomenon, now gone because we have become so prosperous, when corner boys, small gangs of out-of-work stevedores and navvies played pitch and toss for money. The minute a garda appeared they disappeared. This practice has ended in my lifetime.</P>
      <P>While the Tuberculosis Prevention (Ireland) Act 1908 was introduced by a particular political administration in London, the motivation came from Ishbel, the Countess of Aberdeen and wife of the viceroy. She was a do-gooder and busybody but a remarkable woman who has not been sufficiently recognised for her efforts. I have letters from her, although not directly addressed to me, dating from when she established booths in <Col N="1810"/>the Phoenix Park where the citizens of Dublin were treated to free orange juice and cocoa. She was a tremendous campaigner against TB before the efforts of the wonderful Noel Browne knocked it on the head. She was gallant, good and decent and deserves that little bit of credit for her efforts. In light of the terrible beauty that was about to be born, she seems to be irrelevant.</P>
      <P>Tuberculosis was a terrible scourge then which, unfortunately, may well be on its way back. We need more legislation in this area partly because of the development of drug resistant strains of TB and partly because of sophisticated AIDS infections. Other factors contributing to this include demographic changes and the relaxation of our own habits. One now sees many people spitting on the street, many of whom are new arrivals as well as our own people spitting chewing gum. When I was young, there was a real campaign against spitting because of TB. I believe we must revisit this area.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Tom Kitt, and his officials. Senator Norris took us back to his favourite period, Edwardian Dublin. Dr. James Deeney also deserves credit for the eradication of TB, which he wrote about in his memoirs.</P>
      <P>The Bill has a practical purpose, a clearing out of the attic. However, that type of exercise is carried out sporadically with some zeal and then left for long intervening periods. Senator Norris is correct that the Code Napoleon is a model for all legislators. However, Napoleon was assisted by the French Revolution that had reduced the customs of the <i>ancien r&eacute;gime</i> to rubble, allowing him and his legal collaborators to build from scratch. Previous speakers are correct in that the Acts addressed by this legislation are part of our social and political history. The term &ldquo;late lamented&rdquo; is used when referring to somebody who has died. I note the Minister does not say the Acts of the late lamented United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.</P>
      <P>I was fascinated by the earliest of these Acts, not realising we still live under 13th century legislation. By its very name, the Statute of Winchester sounds like an important enactment. However, I looked up one of my books on medieval Ireland to assess the general political context. According to that book, inefficiency was now made worse by official corruption and there was little anyone could do about it. In 1284 it was said that all the clergy, the people and the common rumour of the country demanded an investigation into the condition of the lordship, and the king was forced to act. A commission of four was established with wide terms of reference. It appears the tribunal culture dates back several centuries.</P>
      <P>A Franciscan friar, Michael of Limerick, wrote that one special blessing of Ireland was the absence of poisonous animals. However, he said that the poison which God denied to the spider <Col N="1811"/>or the land He allowed to rule in human nature. As an instance of this, he cited the ministers and bailiffs of the king. That is the political context for the Statute of Winchester.</P>
      <P>This statute was important legislation. The period concerned covered the reign of the three Edwards, a time marked by unparalleled violence, crime and continual wars. Edward I, the &ldquo;Hammer of the Scots&rdquo;, built large castles throughout Wales so that when a map was published at the beginning of the 17th century, Wales was marked as part of England. He did not get to grips with Ireland to the same extent.</P>
      <P>The Statute of Winchester was dedicated to the growing crime problem. It directed sheriffs to take up hue and cry against this scourge and to keep arms and horses ready for the purpose. It is considered the foundation Act of the watch system in the towns. The night watchman could, if necessary, detain strangers until the following morning.</P>
      <P>Only one section of this statute, I believe it is section 6, is extant. It provides that neither fairs nor markets be held in churchyards for the honour of the church. I have no wish to raise fears but I hope that by repealing this legislation, we will not now encourage fairs or markets to be held in church yards.</P>

	<P>My attention was particularly caught by the Burning of Bricks (Dublin) Act 1770. It is a wonderful description. I am tempted to use it in my column next week in <i>The Irish Times</i> as evocative of an activity that is both damaging and unproductive. One wonders if the Adulteration of Tea Act 1776 has anything to do with the Boston Tea Party. I also note the Tolls (Ireland) Act 1817.</P>

      <P>While the rationale for this Bill is obvious, many of us might have a little of Edmund Burke lurking inside as we wonder if we are doing away with curious pieces of history and whether it is sometimes better to let these things accumulate like layers of silt.

	<P>I welcome this Bill. The Labour Party has long advocated that we update the Statute Book. It is unsatisfactory that this independent republic still relies on laws passed by, for example, Henry VIII. The Labour Party favours the establishment of a Statute Book in which all the pre-1922 legislation is repealed. This Bill is a good start.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated that more Acts might be added to the Schedule on Committee Stage. While we are generally critical of additions being made to legislation on that Stage, we would welcome the addition of Acts to the Schedule of this Bill. The Minister should not be restricted in amending the Bill in detail in that regard. We encourage him to do so. It could also be done on Report Stage or even in the D&aacute;il. It is important that we take this opportunity to remove as much dead wood as possible.</P>
      <P>The Government should go beyond this Bill and undertake comprehensive statute law revision. The next step must be to repeal all pre-1922 statutes except those currently in use. There should be a comprehensive programme of repeal and re-enactment in a modern form. The Minister should also examine the local, personal and private Acts, the body of pre-1922 statutory instruments and post-1922 legislation with a view to conducting a complete review of the Statute Book. The Labour Party favours a Scandinavian type code of law where all positive law is codified into a single volume, or volumes, which is updated on an annual basis. I suspect that a number of volumes would be required but we should aim for that ultimate goal.</P>
      <P>I have a question about section 2(2). It states: &ldquo;Where any enactment not repealed by this Act has been confirmed, revived or perpetuated by a <Col N="1813"/>repealed enactment, such confirmation, reviver or perpetuation by this Act is not affected by the repeal.&rdquo; Should this not state &ldquo;such confirmation, reviver or perpetuation by the repealed enactment&rdquo;? Perhaps this legislation effects the confirmation, reviver or perpetuation but I am not sure. Is that the correct way to phrase the provision?</P>
      <P>The Labour Party supports the Bill and I acknowledge the work of the Minister, his staff and the Attorney General on its preparation. We hope that work will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>This is my first opportunity to wish the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, well in his new role. I listened carefully to the debate, particularly the contribution of Senator Norris. The Senator has such a knowledge of background information and I respect his knowledge and training. I never heard of the term &ldquo;Crom ab&uacute;&rdquo; and I would like to speak with him about that at a later stage.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for giving us a thorough explanation of the background to this Bill, as well as its contents. The process of revision of pre-Independence legislation will give clarity and certainty on the state of the law today. This Bill is an important part of that process. The principle underpinning the Bill is important as it is a democratic principle of a modern constitutional system. The principle is that our laws should be enacted by the representatives of the people. Some of these laws were enacted by entirely foreign parliaments. The parliament in Great Britain passed the laws which are set out in parts two and three of the Schedule to this Bill. Many of the laws which we are now repealing, listed in part four, were passed by the United Kingdom Parliament after the Act of Union. This was a parliament which had some Irish MPs, but which was certainly not representative of the Irish people and did not enjoy the support of the majority of people of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Many of the Acts being repealed in this Bill were passed by parliaments from which Catholics were excluded. Nearly all of these Acts were passed by parliaments in which women were forbidden to sit. These are not statutes which enjoy any great democratic credentials. There is also a fundamental problem with our modern State maintaining so many laws on the Statute Book that were not signed by our elected President, but which were assented to by a foreign monarch. These are laws from an imperial era which have no place in a modern republic. Of course, it is not possible to rewrite the entire Statute Book overnight. There were very good reasons to maintain pre-existing statutes in the early days of the State, until modern laws could replace them. In the last eight decades, a great number of pre-1922 statutes have been repealed. This has not only occurred in the major revision Acts of 1962 and 1983, but also in some of the very important pieces of consolidating legislation which have been enacted in the Oireachtas.</P><Col N="1814"/>
      <P>We have finally reached a stage where we can look forward to the complete modernisation of our Statute Book. This Bill is only part of that modernisation process. It repeals laws which no longer have any use or effect, but there are still many laws on our Statute Book enacted before Independence which still have an effect. These must also be modernised. I am glad the Taoiseach has made it a priority of his to carry on this project. Many people are working on this project, such as the experts in the Law Reform Commission who are preparing a Bill to modernise our land law system. It is appalling to think that laws relating to contracts for the sale of land date back to penal times. Our land ownership statutes were passed in the 19th century, during the heyday of the landlord class. These laws were modernised in Britain many decades ago, but they still remain in force in Ireland. It is surely time that these be replaced with modern laws. I thank those experts who are working hard to achieve that goal.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for giving us such a comprehensive explanation of this Bill. I hope that the momentum will be maintained and that in a short number of years, Members will be able to state they have swept away the last remnants of the empire.</P>

	<P>What an interesting debate this has been. I welcome the Minister and his officials here today. I particularly welcome the words he used which were repeated by Senator Ormonde. I was impressed by the Minister&rsquo;s reference to the regulatory impact analysis that is to take place, following the publication of a report on this topic last year. What will happen in 100 years time when people look back on the Bills being passed now? The Leader&rsquo;s entertaining examination of the various Bills was such that I would like to touch on some of them. The Assay of Imported Watch Cases (Existing Stocks Exemption) Act 1907 was passed less than 100 years ago. Other Acts include the Hosiery Act 1845, the Adulteration of Coffee Act 1718 and the Burning of Bricks (Dublin) Act 1770, about which Senator Norris spoke. It is not that long since the Oireachtas passed legislation on dog muzzling. I have been told that in the 1950s, there was a proposal that neon lights were likely to make one bald and that legislation should be passed banning it. Of course, that did not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Would that happen to both men and women?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>We occasionally make the mistake of rushing legislation through these Houses. The point was made that less law is sometimes better <Col N="1815"/>law. We do not automatically believe that because we pass legislation we are doing good.</P>
      <P>I have no problem with the 90 Acts that are being repealed, but it does raise a question. How many pre-1922 statutes will remain in force after this measure takes effect? I ask that question because, ideally, the answer should be none at all. However, I know that is not the answer I will get to the question. I take the view that 83 years after independence, the only laws to which we should be subject are our own laws and those of the EU. Quite frankly, I feel that way due to nationalistic reasons. I am uneasy about British laws still being in force in this supposedly independent State. Nonetheless, from a more practical point of view, there are two reasons we should not be governed by any pre-1922 laws at all. First, we are living in the 21st century and it is unlikely that any laws passed in the 19th century will still be fully appropriate to our needs today. Second, any law passed since 1922 is readily accessible on our Statute Book, even more so in recent years because that book is now available on CD-ROM and on the Internet. The same is not true of laws passed before 1922. Indeed, they can be very hard to find, especially for the lay person. That is not a good situation, as I believe fundamentally that our laws should be readily accessible to every citizen.</P>
      <P>While welcoming this Bill, I have to make the observation that the cleaning up of our Statute Book seems to have a very low priority with the Government. The Oireachtas is still processing the Interpretation Bill, which was published in 2000. It seems to have disappeared into a limbo between Second Stage and Committee Stage. What is the reason for this delay? It is not as if we were overburdened with work in this House. Another way to clean up the Statute Book is to consolidate Bills more often. I have spoken before of the difficulties we create for citizens by passing laws in a piecemeal manner, by amending previous Bills that amended previous Bills and so on back in a chain that sometimes seems to go on for ever. This approach reduces greatly the accessibility of our legislation, which is a bad thing.</P>
      <P>There are two obvious candidates for consolidating legislation. One is the case where there has been an extensive reform of the law on a particular subject, but for one reason or another that reform has been split up into separate Acts. I believe that when the reform is concluded, we should go back and consolidate all the individual Acts into a single piece of legislation that people can access easily whenever they want to find out what the law is on that subject. A prime example of that is to be found in the area of family law where, for practical and perhaps even tactical reasons, we tackled reform in dribs and drabs. In this instance, legislation is spread over a large number of separate Acts. We should consolidate them into one Act.</P><Col N="1816"/>
      <P>Another example of where consolidation is needed is where the law on a subject is continually evolving with frequent new Acts that amend the principal Act. We already have the practice, of which I fully approve, of consolidating our tax laws, which I understand happens every ten years. We should extend that practice, however, to the field of company law.</P>
      <P>On the question of company law, the Minister has referred to last year&rsquo;s document on better regulation. Company law has changed almost as often as the tax laws. Tomorrow we will be taking Second Stage of the Investment Funds, Companies and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2005, which is the latest amendment to company legislation that was passed by the Oireachtas last year. The need to make company law more accessible is strengthened by the fact that it now impinges on a wide range of businesses which are crucial to our future economic success. Compliance with company law is a big issue for most businesses and it starts with an added cost if legislative measures are spread all over the place, as they are now. Like family law, company law should be accessible in one place so that a person can find out about all the relevant law on a particular subject.</P>
      <P>Every time I mention consolidating Acts, I am told that this will no longer be necessary since we have the restatement facility in place, but do we? I remind Members who may understandably have forgotten, that restatement is the process of publishing an unofficial consolidation of Acts, which can be used in the courts without the process of passing through the Oireachtas. It is a good idea, which we all applauded at the time. The Statute Law Restatement Bill was published in 2000 and was finally enacted on Christmas Eve 2002 but that was the last we heard of it. Nobody expected that such legislation would appear overnight but none of the restated laws has seen the light of day in the past two and a half years. That is not good enough. It underlines my earlier point, that cleaning up the Statute Book seems to be a very low priority for the Government. While welcoming this Bill, I regret that is the case and therefore urge the Government to pull up its socks on this matter. I would like to see a little more action in this area.</P>
      <P>However, I am pleased to see the Bill before the House, including the measures it envisages. It was good to have our eyes opened by the history lesson from other speakers, particularly the Leader of the House.</P>

	<P>Many matters have arisen as a result of this debate but if I do not get a chance to reply to all of them, I will do so on Committee Stage. I thank everybody who contributed to the debate, which afforded us an opportunity to consider the historic nature of the work we are doing. It has been a fulfilling hour <Col N="1817"/>because Senators, including the Leader, have referred to old Acts which conjured up Dickensian images of how life was in earlier times. I enjoyed sharing that journey with Members of the House. While it is interesting and even entertaining to consider such historical aspects, the other side of the coin shows how harrowing life was for many citizens in those times. The 1840 Act regulating chimney-sweeps, for example, penalised a person who allowed a child or young person under the age of 21 to work as a chimney-sweep. Other speakers referred to the Children (Dangerous Performances) Act 1879.</P>

	<P>Circuses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>That legislation conjures up the circus coming to a village. The purpose of the Act was to regulate the employment of children in places of public amusement. It outlawed &ldquo;the use of children under 14 in public exhibitions or performances where the life or limb of such a child shall be endangered&rdquo;. The debate has been beneficial in outlining how far we have come. As Senator Quinn said, we can also imagine that in decades to come other politicians will look back on our legislative period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope they will be as kind as we are today about previous periods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope they will not be laughing at us. They may be entertained but I am sure they will realise, too, that we were doing our best. The bottom line is that old legislation is being replaced by modern health and safety legislation. The Leader and I had the privilege of serving in the then Department of Labour which dealt with legislation covering many such issues. Some animal welfare legislation has also been updated, so much progress has been made.</P>
      <P>The Leader referred to the useful research that has been undertaken in this regard, for example, by students who have taken an interest in this area. As I said in my opening remarks, a website was used during the consultation process concerning this legislation &mdash; not just within Departments but also involving the public. I am interested in pursuing this aspect with regard to our own <i>modus operandi</i> for modern legislation. I am sure Senators will agree that it is useful to engage the public in some way. I have made an initial decision, subject to the co-operation of the other Whips, that as soon as possible, we will consult with members of the public regarding a pilot Bill via Internet websites &mdash; a modern means of communication &mdash; to get their input on legislation, perhaps on Committee Stage. In that way, members of a select committee would have an opportunity to hear the views of the public. In particular, I would like to engage with students on the right type of legislation but we will return to that issue on another occasion.</P>
      <P>As regards the Bill before the House, it would be useful to share these great stories of the past <Col N="1818"/>with members of the public and hear what they have to say. I will ask my officials to see if they can provide a summary of the relevant legislation, which would show the tremendous research that has been undertaken. I thank my officials for the research work they have done in preparing this legislation.</P>
      <P>I wish to share with the House as much as possible the information that is available. I will briefly go through some of the points that were raised during the debate. Senator Cummins referred to revised statutes but unfortunately we do not publish or prepare such material. Consolidation, restatement and the annual chronological tables are the current tools. The statue law revision unit is aware of this position, as is the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Rourke spoke about the relevance of each Act. The Attorney General examined each statute in full and in case of any doubt they have not been repealed but will be re-examined at the next stage of the programme. Much work remains to be done and we will keep moving on that. Some Acts have been replaced by post-1922 legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>More modern legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>Therefore, although we removed some Acts, we may have current equivalent modern legislation instead. For example, we repealed the old statutes on tuberculosis and food safety, which have been replaced by modern legislation.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris referred to re-codificiation. The current programme covers various areas, such as customs, liquor licensing and employment rights within Departments. Work is already under way to consolidate and reform such legislation. Senator Norris and Senator Mansergh also referred to the Statute of Winchester which deals with fairs and markets in church yards. I will endeavour to obtain as much information as I can on other items of legislation.</P>
      <P>Senator Tuffy referred in particular to section 2(2) and I am aware of her expertise in this respect. I will examine the point she has raised to see if there are any deficiencies and will revert to the matter on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn asked about the number of pre-1922 statutes. We are counting them at present. There is a very large number of them. I will try to get precise figures. If we can, we will compile a full and exact list in the Office of the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>Statute law restatement is different from revision. It does not repeal old Acts but is a faster administrative consolidation which helps the user of legislation but does not use up valuable Oireachtas time and resources. The Statute Law Restatement Act 2002 enables the Attorney General to make available up-to-date versions of Acts of the Oireachtas in a readable form. These versions, known as restatements, do not alter the substance of the law in any way but present the text of a particular Act as it has been amended <Col N="1819"/>since enactment. Accordingly, they are not reforming or revision Acts but simply represent the updated versions of existing Acts.</P>
      <P>The policy and procedure of restatement also fall within the Government agenda on regulatory reform, with the objective of making legislation more user-friendly and accessible. Further information on the policy and process is set out on the website of the Office of the Attorney General. Four restatements have already been certified: the Sale of Goods Act, the Defence Act, the Succession Act and the Tourist Traffic Act. They are available on the website.</P>
      <P>Like Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, I have much experience of consolidation work in that Department and I agree with the comments she has made on consolidation and the need for much more work in this area. This has been a useful exercise and an interesting debate, where we have cast our minds back and have rightly discussed the historic nature of some of the old legislation. As Senator Quinn said, this is a reminder to update our legislation, to make it user-friendly, to consolidate and reform. This is all part of a broad regulatory agenda pursued by the Government and by the Taoiseach in a determined manner. I thank Senators for their contributions.</P>

      <P>I know that after that eulogy the Minister will say, &ldquo;We are not there yet.&rdquo; She is right. I commend her for the fact that in the few months since she took over as Minister she has shown from the outset that she is enthusiastic about and acknowledges the challenges ahead, just as she compliments the achievements made and the success and progress reached over the past six or seven years.</P>
      <P>This debate is appropriate because the Minister is new to the Department of Education and Science, though no stranger to the subject. The debate is timely because in those few months the Minister has brought many new initiatives to bear on the two vital and challenging areas of educational disadvantage and special educational needs. These have been vital and vexed questions for many decades for successive Governments. I regret that while it has been the laudable aspiration of Governments, Ministers, educationalists and teachers over those years that we provide equality of educational opportunity for all our children. However, because of lack of resources and expertise this has often only been an aspiration, and delivery, unfortunately and regrettably in many cases, is better not dwelt on.</P>
      <P>The Minister has already focused attention on these two areas. She has set initiatives in train and has announced the launch of an action plan on educational disadvantage. We look forward to the detail of that plan and, if possible, I will comment on it this evening.</P>
      <P>I wish to comment on the achievements made to date in these two challenging areas. Since 1997 there has been a transformation in the delivery of service and resources. More fundamentally, there has been a transformation in the delivery of legislation to bring rights, enablement and empowerment to children with special educational needs, their parents and representative groups. In that context it is appropriate to compliment the parents who through the years espoused the rights of their children through thick and thin and gained the support of their representative groups.</P>
      <P>Before I go into the details, I compliment my colleague, the Leader of the House, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke. I had the privilege a few years to act as her backup in the D&aacute;il and I recall she strongly pushed the idea of a national council for special education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>It was Senator Fitzgerald who came up with that idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge that the notion was there at an embryonic stage at that time. Unfortunately, due to a lack of resources it did not come to fruition. That was not in any respect because of lack of goodwill, commitment or determination on Senator O&rsquo;Rourke&rsquo;s part.</P><Col N="1822"/>
      <P>Moving forward to 1997, the Government of the day decided to bring the questions of educational disadvantage and a special educational needs service to the centre of the educational service. This was an acknowledgment of the vital importance of addressing these issues and was in the interests of children. It began with a decision to give all primary school children an automatic right and entitlement to a response to their needs. In recent months the Minister has acknowledged that this is not always possible, even today. I respect that acknowledgment and the fact that she is there to pick up this challenge which is at the heart of this debate.</P>
      <P>The decision to give this automatic entitlement to a response to all children was followed by a programme of funding and legislation. These have radically and significantly enhanced the level and quality of the service to children with special needs and the area of educational disadvantage. It is appropriate to compliment our primary and second level teachers who, despite the acute lack of resources over the years, fought tooth and nail for the rights of these children. Today these teachers still enthusiastically embrace the new challenges facing them in the context of the three Bills brought forward in this area. Credit is due to teachers at primary and post-primary levels for their great sense of professionalism, duty, concern and care for the most vulnerable children in society. They have acted in the most professional manner at all times in responding to their needs, with a few rare exceptions.</P>
      <P>I refer to the achievements in the allocation of resources since 1997. The number of resource teachers in ordinary schools has increased from 104 to 2,600 while learning support services have been extended to every primary and post-primary school creating 1,500 teaching posts and the number of special needs assistant has increased from 300 to 5,500. Overall, 4,000 additional teachers have been recruited at primary level and more than 2,000 at post-primary level. The additional teachers have been deployed to reduce class sizes, target disadvantage and give additional support to children with special educational needs. More than 1,000 teachers are employed in special schools with in excess of 600 teachers taking special classes in ordinary schools. More than &euro;30 million is expended on transport for children with special education needs. Many other initiatives are in place, on which the Minister is building, based on the value and merit of each initiative, which I respect very much.</P>
      <P>Since 1997 three important Bills have been enacted, namely, the Equal Status Act 2000, the Education Act 1998 and, more recently, the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004. These have progressively established the rights of all children with such needs in law. The latter Act provides the framework and structures to secure the necessary rights and resources. It provides a guarantee in law because it formally establishes the National Council for <Col N="1823"/>Special Education and it places a legal onus on the Departments of Education and Science, Health and Children and Finance to ensure adequate resources are allocated and the support provided for special educational needs children is comparable to that for children without such needs. This aspect of the Act is important because it boosts the power of parents and representative groups to seek a judicial review where they deem comparability is not achieved.</P>
      <P>I refer to a number of important initiatives taken by the Minister since she took up office, which seek to build on the progress to date and to evaluate and review structures, resources or decisions with the intention of progressing the roll-out of services to the disadvantaged and those with special educational needs. I commend the Minister on the action plan for the disadvantaged and I look forward to her detailing its content. It has major benefits, which we will discuss in greater detail at a later date.</P>
      <P>I refer to her decision to appoint administrative principals to small schools in disadvantaged areas. This has been an ongoing issue, particularly in the context of the extra resources that have been rolled out in recent years. Teaching principals could not cope with the administrative duties being thrust upon them but disadvantaged schools have been targeted for the appointment of administrative principals. This will increase the time available to teaching principals for planning, targeting resources and increased monitoring of the outcomes of the utilisation of resources. That is wise, commendable and laudable.</P>
      <P>I have a great interest in the school completion programme in my area and the results are positive. Whatever plans the Minister has for this programme, education welfare boards and the home-school community liaison scheme, I compliment her for extending the programme for another year and I hope it will retain a significant role. It is working well and it will have a greater role to play in the overall scheme. I trust her wisdom in this regard. The elimination of unqualified teachers on a long-term basis is also commendable.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister well and I commend her on her work and, in particular, on the partnership approach she has adopted to education. The wonderful reception she received at the recent teacher conferences demonstrated that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the motion.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. She has taken to this portfolio with ease because of her extensive experience in the field and it is important that we should acknowledge that. While the motion concentrates on special needs, it is important to reflect on how important the education sector has been to the Government. The Government has recognised funds must be put in place to ensure education is given the resources it needs so that young people can develop and learn at a consistently high level. For example, in 1997 when Fine <Col N="1824"/>Gael and Labour were in power, education funding was &euro;2.9 billion. That has increased dramatically to approximately &euro;7 billion this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Therefore, it was greater in 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>That represents an increase of 9% on last year&rsquo;s allocation. Education will receive 16.8% of current Government expenditure this year while 8.8% of total capital expenditure will be allocated to schools and other educational facilities. If, during the debate, Opposition Members pursue the predictable tactic of knocking the Government for not doing enough, they should reflect on how much the Government is spending in this area.</P>
      <P>A significant percentage of the extra funding for education announced by the Government in this year&rsquo;s budget is earmarked for special needs education. A sum of &euro;628 million will be spent on the provision of special educational services, an increase of &euro;67 million on last year. This will pay for the recruitment of 700 additional special needs assistants, which was provided for in the Estimates and which will bring the total number of assistants to almost 6,000. The number of resource teachers has increased from 104 in 1998 to 2,600 this year while 1,500 learning support teachers are in place. In addition, 1,000 teachers are working in special schools.</P>
      <P>As well as providing the funding for these posts, the Government has implemented important legislation, particularly the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004. The purpose of the Act is to provide education for children with special educational needs, to guarantee as a right the education of children with disabilities and to ensure that right is protected by law. That is a significant commitment. It also takes into account the role of parents and the support mechanisms that will be implemented to ensure the best educational standards for their children. Another objective of the legislation is to provide equity in education services between children with disabilities and those without special needs. It also makes provision for the education of a citizen who may be over 18 but intellectually at the level of a child, an important distinction.</P>
      <P>The other important matter, on which I do a great deal of thinking, is integrated education. How it is to work is a very serious question. It has not worked very well hitherto and I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s views on the issue. I am all for it if we can provide the classroom resources. I also feel it is very important that we designate a centre or school since we know that in the past, educational establishments did not accept their responsibilities and simply passed the buck to another school. The resources will be made available for the education of children with special educational needs and it is very important that we support that. I know the Minister has made commitments in that regard.</P><Col N="1825"/>
      <P>The establishment of the National Council for Special Education came into effect in January, and I believe more time is needed for the organisers who will be appointed to liaise with the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Education and Science regarding assessment and monitoring the educational needs of children with disabilities; I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s views on that. This is to be welcomed as it puts in place a big structure of supports for parents, as well as monitoring and assessment. That is a very important area of the Act.</P>
      <P>Another absolutely necessary area concerns the special transport arrangements introduced. That measure also dealt with the challenges of special needs education. There is a question regarding how that will work when it comes to escorts being available for children attending school. I welcome the fact that a budget of &euro;30 million has been allocated by the Government for that purpose. That is a very large area and monitoring it will be very important. The Minister has already made a statement on small class sizes, which is welcome. The special classes for children with autism took a long time to get off the ground and I know that the Minister is in favour of them.</P>
      <P>I may have to deviate a little and talk about the role of the guidance counsellors. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to a complementary role for guidance counsellors who will assist in the holistic aspect of education by facilitating young people to reach their maximum potential. I know that 80 such counsellors have been introduced already and the Minister has 100 more in the pipeline. The Institute of Guidance Counsellors is delighted with the Minister for her commitment in that regard. We must also ensure that those extra guidance counsellors go into the junior cycle and I understand the Minister is thinking in those terms. It is very important to target children at this stage. That is where the problems exist; a great many children from dysfunctional backgrounds need counselling and guidance in their first, second and third years. We need more group work with young people at that level as one-to-one assistance may not be possible. I welcome the increase in the numbers and look forward to hearing more in the area.</P>
      <P>The Government&rsquo;s work on special education can be seen throughout the country. There are approximately 407 schools with special education classes. In my area, two such schools have provided excellent services, namely, Cheeverstown House and Scoil Mhuire in Ballyboden. They are doing superb work; I cite them as an example of what can be done and how pleased people are with the Government&rsquo;s commitment over the past year to fulfil the commitment to special education. There are great challenges, and I note that they will remain with the Minister, who must achieve the highest standards of education for all children. Progress has been made for which the Minister deserves great recognition. She should continue with the good work.</P>

      <P FLI="0" el="3">I welcome the Minister to the debate tonight and wish her well in her Ministry for the years ahead.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael will not accept the smug and self-congratulatory motion on education presented for debate this evening. It is clear from the amendment we have tabled that we believe that there are serious deficiencies in the manner in which the Government is providing for young people&rsquo;s education that cannot simply be glossed over or erased. Every Member of this Chamber, from the governing parties or any Opposition party on this side, is inundated with queries on educational issues from members of the public. Those people, often deeply worried parents trying to access educational services on behalf of their children, are tragically met with silence or indifference. Such parents will find the self-praise on display this evening a little hard to swallow.</P>
      <P>I note from the Minister&rsquo;s statement of 29 March, when she announced the new plan intended to make a big difference for disadvantaged schools, that she must have had some doubts and, as a consequence, must have doubts about the motion before us tonight. She said that &ldquo;better procedures will be put in place for identifying the levels of disadvantage in our schools&rdquo;. I thought this motion clearly suggests we have the best possible overall policies of effectiveness for identifying people with such needs and that the new action plan was tackling educational disadvantage. I thought we had started that seven years ago. Finally, regarding the most disadvantaged schools, the Minister mentions &ldquo;addressing the issues that have diluted the overall effectiveness of some measures&rdquo;. The Minister&rsquo;s statement of 29 March therefore surely raises a serious doubt as to her commitment to this motion and to Government policy before she became Minister.</P>
      <P>This motion fails to mention several critical points causing real concern throughout the coun<Col N="1828"/>try. It makes no reference whatsoever to the system of weighted resources to be introduced in September this year. That system is essentially one of quotas whereby schools are allocated special education teachers on the basis of their enrolment, the gender of their students and the status of the school. However, that crude application of a quota takes no account whatsoever of individual schools that may have a higher enrolment of children with a mild, general or a specific learning disability.</P>
      <P>Under the weighted system, children with borderline or mild general learning disabilities will lose the specific allocation of two and a half hours resource teaching per week that has been their right to date. We heard Senator Fitzgerald and Senator Ormonde speak about rights. The reality is that the rights applied to date are all qualified by the availability of resources and the operation of the weighted system, with different quota systems in different schools. It will be impossible to ensure that all children who fall into these categories receive equal assistance. The weighted system institutionalises inequality in the provision of educational support, and that is clearly unacceptable.</P>
      <P>In addition, children with specific learning disabilities such as dyslexia will lose the two and a half hours resource teaching the Department circular of August 2002 stated was their right. The proposals also minimise the importance of psychological assessments for children with special needs. Under the weighted system, psychologists&rsquo; recommendations of specific support for children with mild general learning disabilities will carry no weight. The children will simply draw on a general pool of resources and be allocated whatever help their school can spare at the time. I ask the Minister to note this and to provide a reasonable and positive response, outlining the changes which will be made in this area. The weighted system is fundamentally flawed. One size does not fit all when special educational supports are being provided. The application of quotas to children with special needs is a deeply retrograde step, which I ask the Minister to reverse as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>Section 4 of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 states that the assessment of a child should &ldquo;include an evaluation and statement of the nature and extent of the child&rsquo;s disability (including in respect of matters that affect the child overall as an individual)&rdquo;. Section 3 of the Act provides that education plans aimed at meeting the special needs of children should be prepared in a consultative way that includes the children&rsquo;s parents. In the context of that legislation, which was passed last year, the Government is applying a new weighted system that judges schools according to their size, gender balance, number of pupils and status. It is making little reference to the actual needs of children. We have not yet received an indication of the Minister&rsquo;s willingness to change that.</P><Col N="1829"/>
      <P>The Fianna F&aacute;il motion does not mention the National Educational Psychological Service, which undertakes vital psychological evaluations of children with special educational needs and those experiencing difficulties at school. It is critically important that children who need psychological evaluation can have access to an educational psychologist so that their needs can be identified and met within the education system. Approximately 46% of the 3,288 primary schools in the State have not had a psychologist assigned to them under the service. That, not the suggestion of people like Senator Fitzgerald who said earlier that learning support is available to every primary and post-primary school, is the reality. The service being offered to children with special educational needs who are waiting for psychological assessment is deeply unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>It is unacceptable that there are geographical discrepancies in the National Educational Psychological Service. The number of schools covered by the service varies significantly from county to county. Every general primary school in County Kerry is covered by the service, compared to just 30% of such schools in County Carlow, 27% in counties Clare and Wexford, 18% in County Kilkenny and 11% in County Limerick. Some 184 of the 235 primary schools in County Galway are covered by the National Educational Psychological Service, which means that 51 schools do not have any coverage. It is damning that four special schools in the county are not covered by the service. I ask the Minister to contact the schools as a matter of urgency to inform them that their students will receive the service to which they are entitled as citizens with equal rights.</P>
      <P>I wish to conclude by commenting on the Government&rsquo;s commitment to reducing class sizes, which is clearly related to the matter under discussion. The Government has not acknowledged that it has pulled back from a commitment it gave in 2002 in the programme for Government, which stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">We will continue to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio in our schools. Over the next five years we will progressively introduce maximum class guidelines which will ensure that the average size of classes for children under 9 will be below the international best practice guideline of 20:1.</P>

	<P>That has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Not a single step has been taken by the Government to achieve that target in the three years which have passed since the promise was made even though, for the first time in many years, there are many qualified primary school teachers available to work. There are 1,600 trainee teachers in the training colleges at present. Some 400 unqualified teachers are teaching in our schools. I would like to correct a statement that was made earlier.</P>

	<P>Approximately &euro;3.162 billion, or 4.7% of gross domestic product, was spent on education in Ireland in 1997. The Estimates for 2005 have indicated that &euro;7.21 billion, or 4.6% of GDP, will be spent on education in this country this year. How can the Minister guarantee the public, including Senators and members of the teaching unions whom she met recently, that she expects and will deliver progress?</P>

	<P>The facts are available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>She cannot do so. I would like to refer to the cases of two small rural schools in County Galway which are about to lose a few students. I ask the Minister to do something about the schools&rsquo; problems as an act of goodwill. A three-teacher school that has 49 students will be downgraded and will lose a teacher. If a larger school&rsquo;s enrolment drops to 179 students, it will lose other teachers. The schools to which I refer are Lavally and Dunmore national schools near Tuam in County Galway. I could give many other examples, but I will concentrate on the two that come to mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask Senator Burke to conclude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I will. The two schools will lose teachers in the coming years if the Minister does not use her discretion to give the schools an advantage for a few years, thereby ensuring they do not lose out. If they lose teachers, the pupil-teacher ratio will be 29:1 in the case of Dunmore national school and 26:1 in the case of Lavally national school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Burke has made his case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>It is unacceptable that schools which have disadvantaged students will be affected in such a manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I take it that the Senator is taking some of his colleague&rsquo;s time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator had enough time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment moved by Senator Ulick Burke. I was surprised that the Government moved a motion of this nature.</P>
      <P>I read the newspaper reports of the Easter conferences of the various teaching organisations. The good reception that was given to the Minister for Education and Science at the conferences was in sharp contrast to the reception given to her predecessor, Deputy Noel Dempsey. The reception given to the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, was surprising when one considers the many problems which exist in our schools. I assume that Deputies from her party approach her on a regular basis to <Col N="1831"/>discuss the impact of the changes being made on rural schools in their constituencies.</P>
      <P>I would like to tell the Minister about a six year old boy called Jack, who attends a small rural school in my constituency. His mother came to see me recently. Regrettably, Jack will not receive two and a half hours of tuition because a clinical and educational psychologist has said he has a &ldquo;mild general learning disability&rdquo;. The parents of some children pay speech and language therapists &euro;180 to compile a report. I could read out the clinical and educational psychologist&rsquo;s analysis and interpretation of Jack, but I will not do so. It is understandable that Jack&rsquo;s mother is extremely distressed.</P>
      <P>The Minister recently published a document in which she indicated that the National Council for Special Education has recruited organisers in every part of the country. I accept that it is good to have a contact point at local level. I have contacted organisers to make a case on behalf of parents who have contacted me about their children. When one mentions to organisers that the phrase &ldquo;mild general learning disability&rdquo; appears in the analysis of a child, they will say there is nothing they can do because of a policy within the Department of Education and Science.</P>
      <P>I outlined my concerns in this regard on the Adjournment on 8 February last. The Minister, Deputy Hanafin, did not respond on that occasion, when I spoke about the impact that the changes which are taking place will have in County Limerick. I have been contacted by representatives of many schools in the county. Of the 42 resource teachers who will be lost by 72 schools in the county, just 30 will be redeployed and ten resource teaching positions will be lost. I was told on that occasion that changes will be made, which is an example of the kind of comfort being given by Government Deputies throughout the country. The Minister of State who responded on behalf of the Minister on that occasion<?oasys [jy?>said:</P>
      <P LI="1">The Minister for Education and Science is conscious of the difficulties which may arise as a result of the implementation of the model as proposed, especially for children in small and rural schools including those in County Limerick. Accordingly, the model is under review to assess whether it will provide an automatic response to pupils with common mild learning disabilities.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I hope the Minister will use the motion that her own party has tabled this evening to explain what she means by that and remove the uncertainty that exists for parents troubled by the impact these changes will have on their children in September. Two and a half hours is a priceless length of time for parents of children with dyslexia but it is not being made available to them. How can Government Senators table a motion sycophantically praising a Minister when such problems exist? Maybe the Minister will explain <Col N="1832"/>what she meant in that response on 8 February. Perhaps the Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies who are trying to offer schools some comfort by saying there will be changes will let us know what changes will take place.</P>
      <P>On the weighted model, a survey was carried out in County Leitrim, a rural area, and in Dundalk, an urban area, to draw comparisons. In a recent reply to Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan in the D&aacute;il, the Minister said she was not sure if she would publish the results. My information is that the survey results do not support the weighted system that is being introduced and that is why it is has not been published. The Minister should release the survey, clear up any uncertainty and stop the obfuscation and unnecessary damage being done by the policies lauded by Fianna F&aacute;il. She should go out there and experience a dose of reality.</P>
      <P>I have been asked to raise the case of the national school in Pallaskenry, County Limerick. A letter from the board of management, the parents and the teachers states:</P>
      <P LI="1">We have six class teachers for 156 pupils. This means that the average class size in our school is 26 pupils. These figures are particularly intolerable as all our students are in split classes. Currently, for example, we have one teacher for 10 first class and 20 senior infants &mdash; an actual class size of 30 five and six year olds! In addition, we have the services of a shared learning support teacher (two and a half days per week) to provide extra support to 15 pupils and the services of a resource teacher to provide support to ten children with educational needs. These additional supports to our school must be maintained for the benefit of our most vulnerable children. Accordingly, class size in our school and resources for children with special needs are issues or urgent concern for the community.</P>
      <P LI="1" el="0">We believe that it is not fair or equitable that our children should be taught in classes of these sizes, which belong to a bygone age, at a time when our country is experiencing unprecedented economic prosperity. Our demands for increased staffing in our school are set in the context where the Programme for Government (2002) committed the Government to: &ldquo;reduce the pupil teacher ratio in our schools. Over the next five years we will progressively introduce maximum class guidelines which will ensure that the average size of classes of children under nine will be below the international best practice guidelines of 20:1&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">That figure is contained in the programme for Government that has been in place for three years. The Minister recently said it was an aspiration. We must not be disingenuous. What did the Minister mean? Are we going to reduce class sizes and, if so, to what level will they be reduced? What will we tell schools about the reduction of class sizes? The letter from Pallaskenry continues:</P><Col N="1833"/>
      <P LI="1">Three years later not a single step has been taken towards achieving the Government&rsquo;s own target, notwithstanding the fact that for the first time in many years there are qualified primary teachers available for work and a further 1,600 teachers set to graduate in June 2005.</P>
      <P FLI="0">A sad situation is evolving where a dyslexic child will not be entitled to two and a half hours tuition. Some time ago in County Limerick a private school for pupils with dyslexia was established. It was heralded as a success but we felt the Department of Education and Science was making positive noises in the area of resources for the primary school environment. Unfortunately, however, we are going backwards. We are pressurising parents into getting separate tuition to fill the vacuum that the Government should be filling through the education structure. I hope a Fianna F&aacute;il Senator will come into the House this evening and say that he or she is coming across these sorts of cases and seek their resolution instead of tabling sycophantic resolutions praising the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister enjoys the support of a tolerant media but I am asking her to take action on an important issue. The teachers are available and the resources exist. The Minister must get on with the job and do it properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the important matter of special educational facilities. It is the duty of all Members of the Oireachtas to be cognisant of the most pressing issues for citizens at any given time. It is fair to say that health care, infrastructure, the economy, child care and education would make the top five of most people&rsquo;s lists of areas that need our constant attention.</P>
      <P>Education, as a policy area, is vast and has far-reaching and long-lasting effects on our society. There have been challenges at all levels of the education system; many have been met and more remain. The provision of facilities and services for those with special educational needs is rightly at the forefront of education initiatives and it is the subject of the motion before us.</P>
      <P>I am proud to say that much has been achieved in this regard by the present Government and we will continue to make progress on delivering the facilities people need and deserve. The motion before us is an opportunity to acknowledge, commend and welcome progress while giving us time to assess what we have done. We should not forget that special needs education is an area that suffers from a history of under-provision. We must be realistic, we are trying to catch up but we are succeeding. There will be problems and it will take time to improve services to an appropriate level but we are committed to doing that and making progress.</P>
      <P>The history of under-provision has taken its toll on special educational facilities as it has on other priority policy areas. When this Government was elected in 1997, we resolved to make amends and <Col N="1834"/>address this issue in a strategic and meaningful way. The strategic and planned approach is key, it is not just a question of ploughing resources <i>ad hoc</i> into a sector. Simplistic arguments to this effect from some parties only frustrate progress. Progress will not be frustrated, we will continue to be strategic because it is the right thing to do for those who need special educational facilities.</P>
      <P>Contrary to the claims of some, strategy does not mean delay or inaction. We have prioritised the implementation of the core legislative and structural measures. To this end the Government enacted the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004. The establishment of the National Council for Special Education and the transfer of functions to it are integral to the Government&rsquo;s strategic approach. It is responsible for processing applications for special educational needs support. It has been in operation since 1 January 2005 and the council will resolve many of the difficulties inherited from the past. Real progress has been made since the Government took on this issue. In more general terms, the average class size at primary level is 23.9 pupils. This is down from 26.6 in the 1996-97 school year. The number of special needs resource teachers has increased from 104 in 1998 to more than 2,600. There are now 1,500 learning support teachers, 1,000 teachers in special schools and almost 6,000 special needs assistants in schools generally. Real progress has been made and it should be acknowledged, commended and welcomed.</P>
      <P>The provision of services for those with special needs is closely linked to the provision of general education services. The impact of the Government&rsquo;s actions on the wider pupil-teacher ratio is having a positive effect on special needs education. The ratio takes into account all teachers in schools, including resource teachers. When the Government took office in 1997, the pupil-teacher ratio was approximately 22:1, but had been reduced by 2004 to approximately 17:1. That is real progress. More than 4,000 additional teachers have been employed in primary schools since 1997. Additional teaching posts reduce general class sizes, help to tackle educational disadvantage and constitute additional resources for children with special needs.</P>
      <P>In accordance with stated Government policy, we will continue to reduce further the pupil-teacher ratio subject to spending priorities within the education sector. I am happy to see that priority has been given to pupils with special needs from disadvantaged areas and in junior classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Only to some special needs pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Parents and schools have voiced their frustration with the system and, as we must, we are acting to ease their burden. A total of 70 special needs organisers have been recruited nationally and will act as dedicated points of con<Col N="1835"/>tacts for parents and schools. It is more evidence of the meaningful policy approaches adopted by the Government to meet educational requirements.</P>
      <P>While the significant increase in the number of dedicated facilities for children with autism since 1998 is welcome, we can and must do more. The report of the task force on autism, which was published in October 2001, contained over 150 recommendations. As I stated earlier, the Government has prioritised the implementation of core legislative and structural measures, but outstanding issues must continue to be addressed. Given the calls to progress the Middletown centre for autism in County Armagh, its launch earlier this year was very welcome. It is right for the House to support the Government&rsquo;s initiative to progress a North-South centre of excellence to serve the needs of persons with autism in both jurisdictions on the island.</P>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats Party does not doubt that significant challenges remain in the area of special needs education and it will act to address them. My party has never shied away from taking and supporting bold steps to meet the toughest tests head on. It is no different in the area of special educational needs. While tonight&rsquo;s motion provides us with time to reflect, we must keep making progress. To this end, I welcome the recent announcement of more targeted support which is to be provided across the education system under the new action plan to tackle educational disadvantage. I welcome the additional annual investment of approximately &euro;40 million and the creation of 300 additional posts across the educational system.</P>
      <P>We are dedicated to tackling educational disadvantage. While the progress which has been made should be acknowledged, historic under-provision has left the sector in trouble. We must continue to address people&rsquo;s frustrations and blocks and gaps in services. I intend to play my part to ensure that educational disadvantage remains a priority, in which context I welcome this evening&rsquo;s motion. I have encountered stories like those outlined by Opposition Members and am glad to say that by tackling the issues raised and bringing them to the attention of the Minister&rsquo;s office and the Department as a whole, problems have been resolved. For every story a Member opposite brings forward, I can relate a story of resolution for families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Not for all. Provision is selective as the Senator has admitted here tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be more appropriate for certain people to reflect on what they did and, more important, failed to do while in office.</P>

	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire go dt&iacute; an Teach. S&uacute;ilim go n-&eacute;ireoidh go maith l&eacute;i sa phost nua at&aacute; aici. T&aacute; s&iacute; s&eacute; mh&iacute; sa phost anois and we expect results. Despite all of the discussions, the 20:1 pupil-teacher ratio commitment set out in the programme for Government will not go away. It will have to be delivered. While I accept the Minister requires time to achieve the target and do not agree that tonight is the right time for a row, such a row is brewing. The Government has committed itself to doing something but has provided no indication of how it will be achieved. I want to hear how it will happen. I intended to table a motion on the issue next month as I thought, having listened to the Minister recently, that she was working on a project, the details of which could be provided to us. Time is running out however.</P>
      <P>The Minister is six months into her term of office and schools want to know what their positions will be next year. No matter how much people object to the examples outlined by Senators Finucane and Ulick Burke, they are real problems. The small schools in Galway and elsewhere and the special schools in Limerick will be in trouble even in the context of the provision of the 70 additional special needs assistants to whom Senator Minihan referred.</P>
      <P>The background to the provision is that approximately 1,500 schools will lose access to special needs assistants while another 1,500 gain access to them. While 70 extra assistants will be provided in the process, it will be in the context of the absolute chaos which will emerge when Members on the Government side begin to <Col N="1837"/>receive deputations from local schools which lose supports. No one understands why that must happen. It is certain to create great anger in schools nationally in the absence of a plan to agree and announce a process to reduce class sizes. People with special needs will not receive what they want, smaller schools will lose teachers and over 1,500 schools will lose their special needs assistants without any sign of class sizes being reduced. It is a recipe for chaos. Someone is leading the Minister into a situation which must be dealt with.</P>
      <P>I have been a Member for 18 years and as I continually point out, a motion which in sequence acknowledges, commends, welcomes, supports and congratulates the Government is very difficult for anyone on this side of the House to endorse, no matter what its merits. People should organise things a little better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Progressive Democrats Party goes along with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The best I can say about the motion is that in using the phrase &ldquo;committed to reducing further&rdquo; in the last paragraph somebody avoided the possibility of splitting an infinitive. How will the 300 additional posts across the education system be provided? I dare not ask, but I presume the provision of perhaps 150 posts at primary level will be to address educational disadvantage only. As it is not clear from the motion, I would like to know exactly what the 300 additional posts will achieve.</P>
      <P>I listened to the Minister speak at the INTO conference earlier this month at which she was very well received. I took special note of her comments which I welcomed genuinely. Her comments on class size were especially welcome. She said that while she acknowledged the issue of class size was one on which more work had to be done and the average pupil-teacher ratio had been brought down to 24:1, she remained committed to delivering further reductions in class sizes in line with Government policy.</P>
      <P>The Minister also made another reference to that issue. What concerns me is that there is no mention of a 20:1 ratio. I would like confirmation from the Minister that the objective on class size is still 20:1, as stated in the programme for Government, and that this will be delivered. I am a reasonable person. I have listened to the INTO general secretary, John Carr, speak on this matter on several occasions. He is also a reasonable person. What people want to hear is how the objective on class size will be achieved and in what timescale. It is not an unreasonable demand.</P>
      <P>The Minister also referred to the number of untrained personnel in classrooms. Will something be done about that issue this year? The Minister said she would write to every primary school board of management. Everybody in this Chamber would support her in ensuring that qualified teachers who are seeking work would get jobs rather than untrained personnel. It would <Col N="1838"/>be helpful if that letter were sent out now so that people could begin to address the issue. That letter could be sent out in the morning. Why can it not be done immediately?</P>
      <P>Estimates suggest that between 400 and 700 jobs would be created next year as part of the campaign to reduce class sizes. Will the Government make these jobs available? By how much will we reduce class sizes? It is even more worrying that the Minister stated that in the next school year there would be smaller classes for children in disadvantaged schools. That is a definite commitment.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been a teacher and she knows what it is like to be in a classroom and to plan ahead. People in schools are trying to work out where they will be next September, how many teachers they will have, where they will put classes and who will be in charge. Schools need to know about that now. The Minister made a fair point but it is not unreasonable to ask that people would be informed.</P>
      <P>I know there is a smart answer to this issue. The Minister could say that even if principals were told on the last day of June or August that they would welcome an additional teacher whenever they got one. That is the truth but that is not the way we want to plan for our schools, do our business or make appointments. I ask that the Minister would deal with this matter.</P>
      <P>I do not think anybody can argue reasonably with the Minister&rsquo;s statement that she is giving priority to special education and educational disadvantage at various levels. People can argue against it but it is a valid position for a Minister to take. There are four issues to be taken into account in this regard. The first relates to the loss of special needs assistants, SNAs, and how schools will cope. Another issue relates to what we will do for the disadvantaged in the next school year. There is also the question of what we will do to reduce the average class size to 20:1 over the next two or three years, beginning this year. The last matter is what we do in regard to special education. It is not unreasonable at this stage to ask the Minister what exactly will happen and what she will do.</P>
      <P>One of the things I find most alarming in terms of special education &mdash; speakers have commented eloquently on it &mdash; is the fact that in the UK a child with an IQ between 50 and 70 is defined as moderately disabled whereas here such a child is considered to be mildly disabled and, therefore, is not provided with any support. That is appalling. There is no point in trying to reach international standards in that respect. I accept this was the case before the Minister was appointed to this office. That situation is not fair nor acceptable and we must look carefully at this matter.</P>
      <P>I intend to propose a debate on the area of special education. There is too much in the subject to deal with tonight. I want to keep the focus in this debate on teacher numbers. I would like the Minister to state what she will do. I will give a commitment to the Minister. If she informs me <Col N="1839"/>she will reduce class sizes to 20:1 on a phased basis, I will support that and I will argue with teachers in support of such a measure. The leadership of the INTO, and John Carr in particular, would certainly wish to hear how that would be done. While I might not be happy with the speed with which it will be implemented I would support a plan that aims to deliver on class sizes. That is not unreasonable.</P>
      <P>If schools that will lose SNAs or teachers this year see what will happen in the next two years they would put up with it. When there is an expectation of certainty somewhere down the line it is easy to deal with people, but when a matter is clouded in obfuscation, as Senator Finucane stated, that creates uncertainty, scepticism and problems for everybody. Let us put a plan in place that will address the problem which people can buy into. That is not an unreasonable approach. Let us do it within resources.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to do a Khrushchev on it and hammer the Cabinet table and read back to the Government what is stated in its programme for Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Three years on and nothing to show for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister inherited this legacy. She cannot be blamed for asking how a class size of 20:1 can be delivered. It is not her demand; it is a commitment which the Government made to the people. The Minister is entitled to get the resources to implement it. I do not see how the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, can do other than support her. They might say they do not have the money at present and that it will not all be available at once. That is okay. We all have to work within resources.</P>
      <P>We had a debate previously in the House about rights-based provisions. Such issues will always be defined by the resources that are available. However, it would be unacceptable for somebody in the Department of Finance to say that no resources are available for this, that it is pie in the sky and will not be done.</P>
      <P>Let us hear a restatement of the commitment on class sizes of 20:1. Let us hear the process by which it will be delivered. Let us see what will be invested in educational disadvantage over the next year. Let us hear that the letter will go out to schools outlining the fact that we want untrained people out of classrooms. Let us hear what will be included in special education and how we will deal with the gap created by the loss of SNAs.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister well in that very difficult task and I do not underestimate what is involved in what I have proposed that she should do.</P>

	<P>Go raibh maith agat a Leas-Chathaoirligh. Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis na Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute;. It is always a pleasure to come to the Seanad where the debate is usually calm, con<Col N="1840"/>structive and non-aggressive. I thank the Government side for its motion which is neither sycophantic nor laudatory but in fact sets out the progress that has been made by the Government in recent years.</P>
      <P>While it may be obvious to everybody, my aim is to ensure that every child gets the opportunity to reach his or her potential. The motion focuses on a couple of significant areas of development but we could talk about the ambit of education. I am pleased that Government Senators chose to deal with children with special needs, the targeted response that is required for them and the progress that has been made in this area, as well as the continued response and improvements we have to make for these children because, as has already been said by Senators Fitzgerald, Ormonde and Minihan, we are playing catch-up due to the historical under-provision in this area. We are working to ensure we bring our services for children with special needs up to an appropriate level.</P>
      <P>It is worth recognising what has been done, the advances that have been made and the difference that has made to children with special needs and to their educational needs. Some of these figures have already been mentioned. There are now more than 2,600 resource teachers in our schools, which is up from 104 in 1998. There are 1,500 learning support teachers, more than 1,000 teachers in special schools and more than 600 teachers in special classes. There are nearly 6,000 special needs assistants in our schools, compared to just 300 in 1998.</P>
      <P>This year more than &euro;30 million is being spent on school transport for special needs students and more than &euro;3 million is being spent on specialised equipment and materials, up from &euro;800,000 in 1998.</P>

      <P>The statistics outlined refer to the provision of education for children with special needs largely in mainstream national schools. However, education for children with special educational needs is provided in a variety of settings. In addition to supported provision in mainstream classes, special classes and units exist, as well as special schools. Home tuition has also been provided for children. Special arrangements are made pending their placement in one of the units, classes or schools that I have outlined. However, that might not be appropriate for the individual child. The placement may be made in one of the 108 special schools and 654 special classes and units located throughout the country. Sometimes when we talk about the mainstreaming of children with special needs, the very special role of those schools is forgotten. I want to recognise their role in particular and the fact they are providing a top class <Col N="1841"/>education service for children with special needs. I have asked my Department in consultation with the National Council for Special Education and other partners to consider how we can optimise the role and potential of special schools. I am also anxious that all schools should welcome children with special needs. It is not true to say, particularly at second level, that all schools welcome these children. There has been a great improvement among primary schools, but I met one second level principal recently who said he had 23 children with special needs coming into first year at his mainstream institution. While that is to be commended on his part, it is actually distorting his figures and reflects the fact that the other schools in the area are not willing to do it. I would encourage all schools to make the necessary provisions and to be supportive of children who have special needs in their own catchment areas. These are some of the types of issues and problems we need to deal with, as well as some of those outlined here today.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly, the National Council for Special Education and the transfer of functions to it as well as the fact that it has been up and running since the beginning of the year can make a real difference. It was established in December 2003, as an independent statutory body with responsibilities as set out in the National Council for Special Education (Establishment) Order 2003.</P>
      <P>The council currently has 12 members, all with a special interest in or knowledge of the area of education of children with disabilities. There are 71 special education needs organisers, SENOs, who have been employed by the council since September 2004. They are working really well. They have been making good contacts with the schools and the parents. That they are present at a local level enables them to see and identify the needs. They are responsible for the primary and secondary schools in their areas and have already begun to work with them. A recruitment process fur a further nine SENOs has been commenced by the council to bring the total up to 80 persons countrywide. In addition, 17 staff are employed at the council&rsquo;s head office in Trim, County Meath.</P>
      <P>With effect from 1 January 2005, the National Council for Special Education took over responsibility for processing resource applications for children with disabilities who have special educational needs. Under the new arrangements, the council, through the local SENO, processes the relevant application for resources and informs the school of the outcome. The council is also responsible for co-ordinating the provision of education and related support services with health boards, schools and other relevant bodies. One of the real issues is the lack of co-ordination between education and the health services. Parents felt excluded from decisions being made about their children. Where did the teacher fit in to all of this? Local organisers can now ensure they work with the different groups to co-ordinate the services. This means that when a <Col N="1842"/>child is identified with a special need, the services can be put in place immediately.</P>
      <P>As time goes on, bearing in mind that NCSE has only been established a few months, it will greatly enhance the provision of services to children with special educational needs and give a timely response to schools who have made application for supports.</P>
      <P>The general allocation model has been mentioned here a good deal. Pupils in the high incidence disability categories of mild and borderline mild general learning disability and dyslexia are to be found throughout the education system. For that reason the Department, in consultation with educational interests, has developed a model of general teacher allocation for these disability categories. This model, which was announced in 2004 with a view to coming into effect this year, was designed to put in place permanent resources in primary schools to cater for pupils in these categories.</P>
      <P>I am really surprised to hear some of the Senators basically suggesting that any child who needs resources will have to wait until he or she gets a psychological assessment, will have to pay for it, have it verified and then have to wait for the resources to be put in place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms M. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;based on all of the numbers in our schools throughout the country. We have evidence to show there are differing needs for children in disadvantaged areas and there is substantial evidence that boys have greater difficulty than girls. These are some of the issues that had to be taken into account. There <Col N="1843"/>are a number of advantages in having a model which everybody accepts, except some of the Opposition Senators here tonight.</P>

	<P>The Senators are being hoisted by their own petard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms M. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>As soon as the classroom teacher identifies the need it means the resource is already in place within the school and he or she may ensure the child can avail of it. It certainly gives the schools more certainty instead of waiting from one year to the next to find out what the allocation will be and it makes the posts more attractive to qualified teachers. However, there is some confusion. We are not talking about special needs assistants, SNAs. Perhaps Senator O&rsquo;Toole confused the terminology. The special needs assistant will continue to be allocated to children with a defined need&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Tell the truth, some will have to go without.</P>

	<P>The Minister, without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms M. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and there are 6,000 of those. I am surprised that Senator Ulick Burke is even more confused than I thought he was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the Minister who is confused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>It will take her more than six months to get used to the reality of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Ulick Burke must allow the Minister to speak, without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms M. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The special needs assistants are assigned to individual children based on serious medical or physical need. They are not in any way affected by this model. Equally, children in the lower incident disability categories will, of course, continue to be allocated resources on the basis of their individual needs. It became evident to me that the particular model allocated last year would give rise to difficulties for the small schools and rural schools if implemented as originally proposed. I discussed this with a number of people including principals, teachers and parents who were worried about the particular model which was announced. We also got the views of the National Council for Special Education. The work of the special needs organisers obviously fed into this as well. For those reasons I had the <Col N="1844"/>proposed model reviewed and I hope to be in a position shortly to inform schools because I am conscious they need to know. This will ensure they will have resources in place as children need them rather than having to wait for the cost and the time of psychological assessments.</P>
      <P>In addition to the changes made in the delivery of resources to date, the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 provides a map to the future development of special educational needs services. The Act reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to putting in place a strategy to address the needs of people with disabilities. It will begin in steps over the next few years, in accordance with an implementation plan to be drafted by the National Council for Special Education. This Act governs the provision of education services for children and sets out the overall policy approach of the Department as regards the provision of services to children with special needs arising from a disability. It also allows for the provision of such services on the basis of assessed need and, in so far as is appropriate, in an inclusive setting.</P>
      <P>One of the principles underpinning the Act is that parents must have a right to be consulted and fully informed at every stage of the process. If they feel their views are not being full recognised, or where they feel the plan is not being implemented effectively, they have a right to appeal any decisions concerning their children and these matters to an independent review board. The board will have the power to compel bodies, including health boards to take specific actions to address matters before it. However, nothing in the Act will restrict the right of recourse to the courts. Rather, it will simplify the process of enforcing the right to an appropriate education through the appeals board and the introduction of a mediation process prior to full scale litigation if the parents remains dissatisfied with the board&rsquo;s findings.</P>
      <P>The Act provides for the co-ordination of services between health and education sectors as well as providing for the council in primary legislation. There is an onus on the Ministers for Finance, Health and Children and Education and Science to ensure adequate resources are provided for the delivery of services. In particular, the Minister for Finance is obliged to have due regard to the State&rsquo;s duty to provide for an education appropriate to the needs of every child under the Constitution and the necessity to provide equity of treatment to all children.</P>
      <P>My Department and the Department of Education in Northern Ireland are jointly engaged in the development of the Middletown Centre for Autism in County Armagh. Both Departments have jointly funded the purchase of the former St. Joseph&rsquo;s Adolescent Centre, Middletown, and plan to refurbish the property to meet the needs of a centre of excellence for children and young people with autism throughout the island of Ireland. The centre will be dedicated to improving and enriching the educational opportunities <Col N="1845"/>of children and young people with autistic spectrum disorders. The four key services to be provided by the centre will be a learning support service on a residential basis, an educational assessment service, a training and advisory service, and an autism research and information service.</P>
      <P>Several working groups are continuing to address the legal, financial, organisational and infrastructural aspects of the proposal. Work is continuing on the development of a campus masterplan for the Middletown property which, when complete, will guide the commissioning of any necessary infrastructure and refurbishment works. The process of recruiting a chief executive officer to operate the centre is also being formulated. It is anticipated the centre will be operational by autumn 2006.</P>
      <P>Significant improvements have been made in recent years on pupil-teacher ratios in our schools and class sizes at primary level. The Opposition pointed to the commitment to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio in the programme for Government, which has been achieved. Over 4,000 additional teachers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Over 4,000 additional teachers have been employed in our primary schools since 1997 and over 2,000 at second level. These additional teaching posts have been used to reduce class sizes, to tackle educational disadvantage and to provide additional resources for children with special needs.</P>
      <P>In line with the commitment in the programme for Government, class sizes will be further reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

	<P>Various publications from the teachers&rsquo; unions have noted that the reduction of class sizes will not necessarily improve outcomes. It has been noted in some disadvantaged schools with a pupil-teacher of 20:1 that literacy levels still did not improve.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms M. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>We need to examine new teaching methods and approaches as well as the issue of class sizes. The deployment of additional posts will be decided within the context of the overall policy. Priority will continue to be given to pupils with special needs, those from disadvantaged areas and pupils in junior classes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms M. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>On the issue of the untrained teachers as opposed to the unqualified ones, as I stated at the teachers&rsquo; unions&rsquo; conferences, the Department will be writing to schools setting out that there is no need for untrained teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>The Department will be writing to the boards of management setting out the position on untrained teachers. It is important that children are taught by fully qualified teachers, particularly as more are now available.</P>
      <P>I will shortly be publishing a new framework on tackling educational disadvantage. Millions of euro are spent on tackling disadvantage. It is to the credit of any Government to recognise schemes that are not working, to decide not to proceed with them and introduce new schemes and approaches. Members always point out that schools originally labelled disadvantaged no longer fall into that category, while schools never so labelled are. Rather than criticising the measure, I would have thought the Senators opposite would have welcomed the continued progress in this area.</P>

	<P>We do indeed.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1847"/>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms M. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The progress ranges from the new guidance counsellors, as raised by Senator Ormonde. I recently announced an extra 100 counsellor positions which I am conscious must be targeted at junior cycle students. This is not only from my own experience and teachers, but from delegates to D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g. Many delegates believed most guidance was needed in the transition period between primary and secondary level, rather than fifth or sixth year.</P>
      <P>The programme for tackling disadvantage will involve better identification methods and an integrated approach working with families, children and teachers. It will involve examining the provision of libraries, the school completion programme that has encouraged young people to stay in schools, as well as out-of-school measures. The Government&rsquo;s record shows we have prioritised special educational needs and educational disadvantage. We will also continue to make progress in the other areas from investment in postgraduate studies in science and technology to pre-school services.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for her presentation. The INTO&rsquo;s campaign to reduce class sizes is based on the premise that smaller class sizes are crucial in tackling educational disadvantage and providing quality education to our pupils. The Fianna F&aacute;il motion claims there are now 4,000 more primary school teachers and over 2,000 in post-primary schools than in 1997. The Minister for Education and Science claimed the figures for resource teacher positions speak for themselves. However, they do not when one sees the real pupil-teacher ratio as highlighted by the INTO. The motion also &ldquo;acknowledges that these <Col N="1848"/>extra teaching resources have been used to reduce class sizes&rdquo;. This is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms M. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>They have been reduced in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>Nothing has been done about the actual pupil-teacher ratio on the ground. Recently the INTO had local meetings between primary school principals and public representatives. At my local meeting, no Government party members were present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>For south Dublin, the INTO puts the pupil-teacher ratio at 25:1. South Dublin has three RAPID areas which are included in these figures. However in Lucan and Clondalkin, not covered in the RAPID programme, the pupil-teacher ratios are much higher, some as high as 30:1. There are 100,000 primary school students in classes of 30 students or more. That is the pupil-teacher ratio and all the gloss in the Minister&rsquo;s contribution and in the motion before the House does not change it. The pupils, teachers, parents and politicians are aware of the reality that we have the second highest class sizes in the EU.</P>
      <P>Members have referred to the Government&rsquo;s commitment to reduce the pupil teacher ratio for children under nine years of age to 20:1 in its programme for Government. There has been no reduction in the ratio in the past four years according to INTO figures. How will the Government deliver on its commitment in the next two years? That is the reason Senator O&rsquo;Toole and the Labour Party, in a recent motion in the D&aacute;il, sought a schedule from the Government outlining how and when it will deliver on its commitment.</P>
      <P>Another issue raised at local meetings is the inflexibility of pupil teacher ratios. Sometimes the number of pupils in a school will drop from year to year and, although that does not reflect what the position will be in the long term, the school loses a teacher. This issue must be addressed.</P>
      <P>Educational disadvantage is another important issue. Labour Party statistics show that between 800 and 1,000 children each year do not transfer from primary to second level school, 4% of students leave school before the junior certificate examination and 18.4% of students leave school <Col N="1849"/>before the leaving certificate examination. Recent reports on literacy in schools indicate that up to 50% of students in some schools experience difficulties with reading, writing and numeracy. According to another report, 30% of pupils in disadvantaged schools in Ireland experience these problems.</P>
      <P>Class sizes are an important aspect of dealing with educational disadvantage. More must be done in this regard. The Government has done nothing about pre-school education. Research indicates that pre-school education can deliver major improvements in tackling educational disadvantage. The recent OECD report referred to the Government&rsquo;s failure to do anything about providing pre-school education. The Labour Party believes that every child of three years of age should be guaranteed one year of pre-school education. What are the Minister&rsquo;s proposals in that regard?</P>
      <P>Similarly, the Labour Party has proposals to extend programmes for targeting educational disadvantage. There has been no expansion of initiatives such as the Breaking the Cycle and Early Start programmes introduced by the former Minister for Education, former Labour Party Deputy, Niamh Bhreathnach, to tackle disadvantage. These programmes have been commended on their success to date. They must be expanded and the Labour Party has proposals for doing that.</P>
      <P>Far more must be done by the Government on the issue of literacy. The Labour Party believes there should be regular measurements of students with literacy problems and funding should be provided for that purpose. Much work has been done on the pupil teacher ratio in schools in disadvantaged areas but more must be done. The Labour Party believes the pupil teacher ratio in disadvantaged schools should be 15:1 and it should be 20:1 in other schools. However, many schools that have or are near that ratio are experiencing many other problems as a result of the Government&rsquo;s policies. I am aware of parents who are obliged to give money to the school each week to cover heating and lighting expenses. That is not good enough.</P>
      <P>In areas that are not designated as disadvantaged, schools face other challenges which have not been addressed sufficiently by the Government. There are many such schools in the area I represent, Lucan and Clondalkin. These schools have pupil teacher ratios of between 28:1 and 30:1. They also have large numbers of children of non-national parents who need special attention due to language difficulties and so forth. These schools need smaller pupil teacher ratios and more resources to deal with those issues.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party does not believe a review of the weighting system for dealing with special educational needs is sufficient; the system should be scrapped. This policy will be detrimental for pupils and will result in many students losing out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it, Deputy de Valera, and I congratulate her on her progress in the Department. The Minister, Deputy Hanafin, deserves great credit for the work she has done in the short time she has been in office.</P>
      <P>I support the motion before the House. This side of the House has always recognised that this country&rsquo;s most important assets are its young people and the education they are given. From the era of &Eacute;amon de Valera and Se&aacute;n Lemass through to the current Minister, we have put education at the top of the agenda. Ireland is acknowledged to have one of the most successful and progressive economies in Europe. The foundation of that economy is the provision of a full, well rounded education for young people. We also recognise that education is the key to a better life for everybody. The Minister reinforced that point earlier.</P>
      <P>Despite what we have heard during tonight&rsquo;s debate, our education system has evolved and is recognised to be a modern, efficient and effective method of providing our young people with a well rounded, comprehensive start to life that gives them the opportunity to make the most of their talents and to reach their full potential. That is the aim of the motion. Obviously, some students need more help than others so the motion concentrates on the areas of disadvantage and disability needs.</P>
      <P>The figures speak for themselves. I am surprised to hear the Opposition Members harangue the Minister about the number of SNAs and resource teachers when one considers the miserable contribution they made when they were last in power. Special needs assistants were not even considered an issue in 1997. Look at the improvements since then and the increase in the number of support and resource teachers.</P>
      <P>Neither has there been any mention of the improvement in facilities. The school building programme is five or six times bigger than it was in 1997. All these developments require resources and time. It takes time to change a system, particularly one that has historically been under resourced. Members on this side of the House recognise the importance of this issue, and the facts and figures outlined by the Minister demonstrate that.</P>
      <P>It should also be borne in mind that today&rsquo;s school children are open to many more influences than existed years ago, such as the television and the Internet. Our system must evolve and the teachers and teaching assistants must progress with such changes. They must be trained to deal with the issues that exist now which did not exist ten or 12 years ago. We live in a changing society and our methods of education must change as well. I am very encouraged by the Minister&rsquo;s insistence on the involvement of parents in pre-primary, primary and secondary education. Close co-operation between parents, teachers, management and even the Department is an essential part of the mix. Along with the provision of mod<Col N="1851"/>ern facilities and equipment, this is an area in which we have not been found wanting. The recruitment of over 4,000 extra teachers, including 2,500 resource teachers, speaks for itself. I have seen the benefits of it in the inner city. The previous speaker mentioned a pupil-teacher ratio of 15:1 and that is the reality in the inner city schools that take part in the Breaking the Cycle programme. The benefits of this are obvious and I see them every day. The kids are more confident and articulate.</P>
      <P>There are other special cases that have to be examined. However, nobody can argue that we have not given priority to these areas through budgetary and resource allocations from the Department. I am involved in an education forum, which is a new departure in the docklands area. The forum brings together all of the concerned parties, such as teachers, parents and pupils, as well as public representatives, State and semi-State agencies. We are concentrating on many of the issues raised at the forum, such as parental input into a child&rsquo;s education. These are simple issues, such as the timing of a parent-teacher meeting. Time can be made available later in the evening so both parents can meet the teacher.</P>
      <P>There is also a need to provide a quiet, safe environment in which a young person can study. In much inner city housing, the space does not exist for a child to study on his or her own for a few hours. I think the Minister recognises that fact. I congratulate her on her performances at the conference. I never heard such a reaction.</P>

	<P>Unfortunately, that is not the case and it is certainly not the role of the Opposition. Senator Brady thinks the current Minister for Education and Science is wonderful. Her main advantage is that she is not the former Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey. All she has done thus far is to undo the damage he did in his short reign as Minister. That is particularly the case in the area of special needs.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1852"/>
    <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should look at the standard of schools around the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The standardisation of the school year is now turning out to be a farce. It actually promotes greater absenteeism from schools. Parents can no longer afford to bring their children on holidays. As everyone is off at the same time, holiday packages are sold at a peak price. This has resulted in children missing more time from school. I challenge Members opposite to look into that issue. More children are now missing school because of the standardisation of the school year. That is the ultimate irony, but it is the end result of standardisation of the school year.</P>
      <P>The Minister has much work ahead of her. The rapturous reception she got at the teachers&rsquo; conferences was a reflection of who she was not, as opposed to who she was. We all know the former Minister refused to turn up at the conferences last year and insulted the teachers at the time. It was no surprise, therefore, that she got a rapturous reception. Will she get the same reception next year? I suspect she will not, but we will have to wait and see.</P>
      <P>I was bemused to hear Senator Brady speak about the schools building programme. I remember the hypocrisy and lies of the Government during the last general election, when the former Minister, Deputy Woods, told officials in the Department of Education and Science not to issue any bad news to schools in the run up to the election. Every school in Ireland was promised a new extension and new buildings, yet nothing has happened years later. In Carlow, Scoil Mhuire gan Sm&aacute;l celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2000. The then Minister, Deputy Woods, was there for the celebrations and he made an announcement about a building for the school. Everyone expected to see construction lorries arriving soon after, yet nothing has happened in the five years since that announcement. The local people were very sore about that and I hope they will not have forgotten it by 2007. There is major work needed on the schools building programme.</P>
      <P>I welcome in principle the Government announcement on the devolved grant. However, much more work needs to be done on it. In Carlow, Saint Mary&rsquo;s Church of Ireland primary school in Bagenalstown is looking for a new school that costs around &euro;1 million. The school management was told that the school was to receive a devolved grant. However, its happiness turned to puzzlement when it was told the school would be getting &euro;575,000. That is a lot of money, but it is well short of &euro;1 million and such a deficit can leave schools in an awkward position. If the school does not accept the grant, it can be knocked back for years. If it accepts the grant, it will be short of money. It is unfair to expect small rural communities to raise that kind of money. The Government is abdicating its responsibility on this issue. I welcome the idea of the devolved grant and any steps that decentralise the very cen<Col N="1853"/>tralised system we have in the schools building programme. However, granting a school &euro;500,000 when it needs &euro;1 million is very unfair. The school should get the money it deserves.</P>
      <?oasys [cl10.5]?>
      <P>The increase in the number of special needs assistants has led to difficulties. Everyone knows that managing staff can be difficult at the best of times. Many schools now have three or four extra staff and principals must deal with teachers and special needs assistants yet no extra resources have been given to principals to deal with the increase in staff. The Department should look at this issue, as it is putting undue pressure on principals, particularly those who also teach.</P>
      <P>Some of the all-girl schools in Carlow have contacted me about the allocation of special needs assistants. They are not happy with the current situation. These schools will see a reduction in hours and their situation should be examined again in the review. They should not suffer discrimination, although I appreciate it is an awkward issue.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael amendment deals with the failure of the Government to deal with the report of the task force on autism. We are trying to get a school for autism up and running in Carlow, but my experience in this regard did not inspire confidence. We are due a decision next month and I hope we get the new school. We were offered a new site but the Department of Education and Science did not play ball with us. I must acknowledge, however, that it did arrange for a meeting after an Adjournment matter was tabled a few weeks ago. I hope the Department&rsquo;s wrongdoing will be rectified by the decision in May.</P>
      <P>The Joint Committee on Health and Children is discussing the problem of obesity and people being unfit generally, yet the Department of Education and Science does not provide proper playground facilities for children. Schools need to be equipped with such recreation facilities for children.</P>
      <P>The pupil-teacher ratio is the main issue for schools. The Government has given a clear commitment to reduce the ratio but it has not happened. The pupil-teacher ratio has a big impact on children&rsquo;s education.</P>
      <P>In some cases, psychological assessments take far too long to obtain, which is unfair on the children involved who may have to wait for up to two years for such assessments. While it may not be much in a lifetime, two years in the primary or secondary school cycle is a long time.</P>
      <P>The method of expelling children from schools must be re-examined. I am aware of one case where a primary school pupil assaulted nurses in the local hospital&rsquo;s accident and emergency unit. He also caused havoc around the town. His own mother brought him to the Garda station at the age of 12 because he was so drunk. It proved to be next to impossible to get him expelled from primary school, where he terrified the teacher and students. That should not be allowed to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to speak on the motion relating to special needs. The motion states that real progress has been made, particularly in the <Col N="1854"/>past five or six years. When we examine the opportunities currently available to children with special needs to move into mainstream education, we can see that is the case. They can be integrated into schools and become involved both at primary and secondary level. Anyone who has had children attending school over the past ten or 12 years can see this. I speak from personal experience having seen a child pass through the system from junior infants class to fifth year in secondary school, without having received any additional support. That journey could not have happened but for the exceptional accommodation of the headmistress at that school who did whatever she could without receiving any additional resources. That child&rsquo;s journey proved to be a huge success story for the education system. It has been a journey of many challenges with despair at times, in addition to great joy.</P>
      <P>It is instructive to see a child who has gone through normal education in the first and second years of primary school. At first, remedial teachers were employed and, as time went on, additional hours were provided with resource teachers. Later, there was more and more integration and co-operation between the service providers in the disability area, which were the Brothers of Charity, in addition to social workers, speech therapists, remedial and resource teachers and the school&rsquo;s headmistress.</P>
      <P>The stage comes when it is time to move from the primary school model to the secondary cycle. Within the mainstream education system, teachers and school principals were identified who were prepared to take a chance by moving ahead of the catch-up system that has been undertaken in the past couple of years. It is great to see the difference for children who are attending primary school now. From junior infants onwards, assistance is provided immediately, although it may not be enough. I am not going to claim that the system is perfect because it is not. There are challenges but they must be examined in the context of what is happening daily in schools around the country. More and more children have opportunities due to the commitment of principals, teachers, parents, officials and other professionals in the disability sector.</P>
      <P>When people who have a special needs relative with Down&rsquo;s syndrome or another disability, perhaps aged 35 or 40, they look at similar 18 or 19 years olds and say, &ldquo;Look at the difference. Look at the life they have available to them. If only it had been like that for us 30 years ago&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I realise the challenges that parents of special needs children will face but I also know how different it is for them and how much more opportunities their children will have. The Minister must take on board what is happening in the classroom, however. Hopefully, special educational needs organisers throughout the country will be able to address the matter. Teachers have to face such issues in the classroom but many of them have not been trained how to deal with aspects of disability. They do not know, for example, how to deal with one or two children who have a special set of needs. Special needs assistants may be available to those children. <Col N="1855"/>Where there is a refugee population, children may have language difficulties because their first language is not English. In fact, they may not be able to speak English at all. A teacher facing a class of 20 or 25 children, depending on the area, will have to face a whole spectrum of challenges every day. Teachers need more support in order to be able to play a leadership role in the classroom. They also need guidance and direction from the Department to be able to do so.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>While improvements have occurred, the greatest difficulties facing parents of children starting school is that they are not aware of what services are available. They have to know what they can or cannot do and what they can expect. In addition to the challenge of bringing up a child with special needs, there is the additional challenge of wondering whether one has to fight the system. We should not have to fight for everything we want. I appeal to the Minister and to the Department in that respect. We should know what is available and should not have to waste energy in demanding such things, which should be available by right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>As regards disadvantage, we are missing out on the holistic approach to dealing with the family issue of children with disadvantage. Unruly children may be dealt with in school, but their parents face the same challenges at home. Special funding is required, perhaps through a pilot scheme, to deal with the supports necessary for parents with children in school who have particular needs. We should have a focus group that would work with such parents by taking a holistic approach.</P>

      <P>The speakers on the Opposition side, particularly those in Fine Gael, tended to rubbish this model as if it had no merits. I will go back briefly and carefully over some of the merits even though I realise it is an imperfect model.I acknowledge that the Minister has already started a review of this matter in consultation with some of the partners in education, and has set down a challenge to the partners to bring forward the result as soon as possible so that schools will know where they stand.</P>

	<P>The corollary was that the system would reduce the need for individual applications and for supporting psychological assessment, a matter which I recognise is vexed and not yet fully resolved.

My comments are directed at the Minister, Deputy Martin, in terms of his role in job creation in County Clare.</P>
      <P>We all learned with sadness in the past few days that Microsemi, an excellent employer on the Gort Road industrial estate in Ennis, had announced that it would no longer be able to sustain the level of production jobs it had in place. However, it indicated it would continue with its sales and marketing efforts from a European perspective and would consolidate its efforts based on production capacity in other plants and jurisdictions.</P>
      <P>This was particularly bad news for Ennis at this time. Over the past years we have seen a number of companies go out of business in the region and in no real way have we seen replacement jobs in line with the growth in the population. The Minister of State knows this since he has been involved for much longer than me in terms of encouraging businesses to remain or locate in the area, something it is important to continue. Ennis is growing at a rapid rate and in order that it is not left behind as a dormitory town it is critical that the Minister puts in place an action plan coordinating the efforts of the IDA Ireland, Shannon Development and Enterprise Ireland. This will ensure that people who have decided to live in the area can work in their own communities and that their area does not become part of a commuter town. It is critical that we consider whatever measures can be put in place.</P>
      <P>I welcome the announcement today by the Minister of State regarding developments at Shannon and a potential 1,500 jobs in the not too distant future. However, we need to concentrate our efforts on the town of Ennis. The fact that the town does not have a large rate base to develop services and facilities a growing town the size of Ennis needs has an impact on development and <Col N="1860"/>job creation. The Minister of State is well aware of this. It is important that the Minister puts in place the necessary forum to ensure we advance this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Dooley for giving me the opportunity to make a brief intervention with regard to this industry. I regret that we must raise this matter, but unfortunately Microsemi has given notice of its intention to lay off most of its workers.</P>
      <P>It intends to retain a limited presence in Ennis, which is welcome. Perhaps in the next year or so, following reorganisation, it might be possible to retain a number of jobs at the plant. The company had not decided to leave immediately. The 2002 census highlights success in the Ennis area with total employment at 9,700 compared with 6,700 in 1996. Shannon Development has worked hard with other development agencies and a new 46,000 sq. ft. high-tech park has been built in the grounds of Our Lady&rsquo;s. A plant has been opened on the Quin-Doora road and an industrial estate is planned on the Kilrush road. A number of new commercial developments are taking place in the town.</P>
      <P>I deplore the comments made by public representatives last weekend who stated it was time to close the gates of the Gort road industrial estate, on which Microsemi is sited. That would mean the gates would be closed on more than 200 people employed on the estate. Most of the lots on the industrial estate are occupied and it is regrettable that people have engaged in such a hysterical reaction to this closure and have not put forward positive solutions to attract industry to Ennis. Gates are opening, not closing, around Ennis. I wish the Minister of State well in his new office and we are hopeful further gates will be opened. It is not our intention to close gates in Ennis. These comments were made by people who ran in the last election and proclaimed they would solve all Ennis&rsquo;s problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators for raising this matter on the Adjournment, particularly for the positive and constructive manner in which they presented their case. I was disappointed to hear of the recent decision, announced on 4 April 2005, by Microsemi Corporation to cease production at its Ennis-based manufacturing facility. Microsemi employs 44 permanent and 87 temporary staff in manufacturing in Ennis. These positions will be phased out over a 12 to 18 month period. The European sales and marketing team of 15 staff, which is also based in Ennis, is not affected by this decision.</P>
      <P>The job losses come as a result of the company&rsquo;s decision to consolidate production in its US facilities, as these have surplus capacity. The company will provide a redundancy package and outplacement services for the individuals affected by the closure. The company considers that the <Col N="1861"/>closure of the Irish manufacturing operation is necessary to consolidate manufacturing for the overall Microsemi group. It regards this step as necessary for the group&rsquo;s worldwide manufacturing strategy and its ongoing competitiveness. The decision to absorb Irish manufacturing output into the US operation, where there is surplus capacity, in no way reflects on the performance and commitment of the Ennis workforce. I have offered to travel to Scottsdale, Arizona, should reorganisation take place along the lines mentioned by Senator Daly.</P>
      <P>Finding alternative employment for the workers affected is a priority for F&Aacute;S and the State development agencies. F&Aacute;S has been in contact with the company to offer its full range of support services. However, it has been advised by the company that it is too soon to consider availing of F&Aacute;S services and that it would be more appropriate later in the year.</P>
      <P>A meeting of Industry Ennis took place earlier to discuss the employment situation in Ennis. Industry Ennis was formed to capitalise on the Ennis information age town investment and to act as a one-stop shop for Irish industry, foreign direct investment and Irish mobile investment. The group&rsquo;s primary function is to support and, where possible, augment the services of the development agencies, including Shannon Development, IDA Ireland and Clare County Enterprise Board. The outcome of the meeting was that the Industry Ennis group will develop a strategy to address the employment situation in Ennis. This will build on the group&rsquo;s current work with the State agencies in continuing to promote Ennis through initiatives such as the Clare consul programme, which targets successful business people, mainly in Dublin, with Clare connections, as well as working with foreign direct investment itineraries.</P>
      <P>Shannon Development and IDA Ireland are committed to the development of the mid-west region, including County Clare and Ennis, and are promoting them for foreign investment. Their efforts are being hampered and undermined by comments such as those mentioned by Senator Daly and the description of Ennis as &ldquo;a ghost town&rdquo;. It is the fastest growing town in the west but competitors under consideration of new foreign direct investment do not know that and when they read descriptions of Ennis in <i>The Irish Times</i> as &ldquo;a ghost town&rdquo;, it seriously undermines the chances of attracting new industry.</P>
      <P>Last year was successful for the mid-west with investment decisions by Cook Incorporated and Power-One Ireland Limited in Limerick and Organic Lens in Ennis, representing significant additions to their existing operations. In addition, Monster Cable announced a greenfield project for Ennis. Organic Lens will implement a &euro;6.5 million investment for the development of its manufacturing operations in Ennis, which will create 100 jobs. Monster Cable has announced its intention to establish a shared services centre in Ennis, which will create 50 jobs.</P><Col N="1862"/>
      <P>A central goal of IDA Ireland is the achievement of balanced regional development. The national spatial strategy provides a framework for the achievement of this goal through the prioritisation of development and investment in the linked gateway of Limerick-Shannon and the hub location of Ennis to allow foreign direct investment needs to be met. The sectoral emphasis for IDA Ireland in the mid-west is on attracting new knowledge intensive projects in information communications and technology, international services, medical technologies and life sciences. Between 2001 and 2004, IDA Ireland companies in the mid-west committed to research and development projects worth &euro;37 million.</P>
      <P>The agency works closely with the local educational infrastructure in the University of Limerick and Limerick Institute of Technology to foster collaboration between industry and academia with a focus on research and development and emerging new business sectors, for example, digital media and e-learning. In the Shannon region overall, Shannon Development has invested more than &euro;40 million in developing the Shannon Development knowledge network at five locations. Four of these are under way.</P>
      <P>Shannon Development has recently completed construction of phase one of the fifth knowledge network location, the information age park in Ennis, with an overall investment of approximately &euro;2.5 million in land, infrastructure and buildings. The park provides 46,000 sq. ft. of world class incubation, expansion and own door office accommodation in an urban park environment on the outskirts of Ennis. This investment marks the first phase of a significant development for Ennis. It is expected that the park will attract continued investment by both private and public sectors over the coming years. Shannon Development&rsquo;s regional office for Clare will relocate to the information age park Ennis as part of the development. The park will become one of the Shannon region&rsquo;s premier locations for working and living, combining state-of-the-art business services and connectivity with thriving local town facilities and access the finest leisure facilities. A total of &euro;110 million will be invested between the public and private sectors in the new park over the next 15 years. The park will cater for office-based knowledge driven activity such as research, software development, back-office type activities and headquarter facilities.</P>
      <P>This initiative is a visible demonstration that the Government is committed to delivering balanced regional development in Ireland and the launch of the information age park Ennis provides a good illustration of County Clare&rsquo;s participation in that process. The park will help to spread development in Clare from the traditionally strong focus points of the airport and the Shannon free zone. I acknowledge Senator Dooley&rsquo;s reference to the launch earlier of a new centre, which will be hugely successful and will be of enormous benefit to Ennis and Clare. I am satisfied that the State development agencies con<Col N="1863"/>tinue to market Ennis and County Clare for investment and will make every effort to secure alternative employment for the staff affected by the job losses at Microsemi.</P>

    <Title>Port Development.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. Our ports are an essential element of our economic infrastructure, as they process 99% of the island&rsquo;s foreign trade. They are critical points not only for transport but also for the entire economy. Our economy is dependent largely on the proper operation of our ports. They operate at the interface between two different modes of transports. A crucial role of ports is to facilitate the movement of goods from sea to road and rail transport. Provision of adequate and efficient capacity into the future is, and must be, a crucial strategic Government objective.</P>
      <P>Dublin is the most critical of all ports. It is estimated Dublin Port will handle cargo worth at least &euro;45 billion this year. This is almost 35% of GNP. The port is estimated to support 280,000 full-time jobs and to cater for 500 million tourists with an estimated spend of &euro;380 million supporting another 5,500 full-time jobs. Irish ports are crucial with Dublin Port being the most crucial. The Department&rsquo;s ports policy states, &ldquo;Recent capacity requirement predictions point to a lower than previously anticipated shortfall&rdquo;. However, the Irish Exporters Association disagrees fundamentally with this assessment and I am gravely concerned about this.</P>
      <P>It must be asked if the capacity predictions on which we are basing our plans are accurate. Are we putting the operation of critical economic infrastructure at risk? I refer the Cathaoirleach to the review of Dublin Port capacity launched by the Irish Exporters Association only yesterday. It was carried out by consultants and sends a clear message that Ireland&rsquo;s national ports are facing a capacity crisis. Without getting too technical, the review points out that load-on, load-off, or lo-lo capacity will expire in autumn 2006, roll-on, roll-off, or ro-ro capacity will expire by summer 2008 while bulk liquid capacity will run out by autumn 2006.</P>
      <P>I do not presume that I have to labour the point beyond that. Those indications must be investigated by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the Department of Transport as a matter of urgency. All the time, vessels are increasing in size and capacity, and space for development is not infinite. There is also a serious shortage of berthing space. That delays lo-lo arrivals, generating a further estimated cost of &euro;750 million annually. All the while there is a 21-hectare site adjacent to Dublin Port waiting to be developed. The Irish Exporters Association report suggests that development of that site would solve the capacity issues at Dublin Port at a cost of only &euro;35 million. <Col N="1864"/>It is therefore also seen as a cost-effective solution.</P>
      <P>Let us be honest about why that is not happening. It appears that permission to develop the site is an issue. Such development requires foreshore approval. According to the Planning Acts, development includes reclamation of any land on the foreshore. Getting that approval seems to be the most difficult aspect. A decision to grant a licence to develop the 21-hectare site is, as far as I understand, being bounced between the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and Dublin City Council. If that is the case, it must stop immediately. Responsibility must be accepted and a decision taken.</P>
      <P>If it is agreed that development of the site in question represents the best and most cost-effective method of meeting the predicted capacity crisis, the Minister must make the decision. At least the Irish Exporters&rsquo; Association and the Department agree on one thing, namely, that the time for developing facilities to meet capacity will be very long. The programme for Government states that, &ldquo;We will implement an integrated transport policy, designed as far as possible to overcome existing delays, bottlenecks and congestion&rdquo;. It may well be that Dublin Port does not represent an existing bottleneck, but if the review carried out by the Irish Exporters&rsquo; Association is correct, it appears that as an economy we might be facing an almighty bottleneck in trade on and off this island. We must investigate this as a matter of national importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Morrissey for raising this important issue on the Adjournment and for giving me the opportunity to outline the Government&rsquo;s position on port capacity.</P>
      <P>Of course, ports are vitally important to us. As was stated, 99% of our exports and imports go through our ports, and we are very much victims of our own success. The reason that we require the additional capacity, which I recognised on my appointment to the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, is the growth in the economy. It is as a result of that growth that we now find ourselves in this position. However, we can deal with that and implement the programme for Government. I received a request to meet the Irish Exporters Association over the weekend or on Monday. I did not have the chance to reply, but I will be taking the first opportunity to discuss the issues that have arisen as a result of the report commissioned by it.</P>
      <P>I launched the Government&rsquo;s ports policy statement in January 2005. In that, I addressed, among other matters, the issue of further seaport capacity requirements for the country. The background is that, in 1998 and 2000, and again in 2004, my Department commissioned consultants to prepare an inventory of the current and projected future capacity of our commercial ports. <Col N="1865"/>The most recent study, which takes into account economic growth and projections and examined capacity up to 2014, found that, while there were likely to be surpluses of capacity at certain ports, there would also be significant shortfalls at some of the major ports, particularly regarding unitised trade. The ports where we see difficulties regarding capacity include Dublin, which is the focus of Senator Morrissey&rsquo;s Adjournment matter.</P>
      <P>Looking ahead to 2014, the study found that projected traffic will increase by almost 16 million tonnes, some 35% more than the tonnage handled in 2003, and that there would be a shortfall in capacity of approximately 12 million tonnes overall, of which some 4.4 million tonnes is unitised trade, unless action is taken. We will address that. The Department recognises that such studies are necessarily an inexact science. However, we must be guided by the projections, whose implications will need to be checked against the experiences of the individual ports.</P>
      <P>When I launched the statement, I said that one of the key challenges ahead was the timely provision of adequate port capacity. I noted that the internal resources of our commercial ports are not generally sufficient to fund large-scale infrastructural projects. As I said, this represents a significant challenge in view of the need for additional capacity at our ports in coming years, particularly to cater for the growth in unitised trade. At that time I said that the Department would consult the commercial ports concerned to determine their view of port capacity and how they intend to deal with the projected capacity requirement. One of the first meetings that I had at national level was with the chairpersons and the chief executives of all the ports. We met in Tramore, and I very quickly familiarised myself with the difficulties, which, as I said, are part of our success story.</P>
      <P>As an initial step, the Department has sought information from all the ports that handle unit-load cargoes on key projects identified by them as essential to deal with anticipated capacity deficiencies to 2014 and beyond and whether the ports see those being funded from their own resources or in partnership with the private sector. The new policy framework encourages all port stakeholders to address capacity provision. I understand that a response from the Dublin Port Company in respect of that request for information will be with the Department shortly. I clarify that as residual financier the State would support capacity provision &mdash; though only if proven essential to progress &mdash; in the form of identified high-quality, self-sustaining projects. Clearly, not all proposals are likely to succeed. On the other hand, some may well be capable of proceeding without any Exchequer financing role.</P>
      <P>As indicated in the statement, it is intended to prioritise a range of projects catering for unitised traffic at our commercial ports from an overall national and regional economic perspective as opposed to the perceived requirements of indi<Col N="1866"/>vidual ports. To that end, the Department will be procuring expert and independent assistance from consultants so that it can refine the criteria to be used for project evaluation, drawing up a uniform template for submission of detailed project proposals and then evaluating and ranking the projects submitted as a basis for the Department&rsquo;s recommendation to the Government.</P>
      <P>Proposals for capacity provision for unitised trade at the ports concerned, including Dublin, Cork and Drogheda, will be considered as part of the process that I have outlined. The Dublin Port Company applied in March 2002 for ministerial consent to the reclamation of 21 hectares of foreshore in Dublin Bay. As private ownership was claimed, the application was made in accordance with the provisions of sections 10 and 13 of the Foreshore Act 1933. Ministerial powers regarding consideration of the application are more restricted where privately owned foreshore, as distinct from State-owned foreshore, is involved. The application was accompanied by an environmental impact statement that the Department had considered by independent consultants.</P>
      <P>A number of issues arose about the adequacy of the environmental impact statement and further information was later supplied by consultants for Dublin Port Company. The issues of proof of ownership of the foreshore in question which arose in the meantime are being actively examined by the State&rsquo;s legal services, acting on behalf of the Department, as well the legal advisors for Dublin Port Company.</P>
      <P>The proposed development will require planning permission. Dublin Port Company has repeatedly been advised that the necessary consent should be obtained under the planning process before the foreshore aspect is dealt with. That is in accordance with normal practice when a development wholly or partly on the foreshore requires planning permission.</P>
      <P>Dublin City Council, which is the area&rsquo;s appropriate planning authority, has been advised that there is no ministerial objection to the making of a planning application for the proposed development. It has referred to the Dublin city development plan, which states that &ldquo;it is an objective of Dublin City Council to prepare a plan for that part of Dublin Bay, from and including North Bull Island and the South Wall and up to and including Sandymount, Merrion Strand and Booterstown and also concentrated on the Port Area&rdquo;. The council also intends to establish the guidelines for the sustainable development and use of Dublin Bay, its environs and foreshore. I understand that any change arising from the plan should be incorporated into the city development plan by way of variation. The council has advised that &ldquo;planning applications for foreshore development shall be deemed premature pending the preparation of the plan&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage <Col N="1867"/>and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, to the House. I would like to raise a simple and clear-cut matter. I ask the Government to review the operation by the various local authorities of the disabled persons grant scheme. I do not refer to Carlow County Council in particular, because it operates a very good scheme under which category A cases are generally dealt with in less than a year. I understand from my colleagues that schemes in other parts of the country are not organised as well.</P>
      <P>If an elderly person who has had a stroke, for example, or is suffering from another illness needs to install a downstairs toilet, shower or bedroom, he or she has to apply to his or her local authority to be considered under the disabled persons grant scheme. The matter is then referred to the person&rsquo;s doctor and the local section of the Health Service Executive, before being considered again by the local authority, which refers it to an occupational therapist. If the person&rsquo;s application is successful, having been considered by the local authority for the final time, he or she is asked to identify what needs to be done. The matter is then referred to the local authority&rsquo;s clerk of works to be costed. If the person succeeds at that stage, his or her application is finally approved.</P>
      <P>The procedure I have outlined is followed quite quickly in Carlow County Council. I commend the staff of the council for reducing the waiting time for the report of the occupational therapist to approximately one month. My colleagues in other local authority areas have informed me that people in some areas have to wait for up to a year for a report. The service provided by Carlow County Council has been greatly enhanced by its decision to avail of the newly privatised occupational therapy service. I am not sure whether other local authorities adopt a similar approach.</P>
      <P>The delays in the grant scheme are causing concern for many people. I am aware of a case in a county other than County Carlow that has taken almost two years to progress. The people in question have been waiting for almost five months for the local section of the Health Service Executive to get back to them.</P>
      <P>I have raised this matter to try to focus the Minister of State&rsquo;s mind on the grant scheme in question. I ask him to organise a review of the scheme. He should try to improve it further by learning from the success of the Carlow experience. We need to facilitate those whose houses need to be renovated so that they can enjoy a decent quality of life.</P>
      <P>Why does the funding provided by the Department of Health and Children to local authorities meet just two thirds of the cost of the renovations? As far as I know, local authorities have to meet the shortfall in central funding by paying for one third of the cost of the renovations. Would it not make more sense for the Department to provide a full grant and allow the local authority to do the rest of the work? I understand <Col N="1868"/>that some local authorities, including one in Cork, are not spending the money they have been allocated because of the requirement to meet the shortfall.</P>
      <P>The operation of the disabled persons grant scheme needs to be examined. Perhaps the manner in which it is being operated in Carlow can be used as an example of best practice, to avoid some of the problems I have mentioned. It is totally unsatisfactory for all concerned that people should have to crawl upstairs on their hands and knees because the necessary renovation works have not been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Browne for giving me the opportunity to speak about the disabled persons grant scheme. He will be glad to learn that a review of the scheme is well advanced in my Department. The grant scheme serves a useful purpose in helping to meet the housing needs of disabled persons. The grant is available for the provision of additional accommodation or the carrying out of adaptation works which, in the opinion of the local authority where the house is located, are reasonably necessary to make the house more suitable for a disabled member of the household.</P>
      <P>The operation of the grant scheme at local level is a matter for the local authorities. I accept the Senator&rsquo;s point that some local authorities are more efficient than others in their operation of the scheme. Part of the problem is that some authorities will not meet one third of the cost of renovation works as they are obliged to do. It is most unfair on those who need renovated facilities that some local authorities are prepared to drag out the scheme.</P>
      <P>The framework for the operation of the scheme is laid down in regulations. It is designed, as far as practicable, to give an appropriate degree of flexibility to local authorities. One of the strengths of the scheme is that the regulations are framed in a manner that gives maximum flexibility to local authorities. That also makes it more difficult to manage, however, and I accept that it leads to variations in performance standards among local authorities. The Department would receive complaints if it were to make all the rules, thereby telling local authorities what they can do, how they can do it and when they can do it. It believes in giving as much power as possible to local authorities, which have housing as one of their main functions.</P>
      <P>Demand for assistance under the scheme has increased enormously in recent years, mainly as a consequence of the significant improvements the Government has made to it. The increase in the grant to its present level of &euro;20,320 in 2001 led to significantly increased activity under the scheme, as did the increase to 90% of the percentage of the cost payable. I listened with interest to Senator Browne&rsquo;s suggestion that the Department should pay 100% of the cost of renovation <Col N="1869"/>works, but I do not agree with such a proposal because it would lead to demand going through the roof. The rate of recoupment to local authorities has increased from half of the cost before 2001 to two thirds of the cost now. A disabled persons new house grant of up to a maximum of &euro;12,700 has also been introduced.</P>
      <P>The number of grants paid increased significantly over five years, from 2,455 in 1998 to 5,739 in 2003. Expenditure on the grants in that period totalled over &euro;200 million and over 25,000 grants were paid. That over 25,000 projects were completed means that a large number of disabled persons and their families were able to remain in their homes, which is important. Such people now enjoy improved housing conditions which many of them would not otherwise have been able to afford.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the unexpected increase in applications in recent years has posed problems for the local authorities which are administering the scheme. This has led to delays in approval and payment, not always related to the level of funding available. The majority of authorities have reviewed their schemes in recent years to streamline their operation. The introduction of systems of medical prioritisation, standardisation of costs and improved arrangements for the use of occupational therapists have enabled the authorities to manage the schemes more efficiently and to tackle the backlog of applications.</P>
      <P>The Department does not insist on an occupational therapist&rsquo;s report, although it is recommended if major renovations are being undertaken and it can be worthwhile if someone has an illness that may get worse. Delays can occur while waiting for reports for genuine reasons but sometimes a report is demanded when it is not necessary to delay people. A number of local authorities hire an occupational therapist rather than waiting for the health board. There is nothing wrong with that as it is more efficient and keeps the system moving instead of fobbing it off to a health board in the hope that it will take nine months to come back. Some applicants have been delayed unnecessarily this way over the years.</P>
      <P>A combined capital allocation of &euro;70 million is being made to local authorities for the payment of the disabled person&rsquo;s and essential repair grant schemes this year. Individual allocations, which will notify to local authorities soon, will be based on their requirements as notified to my Department. Last year, Cork County Council requested &euro;8 million and we allocated 90% of that figure. In November, however, the council told us it only needs &euro;2.75 million because it had not provided its own third. It deprived other counties of that money. There is no point in telling someone in November to go ahead with the disabled person&rsquo;s scheme. Local authorities must give approval early in the year so clients can get the builder in.</P>
      <P>Another local authority divided up its allocation by the number of applications it would approve and each quarter authorised a certain number of jobs. What is he point of telling some<Col N="1870"/>one in October that he or she can do a job when it will not be completed by the end of the year? I hope Cork County Council has budgeted for its third this year. That is the only way to do it. Last year that local authority told us it wanted &euro;8 million and we gave it 90% of the figure. However, in November it told us it could not use it. It is ridiculous.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for authorities to decide on the level that will be provided for the disabled person&rsquo;s grant scheme from within the combined total. One or two counties do not bother with the essential repairs grant scheme, although it is valuable. It is up to the local authorities, however, to decide how they divide the funding.</P>
      <P>While two thirds of expenditure on the scheme is recouped from the Department, authorities are required to fund the remaining one third from their own revenue sources with amounts provided for that purpose in their annual estimates.</P>
      <P>The Government is aware of the importance of the disabled person&rsquo;s grant scheme in meeting the accommodation needs of disabled persons in the community. The focussing of the scheme on real needs, both financial and accommodation-related, and its operation by local authorities in an efficient manner, will be critical in ensuring it achieves its aim. The outcome of the review of the operation of the scheme that is under way will significantly contribute to this achievement. Local authorities will, however, have to provide one third of the grant.</P>
      <P>We are looking at standard costing, occupational therapists, speeding matters up and deciding if the grant should be related to means or medical need. We are introducing those measures that efficient local authorities have already put in place to standardise the operation of the scheme. We have reviewed the scheme and it has probably worked to the benefit of some but not others. We have all heard the urban legend about a lady who sold her house for &euro;700,000 and moved in with her solicitor&rsquo;s son, who then applied for a grant to build an extension for the mother or the grandmother and qualified for it under the present scheme. If a person is poor and on a pension or has sold an existing property and moved in with a family member, he or she still qualifies under the existing scheme. In some cases they build very fancy extensions to their homes. That is fine if the house remains in the family for years to come but if the house is sold within three years because the grandmother has died, it is arguable that there should be a claw back. It is all taxpayers&rsquo; money. It is a case of helping those in genuine need while not allowing the scheme to be milked. We are looking at this issue and hope to come to a conclusion soon.</P>

	<P>When will the review be completed? In future we will not need these grants because modern buildings include downstairs toilets and similar facilities. The problems with the houses built in the 1950s and 1960s are coming back to haunt us. It is not a long-term prob<Col N="1871"/>lem. I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply and urge the Department to focus on this for the next few years to clear the backlog. In 20 years this will be irrelevant as a result of modern building standards.</P>

	<P>I hope the Senator is right. There are building regulations in place but they may not cover every case. There are regulations for door width and fewer steps but higher density <Col N="1872"/>housing could cause difficulties for disabled people in future. Even higher density developments, however, are built with full life living in mind.</P>
      <P>The review is more or less complete, it must be approved by certain people and sometimes that can take time. Most of the work is done and we will make the allocations soon. We may combine the two.</P>
