    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the worldwide web. The Order of Business is Nos. 1 and 2. No. 1 is statements on the upcoming World Trade Organisation negotiations concerning agriculture, to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business and conclude not later than 1 p.m. The contribution of each spokesperson will be 15 minutes and the contributions of other Members will be ten minutes each. Members may share their time if they wish. The Minister will be called upon not later than five minutes before the conclusion of statements; and No. 2, a motion that Seanad &Eacute;ireann notes the Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance, to be taken at 5 p.m. until 7 p.m. Spokespersons will have ten minutes each and other Members will have seven minutes each. The Minister will be called upon to reply not later than five minutes before the conclusion of the motion. There will be an extended sos from 1.30 p.m. to 5 p.m. due to the Budget Statement in the Lower House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>What Bills does the Leader intend to put before the House next week, which is our last week in this session, and what Bills does she intend to have passed by this House by the Christmas recess?</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, the British Government published a detailed guideline through the Northern Ireland Office concerning the proposed restorative justice schemes to be introduced in Northern <Col N="235"/>Ireland. There are already 17 schemes but a number of new schemes are proposed.</P>
      <P>Most people accept that the notion of restorative justice is a useful way of connecting more disadvantaged communities with the police but I question the way in which it is being introduced in Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland is the last place in the world one would want to introduce community restorative justice schemes given the scale of paramilitarism on both sides over the past 40 years.</P>
      <P>What is our Government&rsquo;s position on this issue? While it is a strand one issue and an internal Northern Ireland matter, the Government should make it known that paramilitaries and former paramilitaries cannot be allowed to mete out justice in their own communities, particularly when one of the guidelines states there is to be no connection between the PSNI and the new schemes. It sets a dangerous precedent.</P>
      <P>The SDLP is of the view that this is another concession given by the British Government to Sinn F&eacute;in. Our Government must make its views on this matter known as there are concerns. It is ultimately the view of all Members of this House that those who are not currently signed up to the new policing dispensation must do so and support the PSNI in order that there will be no future need for community restorative justice schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The House might note a happy photograph in today&rsquo;s main newspapers. It is of two happy Members of the Oireachtas, one of whom, a Member of this House, Senator John Hanafin, was being presented with his masters degree in the company of his sister, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin. We should extend our congratulations to the Member of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left"><?oasys _dc14- ?>On a more negative note regarding the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, there is a woman from the Morning Star Mother and Baby Home who has been outside the gates for the past number of weeks. Others have raised this issue. I do not wish to elaborate because it is not appropriate to discuss it on the Order of Business. However, that woman has suffered. I am one of those who have written to the Minister. There seems to be some difficulty in dealing with the issue. A woman has suffered, yet it cannot be dealt with because of the legislation or regulations. We should ask the Minister why she cannot amend the legislation or regulations to allow the case to be dealt with. Coming up to Christmas, it is something we might think about doing. I am not fingering the Minister on this because I recognise that there are legal and regulatory difficulties, but there are none that we could not address.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
      <P>I would not want to set myself up as any kind of moral arbiter or to dance on somebody else&rsquo;s <Col N="236"/>grave, but the situation of the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Callely, has gone beyond a joke. I will not speak about him but will the Government explain what exactly is going on here? We need to know if there are issues which are of concern to us. Will this continue much longer? Are there other things happening? Matters have been reported&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We have no control over that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is entitled to have the truth disclosed and we are entitled to know the truth. I will not go any further than that. We cannot merely ignore the fact that everybody else is talking about it. We need to get clarification on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have never seen a Government plan begin to fall apart so quickly as Transport 21. This morning, as I was boarding the train in Cork, I was presented with a copy of Irish Rail&rsquo;s new timetable for the next 12 months from Cork, which shows no changes from the previous 12 months in spite of the much trumpeted new fast trains every hour. In fact, a few of them are slightly slower. It has only taken a month for Transport 21 to begin to fall apart. I congratulate the Government; it must be a first.</P>
      <P>In the other House yesterday the Taoiseach stated he would not allow this State to be used to facilitate torture. While there is an all-party group examining this, there are issues that need to be addressed. Does slapping somebody with the aim of causing pain and triggering fear constitute torture? Does leaving somebody standing for 40 hours bolted to the floor constitute torture? Does leaving somebody to stand naked in a cell in nearly 50&deg; Celsius constitute torture? Does water-boarding constitute torture? When we took the British Government to the European Court of Human Rights we said those matters were torture. The European Court of Human Rights found differently. The matters to which I refer come from an ABC News report of 18 November on two CIA operatives describing what the CIA currently does. I want the Government to make clear whether it believes the matters I described constitute torture because to most of us they do.</P>
      <P>On the question of the use of aeroplanes by the US Government, the Government stated they are civilian planes and therefore did not need permission to land here. Is it the Government&rsquo;s position that if the private jet of a Columbian drug baron landed in Shannon we would say that it is only a civilian plane and we can do nothing about it? If the private plane of a Mafia boss, whom we suspected of being involved in international drug dealing, landed in Shannon would we say that it is only a private plane and we can do nothing about it? Does the Government accept that those <Col N="237"/>planes are owned by the CIA? It would be helpful to answer that question &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Everybody else in Europe, everybody else in every other parliament and most of the journalists of North America and Europe accept and know that those aeroplanes are not civilian aeroplanes but are owned by the CIA. It is time we were clear on this, for once and for all, because the US Secretary of State, as Members stated on the Order of Business yesterday, is involved in the most extraordinary stretching of language, and that is being diplomatic.</P>
      <P Just="Left">We need clarity on this. If countries allowed the trains that brought people to Auschwitz to go through their territory empty, they were facilitating Auschwitz. If we allow CIA aeroplanes to go through Shannon empty, we are facilitating the CIA in the practice of torture and there is no room for lack of clarity on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The year 2006 has not yet arrived, let alone gone. There are new trains, which Senator Ryan might have noticed in passing Limerick Junction station this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot have a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am confident that the trains will be operation by this time next year and therefore the Government&rsquo;s promise will be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>A Senator</NameTxt>
	<P>The trains will be late.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We will not have a debate on trains on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not raise the matter first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>There might be a more appropriate time. Senator Mansergh did raise the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Unjust charges that are made about things being in tatters deserve to be answered.</P>
      <P>On the Northern Ireland matter raised by Senator Brian Hayes, there was a short article in the newspapers which got no attention this side of the Border but which marks significant progress in the peace process. It reported that the short-term tours of duty of the British army in Northern Ireland are ceasing, that they will only have units which are stationed there for two years. It is just a small, but quite important, element towards normalisation.</P>
      <P>There are many matters relating to Northern Ireland that we need to debate. A little pragmatism is required when one is looking at restorative justice. We have been trying to help the transition from paramilitarism to a full civil society and full acceptance of policing. My understanding is that the proposal would involve an indirect contact with the police. There is a great deal of politics swirling around this but I would take the view that if the scheme is acceptable and could be <Col N="238"/>stood over by the PSNI, then I am not sure we should be trying to second guess it in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>On the transport theme, stations are losing out in the attempt to speed up the trains to Cork. Charleville Station is losing out on two trains, a late night train and an afternoon train. It is regrettable that a station which is used by many people in west Limerick, north Cork and north Kerry is losing transport. Therefore, when one speaks of this great transport announcement in recent times, it is a bit of a contradiction.</P>
      <P>We have had discussions on many occasions in this House on the theme of justice. We have discussed Operation Anvil and the understandable amount of funding that is provided for resources in Dublin, particularly in combating drug related activities. As we approach Christmas time, when many are concerned about anti-social behaviour within their communities, I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to consider providing sufficient financial resources at weekends, such as overtime payments, to enable the Garda authorities at local level to roster effectively for weekend activities. Many urban communities where there are discos experience a great influx of people at weekends and it is during that period that anti-social activity is likely, particularly after discos close. It is important throughout rural Ireland and in all the urban communities which have these disco activities that there be sufficient Garda resources available to deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, want to ask the Leader about the study on Shannon Airport mentioned yesterday morning. I also wish to raise the concerns of the people in the locality about the future of Shannon Airport and the effect open skies would have on the airport. There are many American multinational companies operating in the Shannon-Limerick region. We want to see the Shannon Airport study broadened to take into account a feasibility study that was requested on the future of the airport and how it can be assisted for the future under the new regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with my colleagues about the importance of examining clearly the question of CIA flights through Shannon Airport. I am grateful that we are in the process of setting up a committee to examine this. It seems clear that we have reached a tipping point, that the world community is now gravely concerned and the attitudes of governments are changing in this regard. Last night, President Bush appeared on television and clearly, openly and brazenly lied. He stated that the United States does not render to states that commit torture. Members know that torture has been performed on suspects who have been rendered to Egypt by the CIA. We know this as a result of a Swedish parliamentary report and there can be no question or doubt about it. Members also know that suspects have been <Col N="239"/>taken to Uzbekistan. The British ambassador resigned his post because the Government of Uzbekistan was boiling people. This is absolutely medieval. It is unbelievable.</P>
      <P>Some of these aeroplanes pass through our airspace. Some of the people involved are not particularly pleasant and Abu Omar, for example, is a person about whom I have deep and grave doubts. Nevertheless, we still must respect international law. We know he was kidnapped in Italy, taken abroad and has now disappeared in Afghanistan. As that aeroplane was refuelled here on its return, we are already complicit in this cycle. This is an extremely dangerous matter. We have the case of Khaled el-Masri who was kidnapped&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Senator cites all these cases, we will be here for a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>If I may, I will finish this point, as some things must be stated and corrected. Khaled el-Masri&rsquo;s experiences reflect our points exactly. He was kidnapped, his clothes were slashed from him and he was drugged by the insertion of a suppository. He was then shackled to an aeroplane and was taken to Afghanistan to be tortured.</P>
      <P>One other point must be corrected. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is incorrect, in that Ireland is entitled to search aeroplanes under the Chicago Convention of 1944. As a final point, while I am flattered that Senator Ryan has repeated a number of my points, he was slightly incorrect in one or two respects. I am glad he used the Auschwitz analogy, which is appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Only one or two things?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>He was incorrect with regard to one or two points. For example, regarding the business of torture, what the Americans are now proposing is infinitely worse than what was found at Castlereagh. The Senator is correct to state that the Government took the British Government to court and got a ruling that three practices, namely, the use of white noise, sleep deprivation and hooding, constituted torture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris, the Order of Business is not the place for this. We cannot have a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hence, Condoleezza Rice also lied yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the issue raised by Senator Norris this morning before this session ends on 16 December. The debate should not be about the war or its duration, but about the lies being told by Condoleezza Rice and the twisting as to what does or does not constitute torture. This is a serious matter. While Members cannot stop the <Col N="240"/>war and cannot get the troops out, we can at least publically expose the torture that is taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has a problem.</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>But on that point&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Leader, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, on giving the House so many opportunities to discuss child care.</P>

	<P>This is not relevant to the Order of Business.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>As far as Transport 21 is concerned, I am also puzzled about these trains. I have seen one of them, which might have been the one to which Senator Mansergh referred, when passing through Limerick Junction.</P>

I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to the House to give Members an update on the audit.</P>
      <P>Several organisations and school boards of management have contacted Members in respect of the lack of sporting facilities for young people. While the nationwide audit was promised, the Minister has not delivered on it. Perhaps he will come before the House to provide a progress report, or to indicate when its results will be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P><Col N="243"/>

	<P>This morning, Senator O&rsquo;Toole raised an important question for Members as legislators. While the item in question will not grab any headlines, I regard it as a fundamental issue for Members. I refer to the unfortunate woman who, in the festive season, sits outside Leinster House, day in and day out. She is cold, wet, embarrassed and feeling hurt.</P>
      <P>I understand the House&rsquo;s procedures, and it is easy for Members to pass in and out and, to a large degree, ignore her. However, surely Members should get down from their pedestals from time to time and stretch out their hands to an unfortunate individual like that, who feels she has no voice and who feels dispossessed.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P Just="Left">She feels that she has been treated badly in the past and is being treated badly at present. Surely, it would be good for the nation&rsquo;s morale to show how humane we can be, despite procedures and legislation. I commend Senator O&rsquo;Toole on having put this matter on the record this morning. I hope that in the next few days, the woman will be taken in, given a cup of tea, treated with humanity and that Members will make an effort to ascertain whether she can be helped in some way. That is why all Members came into the House in the first instance.</P>

	<P>Yesterday, five bombs exploded in Spain. I am pleased to note that no one was injured and that warnings were given by the Basque separatists. However, it is a reminder to us of the 30 years of similar occurrences in this country. Given that Senators Mansergh and Brian Hayes spoke today about the opportunity offered by events in the North, I believe it is time we once again had a debate on Northern Ireland. I am not sure that in the past this House was the right place at the right time to have such a debate but I believe it is now. We should place that debate high on the agenda.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, pathologists in a Cork hospital wrote to their patients to inform them that due to a dispute between the pathologists and the <Col N="244"/>VHI, the VHI would no longer pay the pathologists. Patients have invested for many years in VHI and could be caught by surprise by this development. It might only apply to one hospital and only to the pathologists but the Minister for Health and Children should investigate this to put at rest the minds of those patients who might be concerned about the lack of service that will occur if this matter is not solved immediately.</P>

	<P>The Opposition has been waving at trains rather than putting them on tracks. This has been the best year in County Galway for people who use the train to travel to Galway city. The new service that starts in Athlone at 7 a.m. serves Ballinasloe, Athenry, Attymon, Woodlawn and is in Galway city at 8 a.m. That is a great service and I hope the same commuter service will be provided in other towns.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I have made an early bid.</P>
      <P>A more serious matter is the roll out of breast cancer screening in the north west. Perhaps the Leader would put this issue on the agenda for an urgent debate in the new year. The people of the north west do not know where they stand in this process. On a political level they are being told it will be rolled out in 2007 but, at executive level, they are being told the roll out will start in 2007 and will take two years. That means it will be 2009 before the service is fully implemented. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that all the north west will be covered.</P>
      <P>Over 50,000 women in the east were screened for breast cancer in the 2004 programme. Of that number, 1,687 had to return for assessment and, of those, 309 were diagnosed with breast cancer. With early intervention there is hope of a good outcome. However, the system is inequitable for the people of the north west, who have strong sentiments about this issue and want clarification. Will the Leader arrange an urgent debate in the new year on the breast screening programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a debate tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>Tomorrow we will discuss oncology services. Oncology is a different issue. Breast screening is primary care while oncology is tertiary care. It is important that we have a specific debate on the roll out of cancer screening. My mother-in-law was able to use BreastCheck in Birr, County Offaly, whereas my <Col N="245"/>mother in County Donegal had to seek care and private treatment herself. The reason she knew to do it is that she is a nurse but not every woman in the north west is aware of the problems caused by lumps in their breasts. The system is inequitable and wrong even though everybody pays their taxes. This is a serious matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been quite a discussion about trains this morning. I wish to raise a variation, that is, runaway trains. Will the Leader arrange for a debate early in the next session so Members can get an update on the progress of the various tribunals? I am prompted to ask for this debate by the reports today and the interview conducted yesterday with Deputy Lowry. He was eminently reasonable in pointing out that after nine years he is entitled to finality. It is easier for a Member of this side of the House to say this. We established the tribunals and they have done some good and effective work. However, there have been many reports of investigations completed in the interim. At this stage there must be a focus on completing the work of the tribunals with a degree of urgency. There should be a debate so we can be given an update on the proceedings of each tribunal and, hopefully, inject a focus on terminating what appears to be an interminable process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on decentralisation as a matter of urgency? The information we have been getting can no longer be trusted, especially given the occurrence yesterday and the interference by the Minister of State with responsibility for decentralisation, Deputy Parlon, in his efforts to beef up information that does not represent the truth. It is important that the Minister come to this House to outline the exact situation for the many people whose lives will change as a result of this programme. It is unfair to cause demoralisation for so many civil servants and for groups throughout the country who are hoping for decentralisation to their areas in the absence of other jobs being created there.</P>
      <P>This is particularly the case in Ballinasloe. The NRA is supposed to be relocated there but not one member of staff in the NRA has indicated he or she wishes to go there. The relocation of F&Aacute;S to Birr is obviously in jeopardy as a result. Two years ago this Minister welcomed the concept of decentralisation and welcomed people to &ldquo;Parlon country&rdquo;. Where is Parlon country now? Is it the entire country or just Birr? If it is, the Minister of State is a failure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonScanlon"><NameTxt>Mr. Scanlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with Senator McHugh. BreastCheck is a serious issue in the north west and it was hotly debated last week on local radio and at a Border regional authority meeting. However, we are assured it will be rolled out. The T&aacute;naiste has given us a guarantee that there will be a service in Sligo by 2007. Hopefully, it might <Col N="246"/>happen before then.

A person from each of the groups in the House has come together but we have not yet established a committee. The Clerk Assistant of the Seanad kindly arranged legal advice this morning which told us we have the legal right to set up a committee of the Seanad. We will report on it next week. We are glad of their efforts on our behalf and we thank them.</P>
      <P>Senator Mansergh said there are new trains coming to Cork. He has seen them in Tipperary and, as we said, they are being trotted out. He also said if the restorative justice terms are acceptable to the PSNI we should take them at that value. I was glad to hear that.</P>
      <P>Senator Finucane spoke on justice and drugs and said that extra garda&iacute; should be rostered effectively at weekends if necessary. Senator Brennan wants a debate on the commercial future of Shannon Airport and pointed out that this is a separate issue from the CIA.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senator Norris said that world opinion has turned on the use of aeroplanes by the CIA. He pointed out that the Swedish Parliament and all of the European Parliaments are debating the matter. The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs is inviting the US ambassador to explain himself and his country, but according to today&rsquo;s newspaper he must talk to Washington before he is allowed to come before the committee. Senator Norris also referred to the Chicago Convention which allows government representatives to enter an aeroplane.</P>
      <P>Senator White told us she was brought up not to boast &mdash; good for her &mdash; and that the Taoiseach has told her that her dreams are coming true today. Senator Coghlan is exercised by the trains and asks where they are and why they are not in service.

      <P>Senator Quinn spoke about the ETA bombs in Spain and said the time is right for a debate on Northern Ireland. We made a request regarding such a debate and await a decision. The Senator also referred to the row between the Cork pathologists of a particular hospital and the VHI.</P>

I also remember the story of the woman travelling six or seven hours to get her treatment in Dublin.</P>

	<P>I have noticed an increase in security since my last visit to the Seanad. I thought the Members of this House were all kept in the highest regard. I welcome this opportunity to address the House on the WTO negotiations on agriculture.</P>
      <P>Agriculture continues to make an important economic and social contribution to Irish society, and the outcome of negotiation of the new WTO agreement on agriculture will be crucial for us. Agriculture will have a critical role in determining the final outcome of the round. While agriculture is only one element of a broad trade liberalisation agenda, it has a crucial bearing on the outcome of the negotiations for developed and developing countries alike.</P>
      <P><?oasys _dc14- ?>Negotiations on trade liberalisation, or rounds as they are called, have been with us for many years. Up until 1995, the rules were largely ineffective in controlling trade in agricultural products. However, the current Uruguay Round changed this and agriculture trade is now firmly within the multilateral trading system. The Uruguay Round, which distinguished between the forms of support on the basis of domestic support, export subsidies and market access, and committed member states to specific reductions in each, was a significant first step in disciplining agriculture in a meaningful way. Concurrently, the Uruguay Round struck a balance between agricultural trade liberalisation and member countries&rsquo; desire to pursue legitimate agricultural policy goals.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
      <P>The current negotiations are a continuation of the process of trade liberalisation. The outcome of the current negotiations will determine the levels of protection and support which will apply to the agriculture sector in future and, given that the process of liberalisation will be significantly more advanced, the negotiations represent a real challenge to the future of the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
      <P>The negotiations were launched at the WTO Doha ministerial conference in November 2001 under a very ambitious mandate for trade liberalisation. In so far as agriculture is concerned, the Doha mandate provides for substantial <Col N="251"/>reductions in trade distorting domestic support, with a view to phasing out all forms of export subsidy and substantial improvements in market access. Substantial reductions in tariffs, domestic support and export subsidies are therefore prominent issues in the negotiations. The Doha mandate also provides that non-trade concerns will be taken into account and, most importantly, that special and differential treatment for developing countries will be an integral part of the new agreement.</P>
      <P>The European Union has prepared responsibly for these negotiations and has participated constructively at every stage. Recent reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy were deliberately designed to position the EU to contribute to a successful outcome of the round. The Agenda 2000 reform, which continued the process of reform launched by Commissioner MacSharry in 1992, provided for further cuts in institutional prices with compensation for farmers through direct payments. Further progress in reducing expenditure on domestic support and in reducing trade-distorting payments were made in the radical reform of the mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy agreed in June 2003.</P>
      <P>The decision to decouple payments was a further step in fulfilling the Doha target of substantially reducing trade-distorting domestic supports. Decoupled payments, which by their nature are not linked in any way to production, are considered non-trade distorting by the WTO and qualify for the so-called green box category of payments. The EU move away from coupled payments and the gradual reduction in the more conventional market support measures, such as intervention, have reduced substantially our levels of trade-distorting supports, thereby enabling the EU to face into the negotiation from a position of strength.</P>
      <P>I will briefly review the progress of negotiations since the launch in Doha. Little progress was made until the conclusion of a framework agreement in August 2004. Prior to this, negotiations were marked by failure to achieve consensus, as in, for example, the collapse of the WTO ministerial conference in Canc&uacute;n. The framework agreement in August 2004, which set out the structure and content of the new agreement, represented a significant breakthrough. The intention was that the negotiations would concentrate on the details with a view to concluding the negotiations at the ministerial conference next week in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>It is no secret that I have been dissatisfied with the direction of the negotiations and with the negotiating strategy adopted by the Commission. There has been an insistence by the negotiating partners that they would not engage in meaningful negotiations on other issues until substantive progress has been made in agriculture. As I have stated, the Doha mandate covers a broad trade agenda and it is not acceptable that concessions <Col N="252"/>in agriculture should be a precondition for movement elsewhere. Agriculture is vitally important to the livelihoods of millions of farm families in developed and developing countries and they should not be sacrificed for the sake of an overall WTO agreement. I am disappointed that the same commitment to securing an agreement has not been shown by many of the other developed countries among the negotiating partners who continue to put the EU under pressure on agriculture. In contrast, the efforts made by the EU in preparation for the negotiations and the constructive approach has clearly shown its commitment to achieving an ambitious outcome.</P>
      <P>I have also been concerned that the Commission has been adopting an unnecessarily concessionary approach to the negotiations. The Commission negotiates in the WTO on behalf of the member states on the basis of a mandate which was agreed in the Council of Ministers. The mandate is designed to defend the CAP as it has evolved under successive reforms, including Agenda 2000 and the mid-term review, both of which were agreed with a view to positioning the EU in the WTO negotiations. The mandate aims to protect the European model of agriculture as an economic sector and a basis for sustainable development based on the multifunctional nature of agriculture and the part it plays in the economy, the environment and society generally.</P>
      <P>My concerns are shared by a number of ministerial colleagues in the Council. In recent months, we have been active in indicating concerns to the Commission both in the Council of Ministers and in bilateral contact. Together with colleagues, I have urged the Commissioner to defend vigorously the EU position on agriculture in accordance with the mandate as agreed by the Council. As a result of our efforts, as recently as 18 October, the General Affairs and External Relations Council fully endorsed the negotiating mandate and concluded that CAP reforms are the EU&rsquo;s important contribution to the current negotiations and constitute the limit of the Commission&rsquo;s negotiating mandate.</P>
      <P>Following a further round of negotiations with other key WTO negotiating partners, the Commission tabled an improved EU offer on agriculture on 28 October. I have a number of concerns about this latest offer. First, with regard to domestic support, I believe that the Commission&rsquo;s offer has reached the limit of the EU&rsquo;s bargaining position on trade-distorting payments. Protection of the green box is a fundamental priority for me. The green box is the category of payments which includes the EU&rsquo;s system of decoupled direct payments, which are classified as non-trade-distorting. I am extremely concerned that the Commission&rsquo;s latest statement with regard to defending the EU&rsquo;s direct payments is rather weak. These payments have been exempt from reduction commitments in the past and the Commission&rsquo;s latest statement accepts the notion of a review of the green box qualifying criteria, which <Col N="253"/>is a cause of great concern for me. The protection of the decoupled payments in the green box is a red line which must not be crossed.</P>
      <P>On export subsidies, I feel that the Commission has already gone as far as it possibly can at this stage and it is now vital that the parallel elimination of other forms of export subsidy used by other negotiating partners are adequately addressed. The critical issue in the round, however, is market access. The Commission has offered very high tariff cuts, especially in the higher tariffs, which I believe have the potential to open EU markets to increased competition from lower priced imports. The Commission will be seeking to protect the Internal Market through a sensitive product mechanism, the details of which have to be negotiated. This mechanism will be crucial if EU markets are to be protected adequately.</P>
      <P>While the Commission has pointed out that the latest proposal is the EU&rsquo;s final offer on agriculture, extreme vigilance is needed to protect our interests. The offer is conditional and the Commission points out that the EU is not prepared to contribute to a new agreement at any price. The offer sets out the need for balance in other elements of the negotiations and within the negotiations on agriculture. It also identifies the contributions which others must now make in all areas of the negotiations, including agriculture, if progress towards a final agreement is to be achieved in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The EU offer has been made by the Commission on the basis that it is within the terms of the negotiating mandate. While I have reservations in this regard, the offer has been made and cannot realistically be withdrawn. I am satisfied, however, that the actions which I, and other ministerial colleagues, have taken in recent weeks have succeeded in ensuring no further concessions have been made by the Commission and have clearly demonstrated to the negotiating partners that the EU has made a very substantial contribution to the agriculture negotiations and is not prepared to go further. The reaction of these negotiating partners to our offer has been disappointing, if not predictable, and they have not engaged in a meaningful way in any of the areas of interest to the EU. I firmly believe that we must not allow this reaction to force the EU into any further concessions on agriculture.</P>
      <P>I will comment briefly on the development aspect of the negotiations. Special and differential treatment for developing countries in the form of longer timescales and lower reduction commitments is an integral part of the negotiations. The conventional wisdom is that integration into the world&rsquo;s trading economy will assist developing countries to prosper and address the problems of poverty and disadvantage. While I believe that trade liberalisation is only one element in an overall solution, I am fully committed and supportive of efforts to assist developing countries through the WTO process. The EU already pro<Col N="254"/>vides substantial preferential trade access to developing countries and has made offers for further preferential treatment under the new round which I fully support.</P>
      <P>The treatment of the least-developed countries, in particular, is critical to the success of the Doha Round. The objective of the round of promoting development through trade can be a powerful means of allowing the least-developed countries to expand their trade in agricultural products and so improve their integration into the global economy. However, we must also be realistic and recognise that there is a growing need for differentiation between developing countries. The needs of countries like Brazil, as a major world exporter of agricultural products, are fundamentally different than those of countries in sub-Saharan Africa, which have virtually no access to international trade channels. This reality must be recognised in the next WTO round.</P>
      <P>As we enter the crucial Hong Kong ministerial conference next week, my overall objective remains to ensure that any new WTO agreement can be accommodated within the terms of the 2003 CAP reforms and that further reform will not be required. There should be balance in the negotiations as between the various elements and also as between the pillars of the agriculture negotiations. I do not accept, for example, that there should be an undue focus on market access issues. I will also insist that agriculture must not, under any circumstances, be sacrificed for the sake of an overall agreement. Concessions in agriculture should not be a precondition for movement for progress in other aspects of the negotiations. There are also a number of specific points that I will be pursuing in the negotiations.</P>
      <P>In so far as domestic support is concerned, I want to ensure that the system of decoupled direct payments continues to qualify as non-trade-distorting payments under the green box and so remain exempt from reductions under the new round. As the House is aware, the EU system of direct payments, which are issued by my Department under the single farm payment system for the first time last week, makes a major contribution to farm incomes in Ireland. During the past week, payments amounting to &euro;1.007 billion have been made to 113,000 farmers. My Department is continuing to process the remaining applications with a view to completing all payments. Remarkable progress has been made in introducing the new system and I am determined that all remaining cases will be dealt with as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>On export subsidies, I will be insisting on full parallel treatment of all forms of export subsidy and aim to ensure that the phasing out which has been agreed, is carried out over the longest possible period and in a manner least damaging to our interests. Ireland has substantial exports of milk products and beef to third countries which will require the longest possible elimination period.</P><Col N="255"/>
      <P>On market access, I want to retain the maximum possible level of protection through a combination of tariff cuts and other mechanisms, including the designation of products of particular interest as &ldquo;sensitive products&rdquo;, in order to protect our major EU markets from increased competition from imports from third countries. I am particularly concerned about milk and beef products and, depending on the outcome of the negotiations on tariff cuts, I will decide whether our interests are best served by seeking sensitive products status for those products.</P>
      <P>It now appears that there will be no final conclusion to the negotiations next week and that it may be necessary to hold a further ministerial conference in the first half of 2006 to finalise all of the details. There is no doubt, however, that the negotiations in Hong Kong will be a very significant step on the road to a final agreement. I will attend these negotiations and I can assure the House that I will be taking a very active role in defending the benefits of the CAP to Irish and EU farmers and in pursuing an outcome which is the most beneficial for the Irish agrifood sector.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister back to the House. I am sorry she has concerns about the security in the House but I assure her the glass was not placed between this side and the Minister&rsquo;s side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I was feeling for the Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I can vouch for the Minister&rsquo;s safety today. I thank her for briefing us on this issue which is of major concern particularly to Irish farmers, and for Irish agriculture. There were many words in the Minister&rsquo;s statement but she did not use two words that cause me considerable concern, namely, &ldquo;sugar beet&rdquo;. This indicates the present crisis in agriculture.</P>
      <P>Last year, the malt and barley contracts were taken away which practically eliminated the growing of those crops in my part of the country. This year it is the turn of the sugar industry, on which the State was founded. Towns such as Tuam and Thurles, with which I am familiar, were devastated by the closure of the sugar processing factories. Thurles has not recovered from this blow. Carlow followed quickly last year and this year Mallow is under threat. There is a crisis in agriculture and I am disappointed she did not deal with that issue.</P>
      <P>Next year the pig and poultry sector will bite the dust under the unnecessary bureaucratic regulations imposed by the nitrates directive. The Minister may smile all she likes&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought this was a discussion on the WTO talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I refer to the impact of the Minister&rsquo;s negotiating skills on Irish agriculture. She <Col N="256"/>can see that it is disintegrating all around her. In a few years there will be no farmers. A recent report stated that in 15 years time when the regulations and WTO agreements take effect, only 10,000, or fewer, of the 40,000 present full-time farmers will be in business. Who can blame young farmers running a mile from farms, given the attitude of the Government and the European Union towards farming? This is an agricultural country. Like it or not, we depend on agriculture. The economy depends significantly on agricultural exports.</P>
      <P>There was a saying in my part of the country that when the farm was going well, the country was going well. Towns such as Roscrea and Thurles now know that to their cost because the closure of factories in both towns, as a result of the decline in agriculture, make it clear to everybody there.</P>
      <P>European, and particularly Irish, agriculture is being sacrificed to win benefits for other sectors. It is interesting that the negotiations are spearheaded by the EU Trade Commissioner, Mr. Mandelson, from Britain. Everyone, particularly in Ireland, knows to their cost, that British policy was always to get cheap food. That will continue to be the British policy and Mr. Mandelson will achieve it in these talks.</P>
      <P>It is somewhat ironic that, although his negotiating skills are so questionable, as the Minister admitted in her speech, the first to applaud and congratulate Mr. Mandelson was our Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan"><NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is rubbish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>He congratulated Mr. Mandelson and hailed his work and the great deal he achieved. It makes me wonder. These policies, and the importing of foods from South America, especially Brazil, and other countries, will put the health of future generations here at risk. They will have sub-standard, cheap, untraceable, unlabelled, imported foodstuffs.</P>
      <P>The Minister&rsquo;s text reads that the EU already provides substantial preferential trade &ldquo;assess&rdquo; to developing countries. The Minister is making asses of the Irish farmers. It is a misprint in the text but it is a fortunate one because it describes aptly what is happening. These proposals make an ass of the farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonScanlon"><NameTxt>Mr. Scanlon</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>Mr. Mandelson is rowing back. The Minister accepts that these trade talks in Hong Kong are unlikely to bear fruit and it may be necessary to meet again in mid-summer. Last week in the European Parliament Mr. Mandelson stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">Let me be clear. I have no plan to make a further offer in agriculture. This is not justified and would further unbalance the negotiations. <Col N="257"/>The time has come for others to match the effort we have made.</P>
      <P>He emphasised the word &ldquo;further&rdquo;, admitting that the current talks are unbalanced because EU agriculture is carrying too much of the weight of the negotiations. It is being used as a negotiating tool. I ask the Minister to revoke this process and not to allow European, and particularly Irish agriculture be used as a tool in the further negotiations. We must take a firm stand on behalf of the farming community.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the CAP reforms. In 2003, farmers coming from a background of 30 years&rsquo; protection through quotas, tariffs, export refunds and whatever, bit the bullet by agreeing to the reform of CAP. This was a mid-term review, it was not due until 2007. They took the pain and accepted reform in 2003 which included single farm payments. As the Minister said, those payments ruled out trade distortion because they were decoupled from production. That was helpful.</P>
      <P>Less than two years later, before the first cheques were issued, the Minister is asking the farmers again to renegotiate CAP and these payments. Many of the farmers have not yet received their cheques. She said she is concerned about the single farm payments and the future ability of the European Union to allow those payments.</P>
      <P>This is terrible news for the Irish farming community. Farmers have accepted reform as it has been put to them but in future reform it is important that they have a level and equal playing pitch. They do not have that now because the cost of production is constantly increasing and is being pushed up by regulations, traceability, cross-compliance, the nitrates directive, animal transport regulations and the introduction of prescription only medicines. These procedures are laudable if there is fair trade on a level playing pitch.</P>
      <P>There is no traceability on the imports from South America. Out of a stock of 200 million cattle only 16.5 million are registered in Brazil. They are registered only six weeks before slaughter yet that meat comes freely in here. We were told that part of the CAP reforms were based on the theory that because of decoupling production in Europe would fall. As a result, we were told, prices would increase. They have not increased.</P>
      <P>The vacuum has been filled with cheap imports from third world countries, particularly Brazil and, to a lesser extent, Argentina. There is no traceability record on the meat from Brazil, which reeks with foot and mouth disease. We must be concerned about the health and safety of the consumer. If one eats a nice steak with blood dripping out of it but it has no traceability record, God only knows what can happen to one&rsquo;s health and that of the next generation. What a shame this will be in replacement of the fine quality product produced by the Irish farmer. We speak about developing countries and fair production. <Col N="258"/>In Brazil, for example, growth hormones, such as clenbuterol, are used in the beef industry. Is this fair trade, particularly when one considers Irish farmers went to jail for using such products? One can say rightly so as it was banned in the EU. Why is its use acceptable in Brazil and other countries? Why is there an unfair playing pitch? US beef producers are allowed to use hormone growth regulators and steroids to boost milk production but the US has not withdrawn supports to its farmers. It has announced it intends to do this if the same happens but the EU has made legislation and implemented regulations in this area. Again, Irish farmers must compete with an unfair system.</P>
      <P>The Minister must take a stand on this issue on behalf of Irish farmers, otherwise they will be wiped out. European consumers are entitled to the same level of traceability and biosecurity. Why are these imports allowed in on this basis? Why are these trade regulations accepted by the Minister and then imposed on Irish farmers?</P>
      <P>There is an inequality of scale with approximately six large ranches in Brazil devoted to beef production. Much of it is produced by slave labour which is of no benefit to Third World countries. Those working on them are poorly paid. How does this improve the lot of the Third World countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>Part of our negotiating position should be a demand for a level playing pitch.</P>
      <P>Last year, the World Bank wrote off a debt of $20 million for Ghana but imposed regulations on sugar production there that cost it $26 million, meaning Ghana was worse off by $6 million. Peter Mandelson and company would lead us to believe that these reforms at EU level at the WTO talks are to the benefit of poorer nations. That is nonsense. He would be better off taking the example of those who established B&oacute;thar which exports live animals to teach people in developing countries about sustainable food production.</P>
      <P>Today, I believed the Minister would make me more optimistic about the forthcoming negotiations in Hong Kong. I know she can smile because she is on her way there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought the Senator was coming too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister taking me? I must declare an interest as a member of the farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the Senator get his cheque?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not get my cheque.</P>
      <P>These trade talks present a glorious opportunity for Ireland to enhance the clean and green <Col N="259"/>image of its agricultural produce. It is an opportunity to highlight research and development in quality agricultural produce. The message must be sent to Europe that our products are what it demands and are of a high and safe quality.</P>
      <P>However, we will see this afternoon what the Government really thinks of Irish agriculture. The Government also has the opportunity to give effect to farmers producing crops that can provide clean energy. We will see if the Government is prepared to reduce taxes that are preventing this from happening. The bureaucratic regulations that prevent the establishment of farmers&rsquo; markets must be done away with.</P>
      <P>The spin, that some 85% of farmers have received their single farm payments, put out by the Department of Agriculture and Food is a disgrace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>That figure is much more since the Senator stood up to speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is nonsense. Last Friday, the story was that 85% of farmers were paid. It is a disgrace the way farmers are being treated. If one telephones the Department, one cannot get through or the call is not answered. When I telephoned, I eventually got through but nobody could tell me anything. The officials promised to telephone me back but never did. Farmers late in applying are to be penalised by 1% per day. Will the Minister penalise the Department by 1% for not paying farmers on time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>There are reasons for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>Why is it that the Department could not contact farmers until now to inform them there were problems with payment applications?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Department officials have been on the telephone every day of the week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan"><NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, to the House. I will attempt to keep the same spirit that prevailed on the Order of Business. It was fascinating to say the least that we had an excellent morning of co-operation across the House. There was no need for the glass barriers. Senator Coonan may be stirring the pot in straying away from what he should have addressed. That is a matter for another day and another discussion.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;boasting&rdquo; was used this morning but I know Senator O&rsquo;Toole has addressed the issue that there should be an alternative to what is happening with land use. We cannot deal with this topic when debating the WTO talks. However, I congratulate the Minister and the Department officials on having 85% of single farm payments made on the first day they were legally entitled to be made. Those farmers who missed out on the <Col N="260"/>first day have plenty of opportunities to have the issue corrected. As on many other occasions, farmers tend to neglect what they ought to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>Why did the Department&rsquo;s switchboard collapse on Friday and Monday?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan"><NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will Senator Coonan keep to the spirit of co-operation that existed on the Order of Business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Callanan without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan"><NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
	<P>Some 12 months ago, I warned the Minister she was facing into her most difficult task to date, the negotiations on the future of sugar beet growing and the sugar industry. Greencore, through closing the Carlow sugar plant, divided sugar beet growers, leaving the Minister in the invidious position of trying to please everybody but nobody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no division now because no one is growing sugar beet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan"><NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister did well in those talks and I congratulate her on the results she achieved. However, what of the &euro;144.5 million compensation payment for Greencore? It does not deserve it. It is morally wrong that such a payment should be in the package.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear. That is absolutely correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan"><NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
	<P>Irish Sugar has been paying debts incurred in other businesses, many unsuccessful, and has asked the sugar beet growers to pick up the bill from the profits made in sugar processing. It happened again this year, when it dropped &euro;47 million. It is unjust and immoral that Greencore could get its hands on &euro;145 million, less the 10% referred to by the Minister. Farmers are entitled to 50% of the &euro;145 million, while Greencore and other parties with legitimate claims should receive the remainder. The Minister could not have returned from Brussels with anything other than a bag of money. Beet growing can continue for a further two years and I appeal to beet farmers and the last remaining sugar factory to give the industry at least another two years. The sector can be profitable to both sides and the Minister should use a small stick and carrot to persuade them to come together.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Serious matters arise regarding the world trade talks. My views on globalisation are well known at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food. While the process has the potential to be wonderful and beneficial to the peoples of the world, on the basis of the structure adopted for the forthcoming talks in Hong Kong, globalisation will not benefit the population of the world. Multinational companies &mdash; nowadays the <Col N="261"/>term &ldquo;transcontinental&rdquo; would be more appropriate as these firms span all continents &mdash; will not take the action needed to assist the poor of the world. Unless political leadership is given at the highest level of the western world, the only region able to provide substantial aid and assistance, globalisation will only benefit the few and practices such as slave labour, to which Senator Coonan referred, will continue. If globalisation and free trade result in the decimation of the multitudes for the benefit of the few, no one wants them. For this reason, no agreement is better than a bad agreement, and not only from the point of view of Irish agriculture.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the World Trade Organisation should be to raise all boats. It was the late Se&aacute;n Lemass who coined the phrase that a rising tide lifts all boats. That should be the outcome of the Hong Kong talks but under the current structure, no such outcome will be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>With the boat gone, it makes no difference whether the tide rises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan"><NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
	<P>The World Trade Organisation has the potential to be beneficial and politicians, including the Minister, have a duty to ensure this potential is realised.</P>
      <P>I listened carefully to the Minister&rsquo;s extraordinarily strong contribution, which I appreciate and on which I compliment her. If she had not used such a tone, her position could have been misrepresented. Her address was exemplary in that it indicated clearly and honestly that there is a point beyond which she will not allow the negotiators to go. The proposals Commissioner Mandelson has placed on the table cross the line and it may be necessary to ask him to step aside.</P>
      <P>If we in Ireland and the rest of Europe are serious about protecting farmers, we must recognise that our agricultural sector is different from that of other continents. We do not have a ranch structure and most of the ranch-type estates we once had were, thankfully, broken up a long time ago. The continents with which we compete have ranches, some of which cover tracts of land larger than this island. They do not produce goods of the standard we in Europe expect. In addition, community preference is essential to ensure that Europe has a constant supply of home-produced food. It is equally important, however, that we engage in some degree of trade for the benefit of Europe and mankind as a whole. Commissioner Mandelson and his policies are no good for Europe or the poor of the world. While they may satisfy British interests, the only permanent item on Britain&rsquo;s agenda is to pursue its own interests.</P>
      <P>Subsidies in place here and elsewhere include preferential credit terms offered to exporters of agricultural products. The United States also examines such subsidies but, having examined the list of subsidies available to US agriculture, I have been unable to find the subsidy for transport to the port of export which is available to US agri<Col N="262"/>culture. To meet the stated objective of full parallelism, all export credits with terms of more than 180 days must be fully eliminated. It will be critical to ensure that officially supported agriculture export credit agencies are able to demonstrate on an annual basis that they charge adequate premia to be self-financing and have not received government subsidies to support their arrangements. With regard to state trading enterprises &mdash; government owned monopolies or companies which control all exports of certain agricultural products, for example, the Canadian Wheat Board and the New Zealand Dairy Board &mdash; the statutory privileges and regulatory benefits enjoyed by these government funded companies must be eliminated. Rather than pushing Europe any further, we must take this action to ensure the trade distorting effects of these companies&rsquo; practices, including price pooling, anti-trust immunity, direct and indirect preferential financial conditions, preferential transport services and exclusive utilisation of preferential market access quotas, are eliminated.</P>
      <P>The Minister will negotiate with the United States and others. The US Government has publicly stated it will legislate to introduce any changes agreed at the talks by 2007. I do not trust the United States on this matter or other issues discussed frequently in the House, including on this morning&rsquo;s Order of Business. No US President or Congress will impose a reduction in subsidies to American farmers in the year preceding an election. Our bottom line should be that we will introduce measures only when the United States has done so.</P>

	<P>The framework agreement objective is to phase out food aid leading to commercial displacement. There is no reason this should not lead to a lowering of developed countries&rsquo; commitment to adequate food aid levels. The European Union has already decided to move to a cash only system. While the merits of such a system are debatable, it has certain advantages. If the primary motivation of food aid is humanitarian rather than commercial, it is difficult to understand the reason this objective should not be acceptable to others. We should, therefore, commit to gradually moving towards untied and cash food aid. I understand the reason we opted to promote in-kind food aid was the US practice of dumping surplus produce. This must stop because it is disrupting legitimate trading activities between poorer trading nations and Europe.</P><Col N="263"/>
      <P>If all these forms of export subsidy are eliminated, as provided for in the current negotiations, our exports of beef and dairy products will not be competing with subsidised imports in the internal EU market and third country markets. There can be no question of the EU ending export refunds while other countries continue to subsidise their exports.</P>
      <P>Ireland&rsquo;s beef and dairy industries cannot be allowed to disappear because we simply cannot do without them. The importance of agriculture to the rural economy and social fabric of our society cannot be underestimated. I do not accept the report from Maynooth. I know Dr. Liam Downey personally and he was very good on Monday&rsquo;s &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; television programme. I hope all other Senators will agree with me.

	<P>I assumed he was referring to himself.</P>
      <P>I would like the Government to take a balanced approach in the forthcoming WTO negotiations, but from where I am standing, I am not sure that will happen. A balanced approach should reflect all the interests of the nation. We have three distinct interests and the Government&rsquo;s challenge is to reconcile all three in the stance it takes. I know the Minister is here to talk about agriculture, but there are three interests concerned as we are a trading, agricultural and compassionate nation.</P>
      <P>Of these three distinct interests, the most important in purely material terms is our position as a trading nation. I am not saying that we should be driven by purely material considerations, but that will be the only aspect taken into account by many people in the negotiations. It is almost a clich&eacute; nowadays to describe Ireland as a trading nation, but I often wonder if we fully realise just how true it is. More than any other developed country, we depend on trading with the outside world. It is certainly the fuel that has driven the Celtic tiger over the last 20 years. The kind of trading nation we are fast becoming gives us a particular interest in the successful outcome of these negotiations. We are in the process of becoming mainly a service-driven society, at a pace with which many people in this country find it difficult to come to terms.</P>
      <P>Senator Coonan talked about us being an agricultural nation and I recall that, way back in the 1950s, when I was studying international economics at university, that was what we were. The economy was mainly based on the land then and our wealth was largely created by agricultural production. In the years that followed, that gave way to an economy driven by manufacturing, although that era is already beginning to fade. We are now rapidly moving towards a situation where the commanding heights of our economy will be in internationally-traded services. In the context of a wider world, we have become very much involved in what is now called the knowledge society.</P>
      <P>Just as we rode the wave of increased free trade in manufacturing &mdash; and did very well in that because it gave great impetus to the economy &mdash; we will now have to rely for future growth on <Col N="265"/>the next wave. As a nation, we have strong, vested interests in promoting free trade in services. Without it, we will certainly not thrive or even survive in the future world that is fast becoming a reality.</P>
      <P>That is the first and perhaps the most important stand in the position we should take on the WTO negotiations. If we leave aside issues of sentimentality or morality and consider merely issues of national self-interest, we should drive our approach to the negotiations on our future position as a trader of international services. Of course, we cannot and should not leave such issues aside. That is why my argument is for a balanced approach, although I am not sure I am hearing that from the Government. I realise that Deputy Coughlan is the Minister for Agriculture and Food and perhaps I am not expecting a balanced approached from her, but I am seeking a balanced approach by the Government to the WTO talks.</P>
      <P>The second interest we have in these negotiations is as an agricultural nation. We must be careful not to get things out of proportion. I am being careful in my comments because most of the views expressed in the House will be solely from the agricultural viewpoint. The importance of agriculture to this country has dwindled. Once it was the main driver, but it currently accounts for only a tiny portion of the national economy. Although one would not believe it from what we hear sometimes, we must remind ourselves that tourism is far more important to the economy than agriculture. Paradoxically, however, as agriculture has dwindled in economic importance, its political clout has increased, rather than fading away as one might expect. Today, there are far fewer farmers, but they have a much louder voice. The interest in the current election for the post of IFA president is getting far more prominence than elections which occur in many other sectors.</P>
      <P>One result of this political stranglehold is that successive Governments have tended to focus on answering farmers&rsquo; short-term demands, rather than facing up to the much tougher task of addressing their longer-term needs. Farmers, more than most of us, have to cope with revolutionary changes in their environment and particularly in the marketplace. We heard some references to that earlier. In general, however, our Governments have not served the farming community well. They have not provided the strategic leadership that would prepare them for change and equip them to succeed in a totally new situation.</P>
      <P>Farmers have an interest in the WTO negotiations and the Government owes it to them to represent their position effectively, but in doing so I hope the Government will not go overboard as it has done in the past. I hope the Government will not make the mistake of equating the interests of farmers with the much wider national interest. To do so would be to sell Ireland short and I hope that will not happen. In seeking a <Col N="266"/>balanced approach, therefore, we must reflect our interests both as a trading and agricultural nation.</P>
      <P>There is a third strand to our interests that must not be forgotten. Recently, I was in southern Africa and was reminded of the huge gap and sense of unfairness that exists between the Third World and those living in Europe and the United States. It is a gap between poor and wealthy people, but I am not sure that the need to strike a balance in this regard has been or is being recognised. We appear to be on one side.</P>
      <P>In a highly competitive world we are taught to cheer for our own team and to rejoice in our victories over others. In these particular negotiations, however, I do not believe that we can take that approach. What unites both sides is our common humanity. What should unite us is not a desire to pursue our own selfish interests, but a desire to work for a better outcome for all. In the past, rich countries thrived partly at the expense of poorer countries and the present situation is not much different.</P>
      <P>Some years ago, I became involved with the Fairtrade products that were being launched in Ireland and I realised that the case for fair trade had to be made. Senators Coonan and Callanan referred to Ghana and Brazil in this respect, but the solution is not a simple one because if we are not careful the wealth may not go to the right people. We should regard these negotiations as part of an attempt to build a better world for all of us &mdash; a world that will be fairer than it is now in terms of access to our markets. I would like to commend the word &ldquo;fairness&rdquo; to our negotiators as they go into the WTO talks. Instead of simply asking whether this is what we want, I would like them also to ask if it is fair to everyone concerned.</P>
      <P>I wish the Government well in what will be difficult negotiations and ask it to take into account not only the interests of the farming or agriculture community but those of Ireland as a whole. In particular, it should wear that third hat, asking whether it is fair, compassionate and moral.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank Senator Quinn for allowing me the opportunity to contribute to the debate and welcome the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan. Since being elected to this House 18 years ago, I have spent most of my time defending Ministers for Agriculture and Food, mainly against the Opposition party, but almost as often against the Ministers&rsquo; own party. I make this point in all seriousness. This country has been very well served by those who have gone to Brussels to negotiate on behalf of Irish farmers, all the way back to such people as Ray MacSharry, who did a superb job. He was buried, knifed and kicked by his own party while he was doing it, as well as by this side of the House. I was perhaps the only one in the House who defended what he was trying to do.</P><Col N="267"/>
      <P>Ivan Yates is remembered better because he made a telephone call from Wexford rather than being at the airport at a given time or <i>vice versa</i>. He did a fantastic job, and Deputy Walsh has also done tremendous work. I compliment the Minister on her work to date, and I assure her of my future support.</P>
      <P>I agree with almost all of the points made by Senator Quinn. I take issue with him on only one topic, which leads into what I wish to say. He bemoaned the lack of strategic leadership from the Government for Irish farmers. That is not the case, and Irish farmers have rejected such strategic leadership. I can quote many examples, but I will limit myself to two simple ones from the last 15 years. We sat here for ten years listening to a raging war about beef prices when anyone with two eyes and ears and half a brain knew that we would be dealing with world beef prices before the 1990s were out. While we all knew it we were still trying to convince or mislead farmers into thinking that we could stop it happening.</P>
      <P>The story is similar with beet, which has been debated for 32 years. Beet was never a long-term European crop. It was put together mainly to protect farmers in the north of France and Belgium, together with the UK to some extent, and we got in on the back. It was never going to happen.</P>
      <P>Those things have an impact, since the strategic issues raised by Senator Quinn, on which I agree with him, need to be considered. Heads must be knocked together. I want people to engage on the issues rather than the personalities. I want them to ask what they will do now that there is no beet industry.</P>
      <P>The Minister is going to the WTO talks, and I agree with Senator Quinn&rsquo;s points regarding the benchmarks put in place. How do we deal with it? Globalisation, like Irish unity, means different things to different people. For me, globalisation is the extension of the Treaty of Rome to the globe. It is the free movement of labour and capital, among other things. In her speech the Minister said that she would seek to protect Ireland&rsquo;s position. How can she marry those two things? I believe that it could be done if we examined how globalisation might be extended in a way reflecting the needs of the Irish agriculture community, which needs our support at this stage.</P>
      <P>We can do several things, including requiring standards to be met abroad and changing things at home. Let us take the beet issue. Globalisation should be tied very closely to the Kyoto commitments. The Minister and I both know that if matters continue as at present, Brazil will soon supply sugar cane to the entire world. I predict that it will happen within a year or two; there is no doubt that it can do it. Let us remember, however, that Brazil is clearing trees from an area equivalent to the acreage of Ireland every year. It is doing so against all that we believe in regarding Kyoto. To deal with that, we should not do busi<Col N="268"/>ness with the Brazilians or allow into Europe products coming from such a regime.</P>
      <P>I could extend that beyond agriculture to such places as China. On &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;, it was stated in a throwaway phrase of which many of us have been aware for some time that the Chinese are opening a new coal-burning power station every five days. We are worried about that, and we should say to them that we will not accept that kind of carry-on. Regarding sugar beet, that is what we should also say.</P>
      <P>We should make to Brazil the point that Senator Coonan, among others, made very articulately some weeks ago. Why should we allow into our country beef from a country that does not apply the same standards to its producers? We should all say that we are not willing to do that, since Europe cannot allow it. We are strict enough on our own farmers.</P>
      <P>The other issue concerns the question of health and safety regulations. Globalisation must be dependent on fair health and safety. Once we are assured of that, we can rule out such things as sweatshops. We will not do business with those countries. This is an ethical and principled stance. In Senator Quinn&rsquo;s words, it is a fair position to take. We help people in both jurisdictions by doing so.</P>
      <P>Food safety is another area. I and others in this House have asked about it on numerous occasions but I still do not understand the nonsense whereby a Thai chicken can become a European one because someone cut off its head in Amsterdam. It is total madness. As well as affecting Irish producers and agriculture detrimentally, it also gives European legislation a bad name among ordinary people. If we cannot understand it, how can we expect ordinary people to do so?</P>
      <P>Is there a basic position on which we can build our case? We should not oppose globalisation since it is a good idea. The problem is that the Americans have misinterpreted or reinterpreted it in their own way, just as they have done regarding torture and many other things. We should say that it is not what we expect or understand it to mean. There are also things that must be done here.</P>
      <P>I have a single priority for Irish beef farmers with which the Minister could deal in the Houses in two weeks. Will she revise and reform the Abattoirs Act 1988? It was the biggest mistake ever made in Irish agriculture in the last 20 years. We no longer know where our beef comes from. Twenty years ago we knew when we walked into a local butcher&rsquo;s shop in any part of Ireland that it was more than likely that the butcher had bought it locally. Senator Quinn may have a different view on this, but he will not disagree with what I say now. The Abattoirs Act 1988 has put great costs on outlets such as those of Senator Quinn, since they must try to prove where meat comes from. We did not have that problem until the Act was passed.</P><Col N="269"/>
      <P>The Minister can do two things, the first being to examine the success of farmers&rsquo; markets and how we can sell locally. They have seen great growth around Europe. Regulations concerning them are interpreted differently in different parts of Europe. Second, she should take a holiday to Provence and visit the local vegetable market. This is a serious point. She should take half her officials with her and a digital camera. She should photograph what is on sale there &mdash; the beautiful, shiny, healthy, perfect vegetables. Then she should go to her local supermarket such as one of my colleague&rsquo;s shops, photographing the extraordinarily good vegetables that he will have on display there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We only want to spend a minute on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>She should note the difference. Vegetables are dumped in north Dublin because they will not pass through the sorters for the Dublin market, while in Provence they would be on display. People will go in and buy a beef tomato with four sides or a hugely distorted pepper. If it looks healthy, clean and luscious, they will buy it. Why does that happen there but not here? That and the Abattoirs Act 1988 must be addressed.</P>
      <P>I agree with the point that it is immoral and unethical that the workers in Mallow and farmers supplying them will not get a shilling&rsquo;s compensation for the closure of the beet factory and that &euro;140 million will go to Greencore, which is no longer even an Irish company. Neither is it a beet company, meaning that there are two good reasons not to proceed on that basis. We should go to Irish farmers and tell them what we must do in the future. They must sell such things as bio-fuels, constructing wind energy plants wherever necessary in their areas, as well as many other things on which I cannot elaborate.</P>
      <P>Irish farmers and agriculture need our support, as does the Minister. We should plan together to make this work and improve the situation on the ground.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>

	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, welcome the Minister and her officials to the House and thank her for her detailed contribution. It is important that we make time to discuss issues such as the one before us for a number of reasons. First, there can be a tendency to consider negotiations such as those held at the World Trade Organisation as far off and of little everyday significance to ordinary people but what are the repercussions for Ireland at the World Trade Organisation discussions to be held in Hong Kong next week? Second, some <Col N="270"/>see these negotiations as being of concern only to the declining number of farmers in Ireland or those deeply concerned with issues in the developing world but they are of much greater importance than that. We should see this as an opportunity to stress that point and to reaffirm Ireland&rsquo;s continued support for a fair, multilateral trading system at the Doha development agenda.</P>
      <P>The negotiations provide the world&rsquo;s nations with a chance to take a number of important steps, including expanding trade, fostering global economic growth and supporting development. That is beneficial to Ireland, our fellow EU member states and developing countries. Less-developed countries will also benefit from duty free and quota free market access, commitments on the level of market access linked to their level of development and deferential treatment and measures to strengthen trade related assistance. We must remember that this is also meant to be a development round with the difficult objective of creating the conditions whereby poor countries can take advantage of globalisation, something that has been portrayed at times as impossible.</P>
      <P>The World Trade Organisation is not singly concerned with the needs of the developed world over poorer countries. It must be remembered that the Canc&uacute;n talks failed mainly because the concerns of the world&rsquo;s poorest nations were not being meaningfully addressed. Ireland correctly supports international moves to address the challenges that result from economic and technological change. We rightly support equitable growth and development and we also promote all well-balanced actions in the interests of the World Trade Organisation&rsquo;s members but in particular action in the interests of the developing countries.</P>
      <P>The simplistic view is that it is a zero-sum game; gains for one mean losses for others but the heart of the current debate has been a need to ensure balance between the key areas of the development agenda. The agriculture sector expressed concerns that farming livelihoods are somehow being negotiated away at international level. To take the EU nitrates directive controversy as an example, the Department of Agriculture and Food issued a consultation paper, together with the text of draft regulations to give legal effect to the action programme last October but by the closing date of 4 November, 76 submissions had been received from a wide range of stakeholders including farming organisations, co-operatives, local authorities and other interested parties. As recently as last Monday, I received correspondence from farming interests concerned about the validity of a scientific report submitted to the Department on which decisions about the directive may be based. I cite that example because at international negotiations an agreement on agriculture and trade is necessary and welcome, particularly when the objectives are the promotion of free and fair trade, supporting development or protecting our environment. We must ensure, however, that all stakeholders and <Col N="271"/>interested parties are kept abreast of positions taken, the basis for those positions and the likely outcome of developments. Stakeholders and interested parties need the fullest information possible if negotiations are to mend their confidence and trust.</P>
      <P>Today&rsquo;s statements and those in the D&aacute;il on Thursday last are an opportunity for stakeholders and interested parties to get reassurance that Ireland will pursue the most beneficial outcome for the Irish agri-food sector at the Hong Kong negotiations. They provide an opportunity for those negotiating on their behalf and those negotiating on our behalf to state clearly that they accept the importance of their work, although it appears the Hong Kong conference will not result in final agreement being reached.</P>
      <P>The next World Trade Organisation agreement will set the levels for future protection and support for the entire agriculture sector. There is no doubt that will have serious implications for the Common Agricultural Policy. I am aware the Minister for Agriculture and Food shares the concerns of the sector that the EU Commission has adopted an unnecessarily concessionary approach to the upcoming negotiations.</P>
      <P>On the one hand, there are those who need reassurance about the World Trade Organisation negotiations. We need to hear that the EU&rsquo;s latest offer is as far as we can go, having reformed domestic support, committed to the elimination of export subsidies and proposed substantial reductions in import tariffs. On the other hand, we need to hear that the priority in trade talks is to assist the world&rsquo;s poorest countries and that Ireland accepts that developing nations do not have the same capacity to compete on the world markets and so require special treatment. We realise this is a complex area but one that requires a coherent approach. I am glad this series of statements provides an opportunity for those facts to be made clear and I wish the Minister every success next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KieranPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. K. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, welcome the Minister to the House to speak on the important subject of the WTO negotiations but specifically in regard to Ireland. I listened carefully to the Minister&rsquo;s contribution and I know the Irish corner will be well defended by the Minister at the WTO talks. It is important that Members of the Seanad get an opportunity to make contributions before the Minister leaves to attend the negotiations.</P>
      <P>The ministerial conference is not the end point of the current round of the WTO negotiations and it was never intended as such. These negotiations are an important step on the way to the final stages in 2006-07. As I understand it, the negotiations were relaunched in 2004 when the WTO members agreed the core areas for negotiation. The EU&rsquo;s acceptance of the abolition of the agriculture export subsidies on the basis of parallel reform by other WTO members&rsquo; compet<Col N="272"/>ing subsidies, coupled with the continued reform of CAP, was the major reason for reaching the July agreement. In regard to those areas of agriculture, that will be the main topic of discussion at the conference.</P>
      <P>The negotiations on the next WTO agreement are well under way in the run-up to the ministerial conference. There will probably be a need to hold a further conference in 2006 to finalise the details of the new agreement. Obviously, the Minister, who will attend the negotiations, will pursue the most beneficial outcome for the Irish agriculture sector. From our point of view, given the economic and social importance of our agriculture and food sector, this is a vitally important aspect of the negotiations. The outcome of the WTO agreement will determine the levels of future protection and support for agriculture and therefore the new round could have serious implications for the CAP.</P>
      <P>There are three main areas on how the WTO talks will affect Irish agriculture. The three main areas of concern are domestic supports, the export subsidies and market access. It is important that the CAP and the single payment under the decoupling system are safeguarded under the green box because direct payments make a major contribution to farm incomes.</P>
      <P>The Doha mandate provided for reductions and the eventual phasing out of export subsidies. It is important that the phasing out is carried out over the longest period possible so as to cause the least damage to Irish agriculture. We must retain the maximum possible level of protection for market access through a combination of tariff cuts and other mechanisms, including designating certain products as sensitive and implementing a special safeguard clause to protect our EU markets from increased competition from imports from some third countries.</P>
      <P>Irish farmers are subject to full traceability of our beef, lamb and milk, while beef imports from Brazil and other countries outside the European Union are not subject to the same costly restrictions. Reducing tariffs substantially would prevent Ireland producing beef and milk at a profitable level. The only countries that would benefit are Brazil, New Zealand and Australia, which have large farms and huge heads of cattle and can produce beef at a low cost. Tariff reduction will not help poorer countries.</P>
      <P>Some of the proposals being considered by the WTO in the lead-up to the Hong Kong meeting in December, including those of the EU, would devastate Irish farmers&rsquo; incomes. Furthermore, they would result in farm enterprises, excluding decoupled payments, operating at a loss. The result would be an unprecedented fall in output which in turn would impact severely on rural areas and the national economy. Once agreed, these proposals will be irreversible and will lead to an acceleration in rural decay through the decline of the population and infrastructure.</P><Col N="273"/>
      <P>I was happy to hear the Minister say in the D&aacute;il during the week that the Government&rsquo;s priority was to ensure that the process of trade liberalisation continues in a fair and balanced manner and that the WTO continues to provide a stable and constant framework for the regulation of world trade. As a small, open economy Ireland has much to gain from a successful outcome to this round of multilateral negotiations.</P>
      <P>The Minister has outlined the position on agriculture. The offer from the EU is as far as we can go, with which I agree as we have reformed domestic supports committed to the elimination of export subsidies and proposed substantial reductions in import tariffs. We have no more room for manoeuvre. It is unacceptable that the CAP would require further reform.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister and Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern, well and the best of luck in negotiations. Knowing them both, they will not be found wanting in defending Irish interests.</P>

The same gentleman made the mistake of underestimating our present Minister for Finance when they dealt with each other on Northern Ireland affairs and I suspect he has discovered the same about our Minister for Agriculture and Food. If not, I hope he will.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Like Senator O&rsquo;Toole, I believe the farming organisations bear considerable responsibility in this matter, which is a pity. From the time we joined the EEC, the mantra of the farming organisations had much in common with King Canute. They sat and said: &ldquo;The tide will not come in because we say it will not come in.&rdquo; Strategic thinking means carefully examining issues that are far away and reducing one&rsquo;s inspection of matters that are up close. It was manifest to anyone who examined the CAP when we joined the EEC that the only question was how short a time would it be before it became fundamentally impossible to operate.</P>
      <P>One does not need to be a neo-liberal economist to realise that if one guarantees prices to everyone all of the time for all of their production, something will give. It is a great pity that a country that has and had inherent comparative advantages in the production of high-quality agricultural products charged down a road of poor <Col N="274"/>quality and vast quantity in return for guaranteed prices. Very little was done. Senator O&rsquo;Toole is correct to a considerable degree. It was not the fault of the political leadership in agriculture, although I have not seen much imagination in the official side of agriculture other than the defence of the maximum payments to the maximum number of farmers, which was fine for a time but could not have lasted.</P>
      <P Just="Left">We must be wary of those who are the most enthusiastic about the free market, people who are usually never exposed to it. I am not allowed to mention names but I will start with the most eminent Irish man in the area of trade and so forth. He began in a profession that was a closed shop, was appointed &mdash; not elected &mdash; to high political office, was then appointed to an even higher political office, was appointed as the director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT, and was finally appointed without competition to his present eminent position. He has never experienced a competitive market in his life but now believes it would be good for everyone else. Of itself, this is sufficient reason for anyone to be wary of enthusiasts for market liberalism, those who say: &ldquo;It is good for everybody else but we have reasons not to be exposed to it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>For reasons relating to their admirable qualities, farmers have been seduced into believing they are the epitome of the free market when, in its best form, Irish and European agriculture represents a social democratic managed model of a humane economy, in which one balances the needs for quality and decent standards for those who work in the industry, either in the production or processing side. Even with its faults, the CAP is much better to those who work in the industry than the brutal agriculture practised in what is often called, and is in many ways, the underdeveloped world.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that farmers were seduced into believing this as they could have looked elsewhere for political protection. I endeavoured to explain this to several members of the IFA last Wednesday night but neither I nor they were at their most coherent. However, I have vigorously made the point to the IFA that it should be careful not to celebrate the dilution or weakness of trade unions. If the influence of trade unions is diminished, it is inevitable that the diminution of the influence of organisations such as the IFA or others will follow. One cannot have a society in which some people are treated to the full brute force of the marketplace yet expect that other people should not. Whatever our exchanged words, we are all in this together. If we do not agree on institutions that protect people from the brutalities of the marketplace, we will all be exposed to it except, of course, the eminent individual to whom I referred earlier.</P>
      <P>I am intrigued by how the entire economics profession in this country managed not to notice the Common Agricultural Policy, presumably <Col N="275"/>because so many fat contracts came from the IFA. Economists would not say what they normally would have, what they are now saying about the partnership process, such as it is an inhibition to efficiency and so forth. I know why they did not say this about the CAP. The IFA is a good employer of economists and it would therefore be foolish to say anything. As I have said over the years, the CAP is a good idea but we need to examine its costs and benefits. One cost is that many consumers are paying more than they probably would in a world market. There are down sides to this argument, which I will address shortly.</P>
      <P>It is a fact that the profession of economics, which spent its life in the 1980s shooting at the unemployed, for example, and demanding that welfare benefits be cut so that people would be forced out to work, managed to blissfully ignore the market distortions of the Common Agricultural Policy. I support many of these distortions. I have no ideological beliefs one way or another about the market. It is sometimes useful and sometimes a cruelty imposed on people.</P>
      <P>In this context, I remember a meeting of the Joint Committee on European Affairs at which an eminent leader of the IFA, who is closer to the House now than he was then, managed to speak for 45 minutes about what needed to be done on behalf of farmers but did not mention the market or consumers. This was quite an achievement for someone who was in the business of producing that which people must buy.</P>
      <P>Any strategic plan for agriculture in Ireland must deal with two issues, namely, what should we do to generate a way of dealing with food that is good for consumers and what gives a maximum income for farming. The IFA and most of the other farming organisations run away from the issue of income distribution within agriculture, for example. Where does the income go? Probably 80,000 or 90,000 people will march up and down the streets to defend a position which makes 5% of farmers extremely well off and leaves the rest of them just about surviving. There is a significant question, particularly when one is talking about large-scale State support, about the distribution of that State support between people who are barely surviving and people who are living in a style to which only directors of Irish Ferries are accustomed.</P>
      <P>Another question I have asked a succession of Ministers concerns REPS. Part of the Department of Agriculture and Food&rsquo;s responsibility is to ensure that we do not engage in intensive agriculture. The question I have asked about REPS is not how many farmers are involved, but what proportion of the total acreage in farming is involved and what proportion of our agricultural production comes from farms fully involved in the REPS. I have asked a few Ministers that question and I have never got an answer. I know there are approximately 30,000 farmers involved but <Col N="276"/>are they real farmers, farmers mar dhea or part-time farmers. The really interesting question concerns how much of our agricultural production comes from farms involved in REPS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan"><NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would answer that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to hear it.</P>
      <P>The Commissioner makes me nervous. The core of a proper free trade world is a fair trade world. Despite what people say, I believe strongly there is a considerable amount of evidence that where people get the chance, they prefer to know that what they are buying is produced in a reasonably fair fashion. We cannot have equality. Nobody is trying to force Irish working standards, in terms of wages, hours or anything else, on people in developing countries. However, there is a dignified minimum and it is an issue on which many of the governments of poor countries resist. I found myself at the receiving end of a particularly virulent abuse from a senior diplomat from Malaysia when I mentioned at a World Trade Organisation parliamentary convention that I felt we were entitled to some international minimum standards and I was accused of protectionism. It is not protectionism; it is fair trade.</P>
      <P>We have a perfectly legitimate interest in ensuring that countries do not compete with us by the exploitation of their own people. This is where I take issue with China. I find it difficult to argue with competition from India. India is a free-functioning liberal democracy, with some form of free trade unions and a free press. Therefore, the inevitable will happen in India. As India develops, there is the capacity of a free society and a free people to demand a fair share in terms of both income and other resources.</P>
      <P>What happens in China is an entirely different matter. We do not know what is happening in China because large parts of it are not accessible. We do not know what pressures are put on people to work under certain labour conditions. We do not know what deals transnational corporations are making with Chinese authorities to ensure that is sustained and we are entitled to know that.</P>
      <P>The same is true about Brazil, in terms of agricultural production or sugar production. If it is true, as I believe in some cases it can be, that allowing a world free market in sugar will change the lives of significant numbers of poor people in the developing world, then we must do it. That is the direction in which we must go. If, however, it is not true, then part of what we should be doing is ensuring that the new arrangements do not make many people poorer. For example, people in the ACP countries, the price of whose sugar will now drop, will be impoverished. Who would be made rich? The Common Agricultural Policy did not make nearly as many farmers rich as it made middle men running cold stores rich in the 1980s and 1990s. I would be concerned about the same happening here.</P><Col N="277"/>
      <P>The fundamental point I would make to the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, is that in dealing with this particular Commissioner, given his obduracy and having to be sacked from government twice, the only tactics he understands are those where he is confronted. He does not understand subtlety, though he claims to be subtle. He does not understand sweet reason, as far as I can see. Therefore, the Minister must be adamant that it will not be done.</P>
      <P>We must begin in these trade negotiations, both in terms of agriculture and of trade generally, to address the great pity that I cannot now find out where the shirt I am wearing was made because somebody changed the rules. It could have be made in Burma or Sweden. If it was made in Burma, it was almost certainly made by what is effectively slave labour. I find that most regrettable. I do not think the present EU Commissioner will have much sympathy with me but I hope the Government will.</P>
      <P>If we were to link fair and free trade, we would have a wonderful world in which many people in Ireland would perhaps lose a little but many people in the rest of the world would gain. What we may well get now is simply a world which is even easier for transnational corporations to manipulate and, probably, to destroy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share half my time with Senator Scanlon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, and her officials. I am satisfied and supportive of the position that she laid out in her speech. Before coming to sugar and the WTO, I compliment her and her Department on the efficient issue of the single farm payments a few days ago. That means, although this has not been much commented on, that farmers will have a good year this year, and will probably enjoy a double digit percentage increase in income. However, that must not be taken out of context because obviously next year will be somewhat leaner.</P>
      <P>Given the last contribution, I must declare an interest in that I am an ordinary member of the IFA since I ceased to be in the advisory branch of the public service. The farm organisations do an excellent job for Irish farmers. I am glad, however, that they are social partners because that means that the type of somewhat unproductive confrontation in the 1980s and earlier, to which Senator Ryan referred, no longer happens.</P>
      <P>The sugar negotiations showed the dangers and perils facing us. While we perhaps expect to be able to produce for another couple of years, I am a little shocked that we, alone of all countries, are being effectively knocked out of a business which has been profitable and good for Irish farmers. It throws into a certain light whether Greencore was wise to close down the Carlow plant, which <Col N="278"/>divided farmers among themselves. That did not make the Minister&rsquo;s task any easier. Then there were the divisions between farmers and Greencore.</P>
      <P>In general, in negotiation I am not a great believer in unilateral concessions and that also applies to the WTO. To take an analogy from the Northern Ireland negotiations, if, as some parties urged ten years before the Good Friday Agreement, we had unilaterally changed Articles 2 and 3, whether we would have got the Good Friday Agreement, or whether it would have been as comprehensive, is very much open to doubt.</P>
      <P>On the WTO, once again the EU has put its house in order and has put the foot forward while others hold back. One perhaps has a situation where the US Congress decides at the end of the day whether it might implement what is agreed. We need to be extremely wary of those situations.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Another unfortunate fact is that people, who one cannot entirely blame, facing the EU see that it is internally divided. There are people like the British Chancellor, Gordon Brown, MP. Even Commissioner Mandelson had a go at Gordon Brown the other day, effectively arguing that more concessions must be made. Quite obviously, one or two countries do not believe in the CAP and would be glad to see it go. Can one be surprised that other countries are pushing and pressing for concessions?</P>
      <P>I somewhat resent the &ldquo;tugging at the bleeding hearts&rdquo; syndrome. Recently, I shared a platform with a representative from Oxfam to discuss the WTO and sugar and was quite shocked. While I contribute to Oxfam and its representative was a decent individual, the shallowness of its argument shocked me. It failed to make any distinction between what are now euphemistically called advanced developing countries like Brazil, and ACP countries, which will lose out as far as sugar is concerned. We must be clear about what is at issue, namely, a clash of interests. In the main, we are not talking about the poorest of the poor, whose interests are being cared for by various initiatives. One must bear in mind that it is almost always the strong, who are not always the greatest respecters of rules, who preach free market liberalisation. Back in the 1980s, we had, as we still do, a comparative advantage in the production of milk. Did that mean that other states without that advantage closed down their milk industries, thereby allowing us to produce for our advantage? Of course it did not, as Ireland is a small country. Hence, one must be wary of some of those arguments.</P>
      <P>My final point is that food, even more than oil, is essential for security. We have an absolute right to produce an adequate amount of food to supply people&rsquo;s needs. We do not know what hazards may arise in the future, in the form of political or environmental disruption. Hence, I wish the Minister well in continuing to fight the good fight. She will have the full support of everyone in this <Col N="279"/>House and hopefully of practically everyone in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonScanlon"><NameTxt>Mr. Scanlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have an opportunity to make a few points in respect of the WTO talks. I welcome the Minister to the House. While I do not often agree with Senator Coonan&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not often disagree either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonScanlon"><NameTxt>Mr. Scanlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not agree with him in public too often. However, he raised the issue of Brazilian beef and the competition and pressure that beef will put on the European markets on which Irish farmers depend. A recent interesting broadcast of the radio programme &ldquo;Worlds Apart&rdquo;, presented by Rodney Rice, focused on the San Pablo region in Brazil. Mr. Rice met local people, as well as interviewing people who had worked in the meat business in Ireland. Irish agriculture has done more for that region and its people than the WTO talks will do for the poor people of Brazil. He stated that one can see how working in Ireland made a difference to people, in terms of their quality of life and standard of housing. The interviewees had worked in Cork, Roscommon, Galway and throughout the country and the money they earned in Ireland enabled them to build up their homes and region. A great community spirit was to be found there.</P>
      <P>The programme also revealed the damage which has been done to the rain forest in Brazil in terms of the amount of forests that have been felled. Mr. Rice spoke to local community representatives and noted that people do not stand in the way of those responsible for this destruction. While the land mass of Brazil is 80 times greater than that of Ireland, the land is owned by 5,000 ranchers. No one questions these people because, as an interviewee noted, the bodies of many people who had objected to what was taking place had been found on the side of the road. Those people had been shot.</P>
      <P>Workers in meat factories in Brazil are paid &euro;40 per month, while such people doing the same job in Ireland would earn &euro;350 per week. Hence, Irish farmers must compete while paying wages of &euro;1,200 or &euro;1,400 per month, compared to &euro;40 per month in Brazil. No business or industry could compete against a market with such a low base production cost. This is why I wish the Minister the best of luck. She has a tough job to do and I hope she will be successful.</P>
      <P>I understand that Senator O&rsquo;Toole mentioned the pig and poultry industries. The pig industry employs 3,500 people and while it has no bearing on the WTO talks, it is a self-sufficient industry, which works extremely hard. It does not receive any subsidies and lives in the real world. The nitrates directive has been mentioned and in that context, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food was informed last week that Denmark, which has a land mass the size of <Col N="280"/>Munster, has 20 million pigs, while Ireland, which is four times larger, has 3.5 million pigs. However, Denmark can comply with the nitrates directive. I cannot understand how that can happen. I am aware that the local authorities in Denmark monitor the directive and carry out tests on the land, while I understand that the EPA does so in Ireland. Perhaps we should consider changing that practice.</P>
      <P>Abattoirs were mentioned in respect of the 85% payments made last week. In fairness to the Minister, her Department and officials, the payments were made on 1 December, as promised. A further 15% are still outstanding. I know, as do other Members, as politicians, that there is a reason as those 15% have not been paid. I do not doubt that it will be resolved soon.</P>
      <P>I also note that the protection of decoupled payments and the green box is a line that cannot be crossed. I hope we stick to that, as no deal is better than a bad deal, and it is crucial not to cross that line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the debate on the forthcoming WTO negotiations concerning agriculture. The buck stops here and the future of Irish farming rests with the Minister and the Taoiseach. They must make the Government&rsquo;s position on the WTO talks clear and must prevent the selling out of our farmers, who are being driven off the land by one directive after another. This has become evident in recent years.</P>
      <P>This is a time for the Government to present a united front in the interest of Irish farming, unlike the recent shambles referred to by Senator Scanlon in respect of the nitrates directives, where the issue fell between the Departments of Agriculture and Food and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and became nothing more than a political football with resultant potentially devastating effects for the pig, poultry and dairy industries.</P>
      <P>Seven Irish farmers abandon farming each day and many more face an uncertain future at the hands of the lame duck Government, beef barons and other cartels supported by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should ensure that the duck is registered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government appears intent on driving such farmers from the land and out of business.</P>
      <P>A total of 141,000 people, or 12% of the workforce, were employed in Irish farming in 1994. By 2004, this figure had been halved to 113,000 people, or 6% of the total workforce, which constitutes an indictment of the Government.</P>
      <P>I wish to bring the Minister back to the programme for Government of 2002 which stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">We believe that a strong agriculture sector is a vital part of a strong Irish economy and the cornerstone of a vibrant rural community. Our aim is the continued enhancement of agri<Col N="281"/>culture and our vision is for rural communities where young people have a choice between attractive options.</P>
      <P>With a few violins playing, one could almost hear Eamon de Valera back <i>in situ</i>, fantasising about maidens at crossroads &mdash; a habit Fianna F&aacute;il has never given up. The spin of the above would make one believe we have not moved on much further.</P>
      <P>In 2003, the disease levy was doubled, costing farmers an extra &euro;10 million. In 2004, the Government refused to fully roll back this levy and only reduced it by 50%. In budget 2003, roll-over tax relief was abolished. While the revenue yield of abolishing section 605 relief will not be significant, the abolition will severely penalise those farmers who are worst affected by compulsory purchase orders, for a minimal increase in tax yield.</P>
      <P>The average farm income in 2004, revealed by Teagasc, was &euro;15,557, half the average industrial wage of &euro;30,000. In 2004, almost 40% of farmers earned an average income of less than &euro;6,500. The average farm income on cattle rearing systems was &euro;7,286. Average farm incomes on sheep rearing systems declined in 2004 by a massive 16%. Average industrial earnings in 2004 were &euro;29,000, with average public service employee wages at &euro;39,000. Lamb and pig exports fell by 12% and 7% respectively in 2003.</P>
      <P>Almost half of farmers&rsquo; earned income is now non-farm, compared with 30% in 1987. In 2004, farmers were paid for their milk at 1989 prices, with a massive 40% margin going to supermarkets. There has been a 22.5% fall in farm profits since 1995. So much for the Government&rsquo;s avowed support for rural communities and a strong agricultural sector. This is not a record of which the Government can be proud.</P>
      <P>Now, following on one threat after another to the viability of Irish farming, we are faced with a worldwide situation that threatens the heart of what remains of the Irish farming sector. The EU offer to the World Trade Organisation in advance of the Hong Kong summit has the potential to destroy Irish farming. It is clear that the EU has made too many concessions too quickly and there is a serious danger that the Commission&rsquo;s offer will destroy the internal market for food, which will, in turn, decimate both Irish farmers&rsquo; livelihoods and the rural economy.</P>
      <P>Further concessions are likely, despite assurances by the EU Trade Commissioner, Peter Mandelson. These concessions could be made in an attempt to rescue the multilateral trade negotiating process of the WTO but would be disastrous for EU farming and, by extension, would further decimate the already suffering Irish farming industry. The heavy emphasis on agriculture in the WTO is masking the enormity of non-agriculture trade and these issues have yet to be debated at the WTO.</P><Col N="282"/>
      <P>The EU offer of 28 October goes beyond the CAP reform agreement and the EU negotiating mandate and it is imperative that the Government brings pressure to bear on the Commission to withdraw its offer. John Dillon, IFA president, who came before the environment committee yesterday, has warned that under Mandelson, Europe will become the dumping ground of the world food market, where there will be no control over quality, no tagging and no food traceability. He says that the consequences of such a policy would be greater exposure to food and mouth disease, swine fever and avian flu. What we will get is beef of over 30 months that is produced by slave labour and, although it has been disputed this morning, full of hormones.</P>
      <P>On a recent visit to South America I spoke with South American farmers. I was surprised to learn that in many cases they do not test their animals until they are at least four years of age. This beef can be imported into this country and could destroy our clean, beef producing sector. It is extremely worrying that our food safety budget is being cut, according to the Estimates, despite the fact that the number of food scares is growing, particularly from inferior food imports such as Brazilian beef. Irish farmers have invested much money and effort to ensure that Irish food is the safest and most secure in the world. With increased threats from foot and mouth disease in Brazilian beef or Asian flu and so forth we certainly cannot afford to reduce funding for food safety.</P>
      <P>The IFA president has called on consumers to stand by our farmers in return for a secure supply of top quality, safe and traceable food at reasonable prices. It is imperative that the Minister impress on the Commission the need to defend and protect the CAP in the negotiations and oppose attempts to undermine the green box arrangement. Agriculture must not under any circumstances be sacrificed for the sake of the overall agreement. I was surprised to read in the Minister&rsquo;s speech that concessions in agriculture should be a precondition for movement or progress in other aspects of the negotiation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>That was a typographical error in the script. The Senator will see from the Official Report that I said it is not acceptable that concessions in agriculture should be a precondition for movement elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to intervene briefly in the debate. I am aware that other speakers wish to contribute. There is a united voice in this House and in politics generally about the necessity to defend the Common Agricultural Policy and especially small farmers, who are being threatened almost on a daily basis and who are gradually going out of business. That is obvious.</P>
      <P>Without being patronising I congratulate the Minister for Agriculture and Food. Since she came into office she has brought a breath of fresh <Col N="283"/>air into the Department, an air that is blowing in several directions. I hope she will continue in office for a number of years and that she will consolidate the work that has been done by successive Ministers of all parties over the years since we joined the EU. The basis of supporting farmers&rsquo; incomes and especially supporting small farmers is the Common Agricultural Policy. If that is threatened, the policy will come apart and the consequences will be devastating, particularly for small farmers.</P>
      <P>I wish to make a point in connection with the single farm payment. For many small farmers, particularly the farmers in west Clare who I represent, it is an extremely small payment. In some cases it is &euro;3,000 or &euro;4,000. That is not sufficient to enable them to continue in the long term. Some schemes have been devised in conjunction with other Departments to put in place employment schemes for small farmers. Many farmers in my constituency work in Moneypoint, for example, to supplement their income but it is necessary to examine the single payment again with a view to establishing a minimum threshold that will ensure smaller farmers will have a minimum income level that will enable them to continue farming, even on a part-time basis.</P>
      <P>The reason I intervene in this debate is to impress on the Minister the necessity to support the smaller farmers, especially those in western areas such as west Clare, and to ensure they can continue to have a living from the land for the foreseeable future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Daly for allowing me the opportunity to speak in this debate. I join other Speakers in welcoming the fact that the Minister has been present for the duration of the discussion. It is an important debate. I suggested a debate on the world trade talks about five or six weeks ago. I am glad we are having this debate but we should have had it a couple of weeks ago when the Commissioner for Trade, Mr. Mandelson, began to float the idea of agricultural reform and the potentially devastating impact the reforms he is intent on implementing would have on agriculture, particularly in Ireland. I wish the Minister well in the talks. She is a formidable operator but the Government&rsquo;s commitment to agriculture is not as strong as it used to be. I get the impression from most Members of both Houses that that the priority which many communities in Ireland give to agriculture is not as strong with Government as was formerly the case. It is a sign of the times and the way this country has changed. We cannot allow a situation to develop whereby agriculture is sacrificed for the benefit of other sectors.</P>
      <P>Senator Daly is correct that many thousands of people are still directly employed in agriculture as farmers or in other rural services that support agriculture. We must do as much as we can to ensure their employment remains viable and <Col N="284"/>intact. The most fundamental way to ensure rural Ireland survives is to ensure people are involved in agriculture.</P>
      <P>Much hot air, waffle and nonsense is spoken about the Common Agricultural Policy. Much of it has been regurgitated in this House today, including the bull we occasionally hear that the CAP has detrimental effects on agriculture in Third World countries. Agriculture exists in many Third World countries purely due to the preferential treatment they receive from the EU in terms of receiving European prices for their products. I am thinking in particular of the recent sugar reform proposals, which will have their most devastating effect in many of the Third World countries that used to receive the European sugar price. They will see complete collapse, as we are seeing in Ireland. Senator Callanan said we might get two more campaigns out of it in this country. That would be very convenient to get past the next general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan"><NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is merely a fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>It was shocking that the Government and many of the farming lobby groups raised the white flag on the sugar sector. Over 3,000 farmers are directly involved, not including the people working in the plants and in transportation. It was given up at the drop of a hat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is incorrect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Now we are told that the bulk of the compensation to come to Ireland as a result of the abandonment of thesugar sector could go to Greencore. What a disgrace that would be. I accept that the deal has been done but I do not accept that it had to go the way it did and I do not accept the waffle that passes for comment from people who say this deal is being done to benefit poor producers in Third World countries. The benefits of this, and any other fallback in the position of agriculture in the WTO talks, will be enjoyedby South American ranch owners who have thousands of acres and employ slave labour. These people have very poor standards of production, if any, and yet we saddle our producers with red tape and bureaucracy while asking them to compete at world market prices with producers who have no traceability or food safety standards.</P>
      <P>The Common Agricultural Policy has been a success for the EU because it has ensured European consumers have relatively cheap, safe food. As supporters &mdash; and I am a staunch supporter &mdash; of the CAP we should not be afraid to say that. At a time when farmers have had to undergo this dramatic change with decoupling &mdash; and we have seen many payments, but not enough of them, in the last week or so &mdash; they are being presented with anotherpotential reform of the CAP if Mr. Mandelson gets his way. I ask the Minister to ensure he does not get his way. We will give what<Col N="285"/>ever support we can in either House or in Europe. We all know the British Government&rsquo;s attitude to farmers. It would prefer if there were no farmers. The British Labour Party does not get agricultural votes and does not care about agriculture, but in this country we do care about agriculture. The Minister has a difficult task and I wish her the best of luck. I hope she will have the full support of her colleagues in Government because up to now she has not had enough support from them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators for their participation in this debate. As always with agriculture we have strayed from the point, but it was all done in earnest. On the WTO, all parties are supportive of not going beyond the Council mandate that sets the parameters within which we work. I reiterate that we have gone as far as we can go in the green box on domestic support. We have agreed to phase out export refunds but there must be a parallel or reciprocity. We have concerns about the market access parameters beyond which we cannot go.</P>
      <P>On domestic support we want to see other reforms, not what it may be in the future. That is why I have concerns with, for example, the farm Bill, which has not even been on the floor of Congress so we do not know what the outcome will be.</P>
      <P>On food aid, the philosophy of the Irish Government and others is that cash is more appropriate. My Department gives food aid through the Food and Agriculture Organisation by way of cash payments. On market access there must be a parallel process and a balanced approach. I think everybody here will agree with my view on this.</P>
      <P>The issue of beef has been debated here. Beef is imported into the EU because we have a beef deficit. I have expressed my concerns about this to the Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection, Mr. Kyprianou, and asked for a review on the basis of the bans we have implemented in the EU on foot and mouth disease.</P>
      <P>I agree that equal standards should apply to all but it will be difficult to ensure this happens. For less-developed countries that wish and need to achieve food safety and security standards we have aid for trade to support people who do not have the wherewithal to achieve that level. That has been a big issue for agencies such as Tr&oacute;caire and is the right way forward, but Brazil is not a developing nation in the context of agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>If there is to be free trade &mdash; and there are issues about free market access and bottoming out prices &mdash; there are winners and losers. If others refuse to import Brazilian beef, why should we? Why can we not export to the <Col N="286"/>US, Japan and North Korea? Our farmers are prepared to be competitive and ensure quality and standards but they must have a balanced approach. That is needed in the WTO talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan"><NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not being facetious but there is a naive view about the sugar deal. We had to reform the sugar sector because of the WTO talks before us and because we lost the WTO panel. I agree that this is where supporting less-developed countries becomes difficult and complex. The ACP countries asked us as a Council not to change the price. We have not seen the full outcome of the Everything but Arms agreement and the deal will not be finalised until 2009. It gives preferential treatment to developing nations, but the sugar regime will undermine this to some extent. A package of supports will be required for these people. These are the complexities of some naive views that the way this should be done is through an open market access process.</P>
      <P>With regard to the deal I made on behalf of the Government, we were very much part of the bloc of 11 member states which opposed the reforms. At a certain time on the Wednesday evening I knew some had left and others were leaving. We were going to lose our power and my view was that we should reach the best deal possible. On the basis of the prices set over four years, I knew we would not be in a position to produce beet. As a result, we received different treatment with regard to diversification to the amount of &euro;44 million, and we have a two-year determinant of &euro;145 million under the restructuring fund. We also have a single farm payment.</P>
      <P>No decision has been made on the restructuring fund, but a minimum of 10% will be allocated to growers. I must make a balanced decision and allow all those involved in the sector to put their views to me. A decision will be made at that stage. I am favourably disposed to supporting farmers and those involved in contracting alike.</P>
      <P>Other issues have not been thought about, such as the implications for feed costs for farmers, as we will not be producing our own sugar beet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan"><NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The opportunity is still there for those in the beet sector to remain for a two-year period. I negotiated the best deal I could get in the face of adversity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan"><NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear. The Minister certainly did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will do all I can to support alternative ways to sustain agriculture, which were discussed today. With regard to the reform of the CAP, we have changed to become very <Col N="287"/>much focused on market, consumer and quality. That is how the agricultural sector will survive.</P>
      <P>We must deal with issues such as substantial transformation, and I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s comments on this issue. I thank Senators for supporting within the Irish Medicines Board (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2005 the need for labelling of country of origin. We must work on this framework, which is the vision for agriculture. I do not agree with the grim reaper reports for 2025. I agree with the report of the Agri Vision 2015 Committee, which was chaired by an eminent former Minister from Fine Gael. I will take on board many of its recommendations and work with them in the background on the reform of the CAP and the outcome of the WTO talks.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to commend everybody involved in the single farm payment, including the farming organisations, Teagasc, my own Department and advisers who facilitated the 136,000 farmers in Ireland. Last Thursday, 85% of these farmers were given their payment. This figure has risen and some 113,000 of the 136,000 have now been given the payment. There was a telephone issue on Friday morning as there was a bug in the system. We were not sick but we had a problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister was sick on Monday morning also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Those who did not receive payment were contacted by the Department over the weekend and during the week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I can vouch that the Minister is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not wrong as the work was paid for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I was one of the people in question and I was not contacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>With respect, the Senator should have had a perfect application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I had. They cannot find anything wrong with it.</P>

	<P>The Minister without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Some issues exist but they are not insurmountable, and they can be dealt with. We will do our utmost to ensure the remaining necessary funding for farmers will be dealt with as quickly as possible. Agriculture is a priority for me and all my colleagues within my parliamentary party and the Government. Agriculture is a necessity for the economic development of this country, be it the agrifood industry, where 50,000 people work, or the farming sector, where 136,000 <Col N="288"/>work. It is my view and intention to support alternative and different types of enterprise, quality and access to markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>There will be an announcement in the budget this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to see import substitution in the vegetable market, for instance, in which we are involved. An onion growing initiative was launched last Friday in north County Dublin, as we invest in import substitution in the horticultural sector and organic food.</P>
      <P>The consumer will ultimately determine how agriculture develops. The consumer expects quality, standards and safety. This does not necessarily come at a cheap price. We should strike a balance between both of these factors. We must reduce prices but not by sacrificing agricultural safety and food safety. The reduction of funding within the Vote for the Department of Agriculture and Food is not because food safety is taken lightly but is a result of a large reduction in diseases such as BSE and brucellosis, and a further reduction in tuberculosis. A substantial sum of money has been made available through the Department of Finance for supporting agriculture.</P>
      <P>We need some cool heads on the nitrates issue. I have provided a substantial package in the farm waste management and dairy hygiene scheme. Last week, I announced funding of &euro;4 million to deal with the poultry and pig sectors. I wish to take this opportunity to reduce the concerns of those involved in REPS, in particular, on the use of organics, such as slurry, being more beneficial than purchasing fertiliser. I support the pig industry in particular and assure those involved that the Department will not be overly bureaucratic or controlling on this matter. I am working with farmers to ensure progress will be made.</P>
      <P>Directives make certain impositions, and one might question the reason for these. I do not agree that farmers are the main pollutant of farm land and water courses. There are many other factors involved. We must put our house in order and deal with the issue. A balance must be struck between agriculture&rsquo;s sustainability and the environment. I intend to pursue and support this goal. The custodians of the environment are ultimately those who own the land, who are mainly farmers.</P>
      <P>We will work towards this goal in a more sustainable manner, and I look forward to the support of all colleagues across the parties to ensure that a valuable and important industry is supported at home with new initiatives and financial support, as well as the WTO talks. These talks will be difficult, and I assure Members I will do my utmost to support and nurture agriculture. We will not sell out agriculture for other beneficial trade liberalisation policies. We will balance this goal with the need to support developing nations and those less well off, who may not be in the positions they should be.</P><Col N="289"/>

    <Title>Budget Statement 2005: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
      <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann notes the Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P el="0">I am pleased to have the opportunity on budget day to outline the provisions of the 2006 budget to Senators and to listen to the debate. The measures announced in today&rsquo;s budget build on the sound economic policies consistently pursued by this Government over the past nine years.</P>
      <P>As the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, emphasised, this country has made remarkable economic and social progress. This budget aims to consolidate this progress and to provide the right framework for continued prosperity for future generations. It strikes an appropriate balance between the objectives of promoting sustainable economic growth and improving equity and opportunity for all our people.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The budget prioritises measures to meet these objectives through a strategy with the following key elements &mdash; investment in infrastructure and education; addressing the needs of older people; supporting the less well-off and helping those on average and lower incomes; targeting families with children in a new five-year child care package; introducing measures to safeguard the environment; and promoting equity in the tax system through changes to tax reliefs and reducing tax and other burdens on the enterprise sector, particularly smaller firms.</P>
      <P>Before outlining the main budget items, I will set out the broad economic outlook for Ireland. As a small open economy, our fortunes are determined to a large extent by developments in the international economy. The good news about the international economic situation is that commentators are forecasting strong global growth over the next few years. This should mean that markets for goods and services produced here in Ireland will grow more strongly. The challenge for us is to manage our affairs so we can avail of these opportunities. The budget aims to create and maintain the right framework conditions so that Irish firms and employees can exploit these opportunities.</P>
      <P>While the overall international outlook is a positive one, there are risk factors which could throw this off course. The oil market remains tight and further price rises cannot be ruled out. The imbalances in the global economy, including the US, continue to persist and widen. There are <Col N="290"/>signs of a pick-up in the euro area but this remains somewhat fragile. All of these factors are outside our control. We must remain vigilant and ensure that we retain the necessary headroom and flexibility to cope with any adverse external shock. We can take encouragement from the fact that our economy showed its resilience and flexibility in the international downturn at the turn of the century. The budget will support and nurture these features of our economy.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Turning to the domestic situation, it is clear that the economic background to this budget is a very favourable one. Economic growth remains strong, with GDP growth this year estimated at 4.6% and GNP at 4.8%. In the stability programme update published today, the Department forecasts continued robust growth of between 4.5% and 5% over the 2006 to 2008 period. The economy&rsquo;s ability to create jobs continues to exceed expectations. With Central Statistics Office employment data now available for the first three quarters of 2005, it is estimated that total employment will grow by 89,000 or 4.7% for the year as a whole. The total number of people at work in the economy is now approximately 2 million, which is a remarkable performance. Strong growth is projected in 2006 and later years and the economy will maintain its effective full employment status. Inflation has come down. This year, the Department expects that our inflation rate will be in line with, or even slightly below, the euro area average on a comparable basis. Over the next few years, low inflation is expected to prevail, with the consumer price index rising by 2.5% on average. The public finances are sound. We will achieve our budget targets for 2005. Our debt-GDP ratio will be 28% at year end, compared with over 63% in 1997.</P>
      <P>The budgetary targets are for a general Government deficit next year of 0.6% and a debt-GDP ratio remaining at 28%. Total public expenditure will exceed &euro;50 billion. Capital spending will be close to 5% of GNP, the highest rate in the EU. With such a high level of planned expenditure, the Minister rightly put significant emphasis on the Government&rsquo;s intention to ensure value for the taxpayers&rsquo; money and drew attention to the measures he has recently put in place to bring this about.</P>
      <P>The Minister devoted a considerable proportion of his statement to the priority area of investment in infrastructure. As Members will have noted, he announced a total funding envelope of some &euro;43.5 billion for investment over the period 2006 to 2010. Of this, some &euro;5.5 billion will be funded by public private partnerships, thereby harnessing private sector involvement and expertise in the task of improving our capital stock. This funding will support investment across a range of key economic and social infrastructure areas including health, housing, culture, transport and education.</P><Col N="291"/>
<?oasys _fc ?>
      <P>Of particular note was the Minister&rsquo;s announcement of a new &euro;300 million, five-year innovation fund for the higher education sector. Coupled with an allocation of &euro;900 million for investment in university and institute of technology facilities, the Government has committed some &euro;1.2 billion to this sector up to 2010. This investment is a critical plank of the Government&rsquo;s strategy to promote the knowledge economy.</P>
      <P>The overall funding envelope announced by the Minister also includes some &euro;14 billion for the first five years of the recently launched Transport 21 plan. This shows the Government&rsquo;s commitment to this vital plan, which aims to develop a world-class transport infrastructure for our country. This commitment of resources means that the implementation of the plan can get under way in 2006. The Minister gave examples of the many critical road and public transport projects in Dublin and throughout the country where work will commence or continue in 2006.</P>
      <P>On the subject of capital investment, I will take this opportunity to say a few words about the plans of my own office, the Office of Public Works, which continues to deliver many capital and construction projects. The OPW capital budget for 2006 is &euro;400 million, of which just over 50% is in respect of decentralisation.</P>
      <P>As Members will be aware, the decentralisation programme is by far the largest and most wide-ranging in the history of the State, involving the relocation of over 10,000 civil and public service jobs to some 53 locations in 25 counties. A capital envelope of over &euro;800 million has been set aside over the next number of years for decentralisation. As it falls to me to oversee this programme, I am pleased to inform the Seanad that a considerable amount of work has already taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>In many cases, sites have been acquired, and as Members are no doubt aware, some contracts have already been placed. Tenders for construction on a design-build basis have been sought in a number of cases, including the OPW in Trim, County Meath. Members can expect to see a constant flow of tender invitations over the coming months.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the staffing side of the decentralisation programme is also proceeding steadily. To date, decentralising staff have already moved in advance parties to five locations around the country. These locations are Portlaoise, Sligo, Na Forbacha in Galway, Thurles and Tipperary town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>Further staff will move to a wide selection of locations in 2006, including 130 staff <Col N="292"/>of the Department of Finance who will move to Tullamore.</P>
      <P>The level of interest in decentralisation continues to be very strong and the central applications facility remains open for new applications. An average of 100 new applications have been received every month for the past 14 months. These 1,400 new applications are in addition to the 9,200 applications received in the priority period up to September 2004. New applications are expected to continue as preparations for the individual moves intensify within decentralising organisations. Many people have transferred to the decentralising organisations in preparation for the transfer to the country. To date, over 800 staff have been assigned to their new decentralising posts. In the meantime, staff wishing to remain in Dublin have moved to posts which will not transfer. I emphasise again that the Government will ensure that the entire programme proceeds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to social welfare provisions, the Minister emphasised his belief that a primary function of Government is to protect and support the weaker sections of society. He backed up his words by announcing a social welfare package with a full-year cost of some &euro;1,120 million. The Minister reaffirmed the Government&rsquo;s commitment to supporting older people. He announced an increase of &euro;14 per week in the old age contributory pension, bringing it to &euro;193.30 per week. We are now well on our way to meeting the commitment in the programme for Government to increase the State pension to &euro;200 per week by 2007.</P>
      <P>A particularly imaginative feature of the Minister&rsquo;s statement was the announcement of a package of measures to provide care and support services for older people in their homes and communities. For those in need of nursing home care, the nursing home subvention scheme will also be improved. At a full year cost of &euro;150 million, these measures should go a long way towards improving the quality of life for older people.</P>
      <P>As regards other social welfare recipients, the Minister announced an increase of &euro;17 in weekly rates. This works out at an increase of 11%, some four times the projected rate of inflation. On child benefit, the Minister increased rates to &euro;150 for the first and second child and to &euro;185 for third and subsequent children. This fulfils the commitment given by the Minister in last year&rsquo;s budget.</P>
      <P>The needs of carers have also been acknowledged in this budget. The carer&rsquo;s allowance has been increased as have the income disregards associated with the allowance. Carer&rsquo;s benefit has been extended and will be payable for up to two years and there is a 20% increase in the respite care grant to &euro;1,200.</P>
      <P>This generous and innovative package of improvements will go a long way towards reliev<Col N="293"/>ing the pressures faced by families, older people and those on low incomes. I recall that in the debate in this House on the budget last year, Senators expressed a degree of disappointment with the Government&rsquo;s approach to the child care issue. It is appropriate therefore to devote some remarks to this area, one of the highlights of this year&rsquo;s budget.</P>
      <P>The Minister outlined the wide range of considerations to be borne in mind in addressing this complex and multifaceted issue. He announced an integrated strategy comprising measures to increase the supply of child care places and to assist parents in meeting the substantial costs involved. On the supply side, the five year national child care investment programme will build on, and expand, the successful equal opportunities child care programme leading to the creation of an additional 50,000 child care places by 2010.</P>
      <P>The Government plans to spend almost &euro;800 million on this programme in a mixture of capital and current funding over the period 2006-10. The obvious need this will generate for further qualified and expert child care personnel will be supported by increased funding for training, which will facilitate the training of more than 17,000 workers over the period.</P>
      <P>Mindful of the importance of the first year of life to a child&rsquo;s development, the Minister also announced a phased extension of paid maternity leave to six months by 2007. In addition, unpaid maternity leave is also to be increased by eight weeks over 2006 and 2007. Of course, these measures, particularly those dealing with supply, will take some time to come to fruition.</P>
      <P>The Government was also concerned to provide assistance to the parents of younger children, who can find themselves under particular financial pressure. Having examined all of the issues carefully, the Minister announced a new early child care supplement of &euro;1,000 per annum in respect of all children under six years of age. By any standards, this is a generous response to the child care needs of parents.</P>
      <P>The effect of both this measure and the increased rates of child benefit is that, for example, a family with two children under the age of six will receive a total amount of &euro;5,600 per annum. I look forward to hearing the reaction of Members to a comprehensive and integrated approach to this complex issue.</P>
      <P>Expenditure measures are not the only means to assist people on low incomes. This budget continues the Government&rsquo;s approach of using the tax system to target those on the minimum wage and on average incomes. Through a combination of increases in both the employee and basic personal tax credits, the Minister has ensured that those on the current minimum wage will stay outside the tax net in 2006. He also increased the income tax exemption limit for persons aged over 65, again illustrating the depth of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to supporting older people.</P><Col N="294"/>
      <P>For those on average earnings, the Minister has raised the standard rate income tax band by some &euro;2,600, well ahead of inflation. This should ensure that those on the projected average industrial wage in 2006 will pay income tax at the lower rate. The increases in tax credits for widowed persons, blind persons, incapacitated children, dependent relatives and those aged 65 or over are further evidence of the Governments commitment to supporting the most vulnerable in Irish society.</P>
      <P>The tax allowance available for the employment of a person to care for a family member has also been increased significantly to &euro;50,000 per annum, an increase of over 60%. The total cost of these measures, plus others announced by the Minister, is &euro;900 million on a full year basis.</P>
      <P>In his statement, the Minister also announced the results of the major reviews of tax undertaken over the past year. The review process involved detailed examination of the various reliefs as well as extensive public consultation. In reaching decisions, the Government had to balance the imperative that all tax residents should pay tax appropriate to their ability against the need to use the tax system to promote development.</P>
      <P>The result of the review process is the termination of several reliefs that have either served their purpose or are no longer cost effective in meeting their objectives. The decisions taken reflect the consideration that much has been achieved in the areas and sectors supported by these tax reliefs, and their greater capacity to support investment without such incentives in the future.</P>
      <P>The reliefs in question are largely property based. In view of the importance of the construction sector for economic activity and employment, the Minister has wisely put in place transitional measures. The gradual phasing out of reliefs over the period to 2008 will ensure that we do not do anything unhelpful to employment in this important sector of our economy. As well as terminating some tax reliefs, the Minister also took action aimed at avoiding circumstances where high-earners reduce their taxable income to nil through the use of certain reliefs.</P>
      <P>There has been much talk recently at home and abroad about the role of agriculture in developed economies such as Ireland&rsquo;s. The Minister in his speech highlighted the vital contribution of the agriculture sector to our economy and to enriching Irish life in general. I wholeheartedly echo the Minister&rsquo;s views. The Estimates and the budget continue to recognise this vital contribution and offer significant support to farmers to safeguard the future of the sector at a time when there are significant external pressures to reduce certain supports and open markets fully to competition.</P>
      <P>At &euro;1,280 million, the multi-annual capital framework 2006-10 for the Department of Agriculture and Food represents an increase of &euro;175 million on the corresponding framework for <Col N="295"/>2005-09 published in last year&rsquo;s budget. Within the envelope significant provision has been made for improvements to the farm waste management scheme to support farmers in meeting the cost of on-farm investment required to achieve the targets set in Ireland&rsquo;s nitrates action plan.</P>
      <P>The package of tax reliefs for farmers that the Minister announced today are wide-ranging and will offer support to farmers, in particular young farmers. The package comprises the following measures &mdash; the extension of the young trained farmer stamp duty relief for a further three years; separate reliefs on capital acquisitions tax, capital gains tax retirement and stamp duty in respect of the EU single farm payment entitlement scheme; an increase in the farm pollution control relief to a maximum of &euro;50,000; and an increase in the exemption for income from certain farm leases to &euro;12,000 per annum for leases of between five and seven years and &euro;15,000 for leases of seven years or more. This package will cost over &euro;22 million next year and is further evidence of the Government&rsquo;s continued strong commitment to the agricultural sector in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Farmers are key guardians of our countryside. I am pleased that the Government&rsquo;s package of measures to support the safeguarding of the environment also presents opportunities for them, in particular the measures announced by the Minister to encourage the use of biofuels.</P>
      <P>Members will have been interested to hear the Minister&rsquo;s intentions for the reform of the budgetary process. His proposals include the discussion of a three-year economic and fiscal outlook with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service in January, and the publication of an update of these projections in the autumn by the Department of Finance. From 2007, the proposals also envisage the publication of annual statements by Ministers on their Departments&rsquo; outputs and objectives and of the out-turns from 2008. The relevant Oireachtas committees will examine these statements. These proposals will increase the opportunity for the Houses to debate the important issues around the generation and use of taxpayers&rsquo; money. I hope these proposals will be welcomed all round.</P>
      <P>The budget presented by the Minister is one that provides the basis for continuing improvements in our economy and society. As the Minister said in his address, today&rsquo;s budget is progressive. We are not resting on the laurels of Ireland&rsquo;s recent economic success. This budget is balanced, not only in the fiscal or financial sense but also in advancing the aspirations of our people. Through substantial investment in infrastructure, the budget will secure our future and provide the basis for sustained economic growth and improvements in quality of life. Through generous improvements in social welfare and changes to taxation, it will help build a fairer and more inclusive society.</P><Col N="296"/>
      <P>In short, the budget embodies a vision of continuing to improve the quality of life for all Irish citizens. This is the most obvious and important measure of our success.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, to the House. His presence here on statements on the budget is becoming an annual event. I am conscious that tonight several television news programmes will have polls on the budget. I hope the Minister of State or any of his colleagues do not have their mobile telephones with them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Not surprisingly, I am not as overawed or impressed as the Minister of State is with the budget measures. We are disappointed in that what was promised on different items was not in the final budget. The scale&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>That side is disappointed because it is such a good budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and depth of commitment given by the Government to different initiatives is disappointing.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State is correct in stating that the public finances have never been better. The amounts of money coming into the State coffers on a weekly basis have never been more. However, the cynicism and the justified criticism of the public towards Government spending have never been higher. I will not rehash the various incidents of scandalous waste of public funds that the Government has engaged in over the course of the last 12 months, let alone the past eight years. However, I see nothing in this budget which leads me to believe there will be a significant improvement in that regard.</P>
      <P>Several announcements are welcome such as the Minister for Finance going before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and Public Service in January to discuss the budget measures. This reform of the budgetary process is a step in the right direction. However, there is no fundamental change as to how public funds are spent and often scandalously misused.</P>
      <P>There was a brouhaha about child care on the Order of Business. I noted, at one point, Senator White was rapturous in the Gallery during the Budget Statement. However, I am flatly disappointed by what the budget contains for this area. <Col N="297"/>The promises of what parents of younger children were led to believe would come in the budget have not materialised. I acknowledge the &euro;1,000 payment is a significant step in the right direction, but it is a mere drop in the ocean when compared with the amounts of money young families must fork out for child care facilities.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State referred to decentralisation. However, it is clear that what was promised in the budget before the last local elections has not been delivered. It now cannot be delivered because the timeframe has elapsed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator in favour of decentralisation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am in favour of decentralisation. On that budget night I supported it in my speech. However, it illustrates a sincere commitment being made with a timeframe being put in place but still not delivered upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>The timeframe is spot on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are now asked to believe this five-year plan for child care and the ten-year plan for Transport 21 will be delivered on time and within budget. The Minister of State must understand the degree of cynicism on the public&rsquo;s part that these initiatives will not be delivered upon within the schedule announced today. While the announcement on child care is a step in the right direction, it may, like decentralisation, simply end up stumbling from one crisis to another.</P>
      <P>The increase in the carer&rsquo;s allowance was another slightly welcome announcement as this group was particularly neglected and forgotten. The Government led many in carers&rsquo; organisations to believe the means test issue was to be tackled, but it has not been. The majority of those who care for people in their own home are not eligible for a carer&rsquo;s allowance because of the current means test. Today, this could have been dealt with in the budget by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I welcome the reduction in duty on home heating oil, which is another positive move. I have often asked the Minister for Finance to increase the fuel allowance. While it was raised significantly today, sadly it was not enough. The cost of most fuels has almost doubled in the past 18 months. It will not meet the increase in fuel costs faced by the elderly, resulting in the increase being wiped out even before people have got it in their pockets.</P>
      <P>The changes in VRT relief for flexi-fuel cars are like Alanna McCree&rsquo;s dog, it goes a bit of the road with everyone. This is a slight step in the right direction but just a little nudge forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator John Phelan is stuck for words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have always highlighted the increases faced by motorists in duty and motor tax. The VRT regime must be rebalanced, whereby those who use their cars more, pay more, while those who use them less, pay less. A flat charge for all car users is inequitable and must be examined.</P>
      <P>I was amused when the Minister claimed that because the Government did not raise the VAT rate this year, it showed its commitment to keeping inflation down. Ireland has one of the highest VAT rates in Europe. While the Government does not like to admit it, it increased the rate in its period in office. This was an area that could have seen useful changes.</P>
      <P>The Government&rsquo;s main failure is not giving a commitment to reduce the number of those paying income tax at the higher rate. There was some tinkering around the edges today. The Government committed itself to having 20% of the working population paying tax at the top level. As matters stand, approximately 35% of employees pay tax at the top rate, a figure which will not be significantly reduced by today&rsquo;s announcement. This is another example of a broken Government promise.</P><Col N="299"/>
      <?oasys _cl11.7- ?>
      <P>Contrary to the image projected, almost &euro;4,000 in additional taxation has been imposed on every household this year. Notwithstanding all the spin, this budget will not significantly reduce this figure and households will continue to face increased charges. I hold up my hands and admit the budget makes some steps in the right direction but considerable room for improvement remains. If the Minister had focused his attention on two or three areas rather than trying to satisfy everyone, he could have achieved a hell of a lot more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a heaven of a lot in this budget and as Government finance spokesperson in the Seanad, I am proud to speak on it. This budget has few downsides, as it contains no indirect taxation increases and includes some tax cuts. I suspect part of the motive for these cuts was to eliminate smuggling on the Border and build a single energy market on the island, a project on which the Leader worked as Minister for Public Enterprise.</P>
      <P>The budget is a reflection of the excellent management of the economy over a long period. In only one year since 2002, including the current year, has there been a general Government deficit and even that was small. Growth rates, at 5% in 2004 and 2005 and with a projected figure of slightly under 5% for 2006, are highly satisfactory. The workforce has increased to almost 2 million and we will soon have 1 million more people in work than in 1987. Inflation is under 3%. As we saw in Britain just two days ago, budget-making in most countries is a struggle to make ends meet and one which governments frequently barely accomplish. Governments here knew all about this problem in the past.</P>
      <P>While the credit for the current financial position stretches back through all the Governments that have been in power over the past 20 years, the current incumbents have been in charge for the past eight years. The credit must also be shared with the social partners. I have the highest admiration for the social partnership process which has repeatedly, even in the most recent times, proved its usefulness and value. I hope the budget, together with the discussions taking place on Irish Ferries, will be the prelude to the start of new social partnership negotiations.</P>
      <P>I am sure other Senators wish to speak about the child care initiative, the centrepiece of the budget. I pay tribute to Senators, particularly my colleague, Senator White, for highlighting the issue of child care. Senator Minihan also deserves thanks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to be an afterthought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Child benefit has increased to &euro;150 per month for first and second children and &euro;185 per month for subsequent children, a signifi<Col N="300"/>cant improvement on the 1997 figures of &pound;30 and &pound;39, respectively. The budget also provides for a special payment for children aged under six years. Increases in paid and unpaid maternity leave mean women may take practically a year off work following the birth of a child. The budget also includes an important child care investment programme and having been present at the opening of family resource centres around the country, it is clear the programme will play a significant role. The &euro;10,000 tax-free exemption for people who mind children at home has not yet been highlighted but may be as significant as any other measure in this area. In a sense, this initiative formalises the informal economy but there is no harm in that.</P>
      <P>Contributory pensions have been increased by 8% to close to &euro;200 per week, while the non-contributory pension has been increased by 9.6%. With increases in another lower social welfare payment of &euro;17, the Inchydoney agenda clearly continues. The percentage increase in social welfare benefits of 11% is far ahead of inflation. All of us will remember that, with the exception of the late 1980s and early 1990s when a Fianna F&aacute;il Government took steps to fulfil the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare report, general social welfare increases prior to 1997 tended to be between 2% and 4%. We have greatly exceeded this range which is an excellent development.</P>
      <P>The focus of tax measures is to remove the lower paid from the tax net. As the figures demonstrate, every budget since 2002 has been strictly progressive. In the past three years, the European Commission has stated several times that Ireland has the most favourable taxation system of any country in the European Union for those on low to middle incomes. However, the Fine Gael spokesperson is worried about the poor people earning high incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am concerned about those whose income is barely above the threshold for the top income tax rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Anyone who is barely in the higher band will only pay the top rate on a tiny amount of income. The Senator should consider his logic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not worry about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad we did not hear anything about stealth taxes because if one measures the expansion of the standard rate band from this budget back to 2002, one finds it is fully in line with the rate of inflation. It is prudent that Governments maintain a certain degree of flexibility to increase bands above or below the rate of inflation, depending on the circumstances.</P><Col N="301"/>
      <P>A marked feature of the budget, which should particularly recommend itself to more left-wing minded Senators, is the decision to phase out or cap the various tax incentives to ensure wealthy people contribute to the tax yield. To be fair to most wealthy people, they contribute a great deal in taxation, as most figures indicate, but there are some who use tax incentives to avoid paying any income tax. Two incentives on which there has been particular focus are the tax exemption for artists and writers who will now be able to earn &euro;250,000 tax free, a change which substantially leaves the spirit of the exemption intact, and the phasing out of the exemption for stallion fees. The regime to replace this exemption must, I regret, be negotiated.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business this morning, the House discussed rail services, on which the Budget Statement includes a number of specific announcements. I am pleased the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, referred to the decentralisation programme, including decentralisation to County Tipperary. In recent days, a sustained attempt has been made to rubbish the programme but it is on track, certainly as far as County Tipperary is concerned, and has delivered substantial benefits. May that continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the budget and I also welcome the opportunity to say a few words about it. It is always difficult to assimilate such an enormous amount of information in such a short time, but there are certain matters we sought on the record and against which we can measure to see where we currently stand.</P>
      <P>In the main, I welcome this budget as a progressive measure containing some important steps forward that we had sought. I do not agree completely with Senator Mansergh on the transport provisions. There were specific references to transport, but they are vague and it is difficult to understand quite what they meant. Specific projects were mentioned, but the budget speech was less than specific in terms of the level of support to be provided for them.</P>
      <P>I raised specific requirements on the issue of child care in the House recently. I stated that at the end of the day I was looking for five things. The first two things I sought were an increase in maternity leave to 26 weeks and an increase in unpaid paternity leave to 26 weeks also. I am delighted that a commitment has been given to do that over two years, and that half of it will occur this year. That step is progressive, important and welcome. Many people will certainly look forward to it.</P>
      <P>Senator John Paul Phelan referred to the &euro;1,000 supplement as a payment, but I presume it is vouched for against a payment for child care as opposed to a cheque that is being handed out. <Col N="302"/>Either way it is important because for those seeking child care payments it represents close to &euro;2,000 before tax, which is what they would have had to pay for that previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I think it is a cheque.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Whichever way it comes, it saves them &euro;2,000 of after tax income, which is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I also think the &euro;10,000 relief is welcome. Whoever tried to work out the cost in the Department of Finance, however, I would bet my house that they have underestimated it. Nobody knows the way that Irish people can flexibly use that kind of an arrangement and it may well be for use in their own houses. It is good, however, because it legitimises something that people have been forcing themselves to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Quite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome those aspects of the budget. The Minister did not mention any proper accreditation system for the child care package. This is very important because once we start creating choice for parents, we must ensure that some checks and balances are included. Both Senator O&rsquo;Meara and myself have regularly raised that important point. I note from the Budget Statement that people availing of the &euro;10,000 break on taxation must register with the county committee on child care, or whatever its official title is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a welcome step. The Minister also said that the county committee on child care would be in a position to give information, support and small grants in order to make it happen, but we need to hear more about that. I have no doubt that Senator O&rsquo;Meara will have questions to ask about this as well. I would like to know how that proposal will work. I am glad there is a registration process, but I would look for an awful lot more.</P>
      <P>More than anything else, I regret that there is no clear commitment or objective to introduce some process for a formal, structured pre-school arrangement. The Department of Education and Science is mentioned, but such a process is missing and should be included. While I welcome some aspects of the budget, I feel that other matters are lacking.</P>
      <P>I note that the proposal to create 50,000 child care places is scheduled to occur over the next four years up to 2010, but I do not know how that will work and I certainly want to hear more about <Col N="303"/>it. It seems to be a tax break of some form or another, but I am not a bit convinced by it.</P>
      <P>The Leader will recall that recently when we discussed the OECD report on tertiary education, I had some grievous problems with it. One of my objections to the report was that it restricted PhDs to universities. I think Senator Mansergh agreed with me at the time that there was a strong case for linking the institutes of technology into it, as that is where the research and development will take place. I am glad to see that, according to my reading of what the Minister has said in the budget speech, he is now putting it up, as it were, to pitch for it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, that is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and create what he describes as fourth level education, which I am somewhat amused by. Whatever fourth level might be, I would like to see it established that institutes of technology have as much access to PhD courses as traditional universities. That is very important. As a representative of graduates, I liked the Minister&rsquo;s positive words about the quality of Irish graduates. I always knew my electorate were fine people and it is nice to hear that confirmed.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Over the past two years, I have asked that the minimum wage be taken out of the tax net. Last year and the year before, I deplored the fact that this was not done. I note that those on the minimum wage are out of the tax net this year. While I welcome that step, I think it is too late. One may say that I am being curmudgeonly about this, but nonetheless, this measure will give confidence to lower paid workers. I wish that the provision had come in last year&rsquo;s budget but, late as it is, I do welcome it as a positive step to which people will look forward.</P>
      <P>In as much as I welcome the minimum wage being taken out of the tax net, I have also criticised the Government for the fact that the super rich could get themselves into a situation of paying no tax at all. I welcome the fact that that loophole is now being closed off, although I am not sure how. As I recall it, the Minister referred in his budget speech to complex legislation that would be necessary to achieve this, but I am convinced that he will do it. The matter needs to be examined.</P>
      <P>Senator John Paul Phelan welcomed the budgetary measures concerning home heating oil. I hope he is right in what he said, but I thought the Minister referred specifically to kerosene and LPG while not mentioning diesel, which is the main home heating oil. Have I missed something or is it a typographical matter? Did the Minister refer to kerosene as including diesel? I would like to know what the situation is in that regard.</P><Col N="304"/>
      <P>Twice in the past month, I spoke about the need to provide grants for alternative domestic energy. The Minister referred to this in his speech and stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">To help develop a better focus on renewable energy my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources intends to launch several innovative grant schemes relating to biofuels [I would like to hear a lot about that], combined heat and power, biomass commercial heaters and domestic renewable heat grants.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The important word there is &ldquo;domestic&rdquo;, which should mean that if someone wants to install a waste water management system, solar panels or thermal heating in his or her home, a grant will now be available to do so. Senator Ryan has also referred to this point. Such a system might now be introduced in the same way as people received home improvement grants under certain conditions in the 1970s and 1980s. I think that is what the Minister was saying, but I would like it to be confirmed.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator John Paul Phelan that an opportunity was missed to reduce the extraordinarily high rate of VAT. That could and should have been done and this budget was the time to do so because it was probably the best opportunity we will ever have.</P>
      <P>I welcome two aspects of the budget concerning openness. I am attracted to the new process of budgetary reform, which gives an impetus to legislators and other elected public representatives to become involved in it. I am also attracted to the idea in section B of the report, which outlines the views of consultants and others who examined the various tax-break schemes that are now being wound down. It is important for us to see that. I am sure that when we get down to examining the detail it may be overly selective, but nonetheless it is important.</P>
      <P>I do not have the option to deal with many other issues. I am not quite clear, for example, how proposals for the elderly will work out in operation. Overall, however, I must say that there is far more to welcome than to criticise in the budget. It is a progressive budget which takes the direction I have been advocating for the past year. I am supportive of it, although there are some issues about which I am unclear and others about which I am unhappy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this year&rsquo;s Budget Statement. I welcome wholeheartedly the measures announced this afternoon. Over the past 20 years, the Progressive Democrats have determinedly pursued the following objectives &mdash; economic and social policy aimed at maintaining full employment; strength<Col N="305"/>ening the competitive position of the Irish economy; keeping taxes on labour low; and focusing on the low-paid, the elderly and the vulnerable. Today&rsquo;s budget reflects that approach very clearly.</P>
      <P>On income tax, social welfare, pensions, child care and care of the elderly, the Government is delivering both the right policies and on the commitments outlined in the programme for Government. First, regarding taxation, the Government is committed to a tax policy that will expand our economy, reward work and alleviate the burden on taxpayers, especially those on lower pay. From today, we will see a &euro;270 increase in tax credits for PAYE workers. That means that a single person on the minimum wage of &euro;15,818 will pay no tax. The standard-rate band has been increased by &euro;2,600 to &euro;32,000 for a single person and to &euro;41,000 to a married one-income family and &euro;64,000 for a married two-income family. Thus, no one on the minimum wage will pay any tax in 2006, and no one on the average industrial wage will pay tax at the higher rate.</P>
      <P>In 2006, a person on the average industrial wage will have seen his or her take-home pay rise by &euro;12,600 since 1997, but that person&rsquo;s tax will have been cut by over &euro;400. After today&rsquo;s budget, for a person on the average industrial wage, the average tax rate will be 12% lower than in 1997, <?oasys _dc18- ?>at approximately 15%, compared with over 27%.<?oasys _dc0- ?> For 2006, the average industrial wage will be taken out of the higher rate of tax altogether.</P>
      <P>Those measures are further evidence of our strong commitment. The Progressive Democrats have long espoused the view that the best defender against social injustice and poverty is a job. It is the responsibility of the Government to provide a climate where the economy prospers and people are given the opportunity to create their own wealth and shape their own futures. Hard work and endeavour must be rewarded. The more jobs we create, the more revenue is generated for the vulnerable of society and to develop public services. That is the Progressive Democrats&rsquo; idea of social justice.</P>
      <P>Certain parties, particularly those of the so-called left, claim exclusive ownership of the social justice agenda. Their response to meeting social challenges often involves increasing the tax burden on Irish families, however covertly. In criticising the approach of the Progressive Democrats, and the approach taken in today&rsquo;s budget, they are criticising Irish working people for not wanting to pay more in tax.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The people of this country work hard. They must get maximum reward for their efforts and sacrifices. The Opposition decries that as the pursuit of a liberal agenda. For once, ironically, it is right. Liberal economic policy means having faith in people. The Progressive Democrats believe that people themselves are best qualified to <Col N="306"/>decide how to run their own lives and spend their own money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend the Government on framing a budget that seeks to expand our economy further, promotes enterprise, rewards workers and alleviates the burden on taxpayers, particularly those on lower pay.</P>
      <P Just="Left">With regard to the review of tax schemes and measures, the Minister has today announced appropriate changes to how those will operate. A variety schemes that have served their purpose will cease or be phased out. Furthermore, a cap will be placed on the amount of relief that any individual can claim in respect of various schemes, including the artists&rsquo; exemption scheme. That applies to people with incomes in excess of &euro;250,000. The effective tax on high-income earners will increase towards a minimum of 20%. In 2006, 40% of all tax will be paid by those earning more than &euro;100,000.</P>
      <P>As I said at the outset, the Progressive Democrats support fair tax and low tax, not what has been termed &ldquo;no tax for higher earners&rdquo;. I welcome the changes announced by the Minister in that regard.</P>
      <P>The approach correctly chosen by the last two Governments has been to promote and support economic development and prosperity, but not for its own sake. As I said, the people of this country work hard. The more that they are encouraged to work hard and prosper, the more the economy prospers and the more revenue is generated for the vulnerable of society.</P>
      <P>The contributory old-age pension has been increased by &euro;14 per week to &euro;193.30. The non-contributory old-age pension has been increased to &euro;182 per week. Furthermore, for people in receipt of the non-contributory old-age pension, earnings from employment up to &euro;100 will be disregarded for means tests. Basic social welfare payments will be increased by &euro;17 per week, from &euro;148.80 to &euro;165.80. That represents an increase that is more than four times the rate of inflation.</P>
      <P>I hope every Member will join me in welcoming these steps and congratulating the Government on taking them. There are two key areas on which I wish to focus before I conclude, child care provision and services for older people. On child care, the Government is acting wisely and fairly by reducing the burden borne by families in respect of costs. The Progressive Democrats and I have long sought taxation measures to help increase the supply of child care places. More places mean lower costs for families. Thus, I particularly welcome the &euro;10,000 income disregard for child care providers announced by the Minister today.</P><Col N="307"/>
      <P>The rate of child benefit is to rise to &euro;150 per month for the first child, and &euro;185 per month for subsequent children. A &euro;787 million child care investment programme will create an extra 50,000 child care places. Members across party lines &mdash; Senator White, Senator O&rsquo;Meara and I &mdash; have promoted and contributed to the child care debate. The Government is to introduce a phased increase in paid maternity leave from 18 to 26 weeks. There will also be a new child care payment of &euro;250 per quarter in respect of all children under the age of six.</P>
      <P>Unlike the approaches proposed by certain people, in so far as a coherent policy can be discerned, the Minister has considered all family configurations and choices. The Progressive Democrats and I have long made clear in our policy documents that we support increasing child care supply and choice for families, in conjunction with steps to alleviate the financial burdens on them. In that context, I welcome the steps outlined in the Minister&rsquo;s speech and congratulate him on them.</P>
      <P>Perhaps of most significance are the measures announced for home-delivered services and care for the elderly. Our older citizens deserve the best possible care. The Progressive Democrats have set out in its manifestoes that care for older people is a basic social duty. We first campaigned for and delivered a &euro;100 per week pension. The old-age pension is up, from &euro;99 in 1997 to &euro;193.30, announced today, meaning that it is well on the road to the &euro;200 target set out in the programme for Government.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>International research suggests that the life of a person can be extended by up to two years if care is delivered in the home, and I welcome the new measures outlined for the elderly in today&rsquo;s budget. The new &euro;150 million per annum package to support care for the elderly in their own homes represents a sea change in approach. It is the single largest increase in such funding ever. I pay tribute to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children for her dedication in this policy area. Among all politicians and policy-makers involved in ensuring the best care for older people, she has proven herself the most determined and effective, and I congratulate her on her work in promoting the measures included in today&rsquo;s budget.</P>

I welcome the aspects of the budget that are a step in a direction we agree with, and others which are at least a recognition of problems the Government pretended for years did not exist. It is fascinating that after seven years of &ldquo;McCreevyism&rdquo; the Government has discovered the possibility that the rich might not be paying any tax and that after one year of &ldquo;Cowenism&rdquo; it has discovered a way to deal with a problem Charlie McCreevy apparently failed to notice for seven years when he was running an economy in worse shape than Deputy Quinn had done in his three years as Minister for Finance.

	<P>Senator Ryan without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome a number of measures in the budget, particularly the recognition that the rich were paying no taxes. Until recently the Government&rsquo;s position was &ldquo;let them at it, let them rip&rdquo; but after a few electoral rebuffs it rediscovered its concern for equity in the tax system. That is most welcome. I recognise the delicate sensitivities of the super-rich when they hear it will be some time in January 2007 before they feel the pain of tax. That is not the timescale applied to other people when some of the lesser benefits are being cut back.</P>
      <P>I am also intrigued by the announcement of the number of schemes in the construction area which have turned out not to be worthwhile. Is it true that for the past seven or eight years nobody in the Department of Finance examined the internal rate of return and economic benefit to the State from a raft of programmes which are now to be abolished? Is it the case that they were in place for a few years to look after the buddies&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>They served their purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and now that the buddies have got rich and are spending their money outside the country, there is not much point in continuing them? One wonders about the strategy in the same way that one wonders about many other things.</P>
      <P>There are welcome aspects to the budget. Any attempt to reduce the burden of tax on people on middle incomes is very welcome but we must remind ourselves that the Government said only 20% of people would pay tax at the higher rate. That is a reasonable position. It has singularly failed to do it and has done that which it accused others of doing.</P>

	<P>The greatest act of fiction I have read in a long time is the Minister of State&rsquo;s remarks on decentralisation, which is not happening.</P>
      <P>It is astonishing that there is no longer any mention of waiting lists in Government budgetary expenditure because the Government has abolished the term &ldquo;waiting lists&rdquo;. It no longer talks about them. The 3,000 beds we were promised have now disappeared off the agenda. In a caring budget that is an astonishing admission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I will confine my remarks to the issue of child care because there is no question that this is the child care budget. It is long overdue for this Government to act. The big surprise in last year&rsquo;s budget was that it contained little or nothing on child care but the pressure has built up in the meantime. I and others have played no small role in ensuring&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is not in Government. She can do nothing about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the pressure was applied to force the Government to act. Thanks to the publication of policies like those of our party, the Government has finally been forced to act. What has been presented today, however, falls far short of any indication that the Government has any idea of what it is doing on child care.</P>
      <P>When is a child care policy a child care policy? In the first instance it is about children and child care but something that is missing in today&rsquo;s package is any mention of pre-school education. Our proposal &mdash; others have also suggested it &mdash; is that all three-year-old children be entitled to a place in pre-school, the benefits of which are well known. The OECD called for that as did other bodies, including the competitiveness council, but there is no sign of it in the budget. That is one way we know this child care package is not about children.</P>
      <P>The Government made a big issue of the supply side. That is the second place we would look to ascertain if this package is about children. One of the problems being faced by parents and children is finding quality, affordable child care places. This Government talks about increasing supply but the figures and the investment fall far short of what is needed. The equal opportunities childcare programme is delivering at some level in terms of bricks and mortar. Many fine child care centres are being built throughout the country with capital funding from the equal opportunities childcare programme but the problem of staffing then arises. These centres are dependent on the use of F&Aacute;S schemes to keep them staffed. Their costs are barely being met by the fees they are required to charge parents. In many cases, they are barely able to meet their obligations in <Col N="311"/>terms of the disadvantaged and poorer parents. There is nothing in this budget about that. More capital investment is welcome but where is the evidence of the level of funding that is needed to improve these facilities and deliver for parents and, in particular children?</P>
      <P>The extension of maternity leave by up to six months by 2007 is welcome. Unpaid leave is to be extended also. We had a debate on parental leave in this House. Ireland has the worst record in Europe on parental leave. We do not have paid parental leave. Parental leave is not just about parents; it is about children also. The Minister paid some lip service by saying that the first year of a child&rsquo;s life is the most important. That is the case but not the first half year; the first full year. Unpaid leave in the second half of the year is useless to many parents because they cannot afford to take unpaid leave. The notion of extending unpaid leave, therefore, is useless and is an insult to many families. That is another indication that this is not a child-driven, child care package.</P>
      <P>The early child care supplement is very similar to the phrase we used in our document. It is clear that the Minister is trying to appear to be doing something but &euro;1,000 a year is less than &euro;20 a week &mdash; it is &euro;19 a week. Has the Minister any idea how much people are paying in child care? It is much more than that. This supplement will barely put a dent in it.</P>
      <P>There is very little done for private providers in this budget. I am aware from the feedback I am getting that many private providers are operating on very tight margins. I am concerned that the &euro;19 a week will be passed on. The cost of child care will go up by about that much.</P>

      <P>The tax exemption for the home-based childminders, which we proposed, is welcome. However, those on social welfare incomes, <Col N="312"/>including single parents, who want to be in this area, will be hit.</P>

It is the ideal way to deliver the goods at the end of the day. In five years we will have 50,000 more places. The additional new places will be helped by &ldquo;enhanced capital grant aid to private providers, the limit for which will double to &euro;100,000, and continued support to community providers of up to &euro;1 million per facility subject to a maximum grant per place of &euro;20,000&rdquo;.</P>

	<P Just="Left">One of the six propositions of my document was quality assurance of provided child care facilities. The roll-out of places &ldquo;will be complemented by an intensification of training arrangements to support quality child care delivery. It is expected that 17,000 child care workers will be trained in the period&rdquo;. The following is the crunch:</P>
      <P LI="1">In order to help further to improve the supply side, I propose to exempt from income tax, PRSI and levies all income up to &euro;10,000 per year from childminding where an individual minds up to three children, who are not their own, in the minder&rsquo;s own home. This will recognise the contribution of this sector to supporting supply. Such individuals will be required to notify their local county child care committee so that information on availability of child care places can be more readily co-ordinated. The county child care committees provide support, information and small grants to the sector.</P><Col N="315"/>
      <P FLI="0">If a group of people, each of whom minds three children in his or her home, does not earn more than &euro;10,000 per year, those people will be drawn into the child care committees&rsquo; nets. It is a network wherein people can be advised on nutrition, education, hygiene and so on. We are bringing the people who mind children in their own homes into the county child care committee&rsquo;s network of professionalism. It is an imaginative and innovative move. Like the others, it makes a contribution, although no contribution on its own would be adequate.</P>
      <P>Regarding maternity leave, the Budget Statement reads: &ldquo;From March next, mothers of newborn children will have an additional four weeks paid maternity leave, extending the duration of such leave to 22 weeks.&rdquo; I called for this in my document.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Taoiseach congratulated me last Friday and said I could take the credit for this provision today. Children&rsquo;s allowance will increase to &euro;150 for the first child and to &euro;185 for subsequent children and there will be a direct payment of &euro;1,000 per child under the early child care supplement. Rather than giving tax reliefs to parents who pay for child care, this cuts out bureaucracy and administration, which Senator Quinn and I greatly desire. The budget provides for, &ldquo;a direct payment of &euro;1,000 per year available equally to all parents regardless of their labour force status, for each child up to his or her sixth birthday&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Also to my heart&rsquo;s delight is a proposition on new child care arrangements, which was my final proposition. Child care and family issues span 11 Departments. To implement the five-year national child care strategy, the Minister stated that the Government will be introducing new administrative arrangements to streamline the functions relating to child care.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, who is fresh from the midlands. I understand he was down there delivering leaflets all afternoon, as he usually does on the day of a budget.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>According to George and Wilding in <i>Welfare and Ideology, </i>public choice theorists stress two forces driving interventionism forward: first, the competition between parties for votes &mdash; we had an example of that here this morning between Senators Minihan and White &mdash; which stimulates parties to promise more and more, and, second, the self-interested budget maximising behaviour of bureaucrats and professionals.</P>
      <P>This Government has taken the making and breaking of promises to an unprecedented level, as never envisaged by the above-mentioned authors. If ever there was a model of a self-interested budget, it is budget 2006, not budget 2010 of which Senator White gave us a preview. The budget was written with more than one eye on the polls and is designed to restore the faith of the outraged voter in this lame-duck Government, if such were possible.</P>
      <P>However, this is not the full picture of Government duplicity. Electioneering at the expense of the taxpayer and in contravention of the rules governing elections is rife. Staff employed by Fianna F&aacute;il and Progressive Democrats Ministers are being used to make telephone calls to radio stations in a blatant contravention of electoral rules.

	<P>We in the midlands have had several quick fixes by the Minister of State in recent times. The leaflet drops before the budget was even announced&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>That is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I was not in my constituency today. Senator Bannon is incorrect again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Housing is one area on which the Government is not singing loud self-praise. Even the Government cannot spin that one. As I have stated many times in this House, every morning as I walk towards Kildare Street I pass at least half a dozen people sleeping in doorways, victims of a system that favours the rich at the expense of the poor and the vulnerable in society. This heartless Government is doing little for these people. Significant steps could have been taken in this year&rsquo;s budget to address the inadequacy of social provision by improving the allocation for social and affordable housing but instead the homeless got very little.</P>
      <P>There are currently close to 50,000 households on the waiting lists for social housing. The National Economic and Social Council in a recent study estimated that Ireland would need an additional 73,000 social housing units by 2012 but where is the provision in this budget for these units? Instead of making significant inroads into meeting this target, the Government has, once <Col N="318"/>again, heartlessly turned its back on this needy sector of our society.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The provision of social housing must be addressed by continual and sustained increases in social and affordable housing construction, which would lead to increased access to quality housing for those most in need. Currently, the Government is spending nearly &euro;400 million on rent supplements which could be ploughed into social and affordable housing. This is typical of the short-sighted actions of the Government&rsquo;s record of wasting millions of euro of taxpayers&rsquo; money that has been highlighted in a number of well documented cases over the past year.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton intervened today and pointed out this wastage to several Ministers when he spoke in the D&aacute;il. He spoke of the wastage in the Departments of Health and Children, Transport, and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. All this was pointed out. Some &euro;500 million was wasted by the shabbiness of the Government in the past 12 months. Fine Gael opposes the Government&rsquo;s six-month rule on rent supplements and all the other welfare cuts that will drive more people further into poverty and homelessness.</P>
      <P>I am extremely disappointed that the tax relief incentive on commercial developments was not extended for a further five years. This particularly affects my county. I felt that it should have been extended. The space allowed for completion is too short for many developments and the Government&rsquo;s timescale for people to complete major commercial developments is unrealistic. There is an extension from July until December 2006 but that is totally inadequate. To state that reliefs have achieved the objectives set for them or are no longer considered to be cost effective is totally without foundation.</P>
      <P>There was no reduction in the high rate of VAT, which was very disappointing. Local authority funding cuts over the past number of years will not be undone by today&rsquo;s small increase in funding. In fact, it will bring further stealth taxes in its wake, a continuation of the Government&rsquo;s policy of hitting taxpayers from every angle. There have been increased charges for refuse collection, electricity, gas, VHI, television licence, etc. I could continue until 7.30 p.m. outlining the stealth taxes the Government has imposed since it came into office. There have been several charges in the area of health.</P>

	<P>Since 1997, there has been a series of stealth taxes imposed by this Government.</P>
      <P>Grants, such as the disabled person&rsquo;s grant and the essential repairs grant, are now an insult to the people who rely on such provisions. In my <Col N="319"/>constituency, one disabled man who qualified for a necessary extension to his home received builders&rsquo; quotes of &euro;32,000, &euro;34,000 and &euro;35,000. The grant he received was less than &euro;8,000, which is less than a quarter of what it will cost to construct this necessary <i>en suite</i> bedroom.</P>

As the people in the Longford-Westmeath are only too aware, rumour has it that the Government plans to string us along until after the general election and then pull the plug on Mullingar. This budget, like every other since 1997, has done nothing to allay the fears of the people of Longford-Westmeath. Continued representations on my part have failed to get a timescale for the completion of phase 2B from the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government must be doing something right to exercise the other side so much. I congratulate the Government and the Minister, Deputy Cowen, on producing a progressive and far-sighted budget. It is a budget that will build on the significant strides forward that we, as a country, have taken in a relatively short space of time. These strides do not happen by accident. Over the two previous budgets, the Opposition was baying that we were cutting back on this, that and the other instead of, as we saw it, prudently managing our resources. When the economies of other countries in Europe, in particular, and throughout the world were faltering &mdash; some of them are still doing so, with rising unemployment figures &mdash; we managed to maintain a steady course over the past two or three <Col N="320"/>years, and that has brought us to today&rsquo;s budget where we have &euro;43.8 billion to put back into the economy. The Government and the present Minister must be congratulated on achieving this at a particularly difficult time.</P>
      <P>I want to focus on a couple of areas in particular. The first is the environment. Again, the Minister has proved that the Government takes our environment, and that of our children, extremely seriously. I welcome the exceptionally progressive steps being taken, particularly in respect of incentives for the promotion of biofuels, which will have an immense benefit in the long run for our whole community, including farmers. Farmers play a particular role in this regard and the incentives announced today will be of great benefit to them. Our children&rsquo;s future is extremely important to us and today the Government has proved that its concerns regarding the environment and its obligations, particularly under the Kyoto Protocol, are genuine. The Government recognises that serious measures must be taken to protect our supply of energy, while simultaneously protecting our environment for future generations.</P>
      <P>The issue of carbon emissions is a major talking point at present. The Montreal discussions are under way and this is a challenging issue. The establishment of a carbon fund is the first step in what promises to be a comprehensive approach to this issue. The multi-annual funding, starting with &euro;20 million in 2006 will ensure that we can build on this. The development of biofuels is an emerging area of expertise and it is essential if we are to come anywhere close to our targets. The level of excise relief which will start at &euro;20 million this year, with &euro;30 million next year and &euro;50 million in each of the three following years, will support the production and use of hundreds of millions of litres of biofuels per year. The input of the farming community will be essential in this respect and will provide opportunities. While the environment will benefit, we will also benefit from the creation of jobs. Research and development in this field is a significant industry and we have only begun to tap into it. We have a young, well-educated population and have proved in the past that we can hold our own, particularly in areas such as pharmaceuticals and technology. This is another area where I feel we can make major strides in the future.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the extension of VRT relief for hybrid fuel cars is to be extended to flexible fuel vehicles, which is another step forward. This is the future for Ireland. If we are to maintain the progress we have made to meet our obligations, particularly under the Kyoto Protocol, this is a particularly good start. It shows our seriousness about the environment and our willingness to take exceptional measures and progressive steps to try to fulfil those obligations.</P><Col N="321"/>
      <P>Although it only formed a small part of the Budget Statement, I also welcome the social finance initiative, which will encourage banks and other institutions to become involved in social inclusion and community development throughout the country. In particular, the banking community will be given a chance to build relationships and participate in the community as never before. While there has been much negative publicity, particularly in respect of banks and building societies, this will provide them with an opportunity to become involved. It will entail the provision of seed funding and expertise for various community projects and other institutions will be invited to participate. This excellent and welcome initiative will provide an opportunity for these institutions to become involved at a local level in their communities.</P>
      <P>Another section of the speech pertained to property-based tax schemes. I am particularly interested in two of them. The first is the park and ride scheme which has not proved to be as successful as was hoped. It is prudent to remove it and opt for State funding in this regard as it will be an essential part of the implementation of Transport 21. I remember that it was mooted in the early 1980s as part of the Dublin Transport Initiative. One of its main planks was the provision of park and ride facilities. A start has been made at the Red Cow roundabout in conjunction with the Luas, as well as in a number of locations on the outskirts of the city. It will be worth investing money in this respect because it will prove to be beneficial in the future.</P>
      <P>I welcome the retention, to a great extent, of the urban renewal schemes. I have seen their benefits at first hand, particularly in the inner city of Dublin. In some areas, they have completely transformed communities. They have had a catalysing effect on development and regeneration and some of the most deprived and rundown areas of the city have been transformed. Through the integrated area plans, in conjunction with Dublin City Council, councillors, public representatives and the communities themselves, many areas have improved dramatically. The plans are crucial to the development of districts in an integrated and community-friendly manner. By taking the needs and views of local residents into account, they have led to major improvements in the design of urban dwellings and of housing in particular, as well as the provision of facilities at community levels. I welcome this budget&rsquo;s retention of the urban renewal schemes.</P>
      <P>The Government must be doing something right to have the Opposition so agitated. This is a progressive, far-sighted budget which I warmly welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak and welcome the Minister of State at the Depart<Col N="322"/>ment of Finance, Deputy Parlon, to the House. I have a suspicious mind and regard a budget to be part of a wider story. Sometimes its effect, if not its actual purpose, is to divert attention from the wider story. In most years, including this one, I regard the Minister as being akin to a baker who bakes a cake and puts beautiful icing on top of it. Consequently, when one buys the cake, one&rsquo;s attention is distracted from its ingredients by one&rsquo;s concentration on the icing. Hence, for the 13 years in which I have been a Member of this House, I have looked with suspicion on every budget I have encountered, including this one.</P>
      <P>Consequently, I have devised a sort of wish list which I consider, acting somewhat like a school headmaster, to ascertain how many marks I would award to its various aspects. The first item on the wish list concerns the long term. Recently, I spoke in the House in another debate on the danger of complacency, of beginning to believe that the Celtic tiger will continue and that we can take it easy. I am quite concerned about the long term and I have considered the budget to gauge whether there is a danger that the Minister is complacent. On the basis of this budget, my mind has been put at rest to a large extent, particularly, as Senator Brady noted a few minutes ago, with regard to climate change, the Montreal conference, the Kyoto Protocol and the steps the Minister has taken in respect of biofuels. He has taken a long-term view and is taking such matters into account.</P>
      <P>The second point I considered in that regard was the question of tax reliefs. In contrast to Senator Bannon&rsquo;s remarks on tax reliefs, I am impressed by the Minister&rsquo;s plans in this respect. He will publish the performance of the various schemes in the Finance Bill to assess whether they work. I gather that he has had consultants conduct an examination of the schemes to establish which are worthwhile. I believe that on examination, a great number of them will be found to be working and to have worked well.</P>
      <P>The danger is that because they have been used to enable some people to avoid paying a great deal of tax, particularly wealthy people, a degree of envy has led people to believe they should be stopped because they are unfair. While they may not be entirely fair from a taxation point of view, they have facilitated development in a large number of the intended areas. Hence, while the Minister has questioned whether tax relief on hotels, urban renewal and other areas is still required, he has provided time for such schemes to be completed. It seems to me, particularly in the case of student accommodation, that when it is examined, it may turn out to have been a good investment which should be continued on that basis.</P>
      <P>My second wish list item concerns the minimum wage. I am concerned that a large number <Col N="323"/>of people never progress from unemployment. To an extent, this is influenced by the minimum wage and some jobs do not exist at a certain rate. Hence, it seems to me that removing everyone on the minimum wage from the tax net is a great achievement, which I welcome. The National Economic and Social Forum recently produced a report on unemployment which referred to these people who are continually left at the bottom of the pile and never get a job. They are always left out.</P>
      <P>My third concern is education. I must give the Minister full marks in this area, particularly with regard to third level and the new term &ldquo;fourth level&rdquo; which I had not heard before. He deserves full marks for the recognition of incentives for third level and the fourth PhD level, and the inclusion of the institutes of technology and other third level educational institutions.</P>
      <P>However, he gets zero marks for educational disadvantage. There is no mention of it in the Budget Statement. This really concerns me because when I speak about the people who are left out of employment, who never got onto the first rung of the ladder, these are the people who fell behind at school. We must invest far more but we are not doing it. There is no mention of it in the statement. That is important for the long-term unemployed and those who never got into employment. That should be mentioned but the Minister has not done anything about that area of education.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Neither was there any mention of broadband even though Forf&aacute;s recently published a report on broadband coverage in Ireland. We are at the bottom of the pile in Europe. I am not sure how the Minister will solve this but we have discussed it in the past. Ten and five years ago we discussed how Ireland had the opportunity to be to the forefront in this area. The governments of South Korea and Singapore determined that their priority would be to put their countries at the top of the information society and they did something about it. However, this Government has turned its back on the issue. It appears to have fallen over the horizon and the Government has not noticed. It is not mentioned in the budget. We are at the bottom of the pile and we can and must do something about it if we are to compete in the future.</P>
      <P>My fifth concern was child care. My concern was that with so much noise being made about child care, the Minister might be in danger of taking steps that were against the interests of those who decide to stay at home to mind their children. The danger was that the Minister would get the balance wrong. There is a serious problem with child care. The Minister has got the balance right in this area. The ideal from society&rsquo;s point of view is that the parents of children are given <Col N="324"/>options. In this case, the Minister appears to have got the balance right and to have given options. For those who wish to go out to work, there are clearly steps in the right direction. There are also steps in the right direction for those who wish to stay at home and mind their children.</P>
      <P>My final concern is how well we spend our money. There was some reference to it in the budget but I am disappointed that we have not provided a good response to that issue. It has not been given priority in the budget. I believe that, by any standards, we get bad value for the money we spend on the health service, infrastructure and across the range of public spending. The Minister for Finance has a comforting mantra about this which we heard again this afternoon but there is little evidence that he is doing anything about it. In the past the former Deputy and Minister, Mr. McCreevy, put this high on his agenda. He spoke strongly about value for money. I might be wrong but I did not see it get any priority today. Until we have in place a system that guarantees to deliver better value for money from public spending, any budget exercise such as today&rsquo;s will largely be a waste of time.</P>
      <P>Taking on the role of the headmaster in my school, I decided what marks to give the Minister. I will not give them in figures but when I was in school I received a report which stated: &ldquo;Tries hard; could do better.&rdquo; That is the case with this budget. I measured it against my wish list of six main points, and each of those contained two or three minor points as well. It is comparatively easy for the Minister to do the right thing with the bountiful amount of money available to him. It is easy for him to be generous. It is also easy, however, to do the wrong thing, as I have seen happen in the past. In general, the Minister has got it right. He left out some areas on which I would like him to concentrate but it is not too late to do something about them in the Finance Bill.</P>

One does not need a great memory to be aware of what happened in Mullingar or with the disabled person&rsquo;s grant under previous Administrations when we did not have a bob to do anything. In the case of the disabled person&rsquo;s grant, adequate funds have been made available by the Department to the local authorities but, <Col N="325"/>unfortunately, most local authorities do not take up the funds for the people who require and deserve the construction of extensions and so forth.</P>
      <P>I particularly welcome the announcements on child care. The people I have spoken to since the Budget Statement was made are elated with the performance of the Government in this area. Many people put down markers on what was required but I compliment the Government for listening to what they said. There are times when one is unable to do certain things when the money is not available but now the money is available and the Government has made excellent choices in ensuring that people who are working and making a valuable contribution to this country will have access to adequate child care. This will also open up more opportunities for people to provide child care throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Great work has been done, as can be seen in the announcements made by all Departments. Look at what has happened with housing, social welfare and how the Government has brought unemployment to the lowest recorded level. A number of years ago people did not think this could happen but it has. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s remarks about involving the banks in the community. Many people and banks are cash rich and they can now get involved in local communities. There is an opportunity here for others, such as local authorities and local companies, to get involved in providing infrastructure and facilities in areas where they are required. For example, there is a need to provide playground facilities in towns and villages for our young people. This is an opportunity for those institutions to get involved with local authorities in providing those facilities.</P>
      <P>There has been much comment on education and the new fourth level. We are moving ahead. When I was young one did well to complete the group certificate or leaving certificate. That was the maximum achievement for most people. Few people in rural parts of Ireland got the opportunity to go to third level. Now, every school has the opportunity to send its students to third level and there is demand for a fourth level. The Government must be complimented on moving and thinking ahead in this regard.</P>
      <P>The extension of the rural and town renewal schemes is excellent news. People were being pushed to the limit to get the works completed but the extension provides them with light at the end of the tunnel and allows them to proceed. When those schemes are complete I hope the Ministers, Deputy Cowen and Deputy Parlon, will have an opportunity to examine the valuable work that was done and introduce similar schemes in other areas that will give them an opportunity to develop. I particularly mention the <Col N="326"/>tax designation in the upper Shannon region where much work and development took place. I hope in the future it will be extended to the area I represent, and with which Deputy Parlon is only too familiar, south of Athlone in the Shannon basin.</P>
      <P>There are tremendous improvements in farm pollution grant aid, giving farmers an opportunity to develop and come on side regarding REPS. The increase in tax exemption for income from farm leasing is very welcome. One could go on, but time is limited as another Member wants to speak on this. Senator Quinn asked how one would score this budget. Having read through it and listened to the Minister in the D&aacute;il today I would give it ten out of ten and I compliment the Minister and all associated with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the budget. I have been around both Houses long enough to know how these things work &mdash; the Government says one thing, the Opposition says something else, then the roles change and the merry-go-round starts again. However it is important that we have an opportunity to comment on what the Minister presented to the other House. While it is impossible to sum it up in the limited time available, I want to comment on a few of the issues highlighted in the Minister&rsquo;s Budget Statement today.</P>
      <P>The Minister&rsquo;s proposal on biofuel and alternative energy is important. All parties have sought this over the past 12 to 18 months as a result of the massive fuel price increase across the globe. Both environmental issues and fuel costs must be addressed and the Minister&rsquo;s proposals can be helpful in that regard. It is important that we drive those proposals forward as quickly as possible. Unfortunately our public administration has a history of bringing ideas forward but failing to make them happen as quickly as they should, and this is the fault not of the civil servants but of the politicians. It is vital that we put effort into ensuring the biofuel proposals are implemented. In view of the ongoing crisis debate on the future of Irish Sugar, and the strong possibility that sugar beet may not be grown in the future for the production of sugar, we have the possibility here of solving both problems by ensuring crops will be grown for biofuel purposes. I hope we look seriously at that.</P>
      <P>I want to comment on the Minister&rsquo;s statement on the stallion tax. As I have the Seanad nomination of the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association and am involved in a small way in the breeding of thoroughbreds, my views are biased. I would have strongly defended the stallion tax exemption. I note that it is to end in 2008 due to pressure from Brussels but I hope we will try to ensure a system of support is put in place to keep a strong Irish industry strong. We should not <Col N="327"/>apologise in this House or elsewhere for the fact that over the past 30 or 40 years we have developed in the Republic of Ireland the premier horse breeding industry in the world. Rather than hiding that away as something of which we should be ashamed, we should be proud of it and all who have contributed to it. The stallion tax exemption was a major help in that regard. If, as the Minister advised today, it is to end in 2008 we should ensure that measures are put in place to keep that fine industry at its maximum strength.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, was the person most associated with the decentralisation announcement two years ago. I noticed a few lines on decentralisation at the back of the booklet. We have debated it here with Deputy Parlon previously and he knows that politicians across all parties support the concept of decentralisation but are bitterly disappointed with the lack of progress. This is the second anniversary of the December 2003 announcement made in advance of local elections. Maybe it was ambitious at the time but it is important for the future of rural Ireland and from a social and economic perspective that we implement a programme of decentralisation. We now hear about plans that will take five to nine years. It is disappointing that we have made so little progress. I know the Minister of State is in the midst of controversy today about a local radio poll. That does not concern me. I want to see action on the implementation of decentralisation. If it needs to be reviewed and restructured, so be it; we could all live with the political consequences for a few months. For the good of rural Ireland and for the capital city, let us see the programme realised. Deputy Parlon must take a stronger approach to it over the next 12 months. We do not want to look back in five or six years time on a lost opportunity.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State is aware of the issues facing agriculture and the reliefs announced in the budget. One of the issues on which we all receive representations, and which does not appear in the budget, is the case for tax relief for farmers trying to consolidate their lands. I ask that something be done in the Finance Bill. That case is reasonable and has been made very strongly to us. It would lead to better farming, in some cases better environmental practice and road safety would be improved as farmers would not have to travel miles to reach separate parcels of land. The Minister of State should consider some tax relief for this.</P>
      <P>A budget is no longer the big political event it was. The Estimates have been published and the Finance Bill will follow so we will debate this again. I hope the positive aspects of the budget will be acted on quickly. The major fault of the Government over the past seven or eight years has been its failure to deliver on commitments <Col N="328"/>and overspending in many areas. Without being too party political, that needs to be tackled. I refer to the Minister&rsquo;s concluding remarks about the need to be more transparent in the budgetary process and to have more dialogue and debate within the political system. That would be good for politics because it would allow the public not just to see what is on offer at election time but to engage in the broader debate and see the political and financial choices available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Like the other speakers I welcome the budget. It is remarkable that we have a budget based on income generated from economic growth rather than increased taxation or excise duty. I am not sure if it is unique but it has not happened very often. The economic growth we have experienced &mdash; last year it was 4.6% and the projections for the next few years are 4.8% and 5% &mdash; is impressive. One of the most impressive statistics in the budget is the increase in employment in 2005. Employment is up approximately 50,000 on the projections at the start of the year with 89,000 new jobs created. The projection for the coming year at 3% and 60,000 new jobs is also impressive. It shows the way the economy is going and how necessary it is to keep the ship on an even keel so the benefit of recent economic growth is continued without interruption.</P>
      <P>Inflation is currently 2.5% and is projected to rise to 2.7%. It is on the high side when compared with our EU partners. We should be mindful that although the rate is at an historical low in Ireland, we should maintain every effort to keep it low if at all possible.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>It is good to see taxation as a focus of the budget. People on the minimum wage are being removed from the tax band, an action that other Senators and commentators have sought and one which is welcome. The restrictions regarding capital allowances and other tax reliefs, particularly for very high income earners, are also welcome. I was somewhat surprised in reading the budget document to find one can carry forward unused capital allowances from one year to the next. Although this is standard practice, I wonder if it is advisable.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11.7- ?>
      <P>I take issue with the fact that loans for companies which are used for property rental will not be allowed to people who invest, either through shares or by extending a loan to a company. I have argued the point with previous Ministers for Finance that there is an inequity in that process. Most tax advisers will advise people to hold property outside a company as it is more tax efficient. Those who put capital into a company, for the protection of limited liability, for example, should not be penalised as a consequence. Any income generated within the company attracts a surcharge, so these are not moneys which can be <Col N="329"/>retained. There is only a small saving of perhaps &euro;15 million on the matter. It would be useful to examine the issue again.</P>
      <P>An increase in stamp duty to 9% is high in comparison with other countries within the EU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>If nothing can be done on the percentage amount, action should be taken on thresholds. This relates in particular to first-time buyers of property or even people moving up in the property market. This is a significant add-on to the already high price of property, although it is generating revenue. I agree with the thrust of economic policy in that we should have low income taxes, which we have, and the corollary is higher taxes in other areas. The issue should be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Senator to conclude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Public sector wages need to be tightly controlled. If benchmarking is to recur, it should be related specifically to quantifiable productivity. There should also be some type of programme for the eradication of waste in general public expenditure.</P>
      <P>To echo everybody else who has spoken, I welcome the significant increases for all people in receipt of social welfare, particularly old-age pensioners. A focus on these people shows an ethos that is essential in a growing economy, where many people are much better off than they were previously. It is imperative to ensure those at lower income levels are looked after in a way that gives these people a better quality of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I will make a brief comment as there has been a general appreciation of the budget and the positives therein. It is important to note that the budget maintains the Government&rsquo;s policy of sound economic management. Were it not for this good management, we would not have had the resources in this budget to distribute the benefits of our prosperity across all of society. In any budget, but particularly in this budget, sustaining economic growth and improving equality and opportunity for all is most important.</P>
      <P>I remind Members that since 1997, the numbers of those in the tax system who pay no tax has increased from 380,200 to 741,000. Approximately a third of workers pay no tax, a further third pay at the lower rate and less than a third pay at the highest rate.</P>
      <P>Senator John Paul Phelan was critical of the value for money aspects of public expenditure. This is unfair, as the Minister placed particular emphasis on this issue previously and in his <Col N="330"/>Budget Statement, referring to a number of specific measures. In particular, these are the new forms of contracts for construction projects; the new requirements for evaluation of projects costing more than &euro;30 million using cost-benefit analysis; and the tighter monitoring of spending by the Department and its agencies.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole queried the early child care supplement. I confirm this particular payment will be in respect of each child under six years of age. It is universal and not tied to any child care costs. It is not a voucher approach and it will be paid to everybody.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole also asked why the reduction in excise for heating oils did not apply to diesel. The answer is reasonably straightforward, as marked gas oil, or green diesel as it would be termed in rural areas, is most commonly used in tractors for agricultural purposes. Some people use it for heating purposes, although green diesel is a very different product from kerosene. There is a host of issues that can then arise, with the Revenue Commissioners having a constant fight to avoid green diesel being used illegally. It would be difficult to apply excise at differentiated rates, and green diesel also has a higher sulphur content than kerosene, making it less environmentally friendly. These are valid reasons the reduction has not been applied to diesel.</P>
      <P>With regard to decentralisation, I thank the House for its support on the programme. I reject any comments that it is not progressing, as it is well managed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>It will provide a good infrastructure for our civil servants around the country. It will give civil servants time to get their own arrangements in place, as it is a voluntary process. One cannot simply click one&rsquo;s fingers and create a building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State clicked his fingers two years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>The programme is proceeding apace. Senator O&rsquo;Toole was enthusiastic about the budget, asking a range of detailed questions about the initiatives announced today, particularly with regard to high earners. I cannot clarify the issues at this time, but measures will be announced in more detail by relevant Ministers in due course. The detail of tax measures will be elaborated on in the forthcoming tax Bill.</P>
      <P>Senator Bannon was excited about the issue of social housing and homelessness. The Government is fully committed to ensuring that housing needs are met in a comprehensive and effective way. The current national development plan allocated &euro;9 billion for this area from 2000 to 2006. The Government is fully aware of the recent <Col N="331"/>recommendations from NESC, and we will take these into account with the new NDP for 2007 onwards.</P>
      <P>A number of people referred to the issue of tax reliefs, and there was general appreciation that they were being dealt with. These have been evaluated rigorously both within the Department and by external consultants. Schemes that have served their time and are no longer proving cost effective are being eliminated. Transitional measures to ensure that no undue negative implications arise, particularly in the construction sector, will be put in place. I have covered the majority of the issues raised by Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>What about roll-over relief?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I, like Senator John Paul Phelan, have made strong representations regarding that issue. In general, this budget has received a warm reception, particularly from the public. I glanced briefly at &ldquo;Six One News&rdquo; on RTE, which reported widespread support for this enlightened budget that will enhance the well-being and quality of life of all our citizens.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Fahey, for coming to the House to take this Adjournment matter. It is very appropriate that the Minister of State should take this motion because he once represented the constituency in question and probably monitors developments in it every day.</P><Col N="332"/>
      <P>The Minister of State is aware that approximately 70,000 gallons of raw sewage is pumped into Kinvara Bay each day. This ongoing problem has worsened in the past ten years. Pollution is rampant in the bay. The Minister of State can see the extent of the pollution in this photograph I am holding. The signs and smell of pollution are evident. This pollution, which has been documented, is destroying Kinvara Bay&rsquo;s potential as a major tourism area. The former health board took 18 water samples from the bay and found that 50% of them were seriously polluted with organisms such as e-coli.</P>
      <P>The bay was previously used for swimming, which has been cancelled for the last decade. Boating, other leisure pursuits in the bay and, indeed, the tourist trade, are being killed off because of pollution in the bay. Every study has indicated the need for urgent action to tackle this problem. The dumping of raw sewage in the bay has breached EU directives and Government regulations. The EU Commission has indicated that the Government and relevant local authority failed to rectify a situation they were both warned about.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The dumping of raw sewage in Kinvara Bay is a public health hazard. The unique nature of the bay must be taken into account because the tides and currents are unable to regularly flush out the contents of the bay, as is the case with other more open bays. The bay is approximately one mile long and 50 ft wide, with an average depth of approximately eight to ten feet. Problems are caused by incoming freshwater because the circulation of currents adds to the existing physical difficulties in the bay.</P>
      <P>The future provision of a sewerage system at Kinvara Bay was announced in 2003 and included in Galway County Council&rsquo;s water services investment programme for 2005 to 2006. Financing was apparently in place so most people, somewhat naively, believed that this was a firm commitment to deliver the long-promised facility. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government returned the documents from the preliminary report on the scheme in June 2005, a delay of over two years. This report had been sent to the Department in February 2003. As a result, the sewerage plant project has been delayed by two years. According to Galway County Council, the plant cannot be completed before the summer of 2009. This opinion is based on its assessment that the amended report returned to the Department in October will be approved by the Minister in March 2006. Tendering, construction and the appointment of the design team will follow the approval of this report. It will be at least two and a half years before the construction phase of the project commences.</P><Col N="333"/>
      <P>The people of Kinvara and the surrounding areas cannot wait. Serious efforts will be made to induce the EU Commission to revisit the issue and point the finger at the Government for its inactivity. Galway County Council provided a grant for the development of a town plan for Kinvara for the last two years. The plan was unique in that it involved the community. Under the new plan, no new developments can take in place in Kinvara without the provision of a sewerage scheme. Given the health risks posed by the pollution, the economic life of Kinvara and the fact that no new development can take place without the provision of a sewerage scheme, what more is required before some Minister takes action?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Ulick Burke for tabling the motion in respect of Kinvara sewerage scheme. I agree with everything he said. I was involved in the establishment of the Kinvara water scheme a number of years ago. At the time, we thought it would be possible to establish a sewerage scheme.</P>
      <P>The provision of modern environmental infrastructure to remove threats to the environment has been a major focus of Government spending over the past number of years. As part of the considerable programme of investment being put in place nationally to improve our water services infrastructure, the necessary funding has been set aside for the provision of a modern and up-to-date sewerage scheme in Kinvara. This scheme will cost approximately &euro;2.6 million and is approved in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme 2004-06, to start construction next year.</P>
      <P>Kinvara is one of over 60 water and sewerage schemes, worth more than &euro;444 million, that are included in the water services investment programme for Galway. Towns and villages like Athenry, Ballinasloe, Barna, Carraroe, Claregalway, Clarinbridge, Clifden, Corofin, Glenamaddy, Headford, Miltown, Oughterard and Tuam can all look forward to new sewerage facilities. In addition, many other areas such as Carna-<?oasys _jy ?>Kilkieran, Gort, Clifden, Costelloe, Loughrea and Tuam will also benefit from new or improved water supplies. No one can say therefore that Galway is not benefiting substantially from the Government&rsquo;s investment in water services projects.</P>
      <P>The Kinvara sewerage scheme has been assigned construction status in the Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme. Departmental funding is available for immediate draw down by Galway County Council as soon as it is required. The council&rsquo;s preliminary report for the scheme, which was received in the Department in October, is being examined. This is a very <Col N="334"/>detailed report, setting out the objectives, proposing areas to be served and outputs expected from the scheme. It cannot be dealt with overnight and must be carefully considered by the Department to ensure that the scheme proposed will meet the environmental objectives set for it as well as representing the most appropriate and cost-effective solution from a public expenditure point of view. Every effort is being made to finalise the Department&rsquo;s examination of the preliminary report and a response will go to the council as soon as possible. Once the preliminary report is approved the way will be clear for the council to draw up contract documents, which will be used to invite tenders for the construction of the scheme.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the strong case the Senator has made, as have all the public representatives in east Galway, to get this scheme started quickly and I note the comments made. The Department will do everything it can to move the scheme ahead as quickly as possible. From a personal point of view, I could not agree more with Senator Burke&rsquo;s comments. It is a scandal that raw sewage is going into Kinvara Bay which is an enclosed bay with a significant oyster bed. It is also used for fishing and water sports and so on. We all need to see that scheme move on as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for selecting this matter on the Adjournment. I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I am glad that I too am dealing with an issue concerning County Galway because he is familiar with the places involved.</P>
      <P>I am very concerned by the number of raids and attempted raids on businesses in the north east Galway area over the past two months. In some situations raiders have definitely come from outside the county, attempting in some cases to raid two or three premises in one evening or morning. For example, a few weeks ago some raiders who tried to get into Abbeyknockmoy post office but did not succeed went on to Ballygar where they failed again but did serious damage to the post office. Eventually they carried out a raid in the midlands, in Horseleap. In recent weeks some raiders attempted to break into Williamstown post office and succeeded in taking away some goods. They later went to Ahascragh where they raided a supermarket.</P>
      <P>People are concerned that in five of the six places I mention a post office was raided. Some of the post offices were in supermarkets. In each case the raiders had sophisticated equipment. In Ballinamore Bridge they had chains to drag a safe out of a post office. Last Friday there was a raid in Barnaderg, near Tuam, in which a large sum of money was taken from the post office.</P><Col N="335"/>
      <P>I call on the Minister to do several things. First, he could discuss with An Post the use of CCTV which might prevent these raids and, second, in line with the review of rural policing some years ago, small vans or vanettes could be used. These raids have taken place between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. Many of those who were raided were concerned that the raids occurred in November and early December when they distribute double payments for old age pensioners. The raiders know there is extra money there. Special attention should be paid to post offices in the months leading up to Christmas.</P>
      <P>The trauma and invasion of privacy for people who live on, or beside, these premises is serious. People talk about the shock they experienced when they saw people trying to enter their premises, whether a post office or a shop. I hope this will never happen again. If the Minister adopts my suggestions we can make rural Ireland safer.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform says the new Garda recruits will be put into the frontline in Dublin. He does not mention policing in rural areas, which is essential, especially in November and December and the days prior to Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising difficulties in the areas of east Galway he has mentioned tonight. Unfortunately, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, cannot be here but I share the Senator&rsquo;s concerns about the recent raids and attempted break-ins in several towns and villages in east Galway in recent months.</P>
      <P>Before commenting on the particular issue identified by the Senator it will be helpful to put the issue of crime into perspective. In October the Minister released the provisional third quarterly figures for headline crime for the State. The provisional figures showed a decrease of 0.2% in the number of headline offences in the 12 months ended 30 September 2005 compared with the 12 months ended 30 September 2004. This included significant decreases in some serious crimes, such as rape of a female, down 11%, unlawful carnal knowledge, down 15%, aggravated sexual assault, down 56%, theft from the person, down 19%, and robbery from the person down 26%, although there were also increases in a number of other crimes.</P>
      <P>The Minister takes great satisfaction in the Government&rsquo;s decision of October last year to approve the recruitment of 2,000 additional garda&iacute; to increase the strength of the force to 14,000. As a result there will be a combined organisational strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 in 2006. The additional resources will be targeted at the areas <Col N="336"/>of greatest need, as set out in the programme for Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister has already promised that the additional garda&iacute; will not be put on administrative duties but will be put directly into frontline, operational, high-visibility policing. The Minister is also very pleased that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is now better resourced than at any time in its history. The funding for the Garda which the Minister secured in the Estimates for 2006 is at an historic high of over &euro;1.29 billion, and compares with just &euro;600 million in 1997.</P>
      <P>The provision for Garda overtime in 2006 will be &euro;83.5 million, an increase of &euro;23 million on the allocation for 2005. This increase will greatly aid the planned deployment of a visible policing service in a flexible, effective and targeted response to criminal activity and to crime prevention. The &euro;83.5 million in overtime will yield 2,725 million extra hours of policing by uniformed and special units throughout the State. The personnel strength of the Roscommon-east Galway division, as of 21 November 2005 was 248, all ranks, an increase of 7% on the number in December 1997.</P>
      <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not an island of law enforcement. It relies on the ongoing and active support of the public to enable it to be at its most effective in its duties, whether this support is given through the provision of information to garda&iacute; by members of the public, or through more general co-operation by members of the public with the garda&iacute;. Businesses and post offices also have a responsibility to ensure that their premises are secure. As members of society we all have an active part to play in the fight against crime, and a duty to do so. The community alert programme is an outstanding example of how members of the community can do this. This national movement is a community-based crime prevention initiative in rural communities set up by Muintir na T&iacute;re in association with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 1985.</P>
      <P>The programme&rsquo;s network of over 1,294 local groups is dedicated to the following: improving the quality of life of people in rural communities by crime prevention; neighbourliness and self-reliance; general community safety and well-being; accident prevention; promotion of personal safety; and having an anti-poverty focus on, and awareness of, social inclusion. Its companion organisation, Neighbourhood Watch, carries out equally valuable work in more urban areas.</P>
      <P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform contributes annually towards the costs of operating the programme. The Department&rsquo;s funding provides assistance towards the costs of several local development officers who promote the establishment of new groups and increase the level of activity of existing groups. Assistance is also provided by the Health Service Executive. The Garda, both nationally and locally, is in con<Col N="337"/>tact with Muintir na T&iacute;re, with a particular emphasis on crime prevention.</P>
      <P>The Garda places as much importance on crime prevention as on crime detection. A Garda community relations-crime prevention officer, who provides advice and support on crime prevention issues to the community, is assigned to each Garda division. This Garda officer has the backup of the Garda national crime prevention office. In addition, the Garda has introduced a rural community policing scheme which operates in 14 Garda districts. The aim of the initiative is to provide effective and efficient policing in rural areas.</P>
      <P>In the Garda western region, Operation<?oasys _jy ?>Iarthair, under the direct control and responsibility of the regional Garda assistant commissioner, has been in place for the last four years. It targets the activities of criminals located in and travelling through the region and gathers intelligence on them. The operation consists mainly of scheduled daily roving vehicle checkpoints at night. In addition, a list of vulnerable persons and premises has been prepared in each Garda district, and particular attention is paid to these persons and premises by patrols.</P>
      <P>Operation Vehicle Hold-Up is a proactive crime prevention, road traffic enforcement and traffic calming operation, consisting of uniform and armed personnel. It takes place on varying dates and times in every Garda district in the region. All districts in the division are, therefore, regularly patrolled by uniform, traffic and detective branch personnel, particularly during the hours of darkness, when several crime prevention and intelligence gathering operations are in place. A list of vulnerable persons and premises has been prepared in each district and these are patrolled regularly. Elsewhere, vehicle checkpoints are operated and vehicles and persons<?oasys _jy ?>encountered are checked out.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have informed the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that the locations in question are all situated in the Roscommon-Galway east Garda division. In the last three months post offices in Ballygar, Ballinamore Bridge and Barnaderg have been burgled and the safes removed. These crimes are under active investigation, under the control of the regional detective superintendent, and several criminal gangs are being targeted in conjunction with units from the northern Garda region. Following recent burglaries in business premises in Williamstown and Ahascragh, garda&iacute; encountered a suspect vehicle and five persons were subsequently arrested. Stolen property was recovered from the burglary in Williamstown. An investigation file is being prepared for submission to the law officers in respect of these crimes.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been informed that local Garda management is satisfied the measures in <Col N="338"/>place are sufficient to address criminal activity in the area. He is aware of the concern which incidents like these cause to the people directly affected and the wider community. He is confident the Garda is devoting the necessary resources to investigating these crimes and working with the assistance of the community to prevent a repeat of such crimes.</P>
      <P>I will bring Senator Kitt&rsquo;s comments to the attention of the Minister and officials in the Department to have them taken directly to the Garda authorities in the Phoenix Park. The information given to the House by Senator Kitt shows sinister activity is taking place among several criminal gangs in rural areas. Everything possible will be done to bring these people to justice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In nearly every town and village, marching bands have flourished in recent years. They range from accordion bands to orchestra bands, from flute bands to brass bands. They play at nearly every local festival, pageant or football match. Many bands, such as the Castlerea and Boyle marching bands, are great ambassadors for the country when they attend St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day parades as far afield as the UK and New York.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism must set up a fund for these bands. Unfortunately, when they seek funding, they are caught in a no-man&rsquo;s land. While there are some amenity grants from various county councils and VECs, they often only amount to &euro;300. The cost of kitting out a band can be in the tens of thousands of euro. The cost for performing, to cover travel and insurance, can also be expensive. Most bands address a social need of many communities as they support the involvement of young people in community activities. In the south, where there are many pipe bands, every village is proud of its own band.</P>
      <P>In Northern Ireland, marching bands can benefit substantially from UK lottery grants. However, in the south, bands cannot fit into the national lottery funding criteria. I have raised this matter with the Arts Council. I ask the Minister to explore the establishment of a ring-fenced fund for marching bands. Such a scheme could be open to all and allow ownership of the instruments purchased through funding. I accept such a fund must be controlled and marching bands would be anxious to comply with whatever conditions would be set down. The moneys will be well spent because marching bands provide a social service and enjoyment to the people who participate in them and their audiences.</P>

	<P>The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, asked me to take this Adjournment matter and wishes to thank the<?oasys _jy ?><Col N="339"/><?oasys _fc ?>Senator for raising the issue. He is familiar with the tremendously positive impact that marching bands have on their communities. Unfortunately, he does not have the means at his disposal to provide them with funding. The national lottery-funded sports capital programme, which is advertised on an annual basis and administered by the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, allocates funding to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level for sports related projects. The programme is the primary means of providing the quality sports infrastructure needed to enhance participation and improve performance in sport. Since 1998 the Government, through the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, has allocated &euro;386 million to over 4,900 sports capital projects.</P><Col N="340"/>
      <P>While in the past a small number of bands were funded under the sports capital programme, the practice was discontinued in 2002. During the Minister&rsquo;s term, no projects without a sporting or physical recreation element have been funded under the programme. While the programme still receives a small number of band applications, these have to be deemed invalid as the funding available is required to continue to improve the level of sporting facilities and the rate of participation in sport.</P>
      <P>On the arts side, support of all art forms is a matter for the Arts Council, which is independent in the disbursement of its funds under the provisions of the Arts Act 2003.</P>
