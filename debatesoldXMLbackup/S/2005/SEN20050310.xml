	<P>I have received notice from Senator Leyden that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to make a statement regarding the charging of a public patient with a medical card (details supplied) at Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe, County Galway, for carrying out a DEXA bone scan on 14 January 2005.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Finucane of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to outline the current status regarding the extension of the Shannon Estuary water supply scheme to serve the Pallaskenry and Kildimo areas.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann has made the following order regarding the Law of the Sea (Repression of Piracy) Bill 2001, which was received from Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 18 October 2001:</P>
      <P LI="1">That, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, leave be given to withdraw the Law of the Sea (Repression of Piracy) Bill 2001.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, statements on the Report on Certain Issues of Management and Administration in the Department of Health and Children Associated with the Practice of Charges for Persons in Long-Stay Care in Health Board Institutions and Related <Col N="1306"/>Matters, to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 1.30 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 12 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed eight minutes. The Minister is to be called upon to reply not later than five minutes before the end of the statements.</P>
      <P>While I am on that point, perhaps I might say something, with the permission of the Cathaoirleach. The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, is coming to the House to take this debate, but she is also taking the Order of Business in the Lower House. It is therefore possible that there will be a gap between the conclusion of the Order of Business in this House and her finishing the Order of Business in the Lower House. I wish to alert the Seanad to that matter and hope Members will accept that if she is in the middle of answering some point in the Lower House, she must finish it before she comes here, and that there will be nothing unprofessional if we must suspend for five or ten minutes.</P>
      <P>No. 2 is the Health (Amendment) Bill 2005 &mdash; Committee and Remaining Stages, to be taken at 2.30 p.m. and to conclude not later than 4.30 p.m.; and No. 3, motion for earlier signature of the Health (Amendment) Bill 2005, to be taken immediately without debate on the conclusion of No. 2., if the latter is passed by the House. One cannot have an earlier signature motion if the Bill is not passed. There will be a sos from 1.30 p.m. to 2.30 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday was a bleak day for the Irish taxpayer. We had the publication of the report of the Committee on Public Accounts on the redress scheme. It provides a very interesting insight, given that in 2001, when the redress scheme was approved, the estimated costs were &euro;254 million. On that occasion, the religious orders were legally &ldquo;fireproofed&rdquo; regarding damages, and the estimate was &euro;128 million. The Comptroller and Auditor General now estimates the cost at &euro;828 million, with the result that the taxpayer is liable to pay out over &euro;700 million.</P>
      <P>Also yesterday, the Travers report, which we will be discussing shortly, was published. It is worth bearing in mind its implications, since at this stage we do not know the quantification of costs, with estimates varying from &euro;500 million to &euro;2 billion, depending on what route the Government takes regarding the Statue of Limitations and so on. We may not know the full cost for another three weeks.</P>
      <P>When it comes to policy decisions, there seems always to be a serious underestimating of the associated costs. In the middle of 2001, when medical cards were introduced for the over 70s and put on a statutory basis, the cost was underestimated by &euro;50 million, as more than 30,000 people were eligible. Many of us who are in contact with the Department of Social and Family Affairs know it has excellent records of people in <Col N="1307"/>receipt of pensions. I cannot understand why the figures were not right at that time following discussions between the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Social and Family Affairs to quantify the costs.</P>
      <P>It is worth remembering in this debate, which has emerged over the past few days, that last December the T&aacute;naiste tried illegally to take back the money to which those elderly people in nursing homes were entitled. We all know the Supreme Court struck down that decision, leading to the current situation, whereby people have a better appreciation of what is happening. I could say a great deal more regarding the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, and his Ministers of State, but I will await the debate on the Travers report, which is to proceed shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leader for arranging statements on the Travers report first thing this morning. It is very much appreciated on this side of the House. I also believe other Members will want to participate in that debate, which I will be happy to start immediately after the Order of Business. If no other Member wants to speak, I will be happy to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Start it now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, if the Minister is not available. People want to record their views on the matter, not talk to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not fair. The Senator has spoken but others might not have spoken on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Then we should just begin the debate and take our turn. The problem arises when people want everything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it like the ATMs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole, without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a little like ATMs, yes. One lines up and does one&rsquo;s business.</P>
      <P>The issue of suicide, the reasons for it and the way we should address the problem have been discussed in the House on many occasions but it is a subject on which we have very little in terms of facts. I would like to have a further discussion on the problem, particularly the connection between suicide and alcohol consumption. I came across some figures during the week which will be of major help in coming to some understanding of the problem of suicide. More than 80% of suicide victims had consumed alcohol a short time previous to their suicide. More important, and this is a frightening figure which nobody can ignore, is that suicides have increased by 43% over the past 12 to 15 years during which time the consumption of alcohol increased by 42% to 43%. That is a <Col N="1308"/>clear connection about which we should be concerned. Recognising that alcohol has both a depressive and a uninhibiting impact on personalities, creating impulsive behaviour, this is an issue of which I was not aware the last time we discussed the consumption of alcohol. Colleagues on both sides of the House have often asked whether there is any explanation for the increase in suicides. This is a clear connection which should be recorded in a debate here. I am grateful to the Irish National Alliance for Action on Alcohol, which made those figures available during the course of the week. We could have a discussion on this matter and get a view from the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know the views of other Members of the House but if I was the chief executive of a multinational company thinking about investing in Ireland and was presented with a Minister who said he did not ask questions about the possible debt of &euro;2 billion in his Department because nobody told him about it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>We will have the debate in the afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;I would have my doubts about the quality of the governance of a country where the Minister responsible for attracting foreign investment only looked after the areas the people he was responsible for told him about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>A Senator</NameTxt>
	<P>Other Ministers did nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>On No. 1 on today&rsquo;s Order Paper, it emerged on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; earlier that the mysterious missing file is no longer missing and the Minister for Foreign Affairs said he had no doubt that the material would be&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a matter for the forthcoming debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs said this material would be made available to the Oireachtas. If it is available can we have it before the debate? Why should we have to wait until after the debate to have what we are now told is available? Will the Leader ask the Department of Health and Children to make copies of that material available? We will be happy to have photocopies since apparently what exists is a photocopy. Mr. Travers did not see this file so it would be a help to us all to have it.</P>
      <P>On the general area of public administration, will the Leader make time available for an updated debate on the proposed EU services directive, which is in grave danger of causing serious damage to the rights of workers in this State? I was glad to see Commissioner McCreevy adopt what he would describe as a left wing &ldquo;pinko&rdquo; position on the services directive for which we have reason to be grateful but this is a <Col N="1309"/>potentially threatening directive for many workers in this State and in Europe generally and I ask for a debate on it. This House aspires to be one in which European issues are debated and this directive appears to be very relevant.</P>
      <P>While we are doing that we might talk about EU competition policy. The EU appears to have a competition policy which precludes state aid in such a way that it prevents investment taking place anywhere in the EU, which is what will happen if the policy it pursued with Intel is continued. It will not go somewhere else in the EU; it will go outside the EU. A competition policy which precludes investment within the EU is not a competition policy. It is a disincentive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Some 24 stretches of road have been branded dangerous by a European report published yesterday. The National Roads Authority is not making people aware of the designation of those roads. There are no accident blackspot warning signs or special speed restrictions on them and I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government into the House to outline the way this problem will be dealt with in the interests of road safety. In Limerick, applications in respect of the N69 were made to the Department and the National Roads Authority for special speed limit restrictions on that road but were turned down on numerous occasions. Now that responsibility for the speed limit reviews for these roads is back with the local authorities, I ask the Minister to deal with this issue urgently in the interests of road safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Most Senators and indeed the general public in both the midlands and the west encounter the roads to hell, as described in a number of publications yesterday. A recent survey by the Automobile Association highlighted a significant number of dangerous roads throughout the country. Most of them are in the midlands, particularly the N55 between Athlone and Cavan and the N52 between Kinnegad and Tyrrellspass. The worst stretch of road is listed as the one between Edgeworthstown and Armagh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>A call has been made already for a debate during which the Senator can go into detail on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I call on the Minister for Transport to come into the House and outline the plans he has to improve road safety. We highlighted in this House the roads that pose serious threat to the public on numerous occasions but no action was taken. There was a major underspend last year on those roads, many of which are in the BMW region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has made his case adequately.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1310"/>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>We have highlighted that underspend in the House on many occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call by Senator O&rsquo;Toole for a debate on the increase in the levels of suicide. Such a debate should be held soon because we are coming up to the leaving certificate examinations when students will be under great pressure. It would be appropriate to examine the fundamental reasons for this increase in suicides and alert parents to the problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I too support Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s suggestion that we have a debate on the correlation between increased alcohol consumption and increased levels of suicide. That correlation is well known and all the moaning and groaning about any drop in the consumption of alcohol in pubs due to the smoking ban is fairly shabby because the ban is welcome.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris and I frequently raise the issue of the Gulfstream jet that lands in Shannon. We have no idea what is on board that jet. In the United States, the CIA has been forced into admitting that it has permission to take people abroad on what is referred to as &ldquo;extraordinary rendition&rdquo;. I do not know what that means but it does not sound very good. Apparently, these people are brought to countries such as Jordan, Egypt and Morocco for treatment of some sort that it is felt better to farm out from the United States.</P>
      <P>When I raised this issue initially, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said that anyone who landed in Shannon was subject to the protection of the Constitution. If the Irish population thought that people were being brought through Shannon for any form of torture, they would be very angry. I am aware the Leader has tried to get more information on this issue but in general the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has sent her cuttings from newspapers, which we can all read.</P>
      <P>I realise that the Leader has much to do but I would be extremely grateful if she could discover whether an attempt has been made to obtain information regarding the identities of those on board this jet which passes through Shannon quite frequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to comment on the Travers report which states that the Department of Health and Children has failed, at the highest levels, for almost 30 years to deal effectively with the issue of illegal nursing home charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We will be debating that matter after the Order of Business and it would be more appropriate if the Senator made her remarks at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>Michael Kelly, the former Secretary General, is only the sixth in line of a number of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1311"/>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We will be debating the matter later. The Senator may raise those points at that time but she may not do so now. Does she have a question for the Leader?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, was delighted to appoint Mr. Kelly as chief executive of the Higher Education Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P Italics="Y">(Interruptions).</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader will recall that yesterday I asked her about practices and procedures in Departments other than the Department of Health and Children. She informed me, I presume correctly, that she did not have the right to provide that information nor did she possess it. Was she satisfied with the practices and procedures that obtained in the Department during her tenure as Minister for Health?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That matter is not appropriate to the Order of Business. We will be taking Committee and Remaining Stages of the Health (Amendment) Bill 2005 later today, at which time the Senator may raise that point. It is not fair to discuss any individual, even the Leader, on the Order of Business in this way. The Senator is out of order. Does he have a question on the Order of Business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought it was correct to ask&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>What the Senator thought is not relevant. He should confine himself to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Who is going to interpret this? We are discussing practices and procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The matter will be debated after the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>All I want is for the Leader to indicate whether she was informed about the Department&rsquo;s concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P Italics="Y">(Interruptions).</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not in order. It is not the function of the Leader to comment on such matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been a great deal of discussion recently about Aer Lingus&rsquo;s loss being BA&rsquo;s gain. Will the Leader indicate when the Government intends to appoint a permanent or new CEO to Aer Lingus? It is unfair to leave the airline rudderless, so to speak. When will the important matter of the second terminal at <Col N="1312"/>Dublin Airport be addressed? Will the Leader arrange a debate on these matters?</P>
      <P>When will the Bill to give effect to the Boundary Commission&rsquo;s recommendations regarding D&aacute;il constituencies be introduced? The Leader will be aware that her constituency of Westmeath is due to become Longford-Westmeath. Perhaps she will indicate when the Bill will be forthcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I am looking forward to that development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Henry&rsquo;s call for a debate on the aircraft passing through Shannon. There has been a great deal of misinformation circulated about this matter and, in my opinion, it has come about as a result of sloppy journalism. Reports appear to suggest that there are all sorts of antics occurring at Shannon Airport and that various prisoners are being transported through it. The American authorities have responded to the Government in respect of this matter and have made it clear that no prisoners have been transported through Shannon. It would be a welcome development if the relevant Minister could come before the House to place the facts on the record in order that people will not continually state that there is a star chamber at Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Dooley&rsquo;s request for a debate on this matter. He suggested that the newspaper reports are inaccurate and that the information provided came from dubious sources. <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The Washington Post</i>, <i>Newsweek</i>, <i>The Irish Times</i> and the <i>Irish Examiner</i> have all carried stories relating to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>Andrew Gilligan is the big authority on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know what else the Senator wants of people reporting on this issue. I questioned the American ambassador on this subject and he informed me that the US Government has provided its Irish counterpart with a categoric assurance that no prisoners, in the condition that has been reported, were taken through Shannon Airport. He did not state, however, that this was not his Government&rsquo;s policy, nor did he indicate that the jet had not passed through Shannon in pursuit of the business in question. There is clear evidence, including the relevant logs and registration numbers, that these planes passed through Shannon&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course they did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;on their way to kidnap people and bring them to third countries to be tortured. One of the methods of such torture is to use surfboards in the drowning of people until their lungs burst. This technique was perfected by the Gestapo in the Avenue Foch. Senator Dooley may be satisfied that Ireland is involved&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1313"/>
    <?oasys [cl11]?>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That matter is more appropriate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;in that kind of disgraceful behaviour but I certainly am not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator will not besmirch the name of Shannon Airport on an ongoing basis while I am a Member of the Seanad.</P>

    <P Italics="Y">(Interruptions).</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Order, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Would the Leader be prepared to lay before the Commissioner of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the evidence which has been assembled and which clearly constitutes a <i>prima facie</i> case for the involvement of this country in the commission of war crimes? There is an obligation on the police to examine this matter. I will certainly make available whatever information I possess. If the Leader, on behalf of Seanad &Eacute;ireann and the people of Ireland, will lay this information before the Garda Commissioner and request that the matter be properly investigated, I would be extremely grateful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader ensure that the e-mail facility that has been put in place by the Department of Health and Children in respect of reimbursing people who were overcharged in publicly-funded nursing homes is in full working order? I have contacted the Department on a number of occasions in respect of representations I received and been told to submit the details of those representations by e-mail. Up to 6 p.m. yesterday, the facility to which I refer was not working. That is not acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>For the second day in a row, I was struck by something Senator Ryan said. However, I am not quite as in agreement with him today as was the case yesterday. His comments about the activities of multinationals should be taken on board. For the Labour Party to be the voice of multinationals in the House is a new experience for everyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should sit down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Ross, without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a point well taken. We should consider what multinationals think about a matter Senator Coghlan raised, namely, the fact that the chief executive of Aer Lingus has left <Col N="1314"/>these shores because he did not find the conditions in which he worked particularly welcoming or suitable for the enterprise culture.</P>

	<P>He has rejoined the Commonwealth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>The individual in question took his decision for two reasons of which Senator Ryan should take note.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should confine himself to the Order of Business. There is no need to advise anyone about particular matters when making a contribution on the Order of Business.</P>

	<P>I would not dream of doing so.</P>
      <P>There are two important reasons for Willie Walsh&rsquo;s departure from Aer Lingus and the Minister for Transport should come before the House to discuss the matter. The first of these is the semi-State culture. Mr. Walsh could not work within this culture because it was not enterprising enough and, unfortunately, he left as a result for <Col N="1315"/>an equivalent but larger airline in the UK. We could well do with Mr. Walsh returning to Ireland.</P>
      <?oasys [cl11.2]?>
      <P>Senator Ryan should listen to my second reason, as the multinationals look at it this way as well. Would they invest in Aer Lingus without Willie Walsh?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to request that the Minister for Education and Science come into the House to discuss the legislation on special needs. It is clear that the best intentions of the Department to implement such legislation have fallen back. There is a failure on the part of someone but the responsibility must lay with the Minister who introduced the legislation. I mentioned an issue relating to this on two occasions this week. Apart from that particular situation, the delay in assessments across the country has continued. The appointment of personnel to carry out those assessments has failed to be implemented as promised. The series of initiatives promised by the Minister to have a proper special needs service have all failed. The evidence of that is the additional work forced on principals of national schools. They complain that despite the work they are carrying out to speed up the implementation of the special needs policy, it is only adding to the existing bureaucracy. I ask that the Minister come in to the House account for her effectiveness or failure to implement the legislation properly in the last six months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the point made by Senator Brennan on dangerous roads. I ask the Leader to contact the Minister for Transport on this issue and on road safety in general. There are many foreign registered cars and trucks speeding past any type of road. They seem to show no respect for speed limits. When caught by the speed cameras, they do not take responsibility and do not pay fines. Not all of these vehicles are from Northern Ireland, some are from other EU countries but are registered here.</P>
      <P>In many car auctions around Ireland, old cars are sold that appear in reasonable condition. However, there are no controls on them. They can be put on the roads as soon as they are bought and there is no check for insurance or tax. That matter must be addressed and I urge the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to take it in hand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Finucance, acting leader of the Opposition, asked why better estimates were not available on issues which were to be settled by the taxpayer. He wondered how the PAC report has concluded that an extra &euro;700 million has to be paid for the redress scheme than was originally estimated. That is a fair point and I do not know why it arises. It is the same with roads and other issues. I suppose the under-estimate is built on a hope that is not realised.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred to the correlation between the rise in suicides and the rise in alcohol consumption. It is clear why that is the case. Young minds and bodies are not able for the excessive consumption of alcohol. It is a good topic for debate and we will arrange it on resump<Col N="1317"/>tion after the break. Senator Ryan spoke about the responsibility within Departments. He asked that the EU services directive and competition policy in general be addressed in this House. It would interesting if the EU Commissioner came before the House to debate that. A Commissioner has been here before.</P>
      <P>Senator Brennan spoke about the 24 stretches of dangerous road in Ireland and the safety implications of such roads. Senator Bannon took up that issue and listed some of those roads. The county councils have received adequate funding for such roads and the county councillors should harass their executives to ensure that the funding is spent well. Senator Ormonde also called for a debate on suicide, particularly as the lead up to the leaving certificate is a very difficult time for young people.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry wondered what was happening in terms of the Gulfstream jet that lands in Shannon and demanded more information on it. Senator White spoke about the Travers report, which will be debated after the Order of Business. Senator Coghlan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator Dooley spoke about the aircraft which passes through Shannon Airport and agreed with the need for a debate on the issue. In response to Senator Norris, I will not lay information before the Garda Commissioner on the issue he raised. I do not have any such information. However, we should have a debate on the whole issue, be it with the Minister for Transport or the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan raised an issue which will come up in connection with the Travers report. The original file has not turned up in the Department but copies of the documents in question have always been available on computer. That is recorded in the report. What is not there, however, is the letter that should have accompanied those documents. Senator John Paul Phelan referred to the e-mail facility at the <Col N="1318"/>Department of Health and Children. I will advise the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children about that to see if it is functioning.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross mentioned multinationals and sought the attendance of the Minister for Transport in the House. I have already made that request.

    <Title>Report on Long-Stay Care Charges: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to discuss the Travers report in the Seanad. I pay tribute to Mr. John Travers for the excellent job he has done in carrying out an evaluation in the Department of Health and Children as to how, for 28 years, legal advice was not sought in regard to long-term charges for people in public institutions. When I asked Mr. Travers to carry out the task, I did so recognising his distinguished career in the civil and public service spanning 40 years. In a very short time, he has examined thousands of documents and legal opinions of the Department of Health and Children, other Departments and some of the health boards. He has done so single-handedly, with the help of one civil servant at the Department of Health and Children, and compiled what is a thorough and comprehensive report. It is a model of how we can have facts clearly assembled quickly and inexpensively in comparison to other routes we often use to discover information, which can take years and cost a considerable amount.</P>
      <P>I intend to provide a brief history, which is outlined in the report, of how this matter arose. I will then deal with the conclusions. The most important issue for me is what we do for the future. Institutional assistance regulations were introduced in 1954 on foot of the  Health Act 1953. These institutional assistance regulations provided for people to be charged for shelter and maintenance and that persons in public institutions could be charged regardless of whether they had a medical card.</P>
      <P>The Health Act 1970 was the only major reform before the Act we passed through the Oireachtas before Christmas last. The 1970 Act has been the main legislation governing the health services for the past 30 years. In that Act, for the first time, the concept of full eligibility and limited eligibility was defined. Full eligibility was essentially defined as referring to people with medical cards. The report refers to the 1970 Health Act which defines inpatient services as &ldquo;institutional services provided for persons while maintained in a hospital, convalescent home or home for persons suffering from physical or mental disability or in accommodation ancillary thereto&rdquo;. The report states &ldquo;Under these Regulations, charges imposed are only payable by persons with limited eligibility. Medical cardholders are exempt as are persons with dependants&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is relevant because a patient at Crooksling Hospital in Brittas, Maud McInerney, who was a ward of court, was being charged for shelter and maintenance. A case was taken on her behalf to the High Court which maintained, notwithstand<Col N="1320"/>ing the institutional assistance regulations which provide for the charging for shelter and maintenance, that if one was a medical card holder with full eligibility and there is any element of medical care in the facility, one cannot be charged. Essentially, the court set down the position that only those in a hostel-type facility where there was no medical care could be charged.</P>
      <P>That High Court decision was subsequently upheld by the Supreme Court but between the High Court and Supreme Court decisions, the Department introduced new regulations making it clear that one could only charge persons with limited eligibility and not those with full eligibility. However, at the time the regulations were introduced, the Department issued a circular to the health boards effectively telling them that they could move people away from full eligibility by taking away their medical cards. They made the point that they would not need medical cards when in institutional care. Therefore, by removing the medical cards, they became people of limited eligibility and could be charged. It is extraordinary but this is what happened. Subsequently, the Supreme Court upheld the decision in the McInerney case but nothing seems to have happened to implement the findings of the court. At the time of the regulations, between the High Court and Supreme Court decisions, the then legal adviser of the Department of Health, as it then was, stated it was not possible to amend primary legislation by regulation, which is significant.</P>
      <P>The next significant date is 1978, when the Eastern Health Board obtained an opinion from two senior counsel of the time, Ronan Keane, who went on to become Chief Justice, and Thomas McCann. Mr. Keane stated clearly in his opinion that there was no legislative base to do this, which is detailed on page 17 of the report. The Eastern Health Board wrote to the Department of Health enclosing a copy of the legal opinion, which stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">(i) the difficulties being experienced in levying charges on persons for long-stay care in health board institutions &ldquo;arises from the failure of the legislature to deal with the question of charges for maintenance ... in a clear and unambiguous fashion when the 1970 legislation was being passed&rdquo; and</P>
      <P LI="1">(ii) the difficulties in such cases &ldquo;can only be resolved by amending legislation&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The health board wrote to the Department which strongly advocated that &ldquo;consideration be given to introducing amending legislation and at ending the present confused and ambiguous situation&rdquo;. Notwithstanding that advice, no legislation was introduced. Through the years, every time somebody sued a health board for levying these charges the advice from the Department of Health to the health board was to stop charging and not contest the case. When invited by the <Col N="1321"/>Registrar of Wards of Court to challenge the legislation, the invitation was not taken up.</P>
      <P>This situation continued for many years. The Commission on Health Funding, which reported in 1989, drew attention to this difficulty. The health strategy published in the summer of 1994 drew attention to the fact that there were legal issues concerning long-term care and promised amending legislation. Many other reports were drawn up over the years.</P>
      <P>In 2001, when medical cards were being extended to everybody over 70 years by virtue of their age, the issue arose again. In October 2002 the South Eastern Health Board obtained a legal opinion which it forwarded to the Department of Health and Children in March 2003. It asked for a meeting to be held quickly to discuss the legal opinion but that meeting &mdash; the famous Gresham Hotel meeting &mdash; did not take place until December 2003, nine months after a meeting was sought and legal advice was submitted. On foot of that meeting, at which the issue was discussed, the correct decision was made, namely, to seek legal advice from the Attorney General. A letter was drafted for the Attorney General, as well as background documents, of which I have a copy. A copy also exists in the line Department which prepared the letter. That letter was forwarded to the Secretary General of the Department but, as we know, it did not issue. A copy of the letter and the background file was used in October 2004 when I asked for the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice to be sought. Later today, I will publish a copy of that correspondence because some confusion has arisen overnight as to whether some new file was found. No new file was found but, as Mr. Travers acknowledges on page 54 of the report, a copy of the file was in the line division.</P>
      <P>At the end of March 2004, after the letter was drafted on 27 January 2004, a meeting was held between the management committee of the Department of Health and Children and the chief executive officers of the health boards. Such meetings are frequent and usually take place, I understand, approximately twice a year. The minutes of the meeting are published with the report and acknowledge that legal advice was being sought. Therefore, everybody at the meeting was of the view that legal advice was being sought. The assistant secretary responsible in the line division attended the meeting and was under the impression that legal advice was being sought. The next meeting took place in October 2004. The minutes note that legal options were being reviewed. I mention these two meetings because the information was not accurate; legal advice was not being sought and legal options were not being explored.</P>
      <P>When, as a result of parliamentary questions, I asked for legal advice to be sought from the Attorney General, I received it very quickly. The advice was that we were acting <i>ultra vires</i> and, therefore, what we were doing was illegal and had to stop forthwith. We did that and sought to bring <Col N="1322"/>in amending legislation. At that time I asked the Secretary General of the Department to prepare a report on the issue for myself and the Cabinet. That report was prepared for 13 December and it is included in the published documentation. It is there for all to read.</P>
      <P>The report refers to a legally defensible position and so on. It did not contain any reference to the letter that had been drafted and sent to the Secretary General. I was not aware of that when I took the matter to the Government, nor was I aware of the long legal history in the Department. As I said at the Oireachtas committee meeting yesterday, the Government therefore made decisions based on incomplete and inaccurate information. That is why, when I became aware that a letter and a file existed, subsequent to the Government meeting I asked for Mr. Travers to be appointed to examine the issue.</P>
      <P>The conclusions of the report are very strong in terms of responsibility. All of us in this House have a duty to be fair and reasonable. I have already said that this was systemic maladministration over many years, and that is a fact. Maladministration does not of course merely affect public servants but can also be the responsibility of politicians. Notwithstanding those comments and the findings of this report, in the five months in which I have had the honour of being at the Department of Health and Children I have found outstanding public servants who work extremely hard under enormous pressure. Mr. Travers acknowledges that.</P>
      <P>The manner in which the Department set about drafting the legislation to establishing the HSE, a mammoth Bill which we took through the Oireachtas just before Christmas in very pressurised circumstances, is an example of such work. There are many other examples of complex issues such as the negotiations on the Medical Defence Union, which are handled by the Department of Health and Children. The Department accounts for about one in four of every euro the Government spends on a day to day basis. Unlike many other Departments it deals with life and death issues. Mr. Travers makes the point that the urgent &mdash; which clearly has to be dealt with &mdash; does not mean that the important has to be left aside, certainly not for 28 years.</P>
      <P>In his conclusions, Mr. Travers said there were shortcomings at political levels over the years since 1976 in not probing and questioning more strongly and assiduously the issues underlying the practice of charges for long stay care in health board institutions even if, or because, the analysis and briefings being provided by the officials in the Department of Health and Children appear to have been deficient in many respects. Mr. Travers said that these shortcomings were, however, of a nature, scale, substance and order of magnitude considerably less than those of the system of public administration.</P>
      <P>In summary, the Travers report says that the fundamental reason for the period of time that <Col N="1323"/>elapsed from the date at which legal concerns about the practice of long stay charges in health board institutions were known up to the request by the Department of Health and Children for legal advice from the Attorney General on 27 October 2004, lies in &ldquo;long term systemic corporate failure&rdquo;. The report says that this failure is &ldquo;principally a failure of public administration which, essentially, failed to identify, recognise and acknowledge the difference between actions and practices widely regarded as fair and reasonable and supportive of the development and protection of essential public health services and actions and practices that were legally valid&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The report notes:</P>
      <P LI="1">The overall failure of administration was compounded by the fact that the solution to the dichotomy between what was, perhaps, admirable and desirable from an operational, societal and public health service perspective and what was legally valid was readily amenable to remedy through the introduction of a simple legislative amendment. The failure was further compounded by ignoring for many years a range of legal advices and opinions which pointed to the remedy of the problems arising but which were left to one side in the persistent belief that the practices at issue were at least &ldquo;defensible&rdquo; in a legal sense even if this, ultimately, proved to be incorrect. In summary, it was a case of &ldquo;good intentions&rdquo; not being supported by the requisite legal foundations.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Mr. Travers makes the point that all the legal opinion available to the Department and health boards from their own legal advisers was to the effect that this was not legal. He could not find any substantial legal advice which contradicted that.</P>
      <P>What are the lessons to be learned? Mr. Travers makes a number of recommendations which we intend to implement and I want to work with the management team in order to do so. Above all else, it seems the lesson we all need to learn is that one must not ignore legal advice and not leave matters in the lap of the gods. We all need to act speedily when legal issues arise. Certainly, in 1976, after the Supreme Court upheld the McInerney decision, the fact that this was not put on a sound legal footing is incredible because in those days Supreme Court decisions were rarer than they are today. We get Supreme Court decisions very frequently these days and indeed had one yesterday. To get one is not as unusual as it was 30 years ago. Even though the legal adviser at the Department took a particular view, others took a different view.</P>
      <P>This is not all about procedures and law but about people. The HSE says that 315,818 people were affected, though that figure is not yet verified. Most of those people have passed away but about 20,000 are still alive. All who have been in Government for 50 years have upheld the prin<Col N="1324"/>ciple that one makes a contribution to shelter and maintenance and I think that principle is broadly supported in the community. People who live at home or live in the community support it anyway. A good principle, broadly supported, with virtual consensus in our society that it is the right thing, was not put on a statutory footing, so that we are now in a position where we have to identify where we can those individuals affected.</P>
      <P>That will be a mammoth task. Some institutions are closed and I understand there are no records for them. We will have to get some outside expertise because we have never before undertaken a task of this kind in Ireland. As many people will know, there was much debate about the offshore and non-resident accounts but that involved nothing like the volume this matter entails in terms of documentation and records.</P>
      <P>A Cabinet sub-committee is looking at the implications of the Supreme Court decision. We sought in the legislation which was the subject of that decision a legal basis for the future and to get the power retrospectively in order to protect the taxpayer. The Supreme Court held that the prospective legislation was constitutional and indeed that retrospection was not unconstitutional under Article 15.5. It held, however, that one cannot take away someone&rsquo;s property rights without compensation and it would be constitutional to do so only if the finances were such that it would cause disequilibrium in the public finances. Given our economic state, the court did not consider that the sums of money involved would cause disequilibrium. The figure mentioned in the Supreme Court was approximately &euro;500 million.</P>
      <P>The Government has to refund all those involved who were of unsound mind. It cannot use the Statute of Limitations against those persons. Regarding any of the others remaining alive, if one were not going to make refunds dating back to 1976 one would have to prove that they were not of unsound mind and I do not know how one would go about that task, never mind the trauma involved. Accordingly, repayments will have to be made to all those involved who are still alive. We may consider using the Statute of Limitations with regard to estates. No decision has been made on that because we were awaiting the Travers report and its legal implications. The Cabinet sub-committee will meet shortly to set out clearly how we intend to proceed because I know people are concerned. Those citizens of whom we speak are old, vulnerable, intellectually disabled and mentally ill.</P>
      <P>It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to address the Travers report in this House. When I moved the legislation in this House and in the D&aacute;il before Christmas, I said, as did the Taoiseach, that all of this was done in good faith. We were led to believe certain things and it was on that basis we made decisions. Very early on in the Travers process it became clear that there was legal advice going back to 1978. That is why, <Col N="1325"/>before the Supreme Court, counsel for the State did not argue that this matter was done in good faith. At the time, people wondered why that was the case. It was because, between the passing of the legislation and the Travers process, and the process for the court, the Keane judgment was discovered. That made it very clear to anyone who read it that we were not on a sound legal footing. That was certainly known in 1978 and we now know that it was known in 1976 because the Department&rsquo;s own legal advisers made it clear that we could not amend primary legislation by means of a regulation.</P>

	<P>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste and her officials to the House. I am sure that on the eve of her birthday she did not plan for this to be on her agenda.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure she had other plans for parties and cakes but, unfortunately, this matter came to dominate.</P>
      <P>We have debated this matter at length in this House and I thank the Leader for organising those debates. There are many worrying aspects to the matter. The Travers report is very good but I question if it is a complete report. Fergal Bowers thought he had the original folder but it now appears there is only a letter. There seem to be some documents that have not been accounted for. Perhaps the T&aacute;naiste can clarify later if the document in the possession of Fergal Bowers was not available to Mr. Travers and if that is the case&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>May I deal with this question now as I cannot remain for the whole debate? The story this morning was not accurate. Mr. Travers deals with it in page 54 of his report and I intend to publish the documents, namely, the letter that was drafted and sent to the Secretary General on 27 January and the background documentation. They were on file in the Department&rsquo;s line division that prepared them. They were the same papers used when I asked for legal advice in October last and Mr. Travers refers to them.</P>
      <P>The Fergal Bowers story this morning was not a new discovery. Mr. Travers saw this file and I will publish it. On the top of the file, the legal advice from Miss O&rsquo;Flynn is noted. The official wrote that Miss O&rsquo;Flynn was satisfied that they should go directly to the Attorney General for advice. The note makes it very clear what was to happen. I also dealt with this issue in the D&aacute;il earlier today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>In the report, as published, civil servants received a fair share of criticism and probably correctly so. However, politicians should also take responsibility. Ministers have many perks and bonuses but holding office also <Col N="1326"/>entails major responsibility. We have clearly seen that Ministers did not take responsibility for their own Department. I include the two former Ministers of State at the Department of Health and Children as well as the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children who remained after the recent reshuffle.</P>
      <P>A mess has been created. The T&aacute;naiste correctly pointed out that one out of every four euro of State expenditure goes on health. We now have a massive bill outstanding but do not yet know the full figure. I got the impression from the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s statements that it may be far bigger than we currently think. She referred to non-existent records which may in turn lead to a legal debacle, costing the taxpayer even more money. Perhaps the figure of &euro;500 million is unrealistic. As the T&aacute;naiste herself stated, this money could have been used for other health services. At least we now have clarity. To be positive, by forcing the issue in 2005 we might have saved another Government in 2035 from facing a massive bill. Future Governments will say, &ldquo;Thank God it was spotted in 2004&rdquo;. It might be 30 years too late but at least it has been recognised.</P>
      <P>A worrying feature of the report is that there is a clear conflict of evidence between the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, and the official, Mr. Kelly. Mr. Kelly clearly remembers giving a folder containing the letters we have just mentioned with regard to the Attorney General to Deputy Martin but the former Minister cannot remember it. Mr. Kelly can clearly remember discussing the possible implications of a negative reply from the Attorney General, yet Deputy Martin cannot remember that either. In addition, we have a civil servant who clearly remembers seeing the folder on Deputy Martin&rsquo;s table but the former Minister cannot remember it. This is a weakness in the Travers report.</P>

	<P>In the D&aacute;il, the Minister stated that the issue was dealt with in detail at the meeting of 16 December 2003. The Travers report states that the issue was dealt with rapidly. This is a clear contrast and the T&aacute;naiste should clarify that point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Browne, without interruption. Senators will have a chance to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>A point that seems to be lost on the current T&aacute;naiste and other Ministers is that <Col N="1328"/>when one succeeds somebody in a Department, one is responsible for the other Minister&rsquo;s actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I have never heard that before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>For example, if the Department of Health and Children is being sued the case still proceeds if the Minister changes. That element appears to have been forgotten by this Government. There is a certain amount of responsibility. The contrast in the handling of the issue by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children with the mishandling of the issue by her predecessor, is very stark. When I asked the T&aacute;naiste yesterday whether she has full confidence in her Cabinet colleague, the Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, she failed to answer the question. This does not inspire confidence among the public.</P>
      <P>Although I understand the T&aacute;naiste is under pressure today, it is regrettable that she has left the House. I wished to ask her if this issue was ever discussed at Cabinet. Unfortunately, as we cannot make a freedom of information request in this regard, we will not know the answer for another 30 years. It is a very interesting question. If it was discussed, there are wider implications.</P>
      <P>Another worrying aspect of this case concerns the inconsistent response of the health boards. My own health board, the South Eastern Health Board, sought and received clear legal advice. I commend it for having the initiative to do so. The worst aspect of this case is that patients who could not speak up for and defend themselves continued to pay the charges, while those who could defend themselves were exempted. This is not satisfactory.</P>
      <P>The decision to grant medical cards to the over 70s was made in 2001. We still cannot ascertain the number of people who were over 70 and had a medical card, based on financial or medical grounds before 2001. It is incredible that in 2001 the Department of Health and Children underestimated the number of those over 70 and now is unable to furnish us with those details. We accept that this problem did not begin under Deputy Martin but when he decided to give medical cards to the over 70s, it should have brought the issue to the surface.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, the T&aacute;naiste stated that this issue was meant to be brought before the first Government in which Senator O&rsquo;Rourke served under Charles Haughey in 1987. When the former Deputy, John Boland, was acting as Minister for Health for an interim period, a problem was spotted and he brought it to the last Cabinet meeting chaired by Dr. Garret FitzGerald. It should then have been brought to the attention of the new Cabinet at its first meeting. For some reason, that did not happen. Perhaps that was a failure on the part of civil servants to ensure that the issue was brought to the fore after the change of Government. There was certainly neglect under the new Government. In 2001, when the free medical <Col N="1329"/>cards for the over 70s were introduced, the Government should have spotted the mistake and used the legislation that was required to address this issue, but this was not done.</P>
      <P>It is amazing to read the comments of members of the Fianna F&aacute;il Front Bench in the Official Report of the D&aacute;il of 20 November 1996 when the former Minister for Justice, Nora Owen, was in some difficulty about a letter missing from her Department. At the time, the then Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Bertie Ahern, stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">Every time there is a political crisis in this House, this Government [meaning the Fine Gael-led Government] seeks to blame administrators and turn it into an administrative crisis. The report is a whitewash, trying to put the blame on poor unfortunate civil servants.</P>
      <P FLI="0">How quickly things change. I will not read out Deputy Martin&rsquo;s contribution as it would be even more embarrassing for him.</P>

	<P>Speaking in the D&aacute;il on 26 November 1996, Deputy Martin stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">From the findings of the Cromien inquiry, it is clear that no-one is taking responsibility for the sordid nature of this debacle. It seems that civil servants must take the fall for political failure and negligence on the part of the Minister, the Attorney General and others.</P>

	<P>I was amused by the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s assertion in the House on 23 February 2005 that the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, would not be found guilty. The Tan&aacute;iste and, I think, Senator Minihan, were reacting to a comment I made about the possible findings of the Travers report. I asked the T&aacute;naiste how she could be so emphatic in advance of the report&rsquo;s publication. I thought it made a mockery of having an inquiry if the result was known in advance. That is why I was not surprised when I saw that a senior civil servant was scapegoated and there was no political fallout. I wonder how the Tan&aacute;iste was so well briefed on this issue. Questions need to be asked about that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>There are many issues in this that are very pertinent to the public. The former Minister, Deputy Martin, has claimed he was never given a briefing note by the Department, that would allow him to appreciate the significance of the charge issue. However, on page 44 of the report, this assertion appears to be undermined in paragraph 4.41. Prior to the MAC meeting on 16 December 2003, all Ministers concerned were provided with briefing notes on the issues on the agenda. The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, told Mr. Travers &ldquo;he had read the papers relating to long-stay charges in advance of the meeting&rdquo;. He went on to say he was aware that &ldquo;if the opinion and legal advices of the South Eastern Health Board were correct, they would give rise to significant legal, operational, financial and political implications&rdquo;. It is, therefore, clear that the briefing that allowed the Minister of State to draw this conclusion was also available to the former Minister, Deputy Martin, and the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Callely. Those Ministers either read the briefing and chose to ignore it or chose not to read it. Either way, they are culpable. Deputy Martin cannot claim he was never given a briefing which would highlight the issues. If the briefing was good enough for Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, it was good enough for Deputy Martin. The difference appears to be that Deputy Martin did not read the briefing. The Travers report appears to go very soft on the politicians. Mr. Travers has found wrongdoing in the Department and, unfortunately, Mr. Kelly has taken the hit.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>A second perusal would seem necessary. I compliment John Travers on this report. One thing that comes through very forcefully is that for the past 29 years, a situation obtained in long-stay institutions that clearly was not legitimate. That has been borne out in this report. It took 29 years and this Minister for Health and Children and Government to put it on a solid footing. I accept that the Bill we put through before Christmas was found to be unconstitutional in a certain respect. One thing that is useful about the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision is that we now have clarity on the matter; we can proceed with a sound degree of safety and put matters on a legislative footing. Even though it has taken 29 years, it is never too late to do the right thing.</P>
      <P>The mature approach to this issue is to accept that under successive Governments and successive administrations in the Department of Health and Children, things that should have happened did not happen. There is no point in saying black and meaning white.</P>
      <P>When I spoke earlier on the Bill, and I am on public record on this, I said people would come out of the woodwork. I heard a prize example last night. A woman entered a long-stay institution and asked to visit her favourite aunt. The reason for the visit is, I am sure, apparent to all. The staff had no recollection of the woman in question ever visiting her aunt. She was too late as her aunt had died ten years previously. I rest my case.</P>

	<P>That is the exception to the rule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I hate ambulance chasing. It happened with the army deafness claims and it has begun again here not merely among the legal profession, but also among some politicians. I find that offensive. I want to read paragraph 4.25 from the report:</P>
      <P LI="1">It may be important to point out, to the extent that this might otherwise not be apparent, that the problems surrounding the custom and practice of charges for long-term care in health board institutions did not start with, or derive from, the 2001 Act. These problems, as indicated, had their origins in the decisions taken many years previously. What the 2001 Act did, as it happens, achieve was to bring underlying problems associated with the custom and practice of charges in health board long term care institutions to the surface in a way that effectively forced their resolution. The parameters of that resolution are still evolving as this report is being prepared. The process of resolution at present underway may, perhaps, <Col N="1333"/>have been a somewhat unintended consequence of the 2001 Budget decision which gave rise to the 2001 Act.</P>
      <P FLI="0">While the proactive action of the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Health and Children and the Government came after 29 years, I repeat it is not too late to do the right thing. Future Governments and long-suffering taxpayers will be saved.</P>
      <P>Every fair person in this House admits that several Administrations should have done something prior to now but they did not do so. The deductions taken from patients in long-term care institutions should be refunded. I reiterate that some people with little or no interest in the persons concerned will claim these refunds.</P>

	<P>There is a clear effort being made by some of those on the other side of the House to demonise Deputy Martin. By quoting from a particular page it has been inferred that this issue was dealt with in an outer office. As a long-standing member of a local authority, a chairman of two authorities on two occasions and, to a lesser extent, a Member of this House, I can state that this is not the way these matters are dealt with. If something is on the Minister&rsquo;s desk then it is not in an outer office. If it is in an outer office, it is for the attention of someone else and I resent and regret that this sad occasion is being used in this way. Deductions were taken that should not have been taken and must now be repaid.</P>
      <P>We must revert to and implement Mr. Travers&rsquo;s recommendations without qualification, as stated by the T&aacute;naiste. The terms of reference as outlined on page 87 are the panacea to cure this ill. I support the T&aacute;naiste in this regard and commend the Government for its proactive measures to put this procedure on a solid legal footing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>It is with some regret that these discussions become party political issues. Senator Browne is correct in that many people from both sides of the House over the past 17 years have called for the heads of Ministers. I have asked on at least ten occasions in that time for a full debate <Col N="1334"/>on the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924, as amended in 1995, to establish what is meant by the &ldquo;Accounting Officer&rdquo; of a Department, to determine what is meant by political responsibility and the relationship between the two. Any lawyer would be of the view that these have to be applied reasonably and I value the Minister of State&rsquo;s view on this. There is a rush to judgment as part of the political process but I have outlined the necessity to forensically examine such topics as those concerning Judge Curtin, Mr. Justice Flaherty and others. Pure, naked political views on the role of the Accounting Officer and political responsibility do not help. The situation is not helped either by incorrect information or misinformation. How could any right-minded person bring this issue into the party political process? All parties have been involved in this issue.</P>

	<P>We have said this previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The Travers report is absolutely clear. I have read it three times and do not doubt its accuracy. In 1975 and 1976, the then Minister for Health, Brendan Corish, was a member of the Labour Party but this could have happened to anyone. His Department&rsquo;s legal officer gave him advice to the effect that the charge was not legal. In the officer&rsquo;s words, the charges would require a legal amendment and could not be done by regulation. The Minister told the then Fine Gael Minister for Finance, Richie Ryan, that he was proposing to implement charges and the latter agreed. Mr. Corish wrote a letter to the effect that the Health Act 1954 and the Health Contributions (Amendment) Act 1974 should be interpreted on the basis that those in long-term care would not be seen to have full eligibility and so forth.</P>
      <P>There can be no doubt that this started the process. If not complete closure, resolution has been brought about in the past two months by the current Minister for Health and Children, who happens to be a member of the Progressive Democrats.</P>
      <P>The issue in question now is what happened over the past year and what is the role of the former Fianna F&aacute;il Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin. We can come to our own conclusions about the conflicting evidence but the facts are mostly clear. A briefing document was put together for the Minister at a meeting in the Gresham Hotel in December 2003 but the extent to which it outlined the importance of the charges issue is unclear. However, we know it was on the agenda and we can assume the legal advice received by the South Eastern Health Board comprised a section of that paper. We know that one Minister of State read the document and that another may not have done so. However, we are unsure as to whether Deputy Martin read it. Senator Browne is correct in that the Minister <Col N="1335"/>should have read it or should have had it brought to his attention. That was his responsibility.</P>
      <P>It is clear that, whether he read it or not, the correct decision was taken at the meeting to seek legal advice. The Minister was made aware of this in the ten minutes it took the Secretary General of the Department to walk from the steps of the Gresham Hotel up the steps to the meeting room. This was a minor issue when the major topic of the day was the Hanly report, the CEOs and the Health Service Executive.</P>
      <P>The following week the Department set up a high-level meeting to prepare documentation to implement the decisions of the meeting and to seek the advice of the Attorney General. We can assume this documentation contained all of the background information, the available advice and a letter to be signed by and from the Secretary General to the Attorney General. This was a letter that had been placed on his desk on 27 January 2004. The Secretary General recalls receiving and reading it but he does not know what happened afterwards. He claims he did not send it to the Attorney General and that he would have brought it to the Minister but has no recollection of doing so, nor does he recollect discussing it with the Minister. There is no paper trail leading to the Minister&rsquo;s office to indicate it ever arrived there. A senior member of the Department of Health and Children gave a verbal account to the effect that he saw a folder in the outer office of the Minister&rsquo;s secretariat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>He said he observed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I want this to be clear on the record. That member understood it to be the particular folder in question, although how he read through the cover is unknown. Whether he is right or wrong, everyone accepts that there is no record anywhere of the folder having arrived in the Minister&rsquo;s office.</P>
      <P>What happened next is that on 10 March the Minister had one or two meetings with the Secretary General of the Department to sign up to the business plan. Mr. Travers asked the Secretary General whether he discussed the matter with the Minister on that occasion. He has no recollection of doing so. Mr. Travers asked him whether that occasion would not have been a reminder to him that the matter had not been sent to the Attorney General and he answered that it should have been. That is all clear in the report.</P>
      <P>Some time later there was another meeting of the same group that had met in the Gresham Hotel, but this time the politicians were not present. That meeting was chaired by the Secretary General. The minutes of that meeting indicated that the previous meeting had sought the advice of the Attorney General and this was noted by the meeting. The only person at that meeting who knew the matter had not gone to <Col N="1336"/>the Attorney General was the Secretary General of the Department, who chose not to inform people that they were incorrect and that it had not happened.</P>
      <P>Some months later, in October, the issue was raised again at a similar meeting of the same group. Again, there was only one person at that meeting who knew the matter had not gone to the Attorney General, namely, the Secretary General of the Department. He chaired the meeting but chose not to inform people that it had not gone to the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>There is a major conflict with regard to what was said to the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, and Senator Browne raised some important points with regard to whether Deputy Martin is right or wrong. The one clincher as far as I am concerned is whether the Secretary General told the Minister. We do not know. There is in the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s words &ldquo;a conflict of evidence&rdquo;. We know for a fact that when the Secretary General came to brief the new Minister, he did not find this issue important enough to brief her on it. From that I must conclude that all the evidence is on the side of the former Minister, Deputy Martin, for the previous year.</P>
      <P>I hold no party political brief on these issues. However, I believe it is important to put matters on the record. If I have a criticism to make of Deputy Martin it is, as Senator Browne said, that this was a serious and important issue which he should have followed up. I do not agree that it would be reasonable to expect a Minister to have to examine documentation that was being sent by a Secretary General to an Attorney General. That is not normal practice. Neither would it be reasonable, in terms of turn around time through the Attorney General, that a Minister would expect to have advice back from the Attorney General in a short period. It does not happen that way and these are the facts.</P>
      <P>I move on to the matters of political responsibility and the Accounting Officer. Under the 1924 Act, the Accounting Officer is the Secretary General. He clearly made errors. To be fair, he has explained how that could have happened. The former Minister, Deputy Martin, has explained how it could have happened and so has Mr. Travers. The Department is extraordinarily busy and has never had a more difficult time than during the past two years. Anyone can understand how a hard-working person, with an impeccable reputation until this matter, could have made a mistake.</P>
      <P>It is important to record that it is grossly unfair for people to equate this with issues such as corruption, bribery and dishonesty. This man gained nothing, there was no profit and he has suffered badly from it. At most, he made a serious error of judgment or a serious omission. He did nothing dishonest or corrupt and made no personal gain. As Accounting Officer he had to take responsibility on an accounting matter. He has taken responsibility and is gone.</P><Col N="1337"/>
      <P>Under the Act, the Minister is the person with political responsibility. Therefore, he cannot say with one bound that he is free. What should a Minister do in this situation? Is it reasonable to expect that he should take responsibility for every neglect by omission or commission in his Department? For example, if somebody at a high level in the Department did some illegal, underhand or unfair dastardly act to line his or her pockets, would we expect the Minister to take responsibility? The best analogy I can give is the recent Act passed in this House regarding the requirement of directors to ensure that they take responsibility for signing off on compliance in their companies. The directors must say that they have put in place structures to ensure they have complied in every way with what is required and that to the best of their knowledge they have acted honourably and in compliance with all parts of the law.</P>
      <P>In this situation, the structures were in place. The structure was a paper trail. Why did they not deal with it? The simple answer lies in the three different statements of the Secretary General. The paper trail stopped at his office. He admitted that he broke the system by taking the document from his office without recording it out and that wherever he brought it, he did not record it in. He has accepted responsibility for that. Can a Minister be held responsible for that? I do not know. It is the Opposition&rsquo;s job to make the Minister feel responsible but it is not my job as an Independent Senator.</P>
      <P>I look at the matter from all sides and come to my conclusion which I want to put on the record of the House. This matter is a sorry mess. I am irritated by what I have heard here over the past week about what was legal or illegal. The Supreme Court judgment was very clear. The illegality did not refer to the retrospective element but to the private property element, something in the Constitution against which Senator Ryan and I have argued for many years. It was on the basis of the dastardly private property section in the Constitution, in as much as the person&rsquo;s pension was concerned to be his or her private property, that the Department was found to have acted unconstitutionally and without a legal framework.</P>
      <P>In that regard, every Minister who sat in the Department and got this legal advice over the years must be answerable in as much as Deputy Martin. There is nothing in what I have read to say that he is more or less responsible than the first few Ministers who dealt with this matter. I do not know what people did in between.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the lucid argument put forward by Senator O&rsquo;Toole and previous speakers. On behalf of this House I thank Mr. Travers for his report which is clear, lucid, understandable and sharply and crisply written. I welcome that in any report. This report is an example of what can be done when the job is given to a <Col N="1338"/>competent person who concentrates on it. The report requires at least three readings, an initial cursory one followed by more detailed reading. I read it twice yesterday and once this morning and each reading confirmed my estimation of the report. It should be recorded that Mr. Travers has done the State a service.</P>
      <P>I was struck by how the report is a litany of &ldquo;nearly there but not done&rdquo; or lost opportunities. It is like a novel of lost opportunities. There were many occasions on which the matter almost came to the Cabinet table, but did not and then lapsed for another few years. The report clearly points out that the starting point was 1976. There were missed opportunities in 1987, 1989 and 1994 when the Government health strategy publicised the matter and said amending legislation would be made. It never happened. The reason we are concentrating on the years 2001 to 2004 is that they became the pivotal three years because of meetings, including in the Gresham Hotel, etc.</P>
      <P>Mr. Travers clearly points out that there were degrees of culpability. In a particular section of the report he points out that, perhaps, Ministers should have poked around and sought further information. However, he says the greater culpability was on that part of the public administration which did not see to it that this matter was given the highest priority. If it had happened in 1976, for example, the cost would be negligible. However, this is 2005 and we are paying the piper. It is correct that this should happen because elderly people suffered losses in the intervening years. The Minister referred to having to get an outside agency to correlate all the information because it is a major task, particularly given that a number of institutions no longer exist and records are not available.</P>
      <P>I would like to take up Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s point. If we want to go down the route of picking ministerial villains, Ministers of all Governments bear responsibility but one cannot pick out a period and a villain, put the villain&rsquo;s hat on him or her and put him or her in a corner. The report highlights numerous incidents of ministerial culpability.</P>
      <P>I must correct Senator Browne&rsquo;s misstatement. He stated the Secretary General reported the file was on the Minister&rsquo;s desk.</P>

	<P>When the Senator is appointed to a Department, he will understand there is a significant difference between a Minister&rsquo;s desk and an outer office, in which there are several desks. It is wrong of the Senator to make that statement and he should read the report again.</P>

	<P>According to Mr. Travers, a folder containing the January 2004 submission was observed by another official of the Department, who would have recognised it and was aware of its significance. Every file I received when in office looked the same as the preceding file and the following file. The official was sharp. Mr. Travers report reads, &ldquo;In the outer office of the Minister&rsquo;s office at some point in early 2004...&rdquo;. I was Minister for Health. A door leads from the Minister&rsquo;s office to the outer office, in which there are four or five desks. It is incorrect of the Senator to state the folder was left on the Minister&rsquo;s desk.</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Government Members are playing word games. The Secretary General clearly recollects discussing the implications of the file. It is in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator cannot keep interrupting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Senator should be provided with a tour of Hawkins House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I will bring him. The Secretary General of the Department will no longer be the Accounting Officer as that function has passed to the Health Service Executive. However, I have always been of the opinion that the Department should have two Secretaries General, one in charge of everyday fire brigade issues, which erupt about ten times a day, and the other in charge of legislation and policy-making. That has not transpired but the idea has been floated for a number of years. The Accounting Officer has been deployed to the HSE and perhaps there is no need for two Secretaries General.</P>
      <P>Pressure of work is significant in every Department but it is enormous in the Department of Health and Children. I was Minister for nine weeks and that is why I am aware of the geography of the building. Two weeks were taken up by Christmas but, even in the seven weeks I worked there, I grasped how much work is involved. However, that does not obscure the fact that long-stay charges were a high priority demanding attention. The issue was not attended to and that remains the mystery at the heart of this matter. The Secretary General would have known well, given his vast experience, that this issue needed to be addressed and brought to the Government&rsquo;s <Col N="1340"/>attention. I fail to understand why the Secretary General and his predecessors did not attend to this issue with alacrity and celerity.</P>
      <P>Files are sent to Ministers, initialled, dated and forwarded and everything is logged but, on this occasion, the file was not logged. That remains a huge mystery. The Secretary General said he cleared his desk every 24 hours, which is an admirable trait. I do not know what recesses of mind led to the folder not being forwarded. My conclusion is that it was because it involved a significant financial commitment. The Department, as always, would be battered by the Department of Finance because it is a high spending Department. I approve of the Department of Finance being the watchdog of the public purse, otherwise we would be a profligate nation. Perhaps in a recess of the Secretary General&rsquo;s mind he thought, &ldquo;Oh God, this is going to be another huge row over finance, how are we going to cope with it?&rdquo; However, if that was the case the probity of the system and the public service ethos of individuals should have risen above that.</P>
      <P>John Travers states at the beginning of the report that he will not give a judgment on morality and asks where one could find a person who could judge on the morality of this issue. I applaud the Minister for grasping the issue. She must have thought, &ldquo;Oh my God, what I have come into? Angola writ large. How will I cope and manage?&rdquo; However, she grasped the issue and produced the report. As a result, she has exceeded all my ideas of her. She has a strong record of public service and trust. The Government has also grasped the issue, although it cannot have welcomed it. However, it must be dealt with and I commend the Minister on her business-like approach to the issue and her sense of civic duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>In the 1970s the German Chancellor, Willy Brandt, resigned because a secretary in his office was found to have been involved in espionage. There was no suggestion he knew, there was no suggestion he could have known and there was no suggestion of wrongdoing on his part. Willy Brandt said he was responsible for what happened in his central office and resigned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>He appointed the secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no evidence the secretary was appointed by Willy Brandt, who made it clear he did nothing wrong but said he should have known and was responsible. It is often difficult to get through to the Government that the position of Minister is one of responsibility. Many people think it is about glory but it is about responsibility, to which I will refer later.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated the first lesson to be learned from the report was not to ignore legal advice. None of us could avoid the question of ignoring legal advice. The real advice to give to Ministers is to identify that for which one is <Col N="1341"/>responsible. Ministers are responsible for legal, constitutional and financial issues. Those are the three major ones that I can see. It is a reasonable expectation that any Minister in Government would not wait to be told that there is a problem. The Minister should ask whether there are problems of which he or she should be aware. That is what taking responsibility is about. If the Minister lacks the initiative and managerial enterprise to ask what are the problems of the Department, passing over responsibility and saying that it is not his fault because he was not told, he is not accepting responsibility. The job of a Minister is not simply to take credit or accept glory, although it is nice when that happens; it is to take responsibility.</P>
      <P>We have an extraordinary situation in our political system where very large amounts of work are done by Government quangos, and Members of the Oireachtas cannot question Ministers about decisions made by a whole range of bodies. I assume that the HSE falls into that category. However, every major piece of good news from all those agencies will still be announced by a Minister who is not responsible for their decisions. Let us make up our minds once and for all in this country. Either Ministers are responsible, in which case they are responsible for everything, or they are not, in which case they should butt out and leave such decisions to the relevant agencies. For Ministers to claim the glory while denying the responsibility is to make a mockery of the whole idea of political accountability. That is what is going on here.</P>
      <P>I am tempted to quote the wonderful, flowery language of the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, when he was talking about someone else in Government, but it would take up too much time. Suffice to say that members of Fianna F&aacute;il in Opposition are capable of using language that no one in this House has used today about Deputy Martin&rsquo;s position. They used extraordinary language about a far less significant issue, important though it was &mdash; the administrative failure of a judge in the Special Criminal Court. They used astonishing language about his incompetence, all of which amounted to saying that one could not blame the Civil Service for the Minister&rsquo;s responsibility. Suddenly, in Government, we have the opposite. Fianna F&aacute;il discover that it is not the Minister&rsquo;s fault at all but that of someone else, since he was not informed of the problem. The logic defies me. I wonder about the Government and Ministers. Before someone else says it, I know that I will die wondering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should be more optimistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Leaving aside the politics, let us consider the recommendations. When I looked at them on page 93, my jaw dropped. Most of what is recommended about how to run a decent <Col N="1342"/>organisation could have been written by a first year student of business studies. Did it really need &euro;2 billion, or at least hundreds of millions of euro of taxpayers&rsquo; money for the Department to go astray? We do not know the exact figure, so we should not exaggerate it. Money taken from people is now being paid back. Did it really take that to happen for us to be presented with such recommendations? They include the following: that Governments should get the legal basis for decisions right; that there should be an analytical capability in a Department; that there should be transparency &mdash; we all approve of that; that there should be records; that there should be some capacity to assess risk; that a proper system of recording decisions should be in place; that we should have some way of identifying which issues are important; and that we should have an understanding of issues of political sensitivity. I will not go through them all, since I do not have time.</P>
      <P>For God&rsquo;s sake, we are spending almost &euro;40 billion a year through Government bodies, yet I am now told that those things were not self-evident to those running the Departments. On this I am deliberately trying to avoid being party political. It is mind-boggling that it might be so and I blame politicians for that, since they are responsible for how Departments are run. They may not want to do it or accept it. Civil servants are supposed to do what the Minister wants and assist the Minister in that regard. If the Minister does not want to make Departments work properly, all those things are left out.</P>
      <P>I am flabbergasted by these recommendations. It is always a good idea to look at recommendations in reports. I thought that I was going to see high-flown, serious material. Instead, as I said, I found what were almost schoolboy or schoolgirl ideas, so self-evidently true that it is astonishing they are not already in place.</P>
      <P>I would like someone to answer this question. Is there now a Government decision that these recommendations will be implemented, not just in the Department of Health and Children but in every Department? The response should be nothing less than that. If there is a lesson to be learnt for the future, it is that those are necessary conditions for any sense of good governance. Are there any other time bombs waiting to explode in other Departments? Has every Secretary General been asked whether there are issues similar to this in scale or potential consequence in his or her Department? If they have not been asked, why not? I would like to know if that has happened.</P>
      <P>The intricacy with which Ministers and Departments use language has always fascinated me, and the Department of Health and Children is still holding on to dubious interpretations of the distinction between entitlement and eligibility. It did so in the teeth of conclusions drawn by the Ombudsman in 2001. The Department is still disputing what other people took to be the meaning of the words &ldquo;entitlement&rdquo; and &ldquo;eligibility&rdquo;. It <Col N="1343"/>invites a ministerial decision, since Ministers cannot have been aware of that.</P>
      <P>I return to the famous meeting in the Gresham Hotel; something about it fascinates me. The reason the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Martin, is being criticised and has been invited to consider his position is that he is the only former Minister for Health and Children still in Government. What I say would apply to any Minister who had been there long enough to have been culpable in the way in which I believe Deputy Martin was. What could he have done? In the 2001 health strategy, for instance, there is, as I am sure Members are aware, the intriguing phrase, &ldquo;eligibility arrangements will be simplified&rdquo;. It states:</P>
      <P LI="1">The Ombudsman has drawn attention to the uncertainty surrounding the eligibility of older people for long-term residential care. Clarification of entitlement in this regard will be given particular attention in the general review of legislation on entitlement.</P>
      <P FLI="0">How did that get into the 2001 health strategy without some discussion of who would pay for it? I do not care how it is clouded politically. How did it get into a document that went through Cabinet and was approved? How did such a reference get in without someone somewhere asking what it would cost and who would pay?</P>
      <P>Then there was the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report of 2001, in which he clearly drew attention to those anomalies. How did that happen? The only conclusion to which one can come is that there are conflicts of recollection between the Secretary General and the Minister. I say no more than that; I do not believe that either of them is the kind of person who would tell lies. It has never been my style to accuse people of that. How did the then Minister process the decision to issue medical cards to everybody over 70, a decision that I have publicly supported on many occasions, without him or the Department of Finance asking how much it would cost? How is it possible that all this history never arose in the process of making that decision? That is a mind-boggling picture of incompetent decision-making for which the Minister is responsible.</P>
      <P>The Minister says he cannot be responsible for what is not drawn to his attention. I said on the Order of Business this morning, and I repeat it now, that if that is the picture of a Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment that will be conveyed to chief executives of multinational companies, a Minister who says he is not responsible because nobody told him about it, Ireland will suffer. Most of the CEOs of those multinationals, if something of this scale happened, would lose their jobs on the spot, not because nobody told them but because they did not have the wit and the nous to ask. That is the fundamental question. There has been too much talk about what the Secretary General told the Mini<Col N="1344"/>ster. The fundamental question is the reason the Minister did not ask questions that were obvious to other people and the only conclusion one can come to is that the Minister did not ask those questions in that period because he did not want to know the answers. That is an abnegation of responsibility and it is the reason he should resign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and compliment Mr. Travers on his report. It is an example to us all of the way a complex issue can be dealt with in a short timeframe and a report of this nature produced. The State owes a debt of gratitude to Mr. Travers for the report he has produced.</P>
      <P>The principle involved here is that all those in receipt of publicly provided residential long-term care should make some payment towards accommodation and daily living costs if they can afford to do so, just as they would if they were living in the community. That principle has been accepted over the years by successive Governments. That was the practice from 1954 when the institutional assistance regulations were in place. The new Health Act was brought forward in 1970 and it is clear that is the timeframe in which this conflict arose because this practice lacked the necessary legislative support. It is unfortunate that minor legislation did not put this practice on a proper legislative footing because we would not have the problem we are facing now. The records show the position was known by the Department to be flawed.</P>
      <P>A number of key dates have been highlighted on which this problem came to attention. The first of those is 1976 in the patient service regulations when Mr. Corish was Minister. We then move on to April 1994, when Deputy Howlin was Minister for Health. The Government health strategy at that time, Shaping a Healthier Future, stated clearly that those in public care were still governed by legislation which is now recognised as inadequate. It is unfortunate, in respect of all those key dates, that the opportunity that was presented to correct this problem was not taken. The 1978 Eastern Health Board legal opinion drawn up by Mr. Ronan Keane, senior counsel, again highlighted the problem. Those who play politics with this issue should examine these key dates and the people who were in office at that time and agree that successive Governments, Ministers for Health and their administrations had opportunities to correct this problem but failed to do so.</P>
      <P>With regard to the current Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, it is fair to say that more has happened on this issue in the past 30 days than happened in the preceding 30 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>As a result of the Supreme Court decision.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1345"/>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>When this matter was brought to her attention, the T&aacute;naiste quickly sought legal advice as a result of questions from Senator Browne&rsquo;s party in the D&aacute;il. She rang the Attorney General and since then the process has moved forward at an accelerated pace if one measures it against the preceding 30 years. She stopped the practice immediately when she was told it did not have legal support. She brought forward legislation and admitted, and repeated it in the House this morning, that the legislation she brought forward on the retrospective payments was based on incomplete and inaccurate information. Reading the report one would think that, like the third secret of Fatima, there was some sort of mystery surrounding this that was shared among a few people but not everyone.</P>
      <P>The other key point is that the T&aacute;naiste commissioned the Travers report. It is clear she was not briefed on the seriousness of this issue when she took over the portfolio.</P>
      <P>With regard to the famous letter we are talking about, which the T&aacute;naiste has indicated she will bring that into the public domain and publish later today, I would be interested to know for whose signature that letter was prepared. If it moved from the Secretary General&rsquo;s office to the ministerial office, was there a memorandum or a cover note to the Minister? These are interesting points because if a letter came to me for signature and I wanted to move it up the line to the Minister, I would do so without putting a memorandum or a covering note on it. These are interesting points and I look forward to seeing that letter later in the day.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>In the judgment at section 5.37 of the report, Mr. Travers has clearly outlined the flaws at administrative level and questioned issues at political level. Senator O&rsquo;Toole clearly set the record straight earlier and gave a good analysis and synopsis of the report in his contribution to the House. The report clearly states that the greater culpability lay at administrative rather than political level. We must be clear about that when we want to play politics with these issues. The report states:</P>
      <P LI="1">At <i>political</i> level . . . There is, however, no evidence on the files which I have seen in carrying out this examination that any Minister . . . was fully briefed to the required extent on the relevant issues surrounding the problems associated with the long stay care charges. I have pressed, without success, the Department of Health and Children for documentation on any such briefing . . . . The shortcomings of Ministers in this area, however, are at a significantly lesser scale, substance and order of magnitude to that of the system of administration.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Those are key issues.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that we are in a situation where some 315,000 people have been identified who will be the subject of some form of reimbursement. Also, the approximately 20,000 people who are still alive, going back to 1976, will <Col N="1346"/>have to be reimbursed. Whether the Statute of Limitations will be applied in the cases of those who are deceased is a matter for the Government to decide. These are the decisions facing the State and the taxpayers because it is not as if the Government has a chest of funds under the table to meet this bill, which the taxpayer must foot. If that bill reaches the highest figure that has been quoted, namely, approximately &euro;2 billion, that will have major implications for the services provided in this State.</P>
      <?oasys [cl11.2]?>
      <P>There are two issues on which I wish to comment. I took issue with the inaccuracies uttered earlier by Senator Browne, who is now in the Chair. I did so because in my opinion he was mischievously and vexatiously interpreting material from the report for political reasons. The Senator was wrong to do so. He clearly stated that the file and folder had been placed on the desk of the Minister but the report does not state that this was the case. Senator O&rsquo;Rourke has clarified the position in that regard. A mistake or a misunderstanding is fine but I interjected because Senator Browne was quoting inaccurately from the report. That was wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>The material was placed in the Minister&rsquo;s outer office, where the special adviser was located. It is only a minor point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>There were two offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that Senator Browne is in the Chair but I am merely pointing out that I interjected earlier because he referred to the Minister&rsquo;s desk. In itself, this implies that the file was there for the Minister&rsquo;s perusal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should not be trying to draw me into a dispute while I am in the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no evidence in the report to indicate that the file was there for this purpose. When the T&aacute;naiste publishes the relevant correspondence later today, I hope clarity will be brought to that matter &mdash; particularly if there is a covering note or memo to the Minister which suggests that the file was passed to him for his attention.</P>
      <P>If we are going to debate this issue, we must read the report accurately. People must not interpret from the report what they want to interpret. Such interpretations may be made for political advantage or gain.</P>
      <P>Senator Browne also stated that Mr. Travers&rsquo;s report was biased and unfair in the sense that it is stacked against the public service and soft on politicians. Mr. Travers clearly indicates in the report the inadequacies at political level and those at administrative level. He should be complimented on that. Aspersions should not be cast on the record of Mr. Travers who has been a public servant for many years and who has done the State a great service in producing this report.</P><Col N="1347"/>
      <P>Comments were also made about the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Harney, and her knowledge of this matter. It is a compliment to her that she was able to come to terms with this issue and the complexities attached thereto. As the line Minister, she would have initially investigated the matter. As a result of that investigation, she clearly thought it necessary that Mr. Travers should carry out an independent investigation. Of course the T&aacute;naiste is versed in and holds a view on the issues and took responsibility for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is missing the point made by Senator Browne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Suggestions that the T&aacute;naiste in some way influenced the report are politically motivated and unfair and they cast aspersions on the reputation of Mr. Travers.</P>
      <P>If we are going to play politics with this issue, we must be honest and accurate in our interpretations of the report. One can quote from various different sections of the report. In reality, however, all the issues raised, conclusions reached and recommendations made in it must be taken in context. We cannot be selective or engage in cherrypicking.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that Mr. Kelly is taking the brunt of the blame for this matter at present. We must be conscious of his long public service and also admissions in his report, be they in respect of errors of judgment or omission on his part.</P>
      <P>Lessons have been learned and I hope the recommendations outlined in the report will be embraced by the Government and implemented as soon as possible. We must ensure that a scenario will not be created whereby taxpayers will be exposed to a huge bill by people who do not deserve to make claims. Those who make genuine claims should be acknowledged. I regret the fact that certain members of the legal profession and politicians are choosing to become ambulance chasers on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of two politicians who have been described as ambulance chasers and who have advertised for elderly people who may want assistance or advice on this issue to contact them. I do not blame them for this because if people try to contact the helpline in Tullamore, they will be waiting a long time for the information they require. These individuals might be better off taking the short-cut and contacting politicians.</P>
      <P>People tend to nit-pick in respect of quoting the Travers report. A statement on page 54 of the report from the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, indicates:</P>
      <P LI="1">However, this is very different from discussing the specific point that a charge was being illegally levied since 1976 and that action was required to regularise the situation. The <Col N="1348"/>fact is that this was not drawn to my attention either formally or informally at any time.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I saw an interview with the Minister on Sky News Ireland last night and he stated that he was not aware of the issue and that it was never drawn to his attention. This is a senior Minister who was appointed to his post in January 2000 and who has a great deal of experience. He has, in many instances, been hailed by the media as a potential future Taoiseach. In my view, as a seasoned Minister he would have been aware of what was happening around him.</P>
      <P>In January 2001, 2003 and 2004, the Ombudsman specifically referred to this issue. Every Member of the Houses would have received copies of the Ombudsman&rsquo;s reports. It is interesting that in January 2001 the <i>Sunday Independent</i> carried a headline to the effect that thousands of medical card patients had been charged for public health care. The article to which this headline refers says that State-designed systems saved the health service &euro;1 billion. This article appeared a full year after the Minister&rsquo;s appointment. However, the Minister has indicated that he was never told, either formally or informally, about the matter. Ministers have the support of many spin doctors. If I was a Minister and I had not read about matters in the newspapers which related to my brief, I would fire all of my spin doctors on the basis that they had not done their jobs.</P>
      <P>I refute claims that the Minister did not know what was happening, particularly in terms of the legal interpretation that these charges were invalid. In 2001, Deputy Martin introduced medical cards for those over 70 years of age. The Supreme Court&rsquo;s assessment indicates that, if anything, this legally underpinned the situation in terms of the charges being invalid. What research did the Department of Health and Children or the then Minister carry out in respect of introducing medical cards for everyone over 70? It was known that an election would be held in 2002 and account of this may have been taken in respect of many of the decisions made at that time. We are aware that the research carried out was limited and that the number of people involved could not be quantified.</P>
      <P>All Members deal with the Department of Social and Family Affairs, which I regard as an efficient organisation. If the Department of Health and Children had wanted to obtain a tabular assessment in respect of the number of pensioners in the country and the number of these who were over 70, the Department of Social and Family Affairs, particularly in light of the type of computer records it possesses, could have supplied it. However, the scheme for granting medical cards to those over 70 was introduced even though it was not possible to quantify the numbers involved.</P>
      <P>In my opinion and in light of the newspaper headline to which I refer, many of the decisions <Col N="1349"/>made in 2001 took account of the fact that a general election was to take place in 2002. Those in authority would, therefore, have been afraid to even look at what was happening with regard to subventions on the basis that people would have to be recompensed and that this would have reduced the size of the war chest available to fight the election.</P>
      <P>It has been stated that the then Minister was not available for the meeting in December 2003. There is a conflict of opinion between him and Mr. Kelly in that regard. Mr. Kelly states that he informed the Minister about the matter under discussion on two occasions. We cannot assess who is telling the truth and who is not doing so. It is clear, however, that someone is not telling the truth. Mr. Kelly will probably not speak out on this issue on the basis that he has got a new job, with a salary of &euro;168,000 per year, as chairman of the Higher Education Authority. The current chairman is due to retire and the position was due to be offered on a part-time basis for the future. However, the Government had to find a niche for Mr. Kelly because if the new appointment had not been made, he might be in a position to say much more about this issue. I am tired of Government spin doctors trying to tarnish everyone by telling the public that this all goes back to 1976. It is only in the past few years that this has come before the public in a significant way. When the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, appeared on television to say that he knew nothing about the situation, he was not being factually correct.</P>
      <P>What are the special advisers to the Ministers of State doing? It is obvious that they are supposed to be a conduit between the Department and the Ministers. To what degree were they effective regarding this issue? I believe that they were completely ineffective or if they were effective, then they were being ignored.</P>
      <P>Mr. Travers refers to special advisers and where they fit in between the Department and Ministers. The Minister has serious questions to answer. Once he goes down the road of denial, he has to keep it up, which he has done throughout. He must be blind if he does not read the newspapers and recognise the situation in which he finds himself. If I was a Minister and I read these reports, I would ask serious questions of my Department as to how factually correct are such reports and if anything could be done about it. However, this occurred in 2001. The Government could not take serious action in 2001. After all, free medical cards were to be given to those over 70, which would look good in 2002 when it was seeking re-election.</P>
      <P>Where were the Ministers of State? They attended the meeting. Deputy Callely wrote to me on a regular basis regarding the elderly and what he was doing for them. These were unsolicited letters. He said at that meeting that he spoke to the Taoiseach and to the Minister. He may have been acting the big man but to whom did he <Col N="1350"/>speak? He had a cursory discussion in the D&aacute;il with the Taoiseach and that was it. If I was a Minister in that Department and my Minister of State did not tell me what was happening in my absence, I would have him replaced. There are serious questions to be asked of the Minister. Whatever spin is put on it, the reality is that the buck stops with the Minister. The Public Service Management Act 1997 states that the Minister is responsible for the functions assigned to his or her Department. The senior civil servant in the Department has been made a scapegoat in this affair.</P>
      <P>When Fine Gael was in power for a few years, it was subject to savage attacks on a regular basis by the Opposition regarding accountability and stewardship. Senator Browne is correct on that issue.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and his officials to the House. I congratulate Mr. Travers on producing such a comprehensive and speedy report. He was appointed on 16 December and worked throughout Christmas and the new year so the report could be put on the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s desk. In summary, the Travers report states that the fundamental reason for the problems we now face lies in long-term systemic corporate failure. The phrase &ldquo;long-term&rdquo; covers a 30-year period in which the problem was not properly dealt with. The report states that the Department of Health and Children was well aware of legal concerns surrounding the practice of charging when it was introduced in 1976. These concerns persisted and continued to be articulated anew right up to the present. On that basis, it is absolutely wrong to make a political scapegoat out of any individual Minister or to hold any Minister responsible for erroneous activity over three decades.</P>
      <P>In this 29-year period, there were 16 Ministers, seven of whom were not from Fianna F&aacute;il or the Progressive Democrats. They were all senior Ministers and they served for 11 years of the 29. Senators O&rsquo;Toole and O&rsquo;Rourke rightly pointed out that it is wrong to scapegoat any politician in this case, particularly a Minister. Page 39 of the report states that the problems did not derive from the 2001 Act. They had their origins in the decisions taken many years previously. I will make that point to Senator Finucane.</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>This problem should have been dealt with many years ago. It is unfortunate that the present generation will have to foot the bill.</P>
      <P>I would like to associate myself with the statement made by the T&aacute;naiste yesterday and this morning in the House. She recognised the excellent professional work and achievements, as well as the public service commitment, of the Department of Health and Children. Hindsight is an easy option. This problem should have been dealt with properly by us all. Shame on us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>Shame on all those people and politicians of all hues who have ignored the problem.</P>
      <P>Page 91 of the report refers to the political shortcomings but they are less than those of the system of public administration. That is what Mr. Travers thinks and we either accept his report, warts and all, or we do not. The important thing is to move on and ensure there is no delay in repaying those overcharged. I have no doubt that it will be done. It is unjust to blame any individual for a badly-administered system which has lasted more than 30 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>Carrying out my work as a Senator, I got to know the Secretary General of the Department of Health and Children. I always found him very supportive of me and other councillors in providing information on the Department. I believe that the Secretary General, Mr. Michael Kelly, is carrying the can for this report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Mentioning names is not a good idea. The Senator might have a good opinion of the individual but others may not and that is the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>This Secretary General is carrying the can. He is the sixth Secretary General to take this job in the past 30 years. He is an outstanding public servant and I support what Senator Quinn said yesterday about the collective error.</P>
      <P>I would also like to support the Minister for Education and Children&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I might have erred in telling the Senator not to mention that particular name, because it was mentioned this morning. I apologise for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>That is fine. The Minister for Education and Children spoke about how she had the honour of being appointed by Charles Haughey to the Higher Education Authority for a number of years when he was Taoiseach. She also stated that Michael Kelly&rsquo;s breadth of expertise and his proven track record in the area of structural reform will allow the Higher Education Authority to give leadership and direction to the wider reform agenda in the higher education sector. I have a business relationship with Mr. Kelly, but <Col N="1352"/>I do not know him on a personal level. Senator Finucane has just left the Chamber.</P>

	<P>No. I will wait until the Minister of State has finished. I would like to speak and refer to a Senator who was previously here in the Chamber. I want the Minister of State to hear what I am saying. I want to put on record the fact that, in future, the relationship between Ministers and senior civil servants will be different. As is currently happening in the United Kingdom, the role and number of special ministerial advisers should be examined.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not say anything of consequence to the Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. The report has been exceptionally well prepared and we owe Mr. John Travers a debt of gratitude. He has put the whole issue together clearly. I have read the report in detail and it is a pointless exercise to go back over every detail in it because people can read it for themselves. This issue goes back a long time and all the former Ministers and Secretaries General are named in this regard. Mr. Kelly is only one of the Secretaries General who had responsibility in this area. In the circumstances, I believe he is being very honourable in taking up the new appointment. I do not think he wanted to engage in further debate on this issue.</P>
      <P>The matter is now being dealt with positively by the Government. As the T&aacute;naiste said, there are 315,000 possible beneficiaries, 20,000 of whom are still alive. We should move forward, in accordance with the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision, to provide funding for those individuals to which they are entitled and of which they were illegally deprived by the State. The factual position is contained in the Travers report and we should now move on. The blame game is finished and Members of the Oireachtas cannot benefit from <Col N="1353"/>going into the circumstances surrounding this affair.</P>
      <P>From 1987 to 1989, I served in the Department of Health and I want to make it clear that I was not delegated any responsibility for anything in this area. The record shows that the Government makes decisions concerning the delegation of specific responsibilities. However, the current responsibilities did not exist in the 1987-89 period when I served in that Department. I want to make that clear because people may try to be mischievous in that regard.</P>
      <P>Particular areas of responsibility can be delegated to a Minister or Minister of State by order of the Cabinet. However, no Secretary General or other departmental official will report to a Minister of State concerning an area for which the Minister of State is not responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should conclude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Do I not have eight minutes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>No, four. The Minister of State has to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I told the Senator he had four minutes at the outset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>That is fair enough. There is a case to be made on recompensing people. The Minister of State is an eminent senior counsel. The issue of a statute bar must be examined to see how far we can go back in order to recompense those involved. I take exception to the exploitation of this issue by particular politicians who are doing so for their own political benefit, not for the benefit of the individuals concerned. Like other Members of the House, I am dealing directly with members of the public in this matter and I have assisted people in preparing forms and submitting them to the relevant Department.</P>
      <P>A sum of &euro;15.5 million has been sent back to approximately 8,000 medical card holders in long-stay hospitals. I have been in touch with some of those people but nobody has confirmed that they have received the &euro;2,000 payment. Perhaps the money has been paid into their accounts and, if so, I appreciate that.</P>
      <P>I require clarification on a few issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should conclude because the Minister of State must reply to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I urge the law firms to lay off in this regard. They should be legal eagles, not legal vultures as far as the elderly are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their contributions. One of the most important conclusions drawn in this report is that there was nothing <Col N="1354"/>wrong with the State&rsquo;s practice of making deductions from persons in long-stay, free residential care. There is a recognition running through the report that it was a proper and appropriate practice.</P>
      <P>In his report Mr. Travers recognises the enormous financial constraints that operate in the Department of Health and Children. As a result of discussions in this House, every Senator is also aware of those constraints. Whether by way of Adjournment motions, statements or debates on substantive motions, Senators frequently raise issues concerning the Department&rsquo;s provision of health and social services in their areas and elsewhere. I have always found that Senators have a keen awareness of their national responsibilities, in addition to their knowledge of local conditions. In that context, this was an entirely reasonable practice for the State to engage in as regards the provision of nursing home care. After all, many people have to contribute from their own resources, and do so gladly and willingly, for the care of older persons who require residential care. No question of compensation for those persons has arisen in this entire saga.</P>
      <P>The question must be asked as to why legal doubts about a practice that has existed in the State since 1954 were not dealt with earlier within the Department of Health and Children. That is what the Travers report is all about. While much has been said, it is the function of Opposition Senators to raise questions about political issues. That is understandable and I do not take from their right to do so. Senator O&rsquo;Toole made a reasoned contribution in which he outlined the respective roles played by the leading parties involved in recent times. He laid certain facts before the House which would have to be taken into account by anyone who examines this matter dispassionately.</P>
      <P>No political blame can be attached to either the Minister or the Ministers of State. As a minor historical footnote to this matter, I was not in a position to attend the meeting in question and, of course, I am recorded as apologising for my absence. Senators may also notice in the report that Mr. Travers was critical of the fact that the papers for that meeting were not briefed to the participants at the meeting until late in the afternoon of the day preceding it. In fact, I never saw the papers of the meeting because my private secretary had not been in a position to see me before the time of the meeting. She asked me if I wished to see them and I inquired of her whether any matters pertaining to my own delegated area of responsibility were in the papers. When she advised me that there were not, I indicated that I did not wish to see the papers.</P>
      <P>Mr. Travers has captured well in his report the tremendous sense of the urgency of business in the Department. The Secretary General was a very diligent person who was unfailing in his courtesy. He was under tremendous pressure of work &mdash; the organisation of the EU Presidency <Col N="1355"/>lay ahead of him in the months following that particular meeting. That was a substantial operation which we all know brought great credit on the country. The Department of Health and Children had to play its part in the organisation of a huge number of visits to Ireland, which related to its area of responsibility.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Minister and the Government had decided to embark on a widespread programme of health reform, grounded on a number of reports which had been under public discussion. Apart from that, there is the constant sense of crisis and constraint in the Department and, as Senator O&rsquo;Rourke said, the scarcity of resources. A famous economist once said that a proper definition of economics was the science of allocating scarce resources. In a sense, in the Department of Health and Children &mdash; more than in any other branch of Government &mdash; that is what public administration is all about. We cannot do enough for the handicapped, our public hospital services or primary care. In the area of my responsibility, we cannot provide enough social services for those who are vulnerable in whatever respect, whether they are old, infirm,  young or at risk from one of the many contingencies which afflict us in life. All of these matters fall within the province of the Department of Health and Children.</P>
      <P>I thank Mr. Travers for his work. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children will examine the matter in greater detail but we must now apply ourselves to the issue outlined in chapter 6 of the report, namely, the required changes in practices and procedures which must now come into place in a radically-changed legal landscape. The Health Service Executive is not an &ldquo;unelected quango&rdquo; as Senator Ryan described it earlier, rather the body&rsquo;s chief officer is himself an Accounting Officer, which represents a radical change in the relationship between the Department and those who administer services on its behalf.</P>
      <P>Any restructuring of the Department must take place in this context and must ensure that taxpayers, under the supervision of the Health Service Executive, get maximum value for money and return for their services. We must also reconcile the designing of a service plan from year to year with the essential political requirement to intervene where difficult issues arise to ensure that a rapid response takes place on the part of the Executive. These are the issues which must inform our debate.</P>
      <P>We must also address the issue, raised by Senators during the course of the debate, of how we deal with the Supreme Court&rsquo;s advice to the President that the legal entitlements of those who were not paid are recognised. In this respect, I do not speak on behalf of the Department but I have grave reservations about the consequences of the Supreme Court&rsquo;s judgment. However, we have received the judgment and must deal with it and <Col N="1356"/>address the issues arising, notwithstanding my grave reservations. As I stated earlier, the science of economics and the administration of this Department is about the allocation of scarce resources. A significant amount of scarce resources will be pre-empted in meeting our obligations, which I accept, on foot of the decision of the Supreme Court.</P>

    <Title>Health (Amendment) Bill 2005: Committee Stage.</Title>
    <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 3, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P LI="2">&ldquo;1.&mdash;The Health Act 1970 is amended by inserting the following new section after section 44, but in Part IV&mdash;</P>
      <P LI="3">&lsquo;44A.&mdash;Within three months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a statement of strategy detailing its plans for the funding of the care of the elderly in both public and private nursing homes.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The amendment is self-explanatory. The Opposition feels that the Government&rsquo;s track record on care of the elderly is not sufficient. There have been many recent cases where private nursing homes in particular have come under scrutiny and, unfortunately, have not fared well in regard to conditions for residents.</P>
      <P>The Government&rsquo;s strategy for the elderly is purely a strategy without practical effect. Yesterday, I drew the Minister&rsquo;s attention to the issue of home help being cut to a maximum of ten hours per week, which contradicts the image the Government tries to portray of its views on the elderly. It would be useful if in the next three months the Oireachtas had an opportunity to hear the Government&rsquo;s strategy for the care of the elderly and have an input into it. How we treat the elderly reflects on society at large and, therefore, it is important the strategy is inserted in legislation. If it is not so inserted, it will never be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>Planning ahead is always a good idea and the amendment suggests this should happen. I have one concern which I am sure the Minister will address. There is a dichotomy in this situation. The Department of Health and Children is in charge of policy and this matter is a policy issue regarding the care of the elderly in public and private nursing homes. However, the accounting and auditing of the health service will be in the hands of the Health Service Executive. No matter what policy the Department may make, the Health Service Executive will have a <Col N="1357"/>significant hold over whether the policy will happen because it will be in charge of funding. The Minister might elaborate on whether I am correct in this assessment.</P>
      <P>We have had grim examples of the lack of proper accounting within the Department of Health and Children in regard to medical cards, to which I will refer later in the debate. While I recognise that much diverse work is being done within the Department, there will be great difficulty with the division of its funding. No matter what policy it puts forward, I do not know how it will progress that policy because the executive arm will be a totally different body. What the executive arm will do with excellent policy, I have no idea. Will the Minister elaborate in the context of the amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Without doubt the future financing of the long-term care of older people is a serious issue and one that will need much attention in the near future. The Mercer report on the future financing of long-term care in Ireland, commissioned by the Department of Social and Family Affairs, has been published and, following on from this, Professor Eamon O&rsquo;Shea drew up a report on the nursing home subvention scheme. From a Government perspective, we consider these two reports very important as we plan ahead and decide how we should finance long-term care. Earlier this year, the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, myself and officials from various Departments, including the Department of the Taoiseach, established a committee which will report back by the middle of this year. The T&aacute;naiste indicated in the D&aacute;il in recent days she would make recommendations on this matter later this year.</P>
      <P>There will be no easy decisions. It will be a necessary but costly exercise. In the past we did not give this area the attention it deserves. This has been acknowledged and within Government circles there is a realisation of the importance of the issue and a willingness to deal with it speedily. We will come forward with suggestions before the year is out.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry referred to the Health Service Executive taking over auditing functions. While it is a time of reform in the health services, this will not present us with any difficulty in regard to implementing Government policy. It is for the Government to decide on policy and then to ensure its implementation.</P>
      <P>Senator Browne was critical of the Government, yet in excess of &euro;287 million of additional funding was provided for health services for older people between 1997 and 2004. We have placed great importance on this sector and increased the funding for it each year. While the issue is important I do not see any merit in accepting the amendment and for that reason we will oppose it.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1358"/>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I expected that reply from the Minister of State. What is the position regarding elderly people who have been taken out of institutions and are now living in houses provided by health boards or the Health Service Executive? Will they have to pay rent? That is another issue arising on the doorsteps. If the Minister of State cannot answer now, he might do so later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Senator provides the details of the issue, I will have the matter clarified and report back to him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been let down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 2 has been ruled out of order as it involves a potential charge on the Revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 not moved.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 1 allows a great deal of discretion regarding what might happen to people because of the clause &ldquo;including the means of the spouse, if any, of that person in addition to the person&rsquo;s own means&rdquo;. If a couple had been separated for decades, would the legislation take account of that? I presume there are clauses in the legislation to ensure that huge sums of money cannot be transferred by a person requiring care to another person. However, what if the couple have been separated for years and perhaps even have a judicial separation, though they are not divorced? They may have made financial arrangements on separation. One person might have been profligate and the other might have tried his or her best to live in a normal and modest manner. The latter person might now be asked to subscribe towards the care of the former in a nursing home. That is not just.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>These are operational issues on which the health boards would have previously made decisions. I believe most Members accept that we must have some flexibility in the system if it is going to work. We are all aware of situations where in terms of income, a couple might be a little over the guidelines but there would be certain other factors we would like to see taken on board. For that reason it is important to include some flexibility.</P>
      <P>It is important that the income of a spouse be considered. If not, one could have a situation where a person has limited means but the spouse has perhaps in excess of &euro;250,000 annually, and yet the person would qualify.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1359"/>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what I said could happen but it could also happen the other way round.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>That is why we have a certain flexibility in the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>Flexibility has got us into the mess we are in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>In fairness, while there have been different interpretations around the country in terms of medical card qualification, the system has worked quite well within the health board regions. The flexibility has helped in that regard. Though Senator Henry might not agree, the fact that we have had flexibility and that the CEOs could on occasion consider special cases of particular hardship and grant medical cards has proved helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The measure in section 1 regarding the spouse&rsquo;s income could fly in the face of equality legislation. Senator Henry&rsquo;s point regarding separated couples is relevant. What drives us all mad on both sides of the House is when a Member advises someone about getting a medical card, the person is either accepted or turned down, and then a similar case arises which attracts a different decision. I realise the system must have flexibility but the Minister of State should bear in mind that taking a spouse&rsquo;s income into consideration could create problems down the line. Senator Henry&rsquo;s point is valid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>The other case mentioned by the Minister of State brings up exactly what I meant when I said that one could have a situation where all funds were transferred to the name of the other spouse so that the person would seem incredibly poor. It is also necessary to consider the other side of the coin, where one could have people who have been separated for a very long time. One such person could still be the spouse and could be asked to pay money. That person might not be very well off but his or her income will be taken into account.</P>
      <P>I repeat that flexibility has got us into the mess we are in because some health boards, realising that they were doing something illegal, as informed by their legal advisers, stopped making deductions. I admit that some of them stopped making deductions only when they were told by some of the people in nursing homes that they should not be deducting money.</P>
      <P>This could turn out to be a serious issue because the various people administering the scheme, who we can be sure will be short of money, will have flexibility which may give rise to another inequity in the scheme. I am not proposing this as a hypothetical situation but as one I see coming around the corner.</P>
      <P>It worries me greatly that frequently we see legislation being rushed through the Houses even though Members bring up problematic cases that <Col N="1360"/>could arise. What happens? A couple of weeks later, or at a very good guess, two years, such a case arises. I see the issue before us as giving rise to disgruntled people making complaints very soon. I believe such people will nevertheless be legally liable because they will still be the spouses of the people involved.</P>
      <P>When divorce legislation was introduced in this country, everyone said that we would all get divorced whether we wanted to or not. That did not happen. Substantial numbers of people have not changed from being separated to being divorced. They are the older people to whom this legislation will apply. As couples they made amicable financial agreements years ago but people will now be able to come chasing after them in their old age if they think there is a spouse who may have lived very frugally over the years and is better off than the one now in need of care. I am not putting this forward as a hypothetical case because I foresee such cases arising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>It is difficult to put in place a perfect system which will meet all circumstances but if we do not deal with the matter in the way we propose we will end up attempting to treat all applicants as individuals. That would not be to their advantage and would not be fair. The method we propose is the fairest way to proceed. Up to now, health board CEOs would have different interpretations but the HSE intends to operate standardised guidelines throughout the country. Before this, someone in a particular situation in Kildare might have qualified for a medical card while a person in similar circumstances in Galway might not have qualified. We will now have standardised guidelines countrywide. That is the best way to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Minister that it is very difficult. As the old saying goes, exceptions make bad laws. The central point is that whatever resources are available for the elderly should be devolved to that care area and utilised to the optimum effect and that those who benefit from the resources should be the right people to do so. I have worked in this area and I stand over that.</P>
      <P>There are many care models for the elderly. If they have not already been examined it would be useful if the Department of Health and Children or indeed the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, of which Senators Henry, Browne and I are members, took an in-depth look at what is available. Several models of care, not just the geriatric hospital or the welfare home can provide for the elderly. We also have community care and retirement villages available. Senator Browne made a valid point when he referred to old people who were devolved from institutions into the community and are now living in old persons&rsquo; dwellings. Undoubtedly, care in the community is a better service. When one thinks of planning for the future in the psychiatric <Col N="1361"/>services, community care is a better service, although it is far more expensive.</P>
      <P>We should pursue the best model. I support the Minister&rsquo;s views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>One hears constant complaints that we are supposed to be legislators but just come in here to act as messenger boys or girls. If I see an aspect of a law that I believe may cause injustice, I must point it out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is right to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I will consider putting down an amendment on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>We are discussing the scenario whereby one person in a couple is a high earner while the other is in a lower income bracket. It is only fair that the combined income should be taken into consideration and that the authorities shall have regard to a person&rsquo;s overall financial situation. Senator Henry has expressed some criticism of the administration of medical cards. In my experience, I have not seen any situations where the income of an estranged spouse caused difficulty for a person applying for a medical card after people had been separated for a number of years. The rules have been interpreted quite fairly in that regard. There is only so much money available and a euro can only be spent once. We provided &euro;60 million for the doctor-only card this year. It is important that we try to relieve the hardship that exists by ensuring the money is spent where it is most needed and provides the best value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not wish to prolong the point but I am only too aware that a euro can only be spent once. However, I feel that some people who in the past may have been very unjustly treated by a partner may now be unjustly treated by the State by being obliged to pay up for this person. I intend to put down an amendment on Report Stage and we will consider it then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Sections 2 to 4, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 5.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 6, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">&ldquo;(<i>d</i>) paragraph (<i>b</i>) shall stand repealed on 1 March 2010.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Fine Gael is in favour of the GP-only medical cards but only as an interim measure. On this side of the House, we propose the insertion of a time limit of 2010 because we fear the Government plans to make this a longer-term option. The only benefit conferred by the new GP-only medical <Col N="1362"/>cards is the facility of going to a GP without charge. The cardholders lose out on all the other benefits of a full medical card. Hence, a GP-only cardholder will not have free inpatient or outpatient consultation or have dental or optical work performed without charge, not to mention the cost of medicine. Moreover, a cardholder&rsquo;s children sitting the leaving or junior certificates will be liable for examination fees. Although people have described it as half a medical card, in fact it is only about an eighth of a medical card.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose behind the new card was the protection of younger children. We could not countenance the death of a child from meningitis because its parents could not afford a doctor. Under the new scheme, a parent may bring a child with a rash to a GP straight away to get a professional opinion. Fianna F&aacute;il gave a very firm commitment in the last general election to provide 200,000 extra medical cards. However, the Government has not even maintained the number of medical cards, which have actually fallen.</P>
      <P>While I accept that people tend to be wealthier now, the Government&rsquo;s policy on giving full medical cards to the over 70s, irrespective of means is daft. Individuals like Dr. Tony O&rsquo;Reilly and Dr. Michael Smurfit will receive medical cards. Hopefully, my father will reach the age of 70 in a year and a half. Although he has both a D&aacute;il pension and a teacher&rsquo;s pension, he will be entitled to a medical card, which is totally wrong. Mothers with children with ongoing medical conditions come into my constituency office having being turned down for medical cards. We are putting this amendment forward to emphasise that the GP-only medical card needs to be reviewed in 2010. It should only be a temporary measure to allow the Government to rectify the broken promise it made in the last general election to allocate full medical cards to an additional 200,000 people. Recent figures confirm it failed miserably to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment&rsquo;s intentions but the operation of the new cards should be reviewed much earlier. We need to introduce a more comprehensive measure. Many people will not qualify for the new card type and many who will qualify should be getting a full medical card in any event. If the Government had kept its promises, they would have done so.</P>
      <P>Senator Browne mentioned the issue of the over 70s receiving full medical cards. I actually agree with the idea that the over 70s should have full medical cards irrespective of income, but when set against the fact that most children do not have the same right, it seems unjust. We should at least introduce a measure whereby all children have access to free GP care. One meets people from middle income backgrounds who must think twice before bringing their children to a GP because of the associated costs. It should not be that way. Recently, I looked after a child <Col N="1363"/>who, it transpired, had measles. I was worried initially that it might be meningitis. I did not think twice about going to the local GP. If a person has a cough, he or she would think twice about going to the doctor as a visit costs &euro;40, even if he or she was on what we would consider an average income.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>The proposal to introduce doctor-only medical cards is a very welcome measure. I am glad the Labour Party is supporting Fianna F&aacute;il policy relating to people over 70. Middle income earners are pretty much liable for everything and entitled to nothing. Too often in our clinics we meet people with young families and big mortgages who are in excess of the guidelines. These people will be helped by this worthy proposal. I am pleased Fine Gael has given it some qualified support because it is worthy of support. It will be of tremendous benefit to middle-income earners for the reasons I have stated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>The Minister, without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us be fair. I never said that. I said it is unfair that children do not have medical cards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The introduction of the doctor-only cards has been received very well throughout the country. We will issue 200,000 of these cards to people who may have been reluctant to visit their doctor in the past because of the cost. We all realise the expense involved in visiting a doctor. While the new card will not cover the purchase of medication, in many cases, particularly when a parent takes a young child to the doctor, he or she often receives advice or reassurance and leaves happy without requiring any medication. At least people will have the comfort of having the card. Parents will be able to take their child to the doctor, take whatever advice is offered and if they need to be referred to somewhere else, they can do that. We are providing &euro;60 million in 2005 for these medical cards. The qualifying criteria for the cards will be 25% above the normal income guidelines for the full medical card. We are expecting 200,000 people to take up the cards. We will review the matter in the event that the final number falls short of it and increase the guidelines to help 200,000 people qualify.</P>
      <P>It would be unwise to legislate for the automatic cessation of these arrangements in five or six years as Senator Browne is proposing. We do not have a crystal ball and it is difficult for any of us to see how things will develop in the future. <Col N="1364"/>This is a very innovative initiative that deserves support and I the general public very much welcomes it. We have previously experienced a situation that Senator Glynn referred to where it was a case of &ldquo;winner takes all&rdquo;, where people got nothing if they failed to qualify. Now 200,000 people who would not qualify for the full medical card will qualify for the doctor-visit card and I am sure it will make a big difference to their lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to clarify a point. It is disingenuous of the Minister and Senator Glynn to twist what I was saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I quoted what the Senator said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>If they listen for a change, they might hear what I am saying. I do not think anyone in the House could justify giving a medical card to a multimillionaire in his 70s while a woman with four or five children, two or three of whom could be regularly sick or have a recurring condition, does not get a medical card. That was the point I was making. We now know that when the medical card was given to the over 70s, the Department of Health and Children underestimated the number of people over 70 and had carried out no research on the matter.</P>
      <P>Most people would agree that medical cards should be given to younger children in particular, especially children under the age of five or six. Any of us who know families with young children know that if one child gets sick, invariably the rest of the children get sick. It is worth pointing out that the public was promised full medical cards and are now getting only one eighth of the benefit of the medical card. The public has been completely short-changed by this Government. The Minister of State&rsquo;s reply indicates this is a more long-term plan by the Government and that it has no intention of changing it.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State give a commitment to extend the doctor-only card to include, for example, people with children who are exempt from junior and leaving certificate examination fees? Will this scheme be extended over time or is it rigidly fixed as a GP-only scheme? When people receive their cards, their initial satisfaction will fade over time and they will realise they have got a very bad deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the introduction of medical cards of any description. I think my colleagues in general practice are glad to see that those who are genuinely deserving will receive these cards. The Minister of State is correct in saying that advice and reassurance is frequently all that is needed. It is not a case of there being a pill for every ill. However, advice and reassurance take far longer to give than a prescription and I am not quite sure what time has been factored into GPs&rsquo; very busy lives to deal with these people who almost certainly are denying themselves medical treatment because of the cost. I know <Col N="1365"/>from reports from some of my colleagues in general practice that they frequently see people who have to come back for a second or third visit and are not charged for those visits. Therefore, there is a kind of &ldquo;free doctor&rdquo; system at the moment, despite the fact that many people do not have medical cards.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State might be able to fill me in on a few details about the scheme. Will the 200,000 medical cards be issued on the same day? Will the primary care sector have to deal with the situation without any forward planning? There has been very little progress in the ten primary health schemes that are running as pilot projects. I heard that permission had been given directly by the Minister, and I think she was correct in doing so, for the Ballymun health centre to go ahead. I then discovered that everything has to go out to tender. It will be at least nine months before the centre is up and running, despite the fact that the old centre frequently has to close due to problems with wiring and heating.</P>
      <P>These new medical cards will be of very little use to people in areas where there are no GPs. I am sure there could GPs in these areas if we had more Irish graduates qualifying, as was stated in the Hanly report. It would be a good idea if the Minister for Health and Children encouraged the Minister for Education and Science to double the number of people going into medicine; this could happen if the Government allows it. Perhaps then, those with the doctor-visit medical card could actually visit a doctor. There are many problems with implementing this scheme on the ground and I would be very grateful if someone would give me some answers because despite all the avenues I have gone up to date, I have not been able to get much information about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has no plans to reduce the number of standard medical cards in favour of increasing the number of doctor-visit cards. This doctor-visit initiative is intended to complement the existing medical card arrangements. The doctor-only card will provide much assistance to families who would not qualify for a full medical card. The Minister explained the scheme when it was announced on the day the Estimates were published in November 2004. We will be inviting applications as soon as the legislation is passed. It will follow on in time that the cards will come on stream. We do not expect to see them all being issued on the same day or in the same week. However, the money is being provided and we hope that up to 200,000 people will avail of the cards.</P>
      <P>On the issue of setting means guidelines for the over 70s and whether we should give medical cards to millionaires, how can we have a fair system that discriminates against a certain group of people? Child benefit does not discriminate on the basis of income and is paid on behalf of every child in the State. We have adopted the same policy for the medical cards of the over 70s.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister aware of any plans to review the GP-only cards or could negotiations be held with the Department of Education and Science on the proposal that a medical cardholder would be exempt from paying exam fees, for example? Is this policy rigidly stuck to GP-only cards or is it open to review, for instance a possible extension over time to include optical, dental or other costs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not expect the Minister to answer me immediately as the information may not be available to him, but our constituents are concerned about whether these cards will be phased in or all arrive on the same day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>To answer Senator Browne, this is a new system and will be under constant review. The Government is anxious that the uptake rate of 200,000 people uses up the &euro;60 million provided this year, as it is intended to spend every cent of that money solely on the doctor-only card. The Government is certain this new scheme will work well and it will be kept under review. This side of the House does not hold a monopoly on wisdom and will listen to any proposals that people wish to make. Such proposals could be of assistance to families, particularly those with two or more children doing exams in a single year.</P>
      <P>To address the question of phasing in, once the legislation has been passed the Government will make every attempt to try to have the cards issued as quickly as possible. However, some people may make an immediate application while others may be awaiting the results of an application for a full medical card. As such, we do not expect all the cards to be issued on the first Monday of the month in question but over a period of time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 6, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">&ldquo;(4) The Minister shall issue guidelines detailing the criteria which shall be used when an assessment of &lsquo;unduly burdensome&rsquo; under this section is being made under this section.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">We must have clarity on this issue. The term &ldquo;unduly burdensome&rdquo; is open to interpretation and it is in everyone&rsquo;s interest to issue guidelines to make lives easier if possible. This would ensure fair play, otherwise the decision could be a subjective view on whether someone has an entitle<Col N="1367"/>ment when the opposite might be the case. It is in the interests of the Department and the Health Service Executive to have clarity on this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I think the House has heard enough from me for the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The House will never have heard enough from Senator Henry. It is always nice to have the contribution of someone involved at the coalface of the issue.</P>
      <P>Senator Browne&rsquo;s amendment seeks to require the Minister to issue guidelines to specify the criteria to be used in deciding whether a person meets the test set in section 58(1)(<i>b</i>) of the Health Act 1970. Upon the passage of the Bill, that section would establish the principle that the term &ldquo;unduly burdensome&rdquo; represents a lesser degree of difficulty than the term &ldquo;undue hardship&rdquo;, which is the basic test for the standard medical card. As indicated previously, the Department has conveyed to the Health Service Executive the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s wish that it should base its initial guideline on a 25% increase of the income limits in force for the standard medical card. This guideline can be revised if the anticipated number of people does not qualify or take up the new cards.</P>
      <P>The medical card scheme has operated under the Health Act 1970 on the basis that decisions on undue hardship are taken at the individual health board level. The income guidelines governing these decisions were agreed by the CEOs of the health boards while the operational agreements of the doctor-visit medical card scheme are currently being drawn up between the HSE and the IMO. To introduce a system of ministerial guidelines would represent a fundamental alteration of the basis on which the medical card scheme operates. I am not, therefore, in a position to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 5 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I am anxious that a spouse who may not have been seen for years may be used as a measure of assessment but I will not repeat my previous comments. Section 5(3) provides that &ldquo;a choice of medical practitioner shall be offered under the general practitioner medical and surgical service made available under this section&rdquo; wherever it is considered practicable by the Health Service Executive. I hope we do not end up with something akin to the old dispensary scheme because the choice of doctor has made a great difference for medical cardholders and medical practice at primary level. While people cannot be guaranteed a choice, as there may not be even one doctor in an area or so on, we must not return to the situation of a division between <Col N="1368"/>those with the medical card and those without it. Senator Glynn and others will agree that the dispensary scheme was not a good one. I do not know which Minister for Health deserves praise for moving Ireland beyond this scheme so that general medical services could be provided by all listed general practitioners to both public and private patients but it improved general practice enormously for patients and doctors alike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Henry that the dispensary scheme system often did nothing to compliment human dignity. Both she and the Minister will agree there is a growing difficulty for people to get on a general practitioner panel in certain urban and rural areas because of a shortage of GPs. We should let the message go out to the many good young men and women who may go into the medical field that there are GP openings, such as in Mullingar. For the first time in my 26 years of political life, I have been approached on this issue to examine what can be done. The former health boards stood in the breach and appointed persons to a panel but that did not address the core issue. There is a need for additional GPs in certain locations.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P><Col N="1369"/>
      <P LI="1">In page 3, line 17, after &ldquo;spouse,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;unless they be separated for more than five years,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I will not delay the House as I already raised my concerns about this on Committee Stage. It is quite common here that people who parted after a very short time of marriage did not get a divorce because there was no divorce in this country. We must also take into account that some people do not want to get divorced for religious reasons. This has not been taken into account in this legislation as far as I can see. I suggest that one of the partners could be very unfairly treated in later life. He or she could be expected to pay up for minding someone whom they had, perhaps, not seen for 20 or 30 years. I doubt that those who framed the legislation intended this, but it could happen as a result of the way this legislation is framed. My best suggestion is to insert this amendment to say &ldquo;unless they be separated for more than five years&rdquo;. This would prevent people from trying once again to get largesse from the State.</P>
      <P>There seems to be an idea here that people are always planning ahead to get money from the State to which they are not entitled. If it is not lone parents, it must be old people who are going into nursing homes. It is rather shabby to think these groups are the sort of people who are trying to defraud the State. We can be quite sure they are some of the poorest in the State and those most in need of help. I foresee this causing trouble down the line. I do not know how many people it will affect but it is unfair. I doubt that whoever framed the legislation intended anything like this to happen.</P>
      <P>The reason we are in the Oireachtas is to examine legislation. This amendment can hardly be described as anti-Government. We are trying to ensure that some people who may not be very well off will not be put in the position of trying to maintain someone with whom they have had little to do for a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a matter that arose on Second Stage on which we sought legal opinion and which we discussed with the T&aacute;naiste. The term &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; is included in the 1970 Act. It is only right that people&rsquo;s individual circumstances are taken into consideration in making a decision. This provision only applies to the medical card.</P>
      <P>We must have regard to a person&rsquo;s overall financial situation. There is flexibility in this that has worked. I have not come across a situation where if a couple has been separated for a long period and there has been no communication, but where one partner is in a strong financial position, that has weakened the case of the other making an application for a medical card. We have examined this issue. There is no such thing as a perfect <Col N="1370"/>system, but we think this is the fairest we can have. We sought legal advice at the highest level and are quite happy to have this provision. Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Minister of State has legal advice, I hope it is right. I also hope that if it is right, it is taken. We have had a lot of trouble over legal advice that was or was not taken recently. I hate to see legislation being passed that I think will put some people in a difficult situation in the future. These people are the very ones who will not be in a position to take legal advice because it is too expensive. In the case of the nursing homes, it was those who had the wherewithal to take legal advice who eventually exposed the situation. I can see that I will not get anywhere with this amendment and am disappointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The operational guidelines will allow a wide range of individual circumstances to be taken into consideration before a decision is made. Therefore, we should not be unduly worried with what we are putting in here. It is the fairest and most equitable way to proceed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his time and consideration. I hope my fears about this do not come to pass. The doctor-only medical card could be useful because it might decrease our reliance on pharmaceuticals. This is a double-edged sword because we rely so heavily on the pharmaceutical industry for employment that we pay some of the highest prices in Europe for pharmaceutical products. This is something the Minister should examine. The cost of medicines in Ireland compared with Italy, France and so on &mdash; I have not recently bought them in the United Kingdom &mdash; should be examined because the Government negotiates the price of pharmaceuticals with the companies. I have never found Ireland to be cheaper than other countries. For example, 11% of the health service budget is expended on such products. This must be examined considering &euro;2 billion must be found somewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State and his officials for their courtesy. Unfortunately, we have a great deal of experience of Health (Amendment) Bills in the House. It is amusing that the Government tabled an early signature motion on the legislation. I hope the President signs it into law, as requested. I also hope we have learned from past mistakes as it is depressing that the people have given up on the health service because they feel nobody can sort it out. That is <Col N="1371"/>a bad reflection on all of us and does not serve politics well. It is in everyone&rsquo;s interest that we should have a good and vibrant health service.</P>
      <P>I hope the legislation will address a number of anomalies. It is regrettable that the Government is pressing ahead with the doctor-only medical cards on a long-term basis. That was not proposed in the programme for Government nor in election manifestos of the Government parties. They made a commitment to issue 200,000 extra traditional medical cards. The electorate has been short-changed and will realise that over time. It is also regrettable that our amendment was not accepted. The Government should extend the doctor-only medical card eligibility to include optical and dental benefits and examination fees because even that would be more acceptable. People can offset pharmacy charges through the drugs refund scheme but the Minister should prioritise families with young children for medical cards.</P>
      <P>I am not fully confident the Government&rsquo;s approach to supply everybody over the age of 70 years with a medical card is sound. The Government is more into gimmicks and spin than substance and it has been found wanting on recent occasions. I thank the Minister of State for his help on the legislation. I hope the issues raised will ensure the provision of a proper health service.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State and Members for their contributions to the debate, which was worthwhile.

Even with the best will in the world in both Houses, a hiatus can occur from time to time.</P>
      <P>I strongly support the repayment of moneys to those why were unjustly charged and I hope the people who garner the money are entitled to it and that those who are unworthy do not come out of the woodwork to claim money. They are the exception, not the rule but they exist and I have encountered a number of them.

    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I stated during the debate on the previous legislation it was unconstitutional and when passed, it was referred by the President to the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>It is too much to expect an elderly person to hand over 80% of his or her pension. Elderly people should retain a greater share of their pensions so that they can have a good quality of life and engage in activities we take for granted. If I attend hospital, I am charged but money is not deducted at source from my income without my consent. Elderly people should be given their pensions and then charged for the service, the same as everybody else in society. How can the elderly not be trusted to pay their bills?</P>
      <P>Senator Glynn praised the Minister and the Travers report. Her response was to point fingers and refer to vulnerable older people who were affected. However, the worst act was the attempt to abolish people&rsquo;s property rights. People had a right to compensation for the money illegally taken from them over the years and the Minister knowingly tried to prevent them for pursuing their entitlement to the compensation. That was found unconstitutional. That is the most wrongful act of all. The constant reference to maladministration is an attempt by the Minister and the Government to deflect from the wrongful act they committed prior to Christmas. The Minister knew what she was doing and there was no fudging on the issue. She knew she was taking away the right to claim compensation.</P>
      <P>Senator Glynn referred to people coming out of the woodwork. The Minister thought she was doing nothing wrong by removing people&rsquo;s right to compensation but she tried to do the same under the Personal Injuries Assessment Board legislation, which was also found unconstitutional. Senator Henry referred to the notion of people on the make. People have legal rights and we should not take them away. They have a right to compensation when money is taken illegally and when they have suffered as a result of the acts of others. The Minister&rsquo;s philosophy is to take away those rights. Everybody sits back and says it is all right. I am a qualified solicitor and people have a right to compensation, which should not be abolished.</P>
      <P>Many issues need to be examined. I read a study on nursing home subvention. More money should be invested in community care because many people need to go into nursing homes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Members for their contributions and assistance in passing the legislation. Senator Henry referred to the cost of drugs, on which a significant percentage of our budget is expended annually. That could be the subject of a good debate in the House in the future.</P>
      <P>Regarding the treatment of the elderly, a mistake was made, and we will ensure that those who are entitled to a refund are paid as quickly as pos<Col N="1373"/>sible. We are finalising a scheme that will be announced shortly. We have already invited those who think they are entitled to a refund to log their names with us, and we will be in contact with them as soon as details of the scheme are available, which will be very shortly. We must rectify a wrong that was done, and we will be quite happy to do so. We assure people that it will be done as quickly as possible. The system we hope to put in place will be as transparent as possible, and no legal assistance will be required for people entitled to a refund; it will be paid as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Senator Browne mentioned medical cards. The reason so many people are not qualifying is that incomes for thousands of families throughout the country have substantially increased as a result of how the economy has grown. That is the main reason people no longer qualify for medical cards. As Senator Henry said, the new doctor-only card is a very innovative initiative that will make a big difference everywhere. Its operation will be reviewed but it is an excellent idea worthy of support. I thank Members for their support for it today.</P>
      <P>I thank the staff from the Department for their assistance. It has obviously not been an easy time for them over the past few weeks, but I very much appreciate their assistance and support to me since I took up office last September.

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I have tabled a motion on the Adjournment regarding the situation of a constituent in County Roscommon who is the holder of a full medical card. She was referred by her general practitioner to Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe for a DEXA bone scan on 14 January 2005.</P>
      <P>The hospital was purchased by the Western Health Board with the approval of the Department of Health and Children in autumn 2001. As chairman of the board, I had the honour of signing the contract for the purchase of the hospital, which cost approximately &euro;14 million. It was an excellent decision, and it worked very well within the framework of the Western Health Board. It has given the staff of the hospital security they would not have had but for the fact that it was purchased by the Fianna F&aacute;il Administration on the basis that there would be a full public hospital.</P>
      <P>I was very surprised, to say the least, when my constituent brought me the bill from something called the consultant radiology group within the hospital for carrying out the DEXA scan on 14 January 2005. That account came to &euro;71. Any public hospital such as Portiuncula is fully funded by the State via the western region of the HSE. All the staff are employed by the State, and all the equipment has been purchased by it. All the electricity and power to run the scanner is supplied by the State. Nursing and ancillary staff are paid by it. However, we hear of the consultant radiology group.</P>
      <P>There are serious questions to be asked about this issue, and I seek an answer from the Department, although I know it currently has some other issues with which to deal. This is probably another indication of issues that will arise in future regarding the carrying out of private consultancies in a public hospital, the use of public equipment for private medicine, and the charging of a public patient, who in this case finds it very difficult to find &euro;71. It is a great deal of money to someone on a full medical card, who does not have readily available funds. She was referred by her general practitioner to the hospital, as far as I am concerned on the basis that the scan would be carried out by the State without charge. That was certainly the impression she was under and she was quite surprised to receive the account later in the month. She was also particularly upset when she received a demand yesterday threatening legal action unless the bill was paid.</P>
      <P>I do not normally table motions on the Adjournment, since it imposes a cost on the State in having to supply information. However, I felt that a policy area was involved that was of significance to the Department of Health and Children, <Col N="1375"/>in which, like the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, I served. I am very concerned at this issue. My advice to my constituent is that I do not believe she is legally or morally liable, and I hope the reply is positive in that regard and will give us some information on this practice by a group in the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising the matter and giving me the opportunity to clarify it as best I can.</P>
      <P>I would first like to outline the basis of eligibility for services. Entitlement to health services in Ireland is based primarily on residence and means. The determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive. Other than for persons aged 70 years and over, who are automatically entitled to a medical card, such cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the HSE, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that the guidelines are not statutorily binding, and even though a person&rsquo;s income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the Health Service Executive considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances would justify it. It is open to all persons to apply to the Health Service Executive for health services if they are unable to provide such services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
      <P>It should be remembered that the Health Service Executive has discretion regarding the issuing of medical cards and also that a range of income sources are excluded by the Health Service Executive when assessing medical card eligibility. Many allowances, such as carer&rsquo;s allowance, child benefit, domiciliary care allowance, family income supplement and foster care allowance are disregarded when determining a person&rsquo;s eligibility. Given those factors and the discretionary powers of the Health Service Executive, having an income that exceeds the guidelines does not mean that a person will not be eligible for a medical card, and a medical card may still be awarded if the Health Service Executive considers that a person&rsquo;s medical needs or other circumstances justify it.</P>
      <P>Regarding hospital charges, it is the case that, under arrangements for public hospital services introduced in June 1991, on foot of the Health (Amendment) Act 1991, everyone, regardless of income, is entitled to public hospital and public consultant services subject only to modest statutory charges from which those with full eligibility, that is, medical card holders, are exempt.</P>
      <P>Private patients attending public hospitals are liable for consultants&rsquo; fees, which are a matter between the patient and the consultant. In addition, the patient would be liable for accom<Col N="1376"/>modation charges as approved of or directed by the Minister under section 55 of the Health Act 1970 once he or she explicitly exercises the option to be treated as a private patient. The requirement that patients make an explicit choice between public and private health care was recommended by the 1989 Commission on Health Funding.</P>
      <P>Having made inquiries with the Health Service Executive regarding the case in question, the executive has advised that the individual concerned attended the radiology department in the hospital for a DEXA scan requested by the patient&rsquo;s GP. Furthermore, the charge in question did not emanate from the hospital itself but from the consultant radiology department. The charge was made in the form of a fee demand from the consultant radiologist. The hospital is unclear if the patient was public or private. The matter is being followed up directly with the consultant radiologist involved.</P>
      <P>As soon as the position is clarified I will revert to the Senator directly on the matter. As the Senator appears to have all the facts available to him, perhaps he is in a position to clarify the issue I raised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for a comprehensive report gathered at very short notice. This patient was a public patient. She was the holder of a medical card who went to her own general practitioner. She had no knowledge that she was being referred for a private consultation. She was quite happy to go to the UCHG or some other public hospital that would provide this particular scan. In the circumstances, I would request the Department to inform the people involved that whatever misunderstanding occurred, it was not the responsibility of my client and it is imposing undue hardship on her. It is also a warning to public patients being referred by their GPs to ensure they are informed that they are being sent for a private consultation in a public hospital. They should clarify that with their GPs. This discussion may be of assistance to other practitioners in the region.</P>
      <P>I want to record that the services provided at Portiuncula Hospital are second to none. It is a terrific hospital working as a unit with Roscommon County Hospital and it is better to have this matter clarified publicly in the Seanad. I thank the Minister of State for his reply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>With the agreement of the House, I wish to share my time with Senator Brennan. The Shannon Estuary water supply scheme covers a wide area. A few years ago, the intentions of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the council was to broaden the scheme to include the Pallaskenry and Kildimo areas. Much work took place on that and I understand approximately &euro;5 <Col N="1377"/>million has been spent in laying the upsized diameter pipes which were essential for the scheme. Those pipes have been laid as far as Kildimo because the council took the opportunity, when upgrading the N69 recently, to extend the scheme by a further 2.7 km to Kildimo.</P>
      <P>It is worth bearing in mind that some of that area is being serviced from Bleach Lough. The many people who use the water from Bleach Lough pride themselves on that water. We must recognise, however, that there has been a dramatic expansion of housing in that area. There are two prominent group water schemes &mdash; Ballyshonick and Kilcornan &mdash; and many other householders want to get connection to the Shannon Estuary water supply scheme.</P>
      <P>I spoke to a woman today who is in the Ballyshonick group water scheme and she told me she has not had a glass of water from her own tap in 23 years. The people in that scheme have poor quality water. They were recently warned by the health board not to use the water because the E.coli level was so high it was only suitable for flushing toilets. Those people have had to put up with a poor quality water supply over many years. I realise the people in Bleach Lough have that water supply but for how much longer can the people in the other group water schemes use water which would not be acceptable in Third World countries? The situation is serious.</P>
      <P>The solution to this problem is to extend the water scheme. The council, in a reply to me on 3 February last, stated that conditional approval to proceed to tender was received from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and that it was appointing consultants to make the necessary amendments to contract documents.</P>
      <P>I raise this matter today, despite pressing the council on it over a period of time, because it requires a sense of urgency from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Serious questions must be asked on this matter. When I was chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts I questioned the Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Mr. Callan, on how so much public money could be expended when large diameter pipes were left lying with stagnant water in them. Somebody described those pipes to me as a condominium for rats. They must be put into usage. They were provided with taxpayers&rsquo; money. There must be an end to the poor quality water many people in these group water schemes and those seeking connections have to endure. I hope the Minister&rsquo;s response will be favourable and that this matter is being expedited.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Finucane for sharing time with me. I support the case he has made and acknowledge the vast amount of Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government funding to Limerick County <Col N="1378"/>Council for its 2000-06 water and sewerage schemes programme.</P>
      <P>The N69 from Foynes to Limerick city could be served by the proposed scheme. As Senator Finucane said, up to &euro;5 million has been allocated by the Department for the upgrading of the Shannon Estuary supply scheme at Aughinish. That scheme is very important for the supply of water to our towns and villages, and to industry. In many towns and villages, from Kildimo and Pallaskenry to Ballybrown, Clarina and Mungret, builders are being asked to provide an alternative scheme from Limerick city towards that area. I understand the importance to the Department of having a full scheme from Foynes to Limerick and from Clareville back to the west and south of the county. I congratulate the Department on making funds available but it is important that these schemes come to fruition and that services are brought to the people in the group water schemes Senator Finucane mentioned those who have an unsafe supply in many instances.</P>
      <P>We also recognise the problem in Kildimo-Pallaskenry where people have a choice of supply but for the greater good the supply coming along the Shannon Estuary to Clarina and Mungret should proceed in the interests of the investment made to date in meeting the development needs of our towns and villages. That is important for the future of schools and facilities in our parishes.</P>

	<P>On behalf of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, I thank the two Senators for raising this issue. Unfortunately, the Minister is unable to be in the House this evening.</P>
      <P>The provision of modem environmental services to support social and economic objectives has been a major focus of Government spending over the past number of years. There has been unprecedented investment under the national development plan in new water and sewerage infrastructure throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The Pallaskenry-Kildimo water supply scheme, which involves an extension of the Shannon Estuary water supply scheme to serve these areas, is one of more than 800 projects being funded under the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government&rsquo;s water services investment programme 2004-06. The Pallaskenry-Kildimo scheme has been approved for construction under the investment programme and I understand that an advance section has already been completed in conjunction with road works on the N69 roadway. I also understand that ministerial approval was given to Limerick County Council&rsquo;s contract documents for the remainder of the scheme last November. This approval authorised the council to invite tenders for the construction of the remainder of the works and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is now awaiting a recommendation from the council for the appointment of the contractor <Col N="1379"/>with the best tender. When that recommendation comes into the Department it will be quickly examined and, following approval, the council will then be in a position to place the contract. Funding of &euro;1.4 million has been set aside for the scheme in the water services investment programme 2004-06 and the Minister is keen for it to get to construction as soon as possible. In the meantime, however, the initiative rests with the local authority. I have no doubt the two Members who raised the matter will be in a position to exert some pressure in that quarter.</P>

      <P>As the Senators are aware, the current water supply source for the bulk of the area to be served by the new scheme is Bleach Lough. There have been local objections to the replacement of Bleach Lough by the Shannon Estuary scheme extension which will instead use water from the River Deel. To ensure that any objections were properly taken into account, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government sought clarification from Limerick County Council. Following a public consultation process, the council reported back to the Department in November 2002. It stated:</P><Col N="1380"/>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0">. . . 8.6% of the people who attended the public consultation and completed the questionnaires were against changing their water supply source, 34.6% had general or no comments and almost 57% required the new water supply source. In total, over 91% of people either had no comment or were in favour of being provided with a new water source because of difficulties experienced with the reliability of water quality, pressure, etc. of their existing supply. In light of the outcome of the consultation process, the pressing need for additional water capacity to facilitate development in the area and the position of a number of group water schemes that were suffering from serious water quality problems and requiring a new source, it was resolved that the extension of the Shannon Estuary scheme to Pallaskenry and Kildimo should go ahead as planned. As already indicated, the council&rsquo;s tender recommendation for the extension is now awaited by the Department for approval.</P>
      <P FLI="0" el="5">I listened carefully to what the Senators said and I will bring their comments to the attention of the Minister as soon as possible.</P>
