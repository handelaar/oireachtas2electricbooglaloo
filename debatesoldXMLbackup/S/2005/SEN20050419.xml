	<P>I have received notice from Senator Kitt that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to outline the position regarding the sewerage system for Glenamaddy, County Galway.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Bradford of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Finance to outline the status of the promised decentralisation programme for Mallow and Mitchelstown, County Cork.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator O&rsquo;Toole of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to sanction the employment on a permanent basis, as opposed to on a part-time basis, of specialist subject teachers for subjects such as art, woodwork and home economics, to cater for the majority of students in the Catherine McAuley school and other special needs schools on an ex-quota basis.</P><Col N="2"/>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Bannon of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to explain the prohibition on a Nigerian woman (details supplied), a qualified nurse, from engaging in full-time paid employment.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Browne of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to investigate the outbreak of cryptosporidium in Carlow town and surrounding areas.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Wilson of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Transport to make a statement on the need to develop the east-west route as identified in the national spatial strategy.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by Senators Kitt, Bradford, O&rsquo;Toole and Bannon as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matters raised by Senators Kitt, Bradford and O&rsquo;Toole and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Bannon may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise. I <Col N="3"/>regret I must rule out of order the matters raised by Senators Wilson and Browne as the Ministers have no official responsibility in the matters.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill 2002 &mdash; Report Stage, to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business until 6 p.m.</P>
      <P>Senators are not supposed to congratulate a certain organisation but I congratulate Senator Ross for receiving a signal honour from <i>Magill </i>magazine. When I telephoned to congratulate him he was not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>He was out celebrating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, congratulate Senator Ross on receiving an award. As the father of the House, he is leading by example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>He is not the father of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise, I understood he had accumulated longer service than all other Senators together. Will the Leader arrange for a resumed debate on No. 14, statements on the provision of national sporting facilities? It would be proper for the House to reflect on the important decision taken by the GAA over the weekend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The House may not discuss the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators may refer to matters on the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>The lid has been lifted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The House is almost as secretive as the papal conclave. Does the Leader agree that the decision taken by the GAA over the weekend was not only historic&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>While Senators may refer to the Order Paper, they may not debate the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not seek a debate but there is a context to this issue. The important decision taken over the weekend allows the House to debate No. 14 in a more complete way. In west Dublin, my part of the city and a place not recognised by northsiders and southsiders alike, the GAA is the only organisation to have delivered quality youth facilities and services from the ground up, parish by parish. Senators, whether from rural or urban areas, should recognise the importance of the recent decision. I ask the Leader to make time available for a debate, particularly given the rather sulky remarks made by the Taoiseach in the past 24 hours, in which he appears to have poured cold water on Lansdowne Road as a potential venue. They were unsporting.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="4"/>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should not refer to comments made by the Taoiseach in such terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask for the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to come before the House to inform Senators on developments on this issue.</P>
      <P>Last week, I raised with the Leader the issue of cash in transit vans and the initiative taken by the Minister for Defence. A report in one of today&rsquo;s newspaper indicates that up to 40% of the security cost of transporting large sums of money is borne by the State through the Department of Defence. I note the Minister for Defence wishes to make progress in this area and wants the banks to pay their fair share. Will he come to the House to outline what agreement, if any, he has struck with the banking industry on the issue? The banks have made profits of &euro;3 billion in the past 12 months, yet the State must pay almost 60% of security costs arising from the movement of money. This is ridiculous in this day and age and I ask for a Government response.</P>
      <P>On behalf of my colleagues, I welcome the fact that the Leader of the House is to stand in the Westmeath constituency at the next general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>This is not appropriate to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Let me put it this way. I seek a debate on accident and emergency wards because it will be needed in County Westmeath by the time the election is over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is completely irrelevant and out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should look after himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Despite the convention, it would be churlish of us on this side of the House not to recognise the decision of the Leader of the House to set about regaining her D&aacute;il seat and we wish her well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The Cathaoirleach will be aware that today we are in the presence of greatness on these benches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>We have had this greatness thrust on us, but we have always been aware of it. We wish to put on the record of the House our congratulations to Senator Ross on achieving the distinct and signal honour of being chosen as Senator of the year. We are not surprised, although of course we are all disappointed ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>We did not try hard enough.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="5"/>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>We wish him well as someone who has declared war on many establishment groups including&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Including ICTU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>And toll roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Including ICTU, IBEC, the banks and, in recent times, National Toll Roads. On that point, we have noted his move to the left in seeking to have the last remaining private road in the country nationalised &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>We see that he is inclusive of all different groups. We congratulate him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>We know that he will serve with dignity and distinction as both father of the House and as Senator of the year. The man is running out of titles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Lord Ross.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Approximately two months ago, I raised the report on the western rail corridor with the Leader and she gave an undertaking that we would have a debate in the House on it. Despite the urgings of Senator Ross and others for the State to spend &euro;400 million on buying out a few hundred metres of roadway on the M50, we should look at investing properly in the western rail corridor. I ask that the report be published as soon as possible and that the Government gives a commitment to investing in it sufficiently to make it worthwhile. The publication and launch of the report should also take place in Ennis or some other place along the western rail corridor area. We should give some attention to this issue and move it forward.</P>
      <P>The issue raised by Senator Brian Hayes about the cost of cash transference is a significant problem. It is exacerbated by the amount of cash business that is still conducted. A number of other countries, particularly New Zealand, which is the same size as Ireland, have enormous money transfers at point of sale. Even children get their pocket money into an account which can be used to buy a bottle of Coke or something larger, with no additional cost. It means that bulk movements of money from one part of the country to the other do not take place.</P>
      <P>This matter is not only concerned with security, although I agree with the points raised by Senator Brian Hayes in that regard. It is also concerned with the way we organise money. We should look carefully at the idea of greater usage of cards which do not create further millionaires in the banking community, but which are simply mechanisms for point of sale transference of price and payment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of my Labour Party colleagues, I add to the congratulations to Senator Ross. The award is well-deserved.</P>
      <P>New research to be published today by the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Brian Lenihan, concerns a local study that was carried out by the Tallaght west childhood development initiative. The research has relevance and broader application to communities throughout Ireland. Basically, it involved a study of the concerns of 140 fifth class children and what they thought should be done to address them. The big issue for them was anti-social behaviour. The research has shown that children even at that young age are concerned and disturbed by anti-social behaviour. The research demonstrates the wisdom that can come from the mouths of children and the importance of making them central to policy making and consulting with them about issues such as anti-social behaviour. The measures these children feel are necessary to address anti-social behaviour are common sense approaches and do not involve anything like anti-social behaviour orders. Rather, they involve investing in communities, providing facilities, including play facilities, making neighbourhoods safe and providing resources to schools. It would be very interesting if the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, could discuss this research in the House in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to address the transport of large amounts of money around the State and the onus this places on the Garda and the Army. We all agree the bulk of the cost should be borne by financial institutions themselves. It would be desirable for Ireland to move towards becoming a cash-free society but we must accept that cash is at the heart of retail. As Senator Mansergh said to me a moment ago, people get very impatient when they are forced to queue at checkouts when cards are being taken. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform indicated in the D&aacute;il on 12 April 2005 that he had secured the agreement of the banks to increase their contribution towards the cost of transporting money to &euro;3 million per annum, following consultations with the Department. This represents a very significant and welcome increase as the banks had paid &euro;952,000 in previous years. The Minister has also indicated to the security industry that it has 120 days in which to reach a voluntary code of practice otherwise a legislative framework will be introduced. It is worth noting these developments since the very serious robbery which took place some weeks ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>Many of us over the weekend were touched by the very poignant circumstances in which a three year old child with an Irish passport wound up in an Indonesian orphanage. I would like the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to examine this case and, if possible, to <Col N="7"/>at least send a social worker to Indonesia to find out what is happening. We should remember that many children have been adopted in Ireland and the abandonment of this child in a country whose language he does not speak casts a certain cloud over the area of adoption. Nobody could be anything other than touched by the photographs of this child in the newspapers. We should demonstrate our compassion as a nation by investigating and attempting to resolve his situation. There must be loving parents out there who would welcome the opportunity to adopt this child. I am aware it is a delicate situation but I hope it can be investigated and resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Garda on arresting three suspects for one of these security van heists. The reason the State paid for some of the cost of transporting money around the country was because there was a definite public interest in preventing what at one time was an absolute spate of robberies during the Troubles. Times have changed, the Troubles are over and bank profits have rocketed. As Senator Dardis mentioned, I would not be quite so enthusiastic about the ubiquitous use of credit cards. If one is waiting in a queue behind people using cards, the queue takes twice as long to clear. Cards clearly have a value for larger transactions. Senator Dardis mentioned discussions involving the Private Security Authority. We welcome this as the first decentralised office is in Tipperary town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I join in congratulating my colleague, Senator Ross. I was unsure about going to the dinner this evening but I now think I must go to enjoy his success.</P>
      <P>I support the comments of colleagues on the issue of Tristan Dowse. This is a regrettable situation as it is terrible to think an Irish citizen child should be tied up in legal red tape. There are anomalies the House should address. Will the Leader ask the Minister to examine these anomalies? For example, the Adoption Board does not analyse the actual material of the foreign adoption but the equivalent and does not examine the circumstances or the legal details.</P>
      <P>Another anomalous situation is that foreign and inter-country adoptions can be neutralised or reneged upon whereas Irish adoptions cannot. Ireland signed the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-Country Adoption in 1993 but the Government has failed to ratify it, leading to some of these anomalies. We are entitled to know when this important international instrument will be ratified. It places at the centre of the issue the best interests of the child and not the human feelings of infertile parents with a desire for children, which should be paramount in all matters of adoption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Garda on today&rsquo;s seizure of a quantity of drugs, cash and guns in <Col N="8"/>the north of Dublin city. It is one of a number of recent seizures but its significance is that it highlights the link with organised crime and the blurring of the line between so-called paramilitarism and drug dealing, or death dealing as it is called around town. Will the Leader organise a debate on the matter, particularly on the links between drugs and organised crime?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not mention any sporting bodies but will acknowledge the input of my neighbour, Mr. Se&aacute;n Kelly, in an historic decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I would prefer if the Senator did not mention any sporting bodies&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;or individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am naming no one. As we are all in a certain frame of mind, I congratulate our colleague Senator Ross. He has been a challenging Senator and unafraid to take on any issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>Challenged or challenging?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Both. He was challenged but challenged in return. We must admire him for this. He did not draw back and was not afraid to say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Through the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>I wish the Leader well in her quest.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Senator please abridge his comments to those on the Order of Business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>A collective one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is quite a cauldron and I wish her well. There has been news in regard to the Great Southern Hotels group.</P>

	<P>There has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, went on the record in County Kerry but will the Leader arrange for him to go on the record in this House? As reported on the front page of <i>The Kingdom</i> of 19 April 2005, he stated the hotels are not for sale and that this is not on the Government&rsquo;s agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Was that last week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>When will the Government get off the fence? Is this statement definitive? Only the Minister is backing this approach. I would appreciate it if the Leader could arrange for such a debate.</P><Col N="9"/>
      <P>The Leader and I had an understanding recently&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should tell us more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;on opinion polls. We share a certain view&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>Of the Lakes of Killarney.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;as the Leader explained that the <i>Longford Leader</i> carried her view. A proper count is important. I am seeking that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government ensures there is a proper count of the native red deer herd in Killarney in south County Kerry. There is continuing talk of a cull but the last thing we in that part of the country wish to see is an indiscriminate, wild west-type slaughter of red deer. I call for a proper count and the Leader might arrange it for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>It must be true, so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is welcome to visit Dinis where there are many red deer. I know people have written to the Minister and it has been acknowledged. I call on the Minister to come to the House to discuss the issue. Perhaps I should table an Adjournment matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, that would be in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>A report on prisons was published recently by the Inspector of Prisons. I ask the Leader if we could debate it as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>As a lifelong member of the GAA, I welcome the progressive decision taken by congress last week. It is important for the future of sport in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator will have an opportunity to debate that under No. 14 on the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader invite the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the House to debate the Government&rsquo;s lack of funding for waste water treatment facilities throughout the country? The European Commission is taking Ireland to the European Court of Justice on this issue. It is a significant embarrassment for the Government.</P>
      <P>The Leader, who will contest the next general election in the Longford-Westmeath constituency, knows that sewerage schemes in the constituency have been waiting for approval for the past four years. It proves this Government has promised much but delivered little. The health and safety of the people are at risk due to the Government&rsquo;s handling of sewage treatment plants. There are serious problems in many towns and villages. We must have proper standards to protect people&rsquo;s health. I hope this will be achieved. The latest move by the European Com<Col N="10"/>mission is a clear indication to the Government that it is not doing its job in this area. My colleagues have congratulated the Leader on her announcement this week but if I am nominated by my party, I am prepared to meet her head on on those issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise an issue which is not an election one as yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>It was raised by Comhl&aacute;mh last week when it had what it called a &ldquo;lotto lunch&rdquo; at which some Members of the Oireachtas got very good meals while most others got slim pickings. Comhl&aacute;mh requested a debate in both Houses on the question of food aid and trade. Now that discussions have taken place at international level, I hope the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Minister of State will come to the House to discuss the issue of food aid and trade talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the fact the banks will pay the full cost of providing Army escorts for cash in transit. We should not clap ourselves on the back. This situation has been going on for ten years since the Good Friday Agreement. If an ordinary citizen does not pay his or her tax, Revenue has a claw back. Therefore, this Government should rightfully seek a claw back of up to &euro;4 million for each of the past ten years. Somebody in the Department of Defence or the Department of Finance has made a significant mistake by not ensuring the banks pay their dues.</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister for Transport to come to the House to debate infrastructure and transport. We eagerly await a debate on the western rail corridor. There has been an increase in the price of diesel and many hauliers have informed me this is the latest blow to their industry and they may go out of business. It highlights the rising costs in that industry. We must ensure hauliers are protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Bannon on the pollution problems. In Carlow town there is a problem due to cryptosporidium in the water supply, which is directly related to the point made by Senator Bannon. That is a real problem facing people who must boil water. The Government should take this issue on board given that people have been hospitalised because of it.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform come to the House to explain his policy on the proposed alcohol caf&eacute;s? Such alcohol caf&eacute;s may make sense in an urban area but they would have devastating consequences in a rural setting. Rural publicans in small villages are feeling the pinch because of the smoking ban and other issues and this would be the death knell. We must have some system of fairness. The Minister should explain whether such licences will be allocated in terms of population density and only in urban areas.</P>

In my constituency in Dungarvan town the waiting time for driving tests is 61 weeks. It is estimated these delays cost young drivers in excess of &euro;50 million in extra premiums. Given that it is an ongoing problem that has not been addressed to date, what does the Minister intend to do to rectify it?</P>

	<P>Senator Brian Hayes raised No. 14 &mdash; statements on the provision of national sporting facilities. The debate on that matter was adjourned. The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, is away this week but will be back next week when we can seek to have the debate. He raised also the topic he raised last week, that of cash transfers and associated costs.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole congratulated Senator Ross. I telephoned Senator Ross to congratulate him but he was not available. The Senator asked for a report on the western rail corridor but that report has not yet been published.

	<P>Yes, but it has not been published yet. The Senator said the launch should take place in a suitable geographic area which would have the proper connections. He said also the debate on security has opened up the whole question of how we organise our money. Senator Tuffy asked about the research on arrested childhood development and anti-social behaviour and said it involved asking children what should be done.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis said the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform asked the banks to contribute more for the transport of large amounts of money and &euro;4 million was the amount set. He gave the security industry 120 days in which to reach a voluntary code of practice, otherwise he would have to do so by law.</P>
      <P>Senator Finucane asked if the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children would look into the case of the three year old child who has ended up in an Indonesian orphanage. As I understand it, this is happening and perhaps the matter would be a suitable topic for an Adjournment debate. It is the most extraordinary case I have come across for a long time and it is right that the Deputy should raise it. The child did not bond and the reaction to that appears to have been quite heartless.</P>
      <P>Senator Mansergh congratulated the Garda on arresting some of the suspects involved in security <Col N="12"/>van robberies. He said also that the Private Security Authority had its office in Tipperary. Senator Norris raised the issue of the abandoned child and asked why the Government has not ratified the Hague Convention 1993. We have signed it but not ratified it. Senator Brady raised the issue of the haul of drugs, cash and guns confiscated by the Garda in the north side of the city and asked for a debate on drugs linked to organised crime. We will have such a debate. Senator Coghlan congratulated Senator Ross. I note that all Senator Ross&rsquo;s colleagues are present.</P>

      <P>Senator Coghlan referred to a statement by the Minister, Deputy Cullen. I stated in the House last week that the Taoiseach was very keen on the Great Southern Hotels and wished to keep the group intact and under State ownership. The Minister was obviously echoing that sentiment when he stated the hotels are not for sale. The Senator also asked that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government come to the House to discuss the culling of red deer.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry seeks a debate on the report on prisons. Senator Bannon congratulated the GAA. We are all afraid of saying the word in the presence of the Cathaoirleach &mdash; we are afraid of him. He asked that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government come to the House to discuss funding for waste water treatment. Senator Kitt referred to Comhl&aacute;mh.

This matter was also raised by Senator Bannon and I apologise for not attributing it to him.</P>
      <P>Senator Browne spoke about the proposals for caf&eacute;-style bars. That Bill was debated in this House and the Minister spoke at length about the continental style where there is less emphasis on drinking and more on conversation and food. Senator Browne asked for clarification on the issuing of licences.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 3, line 9, to delete &ldquo;INSANITY&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;MENTAL DISORDER&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan. I spoke at length on this issue on Committee Stage so I will spare the House a long explanation. I am anxious that the word &ldquo;insanity&rdquo; be removed from the Bill. During the Committee Stage debate, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, said he wanted to use the word &ldquo;insanity&rdquo; because everybody understood its meaning.</P>
      <P>There are many words the meaning of which we understand but which we nevertheless do not use because they are considered politically incorrect, to use a phrase I dislike. In a recent radio discussion on racism and immigration, the Minister was asked by the interviewer about the type of phraseology he considered unacceptable. As an example, he replied that he would not use the &ldquo;N&rdquo; word because everybody understands it is a racist slur. We all remember the fuss created when Mr. Kevin Myers used some very inappropriate language in a newspaper article about children born out of wedlock. Incidentally, I found the phrase &ldquo;cash crop whelping&rdquo; far more offensive.</P>
      <P>There are phrases it is unacceptable to use, therefore. One of the most important issues in regard to mental illness is ensuring that people seek treatment early. In this context, we would do well to avoid the stigma around the word &ldquo;insanity&rdquo;. The Minister of State has progressed a little way, but I am a bit confused as to what he proposes to do with the title of the Bill. The title of the Bill is what will be out there in public. It is important that we make the Bill look as relevant as possible to the general public. &ldquo;Mental disorder&rdquo; and &ldquo;mental illness&rdquo; are the phrases that are used nowadays. They were the words used in <Col N="14"/>the Mental Health Act 2001. They are also the words used in the Henchy report, which was written more than 25 years ago. I would hope the Minister and his advisers can see their way to do something about the title, and I would like the Minister of State to say how he sees the matter proceeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment. It is a reasonable amendment and addresses a sensitive point. I fully support the sentiments expressed on the subject by Senator Henry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform takes the view that the amendment is not appropriate. The legislation we are enacting must be read in the context of the evolution of our criminal law. There is a decided judicial authority on the precise meaning of insanity and on the precise circumstances in which the plea of insanity will excuse an offender from criminal liability. The Minister sees the Bill as slotting into that context of Irish jurisprudence, and he maintains that the eventual Act will have to be construed in that context.</P>
      <P>The development of the defence of insanity since the 1960s has been fixed on the question of a person&rsquo;s responsibility for his or her actions. That is unique among common-law systems, not just neighbouring jurisdictions but those further afield. The plea of insanity in Irish law is an excuse, rather than a condition. It is a factor that excuses liability from the commission of a crime. The Minister is prepared to say that, once the person is excused criminal liability, then the civil definition, which Senator Henry is essentially proposing through the amendment, will apply.</P>
      <P>When it comes to the care of the person who has been tried, the civil definition will apply, as I understand it. For the purposes of defining the defence of insanity in Irish law, the Minister has drafted the proposed legislation on the basis of existing case law. That preserves the definition, and the Minister is anxious to preserve it into the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>When he was here, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said how much he admired Mr. Justice Henchy, whom he described as the greatest legal brain of the last century. Mr. Justice Henchy stressed that the prisoner could become a patient. That is one of the reasons I feel so strongly about the matter. I want the prisoner to be treated as a patient once it is recognised that he or she is a patient.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State talked about tradition. For goodness&rsquo; sake, if traditional practices are wrong, they should change. I am sorry about Deputy Lenihan&rsquo;s remarks. The Bill is entirely Deputy McDowell&rsquo;s. When he was here, he did not say a word about tradition. All that he said was that he liked the word &ldquo;insanity&rdquo; because <Col N="15"/>everyone knows what it means. The Minister did not say anything about tradition.</P>

      <P FLI="0">My intention with this amendment is to save the taxpayer money. One interesting aspect of the explanatory memorandum is its statement that there are no financial implications to the legislation. I have never heard anything so ridiculous. There is no Bill without financial implications and if people are to be given proper treatment or care there will be financial implications. The explanatory memorandum states:</P>
      <P LI="1">It is not anticipated that the proposals in the Bill will have significant financial or staffing implications. There will be some extra costs associated with the work of the new Mental Health Review Board because its responsibilities as set out in the Bill are more extensive and onerous than those of the <i>ad hoc</i> Advisory Committee which it replaces.</P>
      <P FLI="0">There will be expenses, not just with the review board, but also if there is to be any kind of semi-adequate care and treatment given to those who are at present not getting treatment.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to save some money for the taxpayer by providing that members of the mental health tribunals, established under the Mental Health Act, act in this manner and that the chair should comprise a judge or a lawyer of at least ten years&rsquo; standing.</P>

	<P>The Minister of State is ready.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>As no one will take any notice of what I say I wonder why I bother. The mental health tribunals will have the advantage that the people comprising them, who would be much the same type of person as those on the Minister&rsquo;s review board, will get some experience as they deal with ordinary cases. When they come to criminal cases they can have as much advice and as many lawyers as they like, but I would like something already established to be used because those involved will have some experience. I hope there will not be people appealing to the review boards too often.</P>
      <P>This is a practical initiative and my intention is not to be difficult. I wish the matter could have been examined more seriously. On Committee Stage, the Minister, Deputy McDowell, indicated he did not think much of the idea although a few people thought it was well worthwhile. I know it would involve extra work for the mental health commission but psychiatrists deal with the same kind of people.</P>
      <P>The people who will be seen before the review boards will be serious cases. We have had people who committed murder come before the <i>ad hoc</i> review board. They were in the Central Mental Hospital or another mental institution and were deemed fit to be released. Then they committed another murder and there was more trouble. In England recently someone who murdered two people was brought back to a high-security designated centre and managed to murder another person inside the institution. We are dealing with serious issues and dangerous people. If we place more legal emphasis on the mental health tribunal review boards, they at least would have some experience of assessing cases, whereas we are going to have boards set up <i>de novo </i>for these cases. This is disappointing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of amendment No. 2 tabled by the Independent Senators concerning the Long Title of the Bill and the related amendments is to provide that the body carrying out regular reviews of cases involving the detention of persons found not guilty by reason of insanity or unfit to be tried in designated centres, <Col N="17"/>including the Central Mental Hospital, should be the Mental Health Commission, established in accordance with Part 3 of the Mental Health Act 2001. It is Senator Henry&rsquo;s wish that the Mental Health Commission should be the review body for the purposes of this Act. However, the Bill reflects Government policy on the matter and proposes a separate, independent body, namely, the mental health criminal law review board, for this purpose. The details of this new body are set out in Schedule 1 of the Bill. There are many related amendments on this matter, numbering 55 in total, but most of these are of a technical nature. They merely change the title from the &ldquo;review board&rdquo; as proposed in the Bill to the &ldquo;commission&rdquo; as set up by the Health Act 2001.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the four official amendments tabled by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is to insert &ldquo;Criminal Law&rdquo; into the title of the new body to assist in distinguishing it from the Mental Health Commission operating under the Health Act 2001 and to provide for the Irish version of the board&rsquo;s name.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stated on Committee Stage that he was receptive to the proposition that a more distinctive title be given to the new body so there would be no confusion between it and the mental health tribunals and the Mental Health Commission, which perform functions under the existing mental health legislation. He has, therefore, tabled the relevant official amendments, which provide for the new body to be called the mental health criminal law review board. The appropriate name of the new body will also be provided in Irish. This will necessitate an amendment to the Long Title of the Bill, as provided by amendment No. 3 and to the relevant definition in section 1, as provided for in amendment No. 8. Amendment No. 52 makes the necessary change to section 10 of the Bill and amendment No. 51 provides for an Irish title. A separate amendment to section 18, to be dealt with later, is a technical amendment designed to change the reference from &ldquo;the commission&rdquo; to &ldquo;the board&rdquo;. It has been brought to my attention that we have not made a corresponding change in the title of the new body in Schedule 1 of the Bill. If the House has no objection, we will revisit that matter when we deal with amendment No. 153.</P>
      <P>A detailed discussion took place on Committee Stage on the matter raised by Senator Henry&rsquo;s amendment. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has not changed his views on the issue. The mental health tribunal, or tribunals, to be established by the commission in accordance with the Mental Health Act 2001, have specific functions and responsibilities under that legislation. The new mental health criminal law review board, to be established in accordance with the provisions of section 10 of this Bill, will have as its main function the regular review of the detention of persons found not guilty by reason of insanity or unfit to be tried, who have been detained in a designated centre by an order <Col N="18"/>of the court and, most important, deciding on the release of such persons back into the community.</P>
      <P>Human rights considerations are involved and the matter has become more acute now that the Convention on Human Rights has been incorporated into our domestic law by the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003. The Government decided that in order to comply with its obligations under the convention, a separate and distinct body must be established for these purposes, to take a proactive role in the review of persons under its aegis and to review their cases on its own initiative. The task of the new body will be a solemn business, which must command public respect and confidence, as it is almost certain that every decision will be subjected to intense public scrutiny, especially as the review board will have the power to decide on the release of persons back into the community. The body making such decisions should not be involved in day-to-day assessments of appeals by patients against their treatment or the manner in which they were committed to mental institutions under civil legislation. The Minister believes there is a sound basis for keeping the business of the two bodies separate and therefore, following on from this conviction, the Government cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>This raises an issue that displeases me. According to the terms of the Bill, the review body is under the control of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and must report to him.</P>
      <P>I draw attention to the advice given by Mr. Justice Henchy in the third interim report of the interdepartmental committee on mentally ill and maladjusted persons. This was the basis from which we thought we were starting. The mental care review body in this legislation, referred to as the review body, shall consist of a chairman and deputy chairman appointed by the Minister for Health and Children after consultation with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, one member and one substitute member appointed by the Minister for Health and Children, one member and one substitute member appointed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and two members appointed by the Minister for Health and Children from a panel of five psychiatrists nominated by the executive council of the Irish division of the Royal College of Psychiatrists.</P>
      <P>This seems more concerned with the issue of health and the prisoner becoming a patient as opposed to what we have now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment adds the appropriate references in the definition section of the Bill. The definition of a prison is included in a definition section within section 2, which deals with the definition of designated centres. However, section 2 is being replaced with a new section in light of commitments made by the Minister during the course of debate on Committee Stage. The definition of a prison is being moved to section 1 for drafting purposes.</P>
      <P>The need to define the term &ldquo;prisoner&rdquo; arises because of the new provisions inserted into the Bill by Government amendments Nos. 144, 145 and 146. These relate to the complicated question of the transfer of prisoners to the Central Mental Hospital who, for example, become mentally ill during the period of their imprisonment. This currently involves an arcane and outmoded administrative process.</P>
      <P>I am not referring to the transfer of persons detained on the basis that they are unfit to plead or have been found not guilty by reason of insanity. Such persons cannot be detained in a prison because they have not committed a crime and have been excused by virtue of their condition from the commission of an offence.</P>

      <P FLI="0">It is suggested that the Mental Health Commission should be consulted. I tabled this amendment because the Minister for Health and Children has a great deal to do and far more than she expected. It would be extraordinarily difficult to be in position to identify a designated centre without getting advice from somebody in the area of mental health. We must delete the phrase &ldquo;prison or any part thereof&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Mr. Justice Henchy does not recommend sending prisoners who become patients to prison. It is not ideal because there is no therapeutic environment. Prisoners who are psychiatric patients are being treated in prison. We should ensure they are in suitable institutions. I cannot accept a prison as a suitable institution and neither does Mr. Justice Henchy, the various international bodies or the European Convention on Human Rights. We are putting something into legislation which is considered unsuitable by an extremely experienced judge as well as international bodies. Prison is not a therapeutic environment.</P>

      <P>There are a number of points in the re-drafts as submitted by the Minister of State. It clarifies that the Central Mental Hospital is a designated centre for the purpose of the legislation. First, it is better to state that openly in the legislation rather than deal with it as a matter of subordinate <Col N="21"/>legislative inference. Second, it addresses Senator Henry&rsquo;s substantive point except that it requires the Minister for Health and Children, when designating a centre, to consult with the Mental Health Commission rather than the Inspector of Mental Health Services when a psychiatric centre is involved and to obtain the consent of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform when a prison or any part thereof is involved.</P>
      <P>Third, this section proposes to accommodate another amendment yet to be discussed concerning the transfer of prisoners from prisons to designated centres. I touched on this earlier when discussing the interpretation centre. The fourth aspect of the amendment is being brought forward in light of suggestions by the Department of Health and Children and proposes to replace the word &ldquo;institution&rdquo; with &ldquo;in-patient facility&rdquo;. This will allow in-patient facilities which are not hospitals to be designated under the Bill.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 13 was proposed on Committee Stage and the Minister of State stands over his reasons for objecting to it. A designation of centres for persons covered by the terms of this Bill is a matter for the Department of Health and Children in consultation with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform where such a centre is located within a prison.</P>
      <P>On the one hand, the State has a duty to provide care and treatment for the person who has been found by a court to be unfit to be tried or not guilty of a criminal offence by reason of insanity. On the other hand, there may be circumstances whereby it might be appropriate to detain a person in a prison rather than a psychiatric hospital. That is the unfortunate reality. We cannot rule out that at some stage requirements of public safety may override other considerations and the person may have to be detained within the confines of the most secure facility available. Any concern regarding the treatment, care and well-being of a person detained in such circumstances are met by the provisions in this Bill governing the establishment of the new mental health criminal law review group board and the extensive provisions of the Mental Health Act 2001.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 5, between lines 4 and 5, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;(2) An accused person is presumed to be fit to be tried unless the contrary is shown.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I propose this amendment purely in the interests of certainty. The Minister should have little difficulty accepting it as it is not contrary to the policy behind the Bill. I merely want to make it clear that all persons will be presumed fit for trial until the matter of sanity is raised and adjudicated on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister did not accept a similar amendment on Committee Stage on the basis that it was neither necessary nor desirable. Provision on these lines, which is akin to a reversal of the burden of proof, would be objectionable as it would alter fundamentally existing law on these cases. The amendment also ignores the position that fitness to plead or, as it will be called following the enactment of the legislation, fitness to be tried, is a medico-legal issue. Most fundamentally, it does not relate to the guilt or innocence of the persons concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 5, line 5, after &ldquo;if&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;having obtained the opinions of two approved medical officers, one of whom is the clinical director of a designated centre, the court finds that&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The reason I tabled this amendment is that a judge in a court who has no experience of psychiatric matters is being asked to make a decision as to whether a person is mentally ill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The difficulty with the amendment is that the matters set out in section 3(2) must be determined solely by a judge. As the Minister stated on Committee Stage, there is no need to hear the opinions of two doctors on an <Col N="24"/>issue which will, in all likelihood, be obvious to the court. Once a determination is made that a person is unfit to be tried, the judge may proceed to hear evidence in the matter from an approved medical officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I had the impression on Committee Stage that the Minister did not believe it necessary for the psychiatric profession to give an opinion in many areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>In the normal course of events the evidence of psychiatrists will be heard by a judge on matters of this type and it would be extraordinary if that were not the case. There is a difference, however, between indicating that a judge will hear evidence as a matter of course and practice and prescribing in legislation that, as a necessary precondition of a judge exercising his or her jurisdiction, he or she must have obtained the opinions of two approved medical officers, one of whom is the clinical director of a designated centre. In effect, the amendment would trammel the court in the range and quality of evidence it could entertain on an inquiry of this nature and circumscribe it by requiring, as a necessary precondition, that the opinion of the persons indicated should be heard ahead of anyone else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 19 not moved.</P>
    <P>Government amendment No. 20:</P>
    <P LI="1" el="5">In page 5, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following:</P>
    <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(<i>c</i>) in the case of an indictable offence which may be tried summarily, elect for a trial by jury,&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>During the debate on section 3 on Committee Stage the Minister indicated he was considering including a further ground in the section relating to unfitness to be tried. This relates to a person&rsquo;s inability to elect for trial by jury in a case involving an indictable offence. Sometimes a person must elect as to whether he or she wants to be tried in the District Court or Circuit Court. This right of election is just as important as the right to challenge a juror or make a proper defence. As the purpose of the <Col N="25"/>amendment is to provide accordingly, I am sure Senators will have no objection to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>

	<P>Amendment No. 14 was not moved as amendment No. 12 was agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a very important issue to me. I pointed out during the debate on Committee State that in half the Bill, the description was &ldquo;care or treatment&rdquo; while in the other half it was &ldquo;care and treatment&rdquo;. The terms appear to be randomly dispersed. However, to my horror, where I suggested we should have &ldquo;care and treatment&rdquo;, the Minister has changed it to &ldquo;care or treatment&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I looked up the meaning of &ldquo;care&rdquo; in legal dictionaries. They referred to matters such as reasonable care and custody and asserted that it was not limited to the physical well-being of a child in terms of the provision of meals and comfort, but also that he or she had to have proper education and so forth. However, therapeutic care of a person was not mentioned anywhere.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Treatment is extraordinarily important, as these people are ill. We could have a situation where we are simply warehousing these people in designated institutions. In the Mental Health Act, care and treatment is applied all the times. I do not care that is a civil Act while this is criminal legislation, it is all about people. It is about prisoners who have become patients. Mr. Justice Henchy, who was much admired by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, asks for care and treatment for people. There is no definition for either care or treatment in the Bill that we are discussing today. However, in the Mental Health Act 2001, treatment is defined as:</P>
      <P LI="1">in relation to a patient, [which the prisoner has now become] includes the administration of physical, psychological and other remedies relating to the care and rehabilitation of a patient under medical supervision, intended for the purposes of ameliorating a mental disorder.</P><Col N="26"/>
      <P FLI="0">The Act uses the word &ldquo;ameliorating&rdquo;. It does not state that there must be a possibility of cure. This is extraordinarily important because there is no point in moving people from one institution to another if one is not going to do something to help their situation.</P>
      <P>I have only had a brief opportunity to examine the Government amendments on the transfer of prisoners. However, it appears to me that, according to later provisions in the Bill, someone might agree to a voluntary transfer to the Central Mental Hospital or another designated institution because he or she is considered to be mentally ill in a prison. If that person does not agree to treatment, he or she can be transferred back to the prison. Care alone will not be enough. However, in the Bill we are stating that either care or treatment will suffice. What about the prisoner who then decides he or she does not want treatment? That prisoner will be obliged to have it, even though the Bill earlier includes the wording, &ldquo;care or treatment&rdquo;. I have never seen anything so confused in my life. I cannot understand why mentally ill people are not being considered as patients who are in need of treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Henry. I remember some ten years ago, very early on in my career here, one of the first debates in which I was involved concerned a prison Bill. While speaking off the cuff, I stated that although I was unsure that I had thought out the question as to why people should be sent to prison, among the reasons that I could think of was the protection of society, punishment and rehabilitation. While these were good options to have included, rehabilitation, if it ever takes place, should certainly be for those who are affected by the area we are debating in this legislation. Senator Henry has made a strong case for including treatment as well as care although I will not repeat her statements. The case deserves attention and she has made a case that deserves full approval on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I also fully support this amendment. The question of treatment is essential. How can the Government insert &ldquo;care or treatment&rdquo; and not accept &ldquo;care and treatment&rdquo; in a situation like this as has been explained by Senator Henry? It is inexplicable, because treatment should be there and the people affected must be treated as patients. They should also be entitled to treatment. I ask that the Minister reconsiders this issue in view of the points made so eloquently by Senator Henry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course the Minister wants everyone detained under these provisions to have care and treatment in the ordinary sense. However, words we use in the ordinary sense do not always translate in the extraordinary sense of an Act of the Oireachtas. The Minister is convinced that the words must be used disjunctively in this context to ensure the maximum protection <Col N="27"/>for the person and to ensure that he or she is not in fact warehoused.</P>
      <P>The origin of this discussion is that the Bill was originally inconsistent, as references were made to &ldquo;treatment or care&rdquo; or &ldquo;care or treatment&rdquo;. When the matter arose on Committee Stage, the Minister advised that not only should there be uniformity in the Bill, but that the term to be used should be &ldquo;care or treatment&rdquo;, because as it is wider, it allows for a greater discretion in this sensitive area.</P>
      <P>If &ldquo;care and treatment&rdquo; is used, it might be interpreted as meaning that if a person could not be treated, he or she could be denied care, whereas by using the disjunctive &ldquo;or&rdquo;, either of these can be provided to a person under the legislation.</P>
      <P>The Minister is very concerned with any possibility that a person with certain conditions might be left to one side. His preference is for the term &ldquo;care or treatment&rdquo;, because of the greater amount of flexibility it accords in legal terms. To use &ldquo;care and treatment&rdquo; throughout the Bill would suggest that in all circumstances, both care and treatment must be provided, whereas only one might be possible. An example might be <Col N="28"/>where a person&rsquo;s condition is not treatable where, for example, he or she suffered from Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, but the person would still require a great deal of care. The Minister also mentioned on Committee Stage that in some areas of the Bill there are references to &ldquo;care and treatment&rdquo; and others to &ldquo;treatment and care&rdquo;. He is bringing forward amendments to regularise the position, to make all references refer to &ldquo;care or treatment&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>The basis regarding treatment appears to change daily. The Minister of State gave Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease as an example. Nowadays, most people would think that far more should be done for people with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease than just keeping them warm and feeding them. It was not a very good example. It could be a cost-saving effort not to treat people. I would not like to see that situation arise, particularly as the explanatory memorandum made reference to there being no financial implications. Of course there will be financial implications if we are going to treat people. I do not think the Minister of State&rsquo;s explanation is satisfactory.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 5, line 30, to delete &ldquo;commit him or her to a specified designated centre&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;commit him or her to the designated <Col N="28"/>centre subject to the agreement of the clinical director of the specified designated centre&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have tabled this amendment concerning the requirement for the agreement of the clinical director of the specified designated centre due to the possibility of people being sent to a centre incapable of dealing with them. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on Committee <Col N="29"/>Stage did not give the amendment a good reception, which should surprise the Minister of State, but it is a serious problem. There are few closed units in this country where a person can be safely kept. Not only the safety of the person to be transferred must be considered but also the safety of staff and other patients.</P>
      <P>It concerns me that the lack of facilities within a designated centre for a seriously-ill person might not be realised. It will be easy to transfer most of these people to somewhere that is not too secure as they are persons who have caused problems or committed crimes that are nuisances rather than anything of serious consequence. We are not focusing on people who have committed serious crimes only. It is important that the people at the other end of the spectrum have a closed ward. People may be seriously ill because they have not taken their medication in recent months. This can happen and it is worthwhile considering it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us examine what could happen were the amendment accepted. The courts would require the consent of the clinical director of the designated centre concerned before a person could be committed or referred to it. What would the courts do if they found that no clinical director would accept the person? As the Minister said in the course of an earlier debate, it is appreciated that the motivation for this amendment arises out of a concern that clinical directors may feel they are unable to accommodate such persons. This is a question of provision. The Minister for Health and Children must consider whether there is appropriate provision. Her attention will be drawn to it so that provision can be examined in advance of the commencement of the legislation.</P>
      <P>While other Departments seem to countenance the plea from their agents who are in receipt of public funds that provision cannot be made for a person, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform cannot countenance a position where the orders of the courts cannot be implemented or where the courts can be met with the plea that provision cannot be made for a person. It must see that the decrees of the courts are enforced.</P>

	<P>I am sure I will make as little progress with it. The significant shortage of proper places for people who may need to be detained is causing a terrible problem. I thought it wise to speak with someone in the designated centre or in the Central Mental Hospital before transferring a person in a taxi with a prison officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As Senator Henry has accepted, the same considerations that arose in my last substantive reply apply to this. The courts would require the consent of the clinical director of the designated centre concerned before a person could be referred there for examination by an approved medical officer. What would the court do if it found that no clinical director would accept the person? I will draw the attention of the Minister for Health and Children to the problem.</P>
      <P>I gave Senator Henry a vigorous reply earlier. Having served as a Minister of State in three Departments, there is a remarkable difference between the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and other Departments on this <Col N="31"/>issue. They are always most anxious to ensure the enforcement of court sentences.</P>
      <P>In the case of the Prison Service, there must always be a place, even if it involves the release of a person approaching the end of his or her sentence. This attitude does not prevail in other Departments. As a result, persons have recourse to the courts even in a civil context to try to ensure they have services. I am not necessarily critical of this amendment and have some sympathy for the insertion of these clauses by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, as it must ensure its responsibilities are met.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>During the Committee Stage debate on amendments Nos. 20 and 24, as moved by Senator Henry, in the context of the involvement of the clinical director of a designated centre in the court process, particularly in regard to whether the particular institution would assume responsibility for a person, the Minister said that the period of referral, as provided for in the sections, could be reduced and the purpose of these two amendments is to reduce the initial holding period from 28 days to 14 days. This should facilitate clinical directors when they are faced with the prospect of a person being referred to them for assessment. At least Senator Henry has saved the clinical director 14 days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>Naturally, I will have some crib about this provision which astonishes me. The Minister of State is attached to the Departments of Health and Children and Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I keep trying to point out that the same psychiatrists will have to try to make both Bills workable. Section 18 of the Mental Health Act deals with a review by a tribunal of admission and renewal orders. I am delighted the Minister has reduced the number of days from 28 to 14 days, which is good. However, section 18(2) states that people should be reviewed not later than 21 days. Why is there no consistency? Why is it 14 days? One must remember it will need to be stuck in a psychiatric registrar&rsquo;s head that within 21 days, he or she will have to get going and do something, no matter what type of person is involved. We must try to make the Bill as good as possible.</P>
      <P>I am delighted the length of time has been reduced but I would not have been unhappy if there had been some consistency. A psychiatric registrar, working in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Hospital up to <Col N="32"/>the end of June, will be transferred to the Central Mental Hospital and he or she will be in the habit of saying, &ldquo;These people have been in for 21 days, I must do something&rdquo;. He or she will be wrong because the length of time will have been reduced to 14 days. There is a need for some consistency.</P>
      <P>We get into this mess again further on in the Bill where there are consultant psychiatrists and approved medical officers. Approved medical officers are described in the interpretation section as consultant psychiatrists. Why not use the same terminology in the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I take it the Senator is referring to the 2001 Act and to this legislation in referring to these inconsistencies. Of course, there is a fundamental distinction between this Bill and the 2001 Act. This Bill deals with persons who come before the courts and it provides a &ldquo;regime&rdquo;, if I can use that somewhat sinister word, for them. The purpose of the 2001 Act is quite different and it deals with the general care and attention of such persons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The thinking behind these amendments relates to the point that the word &ldquo;committed&rdquo; carries a connotation that people might have known what they were doing when they committed the act giving rise to the offence. It could be argued the word &ldquo;did&rdquo; is more neutral in that regard and would be more appropriate for use in the Bill. The other reason is that the word &ldquo;did&rdquo; is used in the Bill. As the Minister put it on Committee Stage, it would be better to settle for a tyranny of consistency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Tuffy tabled an amendment on Committee Stage which is similar in terms to this amendment. The Minister noted that it raised an interesting point and said he would consider the matter further. Having reflected on Senator Tuffy&rsquo;s proposed amendment, the Minister is of the view that, as drafted, there is potential in section 3(8) for a court to conclude, without the benefit of a full trial, that there is not reasonable doubt that an accused did the act alleged. It is clear that such a conclusion could be prejudicial to the interests and good name of an accused thereafter or at any future trial. The Minister proposes an amendment using a slightly different formulation from that proposed by Senator Tuffy which will address her concerns and which provides for a penalty in circumstances where the provisions of subsection (9) are breached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>My amendment No. 36 is being discussed with this amendment and what the Minister has proposed goes a long way towards addressing it. I would have liked him to have gone further because it is hard enough for people who are not fit to plead to have their entire psychiatric history in the public press when perhaps they are at a stage of treatment when they know what is going on. It is also hard on families. What the Minister has done is a help. Having medical details of this nature disclosed in the press is always rather worrying. What the Minister has proposed will at least address the situation coming up to the trial. I would prefer if entire medical reports were not published in the press without the permission of the court. I would like the court to have the opportunity to give that permission if it believed it was relevant to the case. I would not like to think that a person&rsquo;s history over many decades would be disclosed in the press for the vicarious delight of the public.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Tuffy. In regard to what Senator Henry said, this Bill was initiated in the Seanad and I am prepared to look again at the issue she raised as to whether the protection of medical records is sufficient. The Minister used the phrase &ldquo;where evidence is adduced before the court&rdquo; and I envisage that in the general run of cases, that is exactly what has happened to the medical report or assessment. If there is any doubt about that, or any opening where the medical profession might be exposed, it can be looked at between now and when the Bill is taken in the D&aacute;il. I give an undertaking to that effect because I agree with the Senator that it is important the matter is safeguarded and made rock solid in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply. My amendment No. 36 is straight from my favourite piece of light reading, the Henchy report.</P>

      <P LI="1">In page 7, to delete line 26.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This is the one place where my light reading and I fall apart. &ldquo;Irresistible impulse&rdquo; is a concept not known in psychiatry. Of course, one will be able to find a couple of people to come forward in the courts and there may be terrible trouble in various court cases because of this concept on which the Minister is very keen. I have been reliably informed by a wide selection of psychiatrists that &ldquo;irresistible impulse&rdquo; is not considered to be a diagnosis in psychiatry. I query the wisdom of keeping this concept in the Bill. As the Minister of State&rsquo;s officials will tell him, I raised this issue on Committee Stage and I will not go over it again. I believe it will cause terrible trouble in the future. I am thinking of barristers on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The point of departure is that the Minister has decided to slot this Bill and his definitions therein into the settled case law and the judicial decision on this branch of the law. The Minister may have erred but so did the Supreme Court in Doyle <i>v.</i> Wicklow County Council, in which the court incidentally approved the views of Mr. Justice Henchy in an earlier decision. The report which Mr. Justice Henchy wrote extra-judicially may be in conflict with the expression he gave of opinion judicially in this particular matter.</P>
      <P>The point the Senator has raised is an interesting one. The purpose of the Bill, in terms of the test for insanity for the purposes of the criminal law is to restate the current position as it exists in the judge-made common law. That is the decision the Government has made on this. The third limb of the test for insanity, as it exists <Col N="35"/>in our law, and as set out in section 4(1)(<i>a</i>)(iii) of the Bill is known as &ldquo;irresistible impulse&rdquo;. When the McNaughten rules were formulated by the judges in the 19th century they did not allow for the defence of &ldquo;irresistible impulse&rdquo;. They were criticised on that ground by many psychiatrists and jurists. I think it became the received wisdom among lawyers and jurists that the rules required revision in light of developments in psychiatric science. Attempts at a defence of &ldquo;irresistible impulse&rdquo; should be recognised.</P>
      <P>The courts across the water managed to avoid having to give an authoritative determination on this issue and eventually parliament intervened with the Homicide Act 1957. In this jurisdiction the courts accepted the view that the McNaughten rules were inconsistent with modern psychiatric science and decided to modernise the rules by recognising the concept of irresistible impulse. What Senator Henry is saying is that a large number of psychiatrists of the more modern vintage do not accept the concept of irresistible impulse. The decision of the Government and the Minister is that in formulating a definition for the purposes of this legislation, he should build on what the courts have already decided.</P>
      <P>To constitute the irresistible impulse, the person must have had an irresistible impulse and not an unresisted impulse and it must arise from a defective reason due to a mental disorder. The Supreme Court accepted that as the standard in Doyle <i>v.</i> Wicklow County Council in 1974. In the 1994 decision of the people in pursuit of the Director of Public Prosecutions <i>v.</i> Courtney, the Court of Criminal Appeal stated unequivocally that irresistible impulse is a limited form of insanity recognised by our law. The lawyers have argued about this and the English courts do not recognise an irresistible impulse as a symptom from which a jury might deduce insanity but the issue is not so relevant there. I misstated the English law, though not Irish law.</P>
      <P>The homicide legislation enacted in the United Kingdom in the 1950s did not recognise the concept of irresistible impulse; it recognised the concept of diminished responsibility. Irish law has not provided for that to date, it has provided for the concept of irresistible impulse. It has been decided to codify the existing position as recognised by the judges of the Supreme Court in this case. Far be it for me to disagree with the Minister. There is the question as to whether the whole definition in this matter would be better left to the courts in their wisdom, having heard appropriate evidence from the experts to be adapted from time to time. That said, the argument would be made that the Legislature has to give guidance and so we have based the guidance on what the judges have told us.</P>
      <P>The difficulty, and it is the same difficulty with which the Senator commenced the debate this afternoon, is that we are talking not just about psychiatry but the area where psychiatry has to encounter the concept of criminal responsibility. <Col N="36"/>The interaction between those two concepts is very difficult and it involves not just an acid test psychiatric call but a political call which we have to make as legislators. The boundary one decides to mark out in this area cannot be left exclusively to psychiatrists given that it is an area relating to the problems of the criminal law, and people must have confidence in the concept of personal responsibility. That is my own view on it but the Minister has taken a view and so has the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I just have to tell my psychiatric friends to remember the good fees they will get going down to the law courts to argue on this issue. That, I hope, will cheer them up.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 40:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 7, between lines 37 and 38, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;(3) Where a person has been found guilty of an offence, but prior to passing sentence the court becomes of opinion that the person is suffering from a mental disorder, the court having imposed a sentence may recommend that the sentence shall be served in a specified designated centre until such time as the person is no longer in need of in-patient care and treatment and shall thereafter be served in a prison or place of detention, and the Minister shall have regard to such a recommendation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P FLI="0">The reason for tabling this amendment is that one of the weaknesses of the Bill is that it does not give options at sentencing stage to deal with those whose mental problems become apparent at that time. On Committee Stage the Minister indicated he might accept a recommendation but not an order made in the course of sentencing. With that in mind we tabled the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has availed of the opportunity to push a door which the Minister left somewhat ajar during the debate on Committee Stage. There was a suggestion, in what the Minister said, that a judge making a recommendation that someone in need of psychiatric inpatient treatment in the Prison Service should have regard to that. The Minister, having reflected on the matter, is not swayed in his thinking since Committee Stage. While it is accepted that it is open to judges to make recommendations when passing sentence, when one considers such circumstances it is hard to see how any judge could make such a recommendation at such a late stage in a trial without appropriate medical advice to support it. As the Minister said on Committee Stage, it is better for the Prison Service to make decisions of that kind rather than the Judiciary. There would also be a concern that <Col N="37"/>there could be some suggestion that designated centres could be substituted for jails and that they could be characterised as something which they are clearly not, that is, places of detention for persons found guilty as a punishment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that the plea of diminished responsibility to which I referred in my last contribution, was introduced in United Kingdom law in the 1950s. This plea does not eliminate criminal liability; it reduces the conviction from a conviction for murder to a conviction for manslaughter. Murder carries with it a mandatory life sentence and for manslaughter the penalty is at the discretion of the court. Diminished responsibility, by definition, can only apply to the relationship between murder and manslaughter where there is a homicide. I suppose one could try to envisage or construct circumstances where diminished responsibility would bring one from actual bodily harm to common assault although in practice, substitute verdicts are generally allowed in that type of trial. The issue of diminished responsibility only arises in the context of a homicide and it has the effect of reducing the culpability of the individual from murder to manslaughter but it does not mean, as in the case of the plea of insanity, that the person is excused from all criminal liability.</P>

      <P FLI="0">Aspects of section 7(3) are quite remarkable. As drafted it allows the Circuit Court judge to find the person guilty of a charge that the court, in the words of the section &ldquo;shall substitute a verdict of guilty of the offence charged or of any other offence of which it is satisfied that the person could (by virtue of the charge) and ought to have been convicted,&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think the construction the Senator has put on this is correct. The Minister mentioned on Committee Stage references in subsections (3), (5), (8) and (10) of this section to offences other than the offence charged. I presume this is what Senator Cummins is referring to.</P>
      <P>The Minister explained that this is to take account of cases where a person charged with one offence may be convicted of a different offence. If, for example, a person is charged with murder and found not guilty by reason of insanity and the Court of Criminal Appeal considers that the applicant was in fact suffering from a mental disorder and that the act in question would have amounted to a lesser offence of manslaughter, the court should still dismiss the appeal. The Minister also mentioned that if an amendment is proposed to subsection (3) which deals with appeals to the Circuit Court, then logically it should also apply in other cases to the Court of Criminal Appeal as provided in the other subsections. The Minister pointed to the text in brackets, &ldquo;by virtue of the charge&rdquo;, in subsection (3). This is the crucial point because the reference in subsection (3) to the phrase, &ldquo;by virtue of the charge&rdquo;, means that this option only arises where there is a choice open on the charge, not to additional or other charges.</P>

      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P FLI="0">I am at a loss to understand why the term &ldquo;consultant psychiatrist&rdquo; is used sometimes and the term &ldquo;the approved medical officer&rdquo; is used other times, when the approved medical officer is in fact a consultant psychiatrist within the meaning of the Mental Health Act 2001. Does this mean we are accepting, in the situations where the term &ldquo;consultant psychiatrist&rdquo; is written, someone who is not a person who is described as a consultant psychiatrist under the Mental Health Act 2001?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, I am trying to assist the Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Minister of State has a good explanation for it but we were very careful about the definition of a consultant psychiatrist so that people from abroad could be used. I wonder why this change is in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Henry rightly says that an &ldquo;approved medical officer&rdquo; is defined as someone practising in the State because it imports the conditions set out in the definition of &ldquo;consultant psychiatrist&rdquo; in section 2 of the Mental Health Act 2001. Those conditions include a person who is employed by a health board or by an approved centre or whose name is entered in the division of psychiatry of the register of medical specialists maintained by the Medical Council in Ireland. Where the term &ldquo;approved medical officer&rdquo; is used in the Bill, it means a person who complies with all of these conditions. The term &ldquo;consultant psychiatrist&rdquo; on the other hand, is not defined for the purposes of the Bill, hence it does not carry with it any of the conditions I have mentioned. It is not so limited. It can mean a person practising in this field outside the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is dealt with separately. It does not affect the Mental Health Commission whatsoever. I refer to the body being established under this legislation. Government amendment No. 155 limits membership of that body to approved medical officers. Consultant psychiatrists, therefore, cannot obtain such an appointment.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 89:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 13, line 46, after &ldquo;oath&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, affirmation&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The purpose of the amendment is to include the word &ldquo;affirmation&rdquo;. The Interpretation Act 1937 is not fully comprehensive in this regard. The Minister said on Committee Stage this issue would be covered by the inclusion of the phrase &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo;, as provided in Government amendment No. 95. This represents an improvement in that more instances will be covered but does the Minister of State believe this is adequate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment. I have supported similar amendments in respect of this issue in other legislation because members of some Christian denominations believe it is wrong to swear on the Bible. It is time to re-examine the Interpretation Act in view of the incidence of people swearing on the Bible and subsequently being found to have told a pack of lies. It is difficult for those of who are practising Christians to see the Bible so debased. It may be more apt for people merely to affirm their intention to tell the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Interpretation Act 1937 provides that the word &ldquo;oath&rdquo; in the case of a person for the time being allowed by law to affirm instead of swearing includes an affirmation. Under this legislation, therefore, affirmation applies wherever the word &ldquo;oath&rdquo; is used. The Minister consulted Parliamentary Counsel on these amendments and is satisfied there is no need to include the words &ldquo;or affirmation&rdquo; as proposed in amendment No. 89.</P>
      <P>The Minister is grateful to the Senators for drawing his attention to an inconsistency in the provisions as currently drafted. The phrase &ldquo;on oath or otherwise&rdquo; is used in some sections whereas the phrases &ldquo;on oath&rdquo; or &ldquo;the oath&rdquo; are used elsewhere. The Minister is satisfied with the reference to the oath in isolation in paragraph (<i>k</i>) as it deals with the issue of the administration of the oath. However, the other provisions relate to the cross-examination of witnesses and the giving of evidence by them and should refer to &ldquo;the oath or otherwise&rdquo;. This is the genesis of Government amendment No. 95.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry raised an interesting point about affirmations. The Law Reform Com<Col N="42"/>mission examined this issue some time ago and it has occasioned differences of opinion in different jurisdictions. It is a more general matter that does not arise under this legislation. Perhaps a more appropriate vehicle for its consideration would be a Private Members&rsquo; Bill. The Constitution, which was enacted at the same time as the Interpretation Act, does not provide for oaths for the various office holders as they enter into office, including judges, the President and so on, but provides for an affirmation made in the presence of Almighty God which dispenses with the necessity of having a copy of the New Testament in one&rsquo;s hand. This is an interesting intermediate solution to the problem.</P>
      <P>I cannot assist the Senators any further in this regard. The Parliamentary Counsel has confirmed that the inclusion of the word &ldquo;oath&rdquo; in legislation carries, by necessity, the connotation of affirmation.</P>

      <P LI="1">In page 16, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="1">13.&mdash;(1) In relation to any person remanded into custody or sentenced to imprisonment, the Minister shall&mdash;</P>
      <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) have the power to give a transfer direction if he or she is satisfied by reports from two registered medical practitioners, one of whom is a consultant psychiatrist on the staff of the Central Mental Hospital, that the person is suffering from a mental disorder (within the meaning of the Mental Health Act 2001) and is in need of in-patient care and treatment in the Central Mental Hospital,</P>
      <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) in the case of all remanded prisoners, the court shall be informed of the making of this order and that the person has been transferred to the Central Mental Hospital,</P>
      <P LI="2">(<i>c</i>) at the request of the clinical director of the Central Mental Hospital, the Governor of the prison from which the prisoner was transferred shall provide for transport and security for court appearances or other purposes,</P>
      <P LI="2">(<i>d</i>) the person shall be detained in the Central Mental Hospital for treatment and shall have the same protections and rights as are contained in the Mental Health Act 2001,</P>
      <P LI="2">(<i>e</i>) if the person is a prisoner who is on remand he or she shall be detained in the Central Mental Hospital until sentenced by the court, and</P>
      <P LI="2">(<i>f</i>) if the person has been sentenced by the courts he or she shall be detained until the expiry of the sentence.</P>
      <P LI="1">(2) In both cases the person shall be detained until the relevant consultant psychiatrist forms the opinion that the person is no longer in need of in-patient treatment or care at the designated centre and the consultant psychiatrist <Col N="45"/>shall forthwith notify the Minister of this opinion; and</P>
      <P LI="1">(3) Where the remanded or sentenced prisoner appeals successfully against his or her continued detention in the Central Mental Hospital to a Mental Health Tribunal, the Mental Health Tribunal shall forthwith notify the Minister of this decision and the Minister shall then order the return of the person to the prison from which that person was transferred.&rdquo;</P>
      <P FLI="0" Just="Left">This amendment represents an improvement on the present situation, which is quite unsatisfactory. There are some parts of the Bill that I do not like, because prisoners would not get treated sufficiently as patients, although there has is a big improvement in the provisions. Part 4 of the Mental Health Act 2001 will apply, which is important as it allows for consent to treatment. If a person goes voluntarily from a prison to the Central Mental Hospital but then does not agree to treatment, he or she can be sent back to prison. I do not know who decides whether the person is being unreasonable about their treatment. I have only seen the amendments recently.</P>
      <P>Section 4 of the Mental Health Act allows people to refuse certain kinds of treatment, and I presume that would also apply under the Bill. I refer to electro-convulsive treatment, for example. It must not simply be a matter of a refusal of treatment. The prisoner &mdash; who becomes a patient, as I keep mentioning &mdash; must have preserved for him or her the rights that patients have under the Mental Health Act regarding treatment. That is probably the most important issue.</P>
      <P>The Central Mental Hospital functions under the Department of Health and Children rather than the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I am sorry that more of the Mental Health Act 2001 does not apply to people when they are in different institutions. That has been a serious problem for a long time regarding the transfer of prisoners. The situation has been ridiculous, with people described as relevant officers &mdash; not medical officers &mdash; declaring that someone can go to court, where they are declared insane so that they can go on to some other institution. I am pleased about the provisions of the Mental Health Act that are being applied, but I would like the whole of the Act to be applied to people once they have become patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>In explaining the Government amendments, I may be able to assist the Senator to an extent. The substantive amendments being proposed by the Minister arise from concerns that have been expressed for some time, both at home and abroad, about the system of certification, decertification and transfer of persons detained for appropriate psychiatric treatment in the Central Mental Hospital. The Office of the Attorney General has stated that the process is dubious from a legal viewpoint and creates administrative <Col N="46"/>procedures that could be confusing in their application. Medical practitioners have been decertifying persons who had been certified a short period earlier merely as an administrative device to ensure that they could appear in court and then return to the Central Mental Hospital for treatment. The Attorney General has advised that the legislation covering the certification of persons in the categories affected &mdash; prisoners on remand or awaiting trial or sentenced prisoners &mdash; is no longer viable, and that the system for the transfer of such persons to the Central Mental Hospital should be overhauled and put on a modern, statutory basis. He suggested that the opportunity should be taken to insert suitable provisions in the Bill to modernise and clarify the purpose of transferring such persons to the central mental hospital and to repeal the relevant statutory provisions. It had been intended to deal with the matter under the proposed new prisons agency bill, but the Minister agrees with the views of the Attorney General and proposes to provide for the necessary legislative changes under the Bill.</P>
      <P>It is relevant that the Council of Europe committee that covers the whole area of punishment commented on our arrangements in a report, following a visit and inspection of places of detention in May 2002. The main difficulties with the system include the fact that the certification and decertification processes require the official seal of the relevant Minister, in the form of a ministerial order, which must be signed by duly authorised persons. That can give rise to administrative difficulties.</P>
      <P>There are a number of other difficulties, one of which is the one identified by Senator Henry. A problem can arise if a person transfers to the central mental hospital on a voluntary basis and subsequently refuses to take medication. In such cases, before medication can be administered, the person has to be transferred back to prison for certification and then sent back to the central mental hospital under a ministerial order. Senator Henry raised the issue on Committee Stage previously, and the Minister undertook to make his own proposals on the matter on Report Stage. The matter has been one of concern for some time. I appreciate the fact that, technically, the Seanad is technically back in Committee now. That is because of the substantive character of the amendment.</P>
      <P>Originally, it was intended to deal with this question under the proposed prisons Bill, but the matter is also relevant to this Bill and the Government has decided to include the appropriate provision in it. It deals with the complex questions of prisoners being transferred from places of detention to the central mental hospital for treatment and back again. That affects persons who have been sentenced on remand or who are awaiting trial. The current procedure involves certificates from psychiatrists, certification and decertification procedures and transfers from prisons to the Central Mental Hospital. The procedures are Byzantine and confusing in their <Col N="47"/>operation to say the least and need to be regularised. I propose a number of amendments today on behalf of the Minister to deal with the shortcomings of the existing arrangements. The intention behind these new provisions is to streamline the administrative formalities.</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>The earlier provisions cover that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>The earlier provisions will continue to apply here. That is important because one does not want to place people in institutions for treatment if they would be better off being treated as outpatients, just because they had been kicking milk bottles in the street because they had not taken their medication. That is good to hear. The Minister of State has gone a long way to try to solve what was an entirely unsatisfactory situation. Let us hope it will work in practice.</P>

	<P>Shall we take the amendments together? Would that assist the Minister of State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes because the amendment addresses a matter raised by Senator Henry and other Senators on Committee Stage. Having con<Col N="48"/>sidered the matter since Committee Stage, the Minister has decided to give effect to amendment No. 141 relating to an officer or servant of the designated centre. What is proposed by way of amendment No. 140 is that the insertion of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; after &ldquo;S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rdquo; will mean there is a positive obligation on members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to arrest persons who may be unlawfully at large. This is a stronger provision than the equivalent section 27 in the Mental Health Act 2001.</P>
      <P>The use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; provides sufficient discretion to officers or servants of a designated centre to decide for themselves, having regard to any risks to their own safety whether or not to carry out such an arrest. As the Minister said on Committee Stage, which is now listed as an amendment, he is not convinced that members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be the only persons carrying out these functions.</P>
      <P>There may well be particular circumstances where practicality and expediency of the common good may require officers of a designated centre to act. We are dealing with powers of arrest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>

	<P>In substance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad of that. Some of these people may not be dangerous, others could be very dangerous. I do not like the idea of psychiatrists sending out the staff to round people up and arrest them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is strengthening the role of garda&iacute; but he is not entirely absolving the members of the centre. That is still there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that. If one examines the Mental Health Act, there is a provision &mdash; I am not quite sure where &mdash; that if people escape from the closed centre they were in members of that centre can search for them but those staff members should not be required to arrest someone. If that is what may happen under this Bill to get people back into hospital, that is fine but I do not like the idea of members of staff having to go and arrest anyone who may involuntarily leave a centre. Will this issue be examined again?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am referring to section 27 of the Mental Health Act. That is different legislation. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also given the power of arrest. The situation envisaged is that the officers or servants of a designated centre decide for themselves, having regard to any risks to their own safety, whether or not to carry out an arrest. Garda&iacute; will have a positive obligation <Col N="49"/>imposed upon them to arrest persons who may be unlawfully at large. That is not case under the Mental Health Act 2001. There is a stronger obligation imposed on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under this legislation than under the 2001 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 27(2) of the Mental Health Act 2001 states:</P>

    <P LI="1" el="5">&ldquo;17. (1) Where in any proceedings for an offence the defence intends to adduce evidence as to the mental condition of the accused, notice of the intention shall be given to the prosecution within 10 days of arraignment for the offence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment was originally proposed by Senator Terry on Committee Stage. The Minister indicated he would table an amendment on Report Stage to incorporate its proposals. The substance of the amendment is similar to amendment No. 148. However, it should be noted that amendment No. 147 does not contain any reference to the provision in subsection (3) of amendment No. 148, which deals with evidence of certain facts and the consequences for the accused person of not mentioning those facts when questioned, charged or <Col N="54"/>informed and the consequent drawing of inference as a result.</P>
      <P>The Minister does not believe that a provision of this character is appropriate in the context of this Bill. Such a provision has been found to be relevant in other branches of the criminal law. What is proposed by this amendment is that an inference on the issue of insanity can be drawn by the court regarding the conduct or demeanour of a person at an earlier stage. While that is a useful provision to have in respect of, for example, the silence of a person or the presence on the person of certain marks or forensic signs, in an area as difficult as this, I am not sure it is appropriate to mandate the courts to draw inferences. Therefore, the Minister does not agree with that part of the proposal. However, he is well disposed towards and is supporting the general principle proposed by the Senators, which is that there should be notice of evidence given when it is proposed to adduce evidence as to mental condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill as drafted allows the question of sanity to be raised at any time, even after a trial has commenced. The plea of insanity has been open to abuse in the past. It is often raised at such a late stage as to call into question the reliability and the truth of the plea. Pleas of this nature often only arise when the legal team arrives on the scene.</P>
      <P>If the mental condition of an accused person is an issue, it should be raised at the earliest possible moment and amendment No. 148 provides for this. However, it also provides for the introduction of evidence of mental condition at a later stage, if desired, with the permission of the court. In considering whether to admit such evidence, the court may draw inference from the lateness of such notification.</P>
      <P>Section 14 contains an important provision. It effectively affords protection to those of unsound mind. This amendment is intended to provide further safeguards and to strengthen section 14, not to weaken it. I appreciate that the Minister has accepted part of the suggestions contained in the amendment.</P>

	<P>It should be noted that there is an error in amendment No. 156, reference No. 4, where the Short Title should read &ldquo;Central Criminal Lunatic Asylum (Ireland) Act 1845.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P el="5">Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P el="5">Bill, as amended, received for final consideration.</P>
    <P el="5">Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister and his officials for the way in which they have dealt with the Bill. I cannot say that I am happy with it. We had an opportunity to take a step forward in criminal law legislation but, in fact, this legislation could be 50 years old or more. The situation outlined in the Henchy report is much more forward-looking than anything in this Bill.</P>
      <P>However, I am glad that Bill attempts to remedy the situation regarding the transfer of prisoners, because it has become a national disgrace and is ridiculous. I hope what has been inserted into the Bill will be effective.</P><Col N="57"/>
      <P>The Bill outlines the law, but lawyers cannot stand alone. They need to have the assistance of other people to operate the law. My deep concern about the Bill is that it is going to be very difficult in some areas for those who want to operate the law properly for our patients. There is the possibility of hired guns emerging, people who would be delighted to give the courts the run around, which will be very disappointing if it does happen. The Minister, as a barrister, is aware that the desire to have long court cases is growing and I envisage some parts of this legislation adding to that.</P>
      <P>I am very disappointed about care and treatment. They should not be separated and the Minister&rsquo;s arguments on this are weak. I had hoped that my practical suggestion of the mental health tribunals being upgraded with more lawyers might be accepted. The review boards are a good suggestion, but it would be better to have people who are working in practice, even if only with patients who have no criminal convictions and who are not dangerous. It takes some time to set up review boards and it is preferable to have an experienced group of people to call from, rather than to set up these <i>de novo</i> groups from time to time. However, I thank the Minister of State and his officials for their courtesy.</P>

I agree with Senator Henry in that it is disappointing the Minister of State was not more forthcoming and accepting, especially with regard to care and treatment.</P>
      <P>The Minister praised Mr. Justice Henchy but it is a pity he did not take on board some of the points made by the judge as outlined by Senator Henry. The Bill has some good points, but it is disappointing that the Minister of State was not more amenable to amendments relating to care and treatment.</P>

	<P>I thank Senators for their kind remarks regarding the Minister and his officials and also their industry in considering the legislation. I also single out Senator Henry for her extraordinary interest in the measure.</P>
      <P>The Trial of Lunatics Act was enacted in 1883. While some time has elapsed since the Minister of State has given effect to the bulk of recommendations in Mr. Justice Henchy&rsquo;s committee, the judge is still with us and I wish him continued long life. A considerable time has elapsed since the Minister implemented those recommendations, but he has done so. Such legislation is being enacted for the first time in 122 years and must now go before the other House.</P>
      <P>Perhaps it is the subject matter which makes it difficult to legislate too often in this area. The Trial of Lunatics Act 1883 caused its own difficulties. Queen Victoria was very unwilling to sign it because she objected to the idea that her potential assassin could receive a verdict of not guilty for reason of insanity. Therefore, a legal verdict of guilty but insane was applied. This was an absurdity, because the purpose of deeming a person insane is to excuse him or her of the offence and not suggest he or she is guilty but insane.</P>
      <P>This is a difficult branch of the law and one of those areas where psychiatry and law meet but do not necessarily arrive at the same conclusions. As legislators, we must instil in the population a respect for the courts and personal responsibility. Psychiatry, with all its insights, could lead to an equation whereby there is no personal responsibility. It is a difficult line to draw, but the Minister has conscientiously tried to do so. He was happy to accept many of the constructive suggestions put forward by Senators in the course of the debate.</P>
      <P>I understand the Cathaoirleach does not like contentious replies on Final Stage and I am very grateful to Senators for how they considered the measure. The Minister wants maximum care and treatment for those committed to his charge in the penal system as well as those who come before the courts and are found not guilty by reason of insanity. It has been accepted that once that verdict is brought in the person then becomes subject to the definition with regard to treatment as outlined in the legislation. It is important that the foundation is in place, though it is philosophically difficult to decide on the ideal foundation. However, the many practical changes, in particular those advocated by Senator Henry with regard to the transfer of persons between different institutions, would be extremely important in laying a legislative foundation for a more humane system of treatment for such persons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing this matter and the Minister of State for coming to the House. The town of Glenamaddy is famous in song and story. The song was called <i>Four Roads to Glenamaddy</i>. I am raising the matter of the sewerage scheme for the town, which was included in the water and sewerage programme for 2004-06. Galway County Council has given priority to the scheme. While Glenamaddy has been famous in the entertainment area, in recent years it has seen considerable new industry and extra local authority and private housing. A new community school has been sanctioned for the town with the coming together of the vocational and the voluntary secondary school. Above all Glenamaddy is very radical in its proposals regarding caring, both in caring for the elderly and the proposals for child care. It is a thriving community with a real need for a sewerage scheme, which is why Galway County Council has given it such priority. I hope the Minister of State will impress upon the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government the need to approve the scheme. It is on the Galway County Council&rsquo;s waiting list and it is urgently needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue and extend the apologies of the Minister who cannot be in the House this evening. Last May, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government published the water services investment programme for 2004 to 2006. Made up of 869 schemes at different stages of development, it has a total investment value of more than &euro;5 billion. It is the most significant milestone yet in the push to bring our water services infrastructure up to a world standard.</P>
      <P>The total allocated to Galway under the latest phase of the water services programme is more than &euro;445 million, extending to 60 individual schemes. Among these are major sewerage projects for Headford, Tuam, Athenry, Ballinasloe, Clifden and Oughterard and major water supply schemes for Carna-Kilkieran, Tuam, Headford, Costelloe, Gort, Ballinasloe, Clifden, Loughrea and Portumna. Funding has also been provided under the serviced land initiative to bring additional residential sites on stream as rapidly as <Col N="60"/>possible to meet housing needs at a number of locations around the county. It is abundantly clear that a very large number of towns and villages in County Galway are reaping the benefits of the drive to bring our water and sewerage infrastructure up to a modern standard. The Glenamaddy sewerage scheme is very much part of that effort and the necessary funding for the <?oasys _dc28-?>scheme has been allocated under the current phase of the water services investment programme.<?oasys _dc0-?></P>
      <P>The Glenamaddy sewerage scheme has been approved in the programme to commence construction as soon as the procurement process has been completed. The estimated cost of the scheme is &euro;3 million and the funding is available for draw-down by Galway County Council as soon as a contractor is appointed. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is awaiting a revised preliminary report from Galway County Council. The preliminary report sets out in detail the scope and scale of a water services scheme and is a key step in the approval process. I understand that the council is working on the preliminary report in this case and that it hopes to submit it to the Department for approval in the next month or so. Once the preliminary report has been cleared by the Department, the council will be in a position to proceed with the preparation of contract documents on which bids for the construction phase will be invited from suitable contractors.</P>
      <P>As I have already indicated, the necessary funding has been set aside in the water services investment programme for 2004-06 and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will create no obstacles or avoidable delays in getting the scheme to construction. The Senator may also be interested to know that the Dunmore-Glenamaddy regional water supply scheme also features in the investment programme. Estimated to cost &euro;13 million, it will provide an improved and more reliable water supply to Glenamaddy and surrounding areas. The water scheme is not as far advanced in the planning phase as the sewerage scheme. As matters stand the Department is awaiting a brief from the council for the appointment of consultants to draw up the preliminary report, which will be dealt with as quickly as possible when it comes to hand.</P>
      <P>I have listened carefully to what the Senator has said. The Minister is undoubtedly just as anxious to see both the water and sewerage schemes reach construction as quickly as possible and I will ensure that he is made aware of the strong case made by the Senator for expediting the sewerage scheme in particular.</P>

    <Title>Decentralisation Programme.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise the matter of decentralis<Col N="61"/>ation on the Adjournment. I also thank the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, for coming to the House to respond to my question or plea, whichever way he wishes to put it. On many occasions the House has debated the Government&rsquo;s planned programme of decentralisation and the Minister of State knows that every Member of this House, regardless of party, supports the concept and practice of decentralisation.</P>
      <P>Great satisfaction was expressed throughout the country in December 2003 when the then Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, announced a widespread programme of decentralisation. In the north County Cork area, the communities in the towns of Mallow and Mitchelstown were exceptionally pleased to have been selected for decentralisation. Over many years, both the towns in question had made submissions outlining their cases for decentralisation. It was a source of great satisfaction, optimism and anticipation for the communities in both towns when it was announced almost 18 months ago that a section of Bus &Eacute;ireann was to transfer to Mitchelstown and a section of F&aacute;ilte Ireland was to transfer to Mallow. It is now the spring of 2005 and people in those communities are becoming anxious about the apparent lack of progress. Given that we have debated this matter on numerous previous occasions, the Minister of State will be aware of the major doubts about Bus &Eacute;ireann coming to Mitchelstown. Following confusion over the number of jobs promised, the initial response from the staff of Bus &Eacute;ireann was negative and it was felt that it would not be possible to find a realistic number willing to move from Dublin to Mitchelstown. Similarly, in the past 15 or 16 months people in Mallow have been disappointed that more progress was not made in decentralising some of F&aacute;ilte Ireland to Mallow. Will the Minister of State clarify the vital question of whether it is still Government policy to decentralise Bus &Eacute;ireann to Mitchelstown and F&aacute;ilte Ireland to Mallow? If this does not prove possible, will the Government decentralise other offices? As the Minister of State will be aware, hundreds of Civil Service staff in other Departments are willing to consider moving to regions such a north Cork. If it transpires that it is not possible to proceed with the initial plans regarding Mitchelstown and Mallow, the Government should acknowledge the position and commence plans to decentralise other Departments or offices to both towns. While I appreciate that one cannot move mountains overnight and we do not expect miracles, it is important that the current status of the decentralisation projects for Mallow and Mitchelstown are clarified as soon as possible. If they cannot be realised, will the towns be considered for other decentralisation projects? How quickly can alternative programmes be realised?</P><Col N="62"/>
      <P>I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply given his commitment to the decentralisation process and his Department&rsquo;s efforts to square the circle as it were. With thousands of Dublin-based staff willing to move to provincial areas, perhaps a better mix and match approach is required. Will the Minister of State give a strong commitment that jobs will be decentralised to the north Cork towns of Mallow and Mitchelstown? The promise given on budget day in December 2003 must be fulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is firmly committed to the completion of the entire decentralisation programme and pleased with the progress achieved in the past 16 months. Some commentators have tried to imply that locations not included in the first phase announced last November would not proceed. It is the Government&rsquo;s intention that the full programme will be implemented. It will be appreciated, however, that in a programme of this scale all the individual projects cannot be realised simultaneously and some phasing is necessary.</P>
      <P>The decentralisation implementation group was appointed by the Minister to drive the implementation of the decentralisation programme and consider issues such as the matter raised by the Senator. Last November, the group announced the organisations and locations it considered should be included in the first phase of transfers. In selecting these organisations it paid particular attention to the numbers wishing to transfer to each location, as indicated by their first preferences shown on the central applications facility, now widely known as the CAF. The progress made in each location on the identification and purchase of a suitable site or building was important in selecting locations. Business issues, as identified in the implementation plans of the organisations in question, were also considered by the group.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>While Mallow and Mitchelstown were not included in the first phase of locations, it is intended that Bus &Eacute;ireann will transfer to Mallow with approximately 80 staff. As the Senator is aware, my colleague, the Minister for Transport, is responsible for its decentralisation. The implementation group has received an implementation plan prepared by the company for its transfer to Mitchelstown. I understand Bus &Eacute;ireann has taken responsibility for the procurement of its accommodation in the town but has not yet acquired a suitable site or building for its decentralised office.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11.5-?>
      <P>F&aacute;ilte Ireland will transfer to Mallow with approximately 180 staff. My colleague, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, is responsible for this transfer and I understand from him that progress has been made. F&aacute;ilte Ireland has prepared a detailed implementation plan for the <Col N="63"/>decentralisation of the authority to Mallow. Up to and including 7 September, the closing date for priority applications, a total of only ten applications had been received on the central applications facility. The Office of Public Works has identified a number of sites in Mallow as possible locations for the authority&rsquo;s offices in the town.</P>
      <P>Although the intention is that the organisations, in the first phase, will receive initial priority attention in terms of staff transfers and property procurement, the implementation group emphasised that progress should also continue for all remaining organisations. The group has stated it intends to report shortly on progress and will address in its report the locations and organisations not covered in its report of last November.</P>
      <P>I emphasise the benefits of decentralisation. Recent economic success has not been evenly spread throughout the State, with Dublin experiencing high levels of both population and employment growth resulting in congestion and creaking infrastructure. Most people would agree that a more even spread of development will contribute to sustainable long-term economic growth throughout the country. The movement of State employment from Dublin will help provide for the economic and social development of regions which have not benefited to the same degree as Dublin from recent economic success. The decentralisation programme will serve as a catalyst for further economic benefit in provincial Ireland while, at the same time, contributing towards reducing congestion in Dublin city and county.</P>
      <P>Public servants who opt for decentralisation should experience significant financial and quality of life gains. Accommodation prices are much lower in the provinces and commuting times will also be lower. People will be able to return home to family and friends and civil servants already living and working outside Dublin will have a wider range of work and career opportunities which have been denied to them until now. Public servants who aspire to senior management positions will no longer have to migrate to the capital, although many will continue to do so. The Department of Finance recently launched a new website dedicated to decentralisation which can be found at <i>www.decentralisation.gov.ie</i>. I hope Senator O&rsquo;Toole will have greater success than previously in logging on to the site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his response. Will he confirm that if the decentralisation projects involving Bus &Eacute;ireann and F&aacute;ilte Ireland are not realisable from a jobs and staff point of view &mdash; we all accept that plans do not always work out as originally envisaged &mdash; the Government will consider decentralising other offices or Departments to these towns? In other words, is the decision to transfer staff to Mallow <Col N="64"/>and Mitchelstown sacrosanct and will it be delivered upon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>As I stated, the Government is committed to the full delivery of the decentralisation plan. For this reason, no concerns arise at this stage. Both Bus &Eacute;ireann and F&aacute;ilte Ireland have prepared detailed implementation plans, which the relevant Minister and his or her Secretary General and departmental staff have a responsibility to implement. Today, the Office of Public Works appointed a person to take full charge of decentralising its headquarters from St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green to Trim. The individual in question will assume responsibility primarily for personnel and all attaching issues. The OPW is, therefore, moving ahead.</P>
      <P>While I am not certain as regards the Senator&rsquo;s question, he could raise it with the two relevant Ministers. I understand a substantial number of Bus &Eacute;ireann employees live in Munster as the company has operations in Tralee, Killarney and Cork city. While I have seen its implementation plan, there is no reason Bus &Eacute;ireann should not fit into the decentralisation plans. If the Senator were to seek out the company&rsquo;s implementation plan, he could apprise himself of its enthusiasm or otherwise.</P>
      <P>It is my responsibility in the Office of Public Works to find property and accommodation solutions for the decentralisation programme. Phase one was based on the enthusiasm of those who signed up on the central applications facility. Although attracting sufficient numbers proved to be a problem initially, as I stated previously, the CAF was designed for civil servants, whereas Bus &Eacute;ireann and F&aacute;ilte Ireland employees operate outside the Civil Service. The process works much better when in-house implementation plans are drawn up.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I am interested in the information the Senator is extracting from the Minister of State. Although I have been having greater success accessing the decentralisation website in recent times, the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service is still seeking monthly reports on the progress of the decentralisation programme.</P>

    <Title>Special Educational Needs.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. The matter I raise relates to education which is not his strongest suit. Nevertheless, it is a straightforward issue on which I hope <Col N="65"/>he will engage with me. I recently visited the Catherine McAuley school in Limerick. It has 175 pupils with special needs, all of whom have been assessed as having a mild learning disability.</P>
      <P>The average intelligence quotient is 100. In most of the rest of Europe, children with an IQ of between 70 and 80 are considered to have a mild disability. Those with an IQ under 70 are considered to have moderate disability which is much more significant. Astonishingly, as a result of a decision taken here to protect resources, children with an IQ of between 50 and 70 are regarded as having only mild disability.</P>
      <P>I cite these statistics to provide some context. This school has 175 of those pupils. The purpose of raising this matter is not to seek a new school because it has a fine design placed in a good location with a superb staff, an enthusiastic principal and a very supportive local community. It is an impressive school where much good work is done.</P>
      <P>While the school is a special primary school, two thirds of the pupils are of post-primary school age. Most local post-primary schools teach the usual range of subjects in addition to subjects such as art, physical education, home economics and woodwork, which are crucial for children at second level. This school is allowed, under certain conditions, to appoint teaches who will deal with art, physical education, economics and woodwork, and it has good rooms to cater for this. For example, it has an extraordinary computer room which is of great importance to children with special needs. It also has a cookery room and other rooms to cater for the subjects I mentioned.</P>
      <P>However, the school is only allowed to make part-time as opposed to permanent teacher appointments in these subjects. This means that the teachers recruited and appointed are not employed full-time. Sometimes the school can be fortunate in being able to appoint a teacher who is only interested in working part-time, but generally, it appoints good teachers who will only stay in the school until such time as he or she gets a full-time permanent job elsewhere. While such teachers cannot be blamed for following their career requirements, this situation creates a certain instability in the school. This problem applies to all special schools in the country.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to ensure that every special school should be entitled to appoint a certain quota of specialist teachers on a permanent basis or to a panel serving a number of schools. This will create stability as the teachers will build up a relationship with the school, the pupils, the principal and other staff. This is very important.</P>
      <P>Other issues include the fact that pupils can only stay in such schools until the age of 18 years whereas it is 19 years in the case of other schools. This can create difficulty for children with special needs who might be sitting State examinations which other children would have sat at an earlier <Col N="66"/>age. I am not sure if that situation has arisen but it is a cause of concern.</P>
      <P>We all know these post-primary pupils require the support of specialist teachers. The teachers cannot be employed permanently with the result that the pupils deal continually with a changing group of part-time teachers, who are usually recruited through the local VEC. I understand that in a small number of schools, such teachers are appointed on a more permanent basis. That is the way to address this matter and I ask the Minister to respond positively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to clarify some of the issues raised by the Senator. This special school caters for pupils with a mild general learning disability and also has a special class for pupils with autism. I can confirm that the school currently has the services of one principal and 16 class teachers. The school also has an allocation of two full-time temporary posts.</P>
      <P>One of the post holders provides outreach support while the second provides for specialist subjects at post-primary level such as art, woodwork and home economics. In addition, the Department of Education and Science provides 2,280 co-operation hours to the City of Limerick VEC to support students in the Catherine McAuley school. Co-operation arrangements with institutions are long-standing arrangements under which VECs provide teaching services to institutions as part of the VEC remit to provide for continuing education in their areas.</P>
      <P>Special schools generally cater for pupils from four to 18 years old. Many special schools, including the Catherine McAuley school, offer the junior certificate school programme, the junior certificate, the leaving certificate applied, and Further Education and Training Awards Council, FETAC, programmes for their special needs students at post-primary level. The Department of Education and Science sanctions teaching hours to these schools to facilitate provision of these programmes.</P>
      <P>The Department proposes to carry out a comprehensive review of all special schools in the country. The Minister will ask her Department in consultation with the National Council for Special Education and other partners to consider how they can optimise the role and potential of special schools.</P>
      <P>The Department believes that sufficient staffing support is given to the school in question to enable it to provide a broad curriculum for its students. I hope this clarifies the position and I thank the Senator for raising the matter with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I do not disagree with any of it. I look forward to hearing what is said about the review. However, I was careful not to argue about the <Col N="67"/>number of teachers available to the school. This is not the problem. The staffing support, in terms of its hours, is sufficient. The problem is that the teachers are all changing while these children need stability. They build relationships, which is where the difficulty lies. The Acting Chairman, Senator Kitt, will appreciate this as like myself, he has an educational background.</P>
      <P>This could be done for a small amount of money as it is the difference between employing someone on a part-time basis as opposed to permanently. It would be somewhat, but not a great deal, more expensive. One could still carry this <Col N="68"/>out in such a way that a number of schools were covered and the people involved could be assigned to a panel or something similar. However, the teachers would then have security of tenure and would build up relationships with the schools and the other staff. This is why I am asking that it be done. There are three or four different ways to do it. I will ask the school to make a representation as to how it might best be done and copy it to the Minister for Education and Science. I ask that its representation be taken into consideration in the proposed review.</P>
