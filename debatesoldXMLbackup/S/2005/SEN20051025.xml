	<P>I have received notice from Senator Browne that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to indicate the steps that are being undertaken to honour her commitment made in July 2005 to provide additional capital funding to St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital, Kilkenny.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Bannon of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to give an update as to when she proposes to establish the regional health forums, engaging locally elected members.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Finucane of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to restore the grant of 90% of the cost under the scheme of community support for older people as the reduction of the grant to &euro;300 is causing an undue financial burden on old age pensioners, and if he would create an emergency fund to be made available for security alarms to be fitted when the urgent need arises.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>Many years ago I attended a European conference accompanied by the late former Deputy Liam Lawlor and many others. On that occasion I discovered what a larger than life character Liam was and what a sense of humour he had. In all the years since, when I met him that sense of humour never deserted him, despite his being involved in tribunals. It is with a certain sense of sadness today that we all reflect on how he died tragically thousands of miles away. I extend the sympathies of my party to his wife Hazel and family.</P>
      <P>In that context, last weekend was a very bad weekend for a certain section of the media. Most of us were disgusted and appalled at the type of media frenzy that seemed to descend on certain people regarding the facts surrounding the case. In the past there have been many approaches to this House from the media to relax the libel laws. Reflecting on the weekend, I compliment the maturity of RTE. Even though some in the House criticised RTE last week, it did not enter into that type of media frenzy and did not speculate on the events surrounding Liam&rsquo;s sad death. While representatives of the newspaper in question have apologised, much damage has been done. I very much regret that in a situation like this people do not empathise with the people affected by such tragedy &mdash; the victims have wives and families in many cases. Whereas all of us entering into political life accept that in the context of the &ldquo;slings and arrows of outrageous fortune&rdquo; Shakespeare described we perhaps suffer at times from unfair criticism, we all try to protect our wives and families from this type of unfair criticism. I very much regret what happened over the weekend. It is unfortunate.</P>
      <P>We know what is happening within the media. There seems to be extreme competition between the tabloids and broadsheets. If we are going down the road the media in England have gone down over many years, I seriously regret it. There are probably certain pressures applying now to establish a press council. My party would support <Col N="807"/>the establishment of an independent press council.</P>
      <P>Over the weekend it was not right for Mr. Flood, as the ex-chairman of the tribunal&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator was going fine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>All right, I shall leave out that part. I abhor what happened over the weekend. It was extremely unfortunate, it was terribly wrong and no man deserved that type of publicity. We all know the defamation laws do not apply if a person dies but in this case a terrible injustice has been done to his family. I am appalled at what happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I agree with every word spoken by Senator Finucane. On my way home on Saturday night I called into a shop to get the Sunday newspapers. I thought I had seen everything in newspapers but I did not believe the headline when I saw it. I actually thought it was a magazine sending up the <i>Sunday Independent</i>. I just could not believe it. I looked at it, but did not buy it. I found it nauseating. My first thought was not whether it was true or otherwise, but how the family would be hit by it. My second thought was to wonder where standards of journalism had gone and my third was to do with the libel laws. The central character is dead and the other person is not a resident, so neither of them has any comeback. We need to look at this issue and give some teeth in this area.</P>
      <P>There is only one way to deal with this matter and that is through punitive measures. There is no way any action will be taken by proprietors against newspapers making money, as long as they continue making money. The way to deal with this is the same as with the licensing laws. A publication found in contravention of the regulations should be closed down for a period or certain number of publications. It should be made feel the pain. This is the only threat that will work.</P>
      <P>I agree with the point made by many, including the Taoiseach, that trying to find the lowest common denominator of standards in order to sell newspapers is a race to the bottom. I have seen other examples of this. Recently, I saw a photograph of my brother-in-law on the front page of a newspaper giving the fingers to his community. He swears he was never in such a pose but that the photograph was doctored. This goes on all the time and the only recourse people have is to take a case, which is expensive, time-consuming, takes place long after the event and allows every aspect of people&rsquo;s private lives to be raked over the coals for the entertainment of the nation. It is undemocratic and wrong that people&rsquo;s characters can be taken away in this manner. Senator Norris <Col N="808"/>has said this many times and is proven right again on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>As a Lucan-based representative I express my sympathy to Liam Lawlor&rsquo;s wife and his children on their sad loss. Mr. Lawlor was a very courteous and likeable person to me and other public representatives. I have often come across constituents on whose behalf he dealt with an issue and who found him very efficient. He had a reputation of being a hard worker in the constituency.</P>
      <P>That said, following his death it is time for a substantial review and proper scrutiny of his political career, the good and the bad, because he was a major figure in politics over the past 30 years. As a local representative I crossed swords with him over the years or did not agree with decisions he took with regard to planning issues. It is important for the future of politics that we examine fully the background to those decisions.</P>
      <P>The newspaper articles, particularly the one I saw first, disgusted me. I happened to be in Ballina on Sunday and saw the <i>Sunday Independent</i>, but similar stories were carried in other newspapers. The story reported distracted from what we need to do in terms of examining the political career of Liam Lawlor. I found the story offensive, even before we were made aware of the true facts, as did anyone I spoke to on the day. It was offensive, inappropriate and hurtful to the family and friends of Liam Lawlor. It was degrading to the dignity of those who died in the accident and to the survivor. I agree it hit a new low in terms of journalism standards in the country.</P>
      <P>That type of story is not the norm in our media, which is one of the reasons the public was so outraged by it. We expect more from our newspapers. That said, this type of sensationalist journalism is becoming more of a feature of our media, something that needs to be addressed. I agree with calls for a press council. It is important that the Minister bring forward the legislation in this regard as soon as possible. The Minister is not seeking to bring forward legislation because of this story; it has been planned for some time. The Law Reform Commission produced a report on this issue many years ago. The Minister spoke about his plans in this House as recently as February 2005 but it is time for action. The Minister should publish the Bill now and engage in substantial consultation with all interested parties, including the media. The Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights could be used as the vehicle for this consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with others in extending my sympathy to Hazel Lawlor and the members of the Lawlor family on the untimely and tragic death of former Deputy, Liam Lawlor. Those of us who had battles with Mr. Lawlor in the past <Col N="809"/>always found him to be very good company and a man of great humour who was very easy to relate to, irrespective of any other defects in his personality.</P>
      <P>Some of the coverage of his death in the Sunday newspapers was outrageous. Senator Tuffy is correct in saying that the particular story in question should not have been published, irrespective of whether it was true. Any of us who had just lost a loved one would have enough to deal with without having to deal with the additional trauma caused by such a story. There was an enormous lapse in basic standards of journalism. I spent a considerable portion of my working life in journalism and one of its basic principles is that journalists check their stories. Excuses have now been made to the effect that the situation was confused and the coverage of the story was rushed. These are not acceptable excuses; they are unacceptable lapses from basic standards of good journalism.</P>
      <P>It is slightly tiresome to hear journalists lecture politicians, clergy, doctors, lawyers and every other group in society on what their standards should be and how they should be accountable week after week when these same standards do not apply to journalists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot understand this double standard and it is time that these lapses were tackled. I welcome the statement by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that he will introduce a statutory press council and look forward to the early resolution of this matter.</P>
      <P>I do not disagree with the comments made by Senator O&rsquo;Toole but there is something more that can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>It relates to circulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>It all comes down to the circulation wars between newspapers and the desire to make money. I stopped buying the <i>Sunday Independent</i> at one point because of a particularly offensive article in it about people with disabilities but, unfortunately, I began buying it again. The best sanction that could be taken against a newspaper is to stop buying it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I extend my sympathy to the family of the late Liam Lawlor. It is recognised that 95% of Irish journalists are honest and decent people who are very annoyed by some of the press coverage of Mr. Lawlor&rsquo;s death. It is unfortunate that we must establish an independent press council to deal with a few rotten apples. The majority of journalists I have spoken to were as appalled by the stories that appeared <Col N="810"/>in a particular newspaper last weekend as we were.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Education and Science to come to the House to debate the unfair discrimination that exists in the primary school sector. An example of this discrimination can been seen in the enrolment figures for gaelscoileanna as opposed to those for ordinary national schools. The achievement of the same pupil-teacher ratio in all schools should be a priority for the Government. Both these types of school do an equally good job of educating our future citizens and it is unfair that discrimination exists in this area. The Minister should explain to this House how we can uphold unequal arrangements in our schools in this era of equal opportunities. This issue needs to be addressed and, hopefully, the Minister can come to the House to explain what she intends to do in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon"><NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on responding so quickly by stating that he would introduce the heads of a Bill regarding a press council following the shocking coverage of the last hours of the late Liam Lawlor on Saturday night. I bought the newspaper in question at the Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheis, got through the first few lines and then returned it and asked for a refund. I will never again buy this newspaper. As most people said, it was a shocking piece of journalism. One can only imagine the horror of Mr. Lawlor&rsquo;s young son receiving the news of his father&rsquo;s death and then hearing a story that he was cruising the red light district in Moscow with a teenage prostitute &mdash; a story without a scintilla of truth. It was horrific. It was not even bad journalism &mdash; it was really evil.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I am glad of one thing &mdash; they tried often to get him in real life, but he was too tough and he retaliated in his final days. He won the final battle with the media as well. I suggest to those who wrote the articles in question that they should go home and look at their own families this evening, and ask themselves whether they would write about them in the way they wrote about the Lawlor family. May God forgive them for the shocking and terrible cruelty they have visited upon a widow and her children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>When I first heard about the stories which were published following the death of Mr. Liam Lawlor, my thoughts were about how I would feel if my wife had to go through the same thing. My heart goes out to Mrs. Hazel Lawlor and the family of the late Mr. Lawlor. Not only have they lost a husband and father, they have had to deal with the publication of these outrageous stories. It is even worse than that, however, because I am not happy with what has been called an apology.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="811"/>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Neither am I.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The word &ldquo;inaccuracy&rdquo; was used twice in the supposed apology. Can one use the word &ldquo;inaccuracy&rdquo; to compare what really happened with what the newspapers in question blatantly proposed and shouted from the rooftops? I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole, who spoke about the establishment of a statutory press council as a way of getting something done in this regard. Senator Dardis suggested something else we can do. It is not just a question of not buying certain newspapers. I recall that we were all upset about a story on the Paralympic Games some years ago. The reporter who wrote the story resigned within days of its publication. Advertisers threatened to withdraw their business from the newspaper in question if it did not dismiss the reporter. It seems to me that the power to damage circulation does not just rest with those who buy newspapers &mdash; it is also in the hands of advertisers. I did not read Sunday&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Observer</i>, which has not yet got around to making an apology, but I gather that it contained a report that was much worse than the stories in Irish newspapers. Not only it is in our hands as legislators to establish a statutory press council, but it is also in our hands as citizens and advertisers to ensure that action of the form I have mentioned is taken.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed to hear that the Taoiseach has proposed that we will have military parades once again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I regard myself as a Nationalist, a republican and a believer in Irish independence. However, I do not believe that has to correspond with militarism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>It reminds me of what we see in North Korea and what we used to see in the Soviet Union. I believe it is the wrong way to go. It will cost votes, rather than gain them. If it is intended as a vote-getting exercise, a rethink is needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I too would like to express my sympathy to the family of the late Mr. Liam Lawlor. I knew him better as a hurler and I had great regard for his abilities in that area. He was always very courteous and nice to me. I have an interest to declare as a director of Independent Newspapers. While today is not a very good day to be a director of Independent Newspapers in this House, Sunday was a worse day. I first heard the news of Mr. Lawlor&rsquo;s death on the BBC World Service to which, as an insomniac, I sometimes listen during the night. That service reported the story substantially as it was later <Col N="812"/>carried by other media outlets. I remember saying at the time &ldquo;My God, they did not have to drag that in, did they?&rdquo;. When I bought my Sunday newspaper, my blood ran cold.</P>
      <P>I will not defend the indefensible. I will not disagree with what has been said by other Senators. A fairly full and unqualified apology has been published in today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Independent</i>. The matter is being taken very seriously. An internal inquiry into the publication of the story is ongoing. First, the story was factually wrong. Second, even if it had been factually right, it was wrong in its treatment in every other way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon"><NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It was insensitive, intrusive, lacking in compassion and unfair. From all those perspectives, it was wrong. The editor, I presume, will answer for that in his next issue. However, the damage has been done. It is an enormous own goal, which we all recognise.</P>
      <P>I have been working for some time with a group in the industry on the question of a statutory press council or a fully independent press council which would be recognised in statute and which would develop codes of ethics and codes of privacy to deal with this sort of issue. We would all welcome a press council. I can only join with other Members in deploring what I regard as a lapse in the standards of good journalism and journalistic ethics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I never met the late Liam Lawlor but believe he was a very jovial person among his colleagues. I was shocked when I opened the <i>Sunday Independent</i> on Sunday last. As Senator Tuffy stated, even if the story was true, it was still inappropriate. Reference was made to circulation and what happened with regard to <i>The Sun</i> newspaper in Liverpool, when readers boycotted it. Independent Newspapers has changed Governments in this country through its editorials. Just as politicians have ethics, newspaper editors and journalists should also have ethics.</P>
      <P>I am a newsagent and stock many newspaper titles. I ask what the readership of newspapers is doing in this regard. It seems we cannot get enough of this kind of journalism. We should ask ourselves whether we are prepared to boycott newspapers. Unfortunately, the newspapers feed readers what they want. It is time somebody called a halt. We can pontificate in this House but I have no doubt that readers will return to buying these newspapers. We should ask ourselves what we want in life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Eight Members are offering but fewer than ten minutes remain on the Order of Business. While I realise Senators are anxious to elaborate, I ask that they be brief. No more <Col N="813"/>Senators should offer apart from the eight to whom I referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KieranPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. K. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>It was with deep sadness that I learned of the tragic death of Liam Lawlor at the weekend. Liam Lawlor had strong contacts with my county of Laois. His late mother came from my village of Donaghmore and his father came from the village of Pike of Rushall, outside Borris-in-Ossory. His uncle Paddy and his first cousin still live in the area.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The people of my parish of Rathdowney in south County Laois and the people of County Laois in general are disgusted with the scandalous and scurrilous behaviour of the media over the weekend. If any Member of this House acted in the same way, he or she would have been chased out of office yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KieranPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. K. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I call on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to bring legislation to the House to safeguard innocent people and their families. I offer my sympathies to Hazel and her family, Paddy and all the relatives of the Lawlor family. The Taoiseach stated yesterday that it is a race to the bottom. As far as I am concerned, we are at the bottom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with many speakers with regard to the treatment of the late Mr. Lawlor. What has happened is not that we have departed from standards but that we have met the standards of the worst British tabloids. We have been going in that direction for years and I have referred to it in the past. However, politicians were reluctant to take up this issue because they did not want to confront the press. I remember the lickspittling from politicians when a series of meetings with newspaper editors were held in the Oireachtas. Now, perhaps, we have learned our lesson and are prepared to be a little tougher. The <i>Sunday Independent</i> is a very mixed newspaper which contains some good articles. However, I always think of the character in <i>The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i>, Mr. Facing-Both-Ways, who always tried to have it both ways. On the front page of Sunday&rsquo;s edition of the newspaper, there was a rather sentimental, schmaltzy piece by Barry Egan in which he recounted how Liam Lawlor once loaned him an umbrella. In addition to keeping Mr. Egan dry, this act apparently covered a multitude of sins. At the end of the article Barry Egan wrote, &ldquo;Perhaps those who savaged him when he was alive will be kinder to him now he&rsquo;s dead&rdquo;. This was just under the headline that misinformed people that Mr. Lawlor had been killed in a red light district in the company of a teenage prostitute. What about the rights of that woman, who I understand is 36 years of age? She has been traduced by this news<Col N="814"/>paper. Let us have a press council that some Members have been demanding for a long time. Let us have attitudes towards privacy expressed in law because people, irrespective of whether they are politicians, are entitled to be treated with decency in terms of their private lives.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Scandals give rise to much hypocrisy and discontent and strange people want to get in on the act. I heard one individual say that the newspapers should give &euro;1 million to the Lawlor family. What rubbish. Liam Lawlor was not a saint and there is no reason to give anyone &euro;1 million. There is, however, a need for decent attitudes.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn referred to the Easter Rising commemoration. I was appalled by the Taoiseach&rsquo;s remarks in Killarney on the resurrection of the military parade. This is treating the voters with contempt. It openly suggests going into competition with Sinn F&eacute;in. Now that it has got rid of its guns, Fianna F&aacute;il will show it has bigger ones. This infantilism does no good. Let Fianna F&aacute;il accentuate the positive aspects of its policy rather than running around attempting to mimic the bully boys of Sinn F&eacute;in. I remember 1966 and how unpleasant it was for people who were made to feel outside the box by the official republican&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I think the Senator has adequately made his point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is blasphemous to have the event on Easter Sunday, which is about the resurrection of Jesus Christ and not the insurrection of Padraig Pearse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">What we have discussed most of this afternoon is an abuse of power at its most extreme. I cannot understand how any human being, with a modicum of sensibility, could deliberately inflict such hurt and torture on a vulnerable family. Is the media saying it has different standards from those it demands from <Col N="815"/>people, particularly those in public life? If it claims it is not exercising different standards, the editor of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> must seriously consider his position. If he does not, the credibility of the media at large will be at stake. Any Minister who abused power to the extent the <i>Sunday Independent</i> has, would have his or her resignation demanded immediately.</P>
      <P Just="Left">On many occasions I have raised questions about the media. The NUJ once wrote to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges complaining about me. The letter, in turn, had to be circulated to every member. Unfortunately for the NUJ, it got it wrong and apologised. If the NUJ is so sensitive about comments made in the Chamber, which were never going to be published, how does it feel about the particular case we are discussing? If we do not have resignations, then all the apologies are empty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>In the past, the freedom of the press meant people had the freedom to read what was true. Nowadays, the freedom of the press appears to be about putting anything into circulation which will improve the figures for a newspaper&rsquo;s sales. I share the concerns about what was said of Liam Lawlor. However, an apology is owed to the young Ukrainian woman involved. This point has not been made. She has a professional life to pursue and I ask the Leader to let it be known that the Seanad considers the newpapers to be remiss in not making an apology to her as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo the messages of sympathy to the Lawlor family. Liam Lawlor was active in politics for 20 years, although not as an office holder. He did many good things and performed valuable services notwithstanding what is under discussion in the tribunals. I will refrain from commenting directly on what was written in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> last week but proprietors and boards of management have a general responsibility for what appears in their newspapers. It is right for journalists and newspapers to point out and highlight abuses of power when they occur on the part of governments or politicians but we cannot be afraid of them, no matter how rich or powerful, if they abuse their considerable power. To borrow a phrase, I suggest there should be no more appeasement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I extend my sympathy to Hazel and members of Liam Lawlor&rsquo;s family. I knew Liam for many years, having served with him on the old Dublin County Council. What happened last Sunday was hurtful and it made me cry to think of the effect on his family. The media have reached an all-time low and have debased the profession of journalism. They have destroyed good people. In the past they have destroyed many politicians and people in high places. This <Col N="816"/>time somebody in the media must be destroyed, in terms of accountability, for what they did last Sunday. Words do not mean anything in this case as the hurt is too deep. If the journalists&rsquo; main objective was to sell papers they have cost their profession the respect of the whole nation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There is a saying that the pen is mightier than the sword. In this case the pen was used as a sword and thrust into the open wound of the grief and tragedy of the Lawlor family. It is journalism of the sewer. When I came into this Chamber in 1997 the former Senator Willie Farrell repeatedly called for a press council. Some weeks ago Senator Mansergh and I talked about a story in a sister newspaper about councillors and their quest for a pension. A journalist submitted a piece to the <i>Irish Independent</i> balancing the points made in the original article. Was it published? No. If the truth gets in the way of a story the story wins every time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
	<P>I associate myself with the expressions of sympathy with the wife and family of Liam Lawlor. I knew Liam for quite some time. I met him on the hurling field where I hurled against him. I always counted him a hard but fair man whether it was in politics or on the hurling field. One wonders what lies ahead for the reporter involved. The editor comes from a family in my own county with a long tradition in journalism. I have always seen that family as being honest and decent in the field of journalism. Senator Phelan mentioned &ldquo;a race to the bottom&rdquo; and journalism has sunk to the bottom in this instance. I hope that, assuming that rules exist within the NUJ, someone will be suspended from that newspaper. If this does not happen, the union should disband immediately. It is a sad day for journalism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The acting leader of the Opposition, Senator Finucane, paid tribute to Liam Lawlor, as he knew him over the years. He mentioned in particular his experience of Mr.<?oasys _jy?>Lawlor&rsquo;s personality and humour. The Senator stated that last weekend was a bad weekend for certain sections of the media but that RTE exhibited maturity in not entering the arena of scandal mongering. Even prior to this incident, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, had promised legislation on the establishment of a press council. He will hasten this legislation now, and I call on the Minister to bring it to this House first, as he is wont to do with many Bills.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole agreed with Senator Finucane and argued that the newspaper in question could be taken off the market as punishment. We could just stop buying it. We are a small number of people, but if people have strong feelings on the issue, such a boycott should occur. I agree with <Col N="817"/>Senator Tuffy&rsquo;s statements on the news story, and even if every word of the horrible report in question was true, it should never have been printed.</P>

	<P>I am just stating what occurred on Sunday. The newspaper&rsquo;s report was absolutely accurate, down to describing the occupation of the woman in question as a legal secretary and her age. The report came from a <i>Daily Mail</i> correspondent in Moscow. The statement that the Lawlor family could not be contacted was untrue. The Taoiseach easily made direct contact with the widow of Mr. Lawlor. These newspapers did not try as they wanted a salacious story to be published.</P>

	<P>I am entitled to state what I read, and we have already heard from Senator Norris. Senator Tuffy finished by stating the need for appropriate legislation as soon as possible. Senator Dardis expressed his sympathy to the Lawlor family. I could assume this sympathy from all Senators, but those who spoke made points in varying degrees of intensity and I wish to acknowledge this. Senator Dardis stated that the newspaper reports were a lapse in the basic standards of good journalism.</P>
      <P>Senator Bannon argued that 95% of journalists are decent people, and there is no doubt about this. He stated that the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, should rectify an inequality in the pupil-teacher ratio in gaelscoileanna compared to the pupil-teacher ratios in ordinary primary schools. Senator Lydon labelled the reports in the Sunday newspapers as shocking and evil pieces of journalism. He pointed out how anybody&rsquo;s family would feel if such a report was published. I do not know how Mr. Lawlor&rsquo;s <Col N="818"/>widow coped with the incident and the reports, and I am sure she is under medical care. Can one imagine how she reacted on seeing a large headline in black print with three sub-headings underneath, each a massive lie?</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn mentioned the family experiencing loss followed by outrage. I agree with his statements on the apologies, which contained statements on inaccuracies when the entire report was a flagrant abuse. Last night, a female editor of another newspaper which had followed the lead appeared on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo;. She was quite complacent and content with her apology. I could not believe it.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn was disappointed at the idea of a military parade. While he claimed it was for electoral gain, that is not correct. Our Army is for peacekeeping.</P>

	<P>Our Army is not for war. The Constitution refers to &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann, which is the properly constituted Army of the Republic of Ireland. It is incorrect to suggest that the Taoiseach would make this proposal for the sake of votes or that it would display military might as though it was ready to go off to fight. We have a peacekeeping Army. I am disappointed that the Senator took that view. The Taoiseach meant that it is a special event and I am sure it will be welcomed by everyone, but we must wait to see.</P>
      <P>Senator Maurice Hayes expressed his sympathy with the Lawlor family. He suggested that Members should work on the idea of an independent press council and that the legislation should be brought before the Seanad. Senator Kieran Phelan&rsquo;s reference to Liam Lawlor&rsquo;s County Laois connection was interesting and I thank him for mentioning it.</P>
      <P>Senator Feighan, who, among other things is a newsagent, was shocked last Sunday, as were all Members. He asked whether Members were prepared to boycott particular newspapers. I do not believe that could be the case if all Members express shock and outrage in the House but then purchase them the following week.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris noted how the standards of the British tabloid newspapers have been reached and suggested that a press council be established. I hope so. He stated that he was outraged by the resurrection of the military parade. I speak for the Taoiseach and my party in this House and I am proud that this step will be taken. I am proud of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann, which is the constitutionally established Army of the Republic of Ireland.</P>

	<P>I have summarised Senator<?oasys _jy?>Norris&rsquo;s contribution.</P>
      <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; called for the resignation of the editor of <i>The Sunday Independent</i>. Senator Henry, along with all Members, had concerns for the woman in question who was earning her living as a professional woman and rearing her family. She has been called names. While Members do not know this young Ukrainian woman, we know enough to be sure she was about her proper professional duties. She has not received any apologies, such as they are. Senator Mansergh noted that directors, boards of management and owners of newspapers have responsibilities, no matter how powerful they appear to be. He stated that they should be aware of how Members feel about these matters. I agree with him.</P>
      <P>While Senator Maurice Hayes quite correctly declared his interest as a director of Independent Newspapers, he disassociated himself from what has happened and offered his sympathy to the Lawlor family. I agree with him. Senator Mansergh made the point that there should be no more appeasement of journalists and newspapers. He is correct. He noted that the profession of journalism had been debased and the respect of the nation lost.</P>
      <P>Senator Glynn called what happened sewer journalism. He noted that a balancing article on councillors written by a journalist had been submitted but not printed. Senator Moylan spoke of his knowledge of and familiarity with the late Liam Lawlor on the hurling pitch. It was important that it was noted. Senator Ormonde expressed sympathy to the Lawlor family. She had served with Liam Lawlor as a member of the old Dublin County Council.</P>
      <P Just="Left">There will be time in a week or so to debate the tribunal and examine related matters but it is <Col N="820"/>an affront to Liam Lawlor&rsquo;s widow and children to be faced by this reporting. His widow faces a long, hard, empty and arid road but to face it with those headlines constantly in her mind will be an abhorrence. I thank the Members of this House from all sides who spoke so feelingly and memorably on this issue and the Cathaoirleach for allowing such a debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I will help myself and others recap. In welcoming the report, I was rebutting an outrageous attack by Senator Ross on the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Gallagher. There is no need to go over this ground other than to say that was not representative of most of the contributions in the House and certainly not in keeping with the recommendations of the report, which I wholeheartedly welcome. The move to a single stock management and the acknowledgement that the Department is the best body to determine how it should be done, such as through legislative improvements, management, reorganisation and the functions relating to the compensatory and set-aside schemes, are good ways forward. It is extremely important that this is not funded just by the Government or EU but that the wide variety of beneficiaries, including interest groups, conservation groups and the tourism industry, contribute to it.</P><Col N="821"/>
      <P>The joint committee recommended: &ldquo;The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government should prepare a report on the predation of seals on the salmon stocks.&rdquo; Senator Kenneally referred to this matter previously when he mentioned that we do not have all of the facts in this situation. Following on from the Minister of State, I said we cannot take knee-jerk reactions. I would be interested to see a study carried out on the effects of seals and cormorants, as their effects on smolts heading out to sea seem to be very serious according to my own research and the report&rsquo;s findings. The Minister of State&rsquo;s referral of the report to the National Salmon Commission is a positive move. It is the most representative relevant organisation and incorporates all aspects from the Loughs Agency, all elements within the industry, the conservation groups and F&aacute;ilte &Eacute;ireann.</P>
      <P>I wish to touch on a number of issues. First and perhaps most important, more needs to be done regarding the marine survival of salmon. All the relevant agencies, including the Marine Institute, other scientific groups, the fisheries boards and the relevant Government agencies must focus on the threats to the marine survival of salmon. From my inquiries into this issue, it appears this area does not receive enough attention and more needs to be done. We all agree stocks are becoming seriously depleted. We can see that is a serious issue from the report and from all the available statistics. However, no more pressure has been put on the fishery industry during the past five years than during the previous ten years. Various actions have been taken in that period, such as shortening the netting season, anglers&rsquo; quotas and tagging systems. In my view the Marine Institute must focus heavily on the survival of salmon.</P>
      <P>We must establish what happens to the smolts en route to the feeding grounds, what happens to them at the feeding grounds and what happens to salmon on return to Irish coastal waters other than problems encountered through drift netting. If we can get answers to these questions we would be in a position to find solutions to enhance the survival of salmon. We would achieve a great deal in pursuit of protecting the fishery industry as a whole.</P>
      <P>Protection of our inland waterways, lakes and rivers is essential. Water quality has deteriorated and the imminent water framework directive will assist in this matter. However, looking to the future and leading from the front in taking steps to improve water quality would further enhance the situation.</P>
      <P>Habitat degradation is caused by river erosion and other factors, such as irresponsible farming which was accused of causing habitat degradation in the past. The REP scheme has improved the situation in terms of appropriate fencing and the protection of river banks. More must be done and <Col N="822"/>more resources must be channelled to habitat development and restoration. This, in turn, will increase the production of juvenile salmon.</P>
      <P>I welcome this report. It goes a considerable way towards achieving the protection of the fishery industry, to which we all aspire. The only matter for debate is how to go about it. I pay tribute to Senator Kenneally, who was a member of the sub-committee that published this report, for the all-inclusive way in which it was done. The recommendations are extremely good. I welcome the fact that the Minister of State has referred it to the Nation Salmon Commission for its recommendations. I look forward to hearing those in due course as we take this matter further.</P>
      <P>On single stock management, I visited the Loughs Agency in Derry and toured both the Foyle and Carlingford operations. As we seek to improve the situation, perhaps we could look towards some of steps it took and seek to replicate some of its actions. I wish the Minister of State well in his endeavours on behalf of all of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Among such illustrious company and people with considerable expertise on all sides of the House, I feel like a small salmon because I am not as expert or as knowledgeable as my colleagues. I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I read with interest his contribution to the House last week and I congratulate the sub-committee on its report. Senators Kenneally, Dardis and Finucane were part of that committee. I congratulate them on their work to date on this issue. This has become a controversial issue of late. However, many people realise the issue has been live for the past 30 or 40 years.</P>
      <P>The time for action is now. Salmon stocks is the serious issue in this matter. The Minister of State will send the report to the National Salmon Commission. I understand a decision might not be made until 2007 or 2008. At some time the bullet must be bitten on this issue and a decision must be made sooner rather than later.</P>
      <P>The salmon fish is part of Irish culture. It is part of our mythology, literature, our story. If people think of a fish that is synonymous with Ireland, it is the salmon. We must frame policies to maximise the stocks throughout Ireland; this will ensure that the species continues to flourish and that tourism in coastal communities and throughout the country is nurtured and developed. No other fish goes to sea and returns to its birthplace to spawn. Given that marvellous story, which children particularly enjoy, we have a responsibility to ensure that the fish of Ireland remains strong in this country.</P>
      <P>In many parts of the country, angling tourism is underdeveloped. People who come to fish in Ireland come to catch. I sometimes spend part of the summer in Senator Daly&rsquo;s county, and given that he is a former Minister with direct responsibility for this matter he would be more expert <Col N="823"/>than I. Fish stock is an issue in many parts of County Clare and anglers no longer come to some parts of rural Ireland. If we are serious about developing fishing tourism and ignore the regional imbalances, we must be serious about protecting this and all fish species. Anglers who visit Ireland expect to catch fish. Recent reports on the quantity of species and volume of fish have been discouraging.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Kenneally for his expert advice on an issue relevant to this debate. A supermarket near my home recently claimed to sell wild salmon in the month of October. I am not sure how this could happen. Wild salmon is generally for sale in late spring and early summer. Unless these salmon showed particularly strong gill movement over September and October, getting into the River Liffey and beyond, which I doubt, there is a labelling issue here. I do not know how supermarkets and shops can continue to get away with labelling a product &ldquo;wild&rdquo; when it cannot be wild, because it is sold in October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>John West?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It was not in a tin. Labelling is important. I have also noticed the craze for organic salmon and often wonder how that can be sold as organic. Local authorities in County Dublin have launched a number of river stocking initiatives in recent years. This is welcome. Fishing is not just a gentrified activity for rural Ireland. It has been part of Dublin life for centuries. Pollution of the Liffey has curtailed the number of people who fish in Dublin. I ask the Minister of State to support the local authorities in Dublin who are trying at a preliminary level to restock the rivers and ensure that recreational fishing is enjoyed by everyone.</P>
      <P>Action must follow debate. We must make a decision on drift netting. This problem is not recent but has developed over the past 40 or 50 years. Some fishermen, if one counts the number of salmon they catch on a regular basis, take ten times the number of salmon for which they have a licence. The licence system cannot be policed for salmon. The Minister of State has yet to decide whether he supports a compulsory or voluntary buyout. Where an industry is depleting a sustainable commodity there are examples of the Government accepting the principles of a buyout and giving compensation. If we are serious about arresting the tide of salmon stock depletion, we must instigate a buyout. My party supports a voluntary buyout to ensure that the issue of salmon stocks is addressed. The tourism revenue from this could be considerable particularly in parts of rural Ireland. It would help develop angling tourism and ensure that many towns and small villages in rural Ireland, particularly those close to <Col N="824"/>rivers or potential fishing grounds, are developed to their full potential.</P>
      <P>I accept that this is a complicated issue. The Minister recently spoke about seals, which are the major predatory competition for salmon returning to our shores. As the Minister said, we must address that issue. I am not sure what one can do about global warming, the rising tides and the ongoing seal problem, but we can do something about drift netting licences and the amount permitted to be caught. Ireland is in a minority of EU countries that still permit drift netting. I ask the Minister of State to move on the recommendations of the report and I hope a decision is made sooner rather than later and is not left to drift, excuse the pun, to the National Salmon Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a classic case of a debate which is not being fully acknowledged on all sides. Two substantial interests are involved, one of which wants to close down the other. Much of the debate has been unbalanced. On the views expressed in the constituency in which I live, the report refers to the small snap net fishery in the south east. I do not think anyone is suggesting that it has a serious impact on salmon reaching the spawning grounds. As an inland county, such representations as I get are from anglers&rsquo; associations calling for drift netting to stop.</P>
      <P>As legislators we must take account of the national interest as well as the local interest. We are being asked to balance the interests of people, the coastal fishermen, who obtain a very substantial part of their livelihood from fishing and which has been an industry there for generations, against those of a leisure activity. Tourism is, of course, one of our most important industries and angling is part of the tourism product.</P>
      <P>Like the Minister, I walked past a few hundred demonstrators in Killarney at the weekend, including one or two from County Tipperary. Undoubtedly the populist approach is to treat it as an all or nothing, black or white issue but the Minister and the Government are within their rights to take a more nuanced view. Government must balance conflicting interests where each of those interests is legitimate. I believe the Minister is trying to do that, conscientiously and to the best of his ability.</P>
      <P>It is clear from the expert material that the quantity of salmon is not solely a function of drift net fishing. Indeed, it is quite possible that if it were to stop from next year, the salmon stocks might show little difference because of other factors involved, such as pollution and seals. In addition, the science on this, as on so many other things, is imperfect. We do not fully understand the causes for fluctuations in catches. I do not wish to deny that there is <i>prima facie</i> a problem. This has been addressed in recent years by reductions in drift netting and it might be neces<Col N="825"/>sary, depending on how matters develop, to seek further reductions.</P>
      <P>However, I believe the Minister has been a little isolated in this debate. It is easy for people living inland like me or in city constituencies to be on the side of the angels in this debate and simply write off places such as Donegal. In Donegal there is, perhaps, the highest unemployment rate in the country. In south-west Donegal, fisheries are a natural resource and the area is the capital of fishing. We do not have the right simply to make these people redundant.</P>
      <P>There should be balance in the debate. We should acknowledge that there are many technical factors involved and we should take the trouble to try to understand them. The politically popular choice is simply to get on one&rsquo;s soap box and pronounce a simplistic message but if we do that, we will not do justice to the people who live around our coasts and who depend on fisheries for a living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>A previous speaker from this side of the House was chastised for being partisan and political but I hope I will not. I hope what I have to say, which will be critical, will be seen to be founded on clear, scientific evidence and not as politically partisan. I have no reason to be partisan.</P>
      <P>To give an example, I was extraordinarily impressed by the contribution of Senator Dardis. He spoke from the Government benches with clarity, the real passion of a committed fisherman and with honesty. That was most important. He made clear what he believed should be the solution. With regard to Senator Mansergh&rsquo;s contribution, one listens to people of a party political persuasion, sometimes with a degree of amusement, when they talk about the easy political choice and what is most popular with voters, as if political parties on one side of the House were immune from this. Of course, they are not. There is a political element in this debate and I accept that.</P>
      <P>Senator Mansergh spoke about the rights of the fishermen but soon there will be no fish left anyway. That is the situation we face. The Minister said that the Government has accepted the scientific advice. That is too little, too late. According to Deputy Eamon Ryan, the Minister of State ignored scientific advice and issued a quota for 150,000 fish but only 100,000 were caught. There were insufficient numbers of fish. Salmon stocks are obviously reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should get his facts right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>According to <i>The Irish Times</i>, &ldquo;Minister of State Pat the Cope Gallagher has ignored developmental and scientific advice and appears determined that nothing will halt the <Col N="826"/>decline in salmon stocks...&rdquo;. It all comes down to ending drift netting. Of course, the fishermen must be compensated but there is no point pretending there will be a fishing industry if the practice is not ended. I will quote from another scientific paper: &ldquo;The TAC [total allowable catch] approach has, however, been serious compromised by two factors: the consistent failure of the Minister of the day to follow scientific advice in setting TACs....&rdquo;. This is not against a particular party or Minister but against all of them. They have all been afraid to grasp this nettle.</P>
      <P>On a personal basis I have a great fondness for the Minister and he is a decent man. However, he more or less admitted that he was massaging the situation a little. He told the House: &ldquo;Senators will be aware that I have already given a firm commitment to aligning the exploitation of salmon with scientific advice by 2007...&rdquo;. One sees shades of St. Augustine, asking the Lord to make him chaste but not just yet because there is fun to be had in the meantime. The reference to 2007 is a clear indication that the Minister is not taking the scientific advice at present. He said as much in his speech by saying we will adhere to the scientific advice in 2007, two years hence. What will the situation be then? That is the problem.</P>
      <P>There is another matter. I base my contribution on facts and the Minister is welcome to challenge them. According to the latest scientific advice the returns of spawning salmon in 2004 were below the levels required to meet their conservation limits in 14 of the 17 Irish fishery districts. Eight of the 14 districts were so far below their conservation limits that the scientific advice was that there was no exploitable surplus of salmon. In other words, there should have been no fishing in those areas. The source of this information is a paper entitled &ldquo;Provisional Catch Advice for 2005 from the Standing Scientific Committee of the National Salmon Commission to the Commission&rdquo;, dated 30 November 2004.</P>
      <P>I appreciate, as a practical politician, that there is a large scale drift net industry, particularly in the Donegal area. Let us be honest &mdash; that means there is political pressure. We should strengthen the Minister&rsquo;s hand in dealing with this political pressure by ensuring that all sides of the House recognise the crisis with fishing stocks. There is no question that there is a crisis. It is my understanding that most of the drift net fishermen recognise they are at the end of the line and will accept a compensation package.</P>
      <P>The Minister also said that he will not make any money available until and unless it is proved to be in the common good. What planet are we on? It has been proved time and again that it is in the common good to give these people a dignified exit from a situation where they are destroying the industry for everybody, not just for the commercial trawlers. It also affects angling, which is worth &euro;55 million to this country and <Col N="827"/>has spin-off effects for hotels, cottage industries, ghillies, boatmen, the people who supply bait and so forth. There is a strong economic argument in that regard but it is being killed. The Minister is well aware that the angling magazines are warning people away from Ireland because of the disastrous situation. We must tackle this issue directly and immediately; putting it off is useless.</P>
      <P>The Minister gave a party political speech in which he took on the spirit of the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, by saying, in effect, lots done, more to do. He stated that throughout the last year the Government has done this, that and the other, but that he fully accepts that there is more to be done. First, he has not done half enough in the past and, second, he can start immediately in addressing the situation regarding fish stocks. Those are comments on the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech. They are not made in a personal or partisan sense, I would say so to any Minister of any party in Government because we are facing a real crisis.</P>
      <P>One must look at the figures. Senator Mansergh stated that we do not really know and the scientific evidence is unclear. Not only is it not unclear, it is unanimous and totally unambiguous. If Senator Mansergh thinks it is the seals who are responsible for it, then I suggest he should do another doctorate in marine biology and marine science because we know that at least 70% of the salmon catch throughout the entire island comes from drift netting. That only leaves 30% to be distributed among everybody else, including the unfortunate seals who have been&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The Senator does not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a fairly good idea. Nothing justifies the slaughter of the seals, the way it was done against the law in Kerry. It is easy for the Minister to blame the seals for his inadequacy and finger a poor unfortunate dumb animal instead of doing what all the scientists state he should do. Over the period from 1970 to 2003, for example, the salmon catch has dropped to less than one quarter of its previous levels. That should set alarm bells ringing in even the dullest of minds and I am not suggesting for one second that the sharp person from Donegal has a dull mind. If there are some dull minds around, they need to be awoken.</P>
      <P>The clear scientific indications are that in 59% of our rivers no salmon should be taken by any means whatever. That is what the scientists are saying. A further 27% should have severe reductions applied. This is what we are being told and this is where we need action.</P>
      <P>If one looks at the question of growing salmon, many of the rivers that have a potential to produce juvenile salmon are on the south-east and east coasts. Here is a situation where they put drift nets right across the mouths of the rivers &mdash; it has been described to me as like having a drift net across the factory gates. The Minister of State is stopping production by allowing this method, which should be stopped.</P>

	<P>I will give Senator Kenneally all the details and documents. I would have no difficulty in doing so. They are facts in black and white. We know it. There is no point in denying it. Why is the Minister of State in denial? We know it perfectly well. We know that bass have been affected. One must look at the position in the case of cod. Were we not all on the same side when the people in Newfoundland were fighting against the Spanish and Portuguese? Why is he singing a different tune now? We should be trying to protect what is left of our stocks. We also know that, for example, there should be proper openness and transparency in the case of our own fishermen and in terms of resources. I am sure the Minister of State could confirm &mdash; or perhaps he will express disbelief as well &mdash; that at weekends, <Col N="829"/>and occasionally even in the evenings, there are no patrols.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no fishing either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>We have no regulations. I am delighted to hear that the salmon take the weekends off. That is another scientific fact from Fianna F&aacute;il. That is great. Do they have bank holidays off as well?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator realise&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I could not be bothered listening to that kind of tripe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has one minute remaining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That will be quite enough for me. There are other matters that should be addressed such as the lack of resources for monitoring this matter. I do not mean only monitoring our own people. If they are so innocent, why do they go without navigation lights when they are about this filthy, wasteful and profligate trade of monofilament and drift netting?</P>
      <P>Let us look at the foreign fishermen. We all know what they do and I presume the Minister of State knows also, the way they leave their nets in the sea to save time when they are going back with their catch. They catch every conceivable kind of fish and then just dump them overboard. They then cut the nets while repairing them and leave them at the bottom of the sea where they can entangle all kinds of different fish, and there is no regulation. I can read it here, that the practice of repairing these nets at sea, cutting away and dumping overboard the miles of non-<?oasys _jy?>bio-degradable netting retaining only the ropes, means many miles of netting ensnare fish uselessly, fish that are then dumped.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State knows that my interest in this is not frivolous. I have been raising this matter over the past four or five years at least. No. 22, motion No. 13 on the Order Paper, in my name and supported by the other Independents, calls for what the Minister of State should address as a programme &mdash; a total ban, starting now, on mono and multi-monofilament gill and drift nets; a ban on trawling within a six mile limit; no netting of any description within one mile of the low water mark; the creation of and an increase in the protection for nursery and spawning areas; closed seasons to protect spawning fish; angling groups like the IFSA to be involved in consultation processes; a full survey of all recreational anglers to determine our economic input; an increase in minimum sizes and a reduction of quotas for commercially exploited species; increased fishery protection resources; much tighter oversight of domestic and foreign vessels as regards landings, <Col N="830"/>gear, etc.; an end to the practices of marine dumping and aggregate extraction; and, an end to nuclear waste dumping. There are other issues, including the zebra mussels.</P>
      <P>It really surprises me to hear the occasional voice &mdash; it is not yet even the majority voice in Fianna F&aacute;il &mdash; chirruping up to protect the Spanish trawlers from my attacks. This is a national resource which we sold out during our negotiations with the European Union. At least let us protect that fragment which remains and nourish it back to some semblance of health.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the difficult position of the Minister of State. I encourage him to take a courageous stance. He should not keep postponing it. Otherwise he will be in an election in 2007. I ask him to act immediately. Why create this miasma about whether it is in the national good? The Minister of State knows it is in the national good. We all know it is in the national good to provide for decent fishermen so that we can continue with the salmon stocks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>

	<P>Long may it continue because he is theatre at its best and we really could learn a great deal from him in that regard. If I had my hat on, I would take it off to him.</P>
      <P>Answering his argument, which was eliciting the comments and reactions from this side of the House, is like trying to separate the wheat from the chaff; I will leave that to the Minister of State to do in his own forensic and efficient way, which I hope the Senator will stay to hear.</P>
      <P>I wish to repeat much of what has been stated already on salmon being a national asset. I approach this from a more rural perspective in that I come from a part of Ireland in the north west where for decades there has been under-<Col N="831"/>capitalisation and under-investment in adequate onshore facilities to encourage a greater number of anglers to come here. The Minister of State, coming from County Donegal, is aware of the importance of angling tourism. He made the point repeatedly in his speech and he does not need to be told by advisers, by a commission or by anybody else of the importance of angling tourism, particularly in my part of the country but not exclusively so. I share his view on buyouts and whether it makes economic sense to spend an estimated &euro;25 million, which I understand from third parties would be the cost, or is more effective to invest that money in angling tourism across the country. In the Leitrim lakeland district we have an abundance of lakes and fish but have traditionally had a problem of access and insufficient and inadequate onshore facilities for our visiting and resident anglers. I am pleased that in recent years, under the watch of the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, there has been an increase in funding in this regard, channelled through the various regional boards.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Local angling interests have expressed concern to me at possible moves towards the abolition or centralisation of the fisheries boards. That would not be a positive step. It would be a disadvantage, particularly to those of us living in Leitrim and those in the peripheral regions, primarily the west of Ireland, where there is a large lakeland environment. The Shannon Regional Fisheries Board and the Northern Regional Fisheries Board which each look after one half of County Leitrim have been doing a very good job. Will the Minister of State inform us whether there are plans or suggestions in the pipeline for centralisation of these boards? I am convinced the regional boards are a good idea. The Shannon Regional Fisheries Board has been circulating correspondence to its constituent members asking them to fight against this proposal.</P>
      <P>I agree with much of what has been said, despite the points made by Senator Norris. We accept this is a controversial issue. A group of parliamentarians from the Faroe Islands who made a submission to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs a few weeks ago said that their islands had never had a history of drift net fishing. They could not quite understand how we still had it here. Unlike many other Ministers who must acquaint themselves with the nuances and detail of their brief, the Minister of State comes from a fishing background and environment. He has made it clear, and I share his view, that any alignment of salmon stocks should be done on scientific advice. I am pleased he has requested the National Salmon Commission to examine the scientific dimension to this controversy and to report back to him by 2007. Some 359,002 wild salmon returned to our waters in 2004, including <Col N="832"/>191,579 spawners. Therefore, there is an abundance of salmon returning to Irish rivers.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I agree with the point made with regard to the dividing line between the importance of fishing for commercial purposes and the importance of angling tourism. I am prejudiced in this regard and come down in favour of angling tourism and those who participate in it, not only because of the value to the local economy but to the national economy also. The Minister is right when he says the trend across Europe is towards a reduction in angling. I am not sure why this is so. In the past decade people made repeated representations to me about the pollution levels on the upper River Shannon. Some photographs were sent to me showing the white foam appearing on the water in good traditional fishing areas around Rooskey and farther north. As a result of Government policy on this in recent years, the problem has dissipated. I pay tribute to people in the agricultural sector who have taken on their responsibility in this regard. However, the problem has not been totally eliminated and I suggest it is a contributory factor to the reduction in fish stocks available for angling tourism.</P>
      <P>There has certainly been a reduction in the number of angling tourists to my part of the world and the upper Shannon region. I am sure the Minister of State is aware of the problems in the angling tourism sector. Not only does the problem affect the Exchequer, it also has an adverse impact on the bed and breakfast places where anglers traditionally stayed. With the increase in the number of hotels, as a result of tax incentives introduced by the Government over the past ten years, there is now a reduction in the number of visitors using bed and breakfast establishments.</P>
      <P>A couple from England recently stated in a letter how much they enjoyed their time in Ireland and criticised those who referred to it as a rip-off country. The couple in question were pensioners and pointed out that in Ireland we do not pay council tax, we have free travel for the elderly and have cheaper hotels than in the United Kingdom. The writer wanted to know why people here were whingeing and whining about the country. I found the letter refreshing coming from people who had travelled around Ireland on holiday for the first time in approximately 15 years. The writer was not, therefore comparing with recent years.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The abolition of salmon drift net fishing is not the sole question. There are wider issues at both a macro and micro economic level. Real hardship is being experienced by people in the tourism sector. I hope the Minister of State will be guided by the scientific advice, but also by the needs of the people in his part of the country. I appreciate that he must look after the national interest, but as a Minister of State, a Deputy and a former MEP he has first-hand knowledge of the needs of the <Col N="833"/>tourism and fishery sectors in the north west and the west. I wish him well in his deliberations. I applaud him for consulting with those in the scientific community and on the setting up of the National Salmon Commission. He has also taken note of many of the recommendations in the report. These actions will hopefully feed into<?oasys _jy?>this debate and resolve the problem once and for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the report of the joint committee and the submissions made to it. I have listened with interest to the major part of this debate and the wide divergence of opinions expressed as to how we can tackle the problem.</P>
      <P>A number of weeks ago a deputation came to my clinic in Lismore representing angling, hotel and tourism interests in the area. The group made a professional presentation and outlined the decrease in salmon stocks, in particular in the Blackwater River, over the past number of years. The same is happening in most parts of the country. This affects businesses such as services to anglers, bed and breakfast establishments, and hotels. Businesses have had to let people go.</P>
      <P Just="Left">This is a major problem. Like the Minister of State, I believe our salmon stocks are a national asset that must be conserved and protected. No matter what side of the fence one is on in this debate, we all believe there must be more conservation and protection of salmon stocks.</P>
      <P>Pollution is a major problem in some rivers. Poaching, seals and cormorants have also been mentioned as causing a problem. There is no doubt, however, that drift netting is probably the greatest problem where salmon stocks are concerned. As previous speakers noted, my party favours a voluntary buyout or set-aside, which the Minister of State should consider at an early stage. As Senator Kenneally outlined, the vast majority of people in many areas, particularly in the south east, would avail of a voluntary cessation and buyout. This must be part of any solution to the problem.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that salmon fishing is worth &euro;55 million to the economy. The decline in anglers visiting Ireland from 54,000 in 1999 to 27,000 in 2004 must cause concern. It must pose a major problem for tourism interests in areas connected with angling around the country. The Minister of State mentioned that it is far more beneficial and economical to have fish caught by the rod rather than through drift netting. The livelihoods of people around the coast must be considered in any buyout, which is why Fine Gael believes any buyout should be voluntary. Telling people to stop all drift netting immediately would not be a sensible policy. We would make great strides in conservation with the reduction we would achieve if a voluntary buyout or set-aside were introduced.</P><Col N="834"/>
      <P>Previous speakers have alluded to the coverage of angling in Ireland in international magazines, about which I am concerned. <i>Trout and Salmon</i>, a UK angling magazine, called us international outlaws because of our attitude to salmon. Articles like these, which tell people there is no point in visiting Ireland because there are no fish, will not encourage people to visit this country. Some visitors from Germany told me recently they were here despite reading in magazines that there were no fish left in Ireland. They enjoyed their visit but caught very few fish. Anglers read these magazines and this type of negative information about Ireland will have a devastating effect on the number of anglers visiting the country.</P>
      <P>The Minister should immediately opt for a voluntary buyout. Most people regard waiting until 2007 to introduce a buyout as kicking to touch. What is the Government waiting for? We have had numerous reports on this issue and all it requires is a decision. The Government should not use science as a refuge in order to prevent the introduction of necessary measures. The sooner the Minister opts for the voluntary buyout and set-aside, the better it is for conservation, anglers and fishermen throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I extend my deepest sympathy to Mrs. Hazel Lawlor and her family on the tragic death of Liam Lawlor at the weekend. I also extend my sympathies to his brother, Noel Lawlor, with whom I canvassed in a by-election in Dundalk many years ago.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue and thank the committee for bringing the report before the House. I also thank Senator Dardis for preparing a very detailed and comprehensive report and compliment him on his speech here today. There have been so many reports on the salmon industry that it is almost impossible to keep track of them all. I recall receiving the report of the salmon review body when I was a Minister of State in 1987. This report set out what needed to be done in the area of conservation in a very comprehensive fashion. The report included a very detailed assessment of the measures taken in various countries, including the Faroe Islands and Canada, to deal with declining salmon stocks and I would recommend it to those interested in how these two countries dealt with the problem.</P>
      <P>Declining stocks of Atlantic salmon are a problem for many countries, not just Ireland. It is significant that there were very clear indications that netting in general and drift netting, in particular, did their fair share of damage to salmon stocks in all the countries with which discussions were held in the late 1980s. I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s remark at the outset of the debate that anyone here or abroad who feels that the complete abolition of salmon drift net fishing will save salmon <Col N="835"/>stocks is mistaken. There are other issues that are equally, if not more, relevant.</P>
      <P>The Annageeragh River in west Clare, which flows from Doolough Lake and into the sea near Quilty, is a very important salmon and brown and white trout fishing river. The river was not affected by the decline in white trout stocks over the last number of years and has attracted many anglers in the summer. However, it is being almost totally annihilated by a water treatment plant at Doolough Lake and the fact that the model of the culvert which allows the fish to escape into the catchment has been broken down for approximately one year. A fault at the water treatment plant led to thousands of salmon and white and brown trout being wiped out in the Annageeragh River. Nobody wishes to accept any responsibility for the broken culvert. The Shannon Regional Fisheries Board does not have the money or legal power to deal with the problem, the Office of Public Works does have the statutory authority to deal with it but claims it cannot do so because it is not on the list of arterial drainage rivers and the county council does not have the money to deal with it. Drift netting is not a factor in this affair but due to the neglect of the outlets and model of the intake to allow the escape of salmon into the catchment, the river is being systematically wiped out and will be gone in approximately three to four years time.</P>
      <P Just="Left">My father, John Daly, was the chief clerk and secretary to the Limerick Fishery Board, which is now the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board, from around 1929 to 1965. I worked with the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board and was brought up in a fisheries office. I was also a member of the Shannon Board of Conservators for a considerable number of years and examined some of its records over the weekend. I learned of a major debate on the abolition of drift netting and the fact that there were approximately 300 boats fishing for salmon off the north west from the minutes of a meeting of the Shannon fishery board in 1919. Those who attended the 1919 meeting were exercised by the upcoming motorisation of the fishing boats. In other words, the boats were about to be fitted with engines. When I had ministerial responsibility for fisheries in 1982 and 1987-88, I endeavoured to talk to the drift net fishermen. I regret to say that the fishermen in question showed no interest in any form of buyout or sell-out at that time.</P>
      <P>I have heard a representative of the Shannon netsmen on national and local radio in recent weeks, criticising the Minister and the Minister of State for their neglect of the salmon industry. He failed to tell the listeners that the 70 drift nets which have been on the River Shannon since the 1930s, when the Ardnacrusha project was completed, have been operating illegally for the last <Col N="836"/>30 or 40 years, including this year. The nets are not drift nets of the strict sense which are allowed, but fixed engines which are fixed by fishermen to take as much salmon as they possibly can. I appreciate that it is their business, but if they want to criticise our approach to the matter we are entitled to ask them where their responsibility lies. Given that they are operating what are described in the Fisheries Acts as &ldquo;illegal fixed engines&rdquo;, rather than &ldquo;drift nets&rdquo;, in the lower Shannon, from the mouth of the Shannon to Coonagh, it is no wonder that salmon stocks are in their current state.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I am conscious of the damage being done to salmon stocks by wildlife. It was proposed at the 1919 fisheries board meeting to which I referred to arm the approximately 1,000 people who were operating stake weirs on the River Shannon at that time, before the construction of Ardnacrusha, with guns so that they could control the river&rsquo;s seal population. At that time, the Shannon fishery board was also paying a bounty on otters, which can do irreparable and immeasurable damage to spawning beds in October and November. I have some sympathy for seals, which can damage catches when they get into nets, but I am not so sure about otters, which can annihilate spawning salmon when they get into spawning beds. I consider the activities of otters to be far more serious than the activities of seals.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It was also proposed at the important 1919 meeting of the fishery board to increase the bounty on mergansers to one shilling and 6 p and on cormorants to half a crown. The fishing industry on the River Shannon was thriving in 1919, when all our rivers had good salmon stocks. At the 1919 meeting, concerns were expressed about netting in the north west and the illegal activities of poachers, who are still rampant today. Those at the meeting spoke about the illegal activities of the operators of drift net fishermen who were fixing their nets to fixed engines, thereby doing immeasurable damage to stocks. Concerns were expressed about the effect on salmon stocks of the activities of otters, seals, mergansers, cormorants and other predators.</P>
      <P>I am worried about the damage being done by the forestry sector to spawning areas in the upper tributaries of our smaller rivers. I understand that Coillte has taken steps to deal with such problems, for example by prohibiting the planting of trees within a certain distance of spawning streams. I believe that the most significant damage is being done to salmon stocks in areas where spawning is carried out. Salmon can encounter difficulties when they try to escape into catchments and to overcome various obstacles. The most important aspect of the salmon fishing sector that needs to be safeguarded is the spawning area. We need to deal with that aspect effectively by ensuring that salmon can escape into catchments and that they receive protection when they <Col N="837"/>are spawning in catchments. In that way, we can reverse to a large extent the significant decline in salmon stocks over recent years.</P>
      <P>I disagree with the comments of Senator Cummins about the proposal to initiate a voluntary buyout scheme in respect of drift nets and draft nets. If such a voluntary scheme is introduced, some fishermen will leave the sector but the remaining fishermen will fish the additional stocks which will come into the catchment area. If one removes 50 drift nets from the River Shannon, the remaining 25 drift nets will reap the benefit of that. If there is to be a buyout, I strongly suggest to the Minister of State that it should be compulsory, so that all the drift nets and draft nets will be removed from our waterways. I would be prepared to allow the compulsory process to continue for a certain length of time. I do not think three years would be long enough. One would have to allow the scheme to continue for a longer period of time so that one could examine whether it is working.</P>
      <P>The drift net issue has to be dealt with. It would be unwise to think that salmon stocks can be miraculously saved by removing drift nets from the salmon fishing sector. A combination of issues needs to be dealt with. I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, has such great knowledge and experience of the fisheries sector. I gave him some training for a few years. I am confident that he will make the right decision when considering whether schemes should be put in place to remove drift and draft nets from the mouths of catchments. I suggest that all such nets should be removed, or none should be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to say a few words as part of this important debate. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, to the House. I recognise that he will have a difficult job in trying to resolve this issue. Ireland spends billions of euro each year, in the form of direct grant aid or tax incentives, for example, on trying to attract enterprise and industry. We need to ensure we protect our natural assets and resources, such as our salmon stocks, which help to create jobs and wealth.</P>
      <P>The Irish salmon, which is as old as the nation, is synonymous with this country. It continues to be one of our greatest resources, despite the pressure on it. Our tourism industry, which employs tens of thousands of people, is another of our great natural resources. Earlier this afternoon, I attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, which featured a presentation by our counterparts from Australia, who mentioned that some 125,000 Australian people visit Ireland every year. The Irish salmon is a magnetic attraction to the many tourists from Australia and other countries who come to this country to do some fishing on Irish rivers. We have an absolute economic duty to ensure that <Col N="838"/>our angling industry is maintained. Like the Minister of State, all Senators need to reflect on whether angling tourism is compatible with the drift net fishing sector. The report under discussion attempts to resolve this difficult matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Cummins and I are familiar with the important angling tradition on the River Blackwater. We have read many reports over the years about the decline in salmon stocks on the river, which is having a negative impact on tourism in the Blackwater Valley. As I am not an expert in this field, I cannot claim to know all the reasons for the pressure on salmon stocks. However, we cannot ignore the fact that drift netting is playing a major role in reducing salmon stocks on our rivers. Action must be taken. We must also recognise that many people are employed in the drift net industry. We cannot expect them to simply go away without an adequate level of compensation. I hope the Minister of State will give serious consideration to the recommendations in the report.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Daly&rsquo;s point in regard to a buyout, be it long-term, temporary or with a set-aside option. A voluntary buyout or set-aside scheme may not work satisfactorily because it will be taken up by those who are least successful in the industry. This happened when the possibility existed for farmers to sell their milk quotas in that it was not the large farmers who sold their quotas but the less economically developed ones. A voluntary scheme would be costly for the Department and the State to operate but would not produce results because the larger drift net fishermen would stay in business.</P>
      <P>If we see a buyout as a way out, it will have to be undertaken on a basis other than a voluntary one. We must bring all involved within the net, if Members will excuse the pun, but this will be costly. We cannot expect drift net fishermen to simply wind down operations. We must be prepared to invest funding in a proper, attractive scheme with a good financial package because, if it works and we help the conservation and further development of salmon stocks, it will produce significant benefits from a tourism and angling perspective.</P>
      <P>In my former constituency, I know people from the drift net community and those involved in angling. I appreciate that the issues involved are not simple ones. It is not easy to square a circle and, in this case, it cannot be done. However, while a difficult choice faces the Minister, we must put at the top of the policy agenda the need to conserve salmon stocks and allow them to flourish, and to ensure that the tens of thousands of domestic anglers and tourists who come to fish our waters continue to do so. The statistics highlight the large variation in value to the economy between a salmon caught by an angler and a salmon caught in nets. Given those figures alone, we know what we must do. It is a question of putting in place a fair system. The idea of the <Col N="839"/>system being introduced on a three or four-year trial basis should be considered.</P>
      <P>I concur with Senator Daly&rsquo;s point with regard to a voluntary versus a compulsory scheme. While we in this country do not like the word &ldquo;compulsory&rdquo;, a voluntary system will cost money but will not produce results. If we are in the business of spending money, we must implement a proper scheme and move towards a system which will remove the nets and allow salmon to be re-stocked in rivers, allow the angling industry to thrive and the tourism industry to recover and grow. That would be a big reward at the end of the line. However, there will be a significant cost element to compensation and the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, and the Minister for Finance will need to be willing to come up with the necessary funding. We cannot expect those in the drift net industry, who have been in the business for generations, to disappear without fair and equitable compensation. I hope the Minister will try to put a fair package in place.</P>
      <P>No matter how long this debate continues, there is only one question, namely, whether we will take tough measures to conserve salmon stocks. We must be willing to do so. It is one of our oldest and greatest natural resources and we must ensure it is available for coming generations, as it has been for all generations past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House for this important debate. As Senator Bradford stated, action needs to be taken with regard to salmon stocks. I listened to most of this debate. I was interested in the contribution of most speakers, particularly that of Senator Dardis, who made an impressive contribution. Senator Daly is correct to state that the removal of nets from river catchment areas is important and should be done immediately.</P>
      <P>I support our party position in regard to the voluntary buyout and set-aside option. Coming from a county which offers sea angling, drift netting and has some of the greatest fishing rivers and lakes in Europe, I have seen at first hand the damage to which Senator Dardis, who is a keen angler, referred.</P>
      <P>It is undoubtedly the case that anglers are no longer coming to Ireland. In some cases, Irish anglers are travelling to other countries in Europe and elsewhere to have the great pleasure of catching a salmon on a rod. This is disgraceful when one considers the river, lake and sea fishing available here.</P>
      <P>Having spoken to hoteliers and restauranteurs recently, it is clear wild salmon is almost a thing of the past. Restaurants can now only buy wild salmon from drift net fishermen. If drift net fishing finishes, no wild salmon will be available because the purchase of rod-caught salmon is not allowed. The Minister of State should examine <Col N="840"/>this issue. We need increased enforcement. Given proper enforcement, it might be possible for restaurants to buy fish from anglers who have caught salmon on a rod. Otherwise, we will never again have wild salmon on menus.</P>
      <P>The issue of access to lakes is important. In my county, access is very poor and it is hard to understand how boats get onto rivers or lakes &mdash; Lough Conn and Lough Cullin in particular. Grants should be made available through local authorities, the fisheries boards or the board of works. So many agencies and vested interests are involved, it is hard to know who is responsible for access to rivers and lakes, a matter which must be examined.</P>
      <P>There is also the issue of keeping lake levels at a certain point during the summer by temporarily removing weirs. I live close to the Castlebar lake and every year there is a constant hassle about putting the weir in place and taking it out even though it is not a large job for the local authority or fisheries board responsible. All Members agree action must be taken on salmon drift netting. The Fine Gael Party has argued for a voluntary buyout and set-aside scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I pay tribute to the sub-committee on salmon drift netting, draft netting and angling, under the chairmanship of Deputy O&rsquo;Flynn and represented by Senator Kenneally and others, for its report on salmon drift netting. I only wish it were a matter of simply finding the funding for compensatory measures to resolve this problem. If it was as simple as that, we would be living in utopia.</P>
      <P>However, as many Members pointed out, it is not as simple as that. One can get the impression little has been done when in fact much has been done over the last several years. Earlier this year at the end of a three year process, the scientists involved changed their methodology from a 50% risk assessment to 75% risk assessment, which resulted in these changes. Socio-economic factors were also taken into account. Leaving these aside, funding of X million euro, when it is decided, must be distributed in an equitable manner to all those involved by the National Salmon Commission, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, BIM or the fisheries boards. Some claim I favour the drift netters as there are so many of them in County Donegal. There are only 140 out of 800 as no one in Donegal, like the rest of the country, can survive solely on the income earned from drift netting. The activity is supplementing other income.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris suggested that Senator Mansergh, after he left the Chamber, should do another doctorate, this time in microbiology. All other Members made genuine contributions. As for Senator Norris, it would be hilarious if it was not so serious. He does not need to get a PhD himself on this matter but at least he should get <Col N="841"/>his facts right. To show how ludicrous his contribution was, he will tell me tomorrow how much salmon seals consume each year. It makes me remember on an occasion when salmon had escaped from a fish farm cage, an individual declared that we would not stop until every salmon was retrieved. This is going from the sublime to the ridiculous. Senator Norris&rsquo;s contribution was funny but this is a serious matter.</P>
      <P>It is said that I should take a courageous decision and ban salmon drift netting now. When the history of this matter is written, it will show that such a decision would be wrong. The National Salmon Commission is representative of all stakeholders. Last Saturday in Killarney, I met those representing the commercial sector. I discussed with them the necessity for balance and to recognise the important role played by the angling tourism sector. I, along with the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, received a letter from the Stop Salmon Drift Nets Now campaigners. When I explained the National Salmon Commission would examine it, I was told the commission was too balanced. We cannot discriminate positively or negatively. The commission must examine this matter. If I was to take the decision on a ban now, the criticism would be all the greater.</P>
      <P>In Galway next week, the chairman of the National Salmon Commission will meet representatives of the Stop Salmon Drift Nets Now group and the drift net association. This is the right approach to the issue. All representatives on the commission are serious about this and are anxious to examine all reports, including the one prepared by Senator Dardis. Some bodies claim they are not represented on the commission. Unfortunately there was not enough space for all. One cannot put the pint into the half pint bottle. However, those groups will have an opportunity to make their views known to the commission, either orally or in written submission.</P>
      <P>There is much talk about compensatory measures. However, this is not the responsibility of the State alone. Many of those who will benefit from a ban, such as those in private fisheries, have said they will make a contribution to the measures. It would be wrong of the Government alone to provide this funding. I have no hang-up on this issue. There are many in County Donegal who are anxious for the introduction of a buyout or set-aside scheme. Legally, it is not compulsory for the Government to provide one cent for a buyout. If a Minister believes such a measure must be introduced in the interests of conservation, he is entitled to do so. However, there are moral considerations in this. Whether one is an angler or a commercial fisherman, this is part of our heritage.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I am not carrying any baggage on this issue. As I said at my party&rsquo;s Ard-Fheis, the only baggage I have is that I am a Donegal man. Please God, I <Col N="842"/>will carry that until the end of my days. I want to be fair and all sides to be treated equitably. Compensatory measures must be financed by those who will benefit from a ban. I am not sure what percentage was stated would be paid by other interests. However, we must first establish what it will cost. As the custodians of the fisheries, we must ensure they are there for future generations.</P>
      <P>One Member suggested we may never have wild salmon on restaurant menus again. Many in the industry have produced farmed salmon that compares favourably with wild salmon. However, one should not replace the other. If we can work with scientists, we can have a sustainable fishery.</P>
      <P>Senator Daly pointed out that we are not concentrating much on the spawning grounds. We must also concentrate on poaching, pollution and seals. It has been intimated that I condoned what happened to seals in County Kerry last year when I actually condemned it.</P>
      <P>This is not the end of the issue of drift netting. We are coming towards a decision. I will not be the one standing in the way of expediting what is in the best interest of all involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the D&aacute;il. In accordance with Standing Order 103, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage. On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the D&aacute;il. This is looked upon as the report of the D&aacute;il amendments to the Seanad. The only matters, therefore, which may be discussed are the amendments made by the D&aacute;il. For Senators&rsquo; convenience, I have arranged for the printing and circulation of the amendments. Senators may speak only once on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Group one is the subject matter of amendments Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 12.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Adoptive Leave Bill 2004 was introduced in the Seanad over 12 months ago. A number of amendments were made during its passage through this House and I welcome the opportunity to return to the House to report on further amendments made to the Bill in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. A total of 11 Government amendments and one Opposition amendment were accepted on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.</P><Col N="843"/>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 12 were required to update the text of the Bill to take account of the Adoptive Leave Act 1995 (Extension of Periods of Leave) Order 2004 (SI 667/2004) made on 22 October 2004. This order implemented the two week increase in adoptive leave to 16 weeks as provided for in section 3 of the Bill. Effectively it implemented the increase almost 12 months earlier than would have been the case had we awaited enactment of the Bill. The increase in adoptive leave was consequent on the reduction in the compulsory period of pre-confinement maternity leave introduced by section 3 of the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Act 2004 and maintains consistency between the leave provisions for natural and adopting mothers from the time the child is born or placed in their care. The increase in adoptive leave and the reduction of the compulsory pre-confinement period of maternity leave mean that both natural and adopting mothers can now avail of up to 16 weeks leave with payment of a social welfare benefit from the time the child is born or placed in their care.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 12 revokes the 2001 and 2004 orders as the provision of both orders is incorporated into the Bill, making the legislation more transparent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill and the changes that are afforded to adoptive parents. There does not appear to be an option for a father to avail of this leave rather than a mother. Not to allow this option is a shortcoming and an opportunity missed by the Government. In the case of a natural birth it is right for a mother, having been through the pregnancy and given birth, to take the maternity leave. In the case of adoptive parents there is no reason a father, where there is one, should not be equally placed to avail of this leave. If a mother was self employed or was in receipt of a larger wage than the father it may be more convenient or suitable that the father avail of it. Has the Minister had time to reflect on the discussion in the D&aacute;il on this issue and will he address it now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>The point is not relevant to the amendments in group one so is not up for discussion at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Group two relates to attendance at pre-adoption classes and meetings and are the subject of amendments Nos. 4, 5 and 6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 7, subsection 11A(1) of the Bill as passed by the Seanad entitles employees time off to attend obligatory pre-adoption classes and meetings in accordance with regulations made by the Minister under subsection 11A (3). During the Bill&rsquo;s passage through the D&aacute;il it <Col N="844"/>became apparent that subsection 11A(3)(a) could be open to an interpretation contradictory to subsection 11A (1) to the effect of giving the Minister the power in regulations to reduce the entitlement by limiting the number of classes or meetings which the employee can attend. Consequently, amendment No. 5 removes subsection 11A(3)(<i>a</i>) for the avoidance of any doubt on the matter so that the Minister no longer has the power to limit this entitlement by regulation.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 6 also amends 11A(3) so that matters intended to be dealt with under regulations are brought into the Bill. This simplifies the legislation and has the further advantage of avoiding a delay of a number of months which would be required to draft and make separate regulations under section 7.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 4 is a technical amendment introduced as a consequence of amendments Nos. 5 and 6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Group three covers postponement of leave, the subject matter of amendment No. 7.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 7 amends subsection 9(2)(<i>d</i>) of the Bill on the date of commencement of proposed leave. This amendment was initially proposed by Senator Tuffy but was not accepted. However, an identical amendment was proposed by Deputy Moynihan-Cronin and, on reflection, I was happy to accept it at that point. The Bill as passed by the Seanad provides that postponed leave must be taken as one continuous period beginning not later than seven days after the child is discharged from hospital. The amendment allows the employee and employer the scope to agree on another date for the commencement of the postponed leave if they wish. The amended provision produces a greater degree of flexibility for the employee while allowing the employer some discretion in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this change. I remember the discussion we had in the Seanad and although the Minister did not accept the amendment then I am obliged that it was accepted in the D&aacute;il. It would have been better to accept it in this House. The fact that we had such a long discussion about it probably influenced the Minister in his final decision. I welcome the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Group four relates to the simplification of section 11, the subject matter of amendment No. 8.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Amendment No. 8 simplifies the text of section 11 of the Bill. The wording of the Bill passed by the Seanad, which was modelled on the 2001 order, could have given rise to confusion about employees&rsquo; entitlements in the exceptional <Col N="845"/>circumstance where the placement of a child terminates earlier than 16 weeks. This amendment replaces the text with a more simple and straightforward construction without altering in any way the purpose of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Group five is a group of technical amendments, the subject matter of amendments Nos. 9, 10 and 11.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 9, 10 and 11 are technical amendments required to correct a cross-referencing error in the text of section 12 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I made points earlier on making the leave which is the subject matter of the Bill optional, although I understand that they will not be accepted at this stage. Nevertheless, I welcome the Bill as it will bring some equality to parents adopting a child. The legislation probably should have been enacted long ago. To repeat my previous statement, it is a missed opportunity in that this leave is not optional for either the mother or father to avail of. This is taking into account that adoptive parents are in different circumstances than natural parents, particularly the natural mother, in terms of having to take maternity leave for health reasons. This is not the case with adoptive parents, and amending the legislation to allow a father to take the leave if necessary could be a matter for future consideration.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the legislation does not allow adoptive parents time off prior to the placement of a child, to enable them to travel overseas, for instance, as we know many children come from foreign countries to Irish adoptive parents. This time that must be spent abroad should be recognised. Although the amendment was not accepted, I welcome the legislation and thank the officials who put much time and effort into it. I thank the Minister of State for bringing it forward and hope that it will be signed into law as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett"><NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his contribution today in finalising the legislation. It is indicative of the caring nature of all strands of Government, in which I include the Opposition, in seeking to provide everybody with an equal playing field on the issue of adoption. Adoptive parents can now achieve the same entitlements as parents of naturally born children. This reflects the caring nature of Irish society, and Irish people have been very Christian through the years in adopting children.</P><Col N="846"/>
      <P Just="Left">We know of many families who have had their own children and adopted children also. The trend is now to go abroad, and many children have come to this country and are in warm and loving family homes as a consequence. My own brother adopted two children and I had the pleasure a month ago of watching one of them walk down the aisle in a  Galway church to get married. I reflected on how she had turned out and the wonderful life she has. Families involved in the adoption process from now on will have an easier passage in many ways.</P>
      <P>We are also fulfilling promises in the Sustaining Progress programme, which is one of many promises that we have brought to fruition. We are also demonstrating that the Government is serious about the equality agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this Bill and support the comments made by the other Senators, as well as the aims of the legislation. The Minister of State, in accepting one of the amendments, moved in the direction of flexibility. There must be more options for parents, be they adoptive parents or otherwise. This would be good for both family life and employers, as employees with flexibility in their work would be happier in their family life and job.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Terry&rsquo;s view that the legislation could go further. I hope it will go in such a direction at a future stage. This Bill is just a step, and much more must be done in order to improve working life for people with children and families in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators for the contributions they have made to the Bill and the constructive approach that was taken. It was not possible to accept a number of amendments that were proposed.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator Terry&rsquo;s proposal today, the Bill does not allow for paid time off for overseas meetings in the case of foreign adoptions. This was strongly rejected by employers because of cost, and it should be remembered that there are costs to employers already contained in the Bill. These allow parents paid time off for meetings in Ireland with social workers and to attend preparation classes, etc. It was therefore not possible to allow those amendments based on today&rsquo;s contribution.</P>
      <P>The Adoptive Leave Bill 2004 is the second of three key pieces of legislation in the area of balancing life and work. The Government committed to these under the Sustaining Progress partnership agreement. Significant improvements have come about in maternity leave provisions, which have already been implemented by the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Act 2004. Work is well advanced on the Government commitment to implement a number of improve<Col N="847"/>ments to the parental leave scheme. The Parental Leave (Amendment) Bill 2004, published last December, has been passed in the Seanad and is currently on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.</P>
      <P>Senators may be interested to know that the majority of the Bill&rsquo;s provisions will commence within weeks of enactment. Section 9, providing for the postponement of adoptive leave in the event of the hospitalisation of the child, and associated sections, will commence at a later date as amendments to social welfare legislation are required to permit splitting of the payment of adoptive leave benefit.</P>
      <P>I thank the Members of the House, the staff of the House, the Cathaoirleach and the Leas-Chathaoirleach. I thank the staff in my own Department for their supportive role in the amendments and improvements to the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. Last July, after many months of waiting, the capital programme for major hospitals in the country was announced. For some unknown reason, St. Luke&rsquo;s hospital in Kilkenny received no funding, despite other hospitals getting two, three or four sets of different funding from the programme. By coincidence, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, was due to visit the hospital the next day, as Deputy McGuinness had organised the trip earlier. It was embarrassing for the T&aacute;naiste to visit the only hospital in the whole country which had received no funding.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The hospital had been used as a showcase because of the manner in which it managed its accident and emergency department and the out-patient department etc. It had been cited at Cabinet level. On the day, the T&aacute;naiste gave reassurances that the issue would be rectified immediately, and some funding was allocated in order to begin work. Further funding was to be allocated in the future. I promised at the time that I would raise an issue on the Adjournment in the autumn to monitor the progress on the case.</P>
      <P>The current accident and emergency department in St. Luke&rsquo;s hospital in Kilkenny was formerly a laundry room. The fire exit is blocked, a situation condemned in a recent health and safety <Col N="848"/>report. The department is inadequate for the number of patients it deals with, as the hospital covers Carlow and Kilkenny, along with some surrounding areas. A promise was made by the T&aacute;naiste in July that the hospital would also receive a stroke unit.</P>
      <P>Other side issues include the minor injuries unit. The doctors and nurses in St. Luke&rsquo;s have an excellent record of working with the local GPs to ensure that patients only present at the accident and emergency unit when necessary, unlike in Dublin where unfortunately, perhaps through a lack of GPs, people present themselves to accident and emergency units and consequently cause a major backlog. It is regrettable that St. Luke&rsquo;s, which was hailed as a showcase hospital, was in effect punished for its excellence. Thankfully, that has been corrected and I look forward to hearing the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply on progress and the commitment made by the T&aacute;naiste at the time. I look forward to hearing good news from the Minister of State in terms of future funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Browne for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I have the pleasure of taking the Adjournment on behalf of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.</P>
      <P>As the Senator has remarked, the manner in which St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital, Kilkenny is run has been put forward as a showcase for accident and emergency treatment. I had the pleasure of visiting the hospital in December 2004 and was struck by the excellent atmosphere and environment in which everyone worked, despite the pressures involved in trying to run a hospital of its size. The staff showed great respect for one another and their different roles. A number of other hospitals have examined its successful operation and are trying to learn from the experience.</P>
      <P>As Senator Browne noted, the T&aacute;naiste paid a visit to the hospital in July 2005 and she agreed with the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s proposal to provide funding of &euro;450,000 for St. Luke&rsquo;s hospital to further the following capital initiatives: the appointment of a design team to further a development control plan for the site; the completion of contract drawings for an out-patient facility; and the development of services for the stroke unit.</P>
      <P>The Health Service Executive has informed the Department of Health and Children that progress on the development of an interim out-patient facility and an expanded accident and emergency unit continue to be the top priority for St Luke&rsquo;s hospital. The technical issues involved are being dealt with by the acting director of capital projects and his staff in Kilkenny. Planning permission has been sought and the HSE south-eastern area is satisfied there are no significant <Col N="849"/>obstacles that would hold up the planning permission. A design team has been appointed and is preparing the necessary tender documentation. It is now a matter for the Health Service Executive to continue to further these developments within the overall funding resources available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House for this Adjournment matter. As he is aware, there is a major democratic deficit in the delivery of health services in local areas since the abolition of the health boards. The provision of carers, home help, child care, etc., and the establishment of clinic appointments are being unduly delayed in a large number of areas. While heretofore, representations could be made to relevant members within a health board, this is no longer the case and one has great difficulty in gaining access to people.</P>
      <P>Section 42 of the Health Act 2004 provides for the establishment of regional health forums engaging local elected county and city council members with the Health Service Executive. As I have stated previously, elected members were never a burden on the health service, but by tradition were the voice of the people and a first port of call for those who were lost and ignored in a bureaucratic system.</P>
      <P Just="Left">As Members are aware, the HSE took over responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services on a national basis on 1 January 2005 without any local input. Hence, the function of the regional health forums will be to make representations to the Health Service Executive on the range and operation of health and personal social services provided within their functional areas. Section 42(3) of the Act provides for members to be appointed to a regional health forum by the city and county councils in the forum&rsquo;s functional area. However, no specific details have been made available as to how many members will be appointed per local authority or whether membership will be drawn up on a <i>per capita</i> basis. If this was the case, it would place smaller counties like my native County Longford and others at a great disadvantage.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that since the health boards were abolished, communication has been at an all-time low and elected representatives have been left in the dark as regards the personnel within the HSE. I know from personal experience the number of representations with which a Member of the Oireachtas must deal and without the correct names to hand, it is extremely difficult to channel representations in the most relevant direction.</P>
      <P>Hence, I call on the Minister of State to bring forward regulations to engage local elected members with the new HSE without further delay <Col N="850"/>and to improve the flow of information reaching public representatives from the HSE. As the Minister of State is aware, this demand has been made by all the local authority representative associations over the summer months. They are disappointed that although the harvest has come and this House is on the eve of its mid-term break, nothing has happened to date. Perhaps the Minister of State will throw some positive light on the question as to when the forums for local elected representatives will be introduced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I will take this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney. I thank Senator Bannon for raising the matter as it provides me with an opportunity to update this House on the proposals to establish the regional health forums.</P>
      <P>As Members and councillors will be aware, the need for the involvement of public representatives and the users of health services was raised on a number of occasions during the debates on the Health Act 2004, both inside and outside the Oireachtas. The Government recognised the necessity for such involvement and in the Act provided for the establishment of a number of forums to involve both local public representatives and users of health services. These include the establishment of a national health consultative forum to advise the Minister for Health and Children on matters relating to the provision of health and personal social services, the establishment of regional health forums comprising representatives of city and county councils within the functional area of each forum and a provision to enable the Health Service Executive to establish advisory panels to involve the local community in decisions about the delivery of health services which affect them.</P>
      <P>As Senator Bannon noted, section 42 of the Health Act 2004 provides for the establishment of not more than four regional health forums. The Act provides that membership of the forums will be based on nominations from city and county councils within the functional area of each forum. These forums will facilitate local representatives in raising issues of local concern in respect of health services within their region with the Health Service Executive. The Government will put these arrangements in place to ensure that the voice of local public representatives will continue to be heard with regard to the development of health services. These arrangements are designed to complement and reinforce the role of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children in reflecting the views of public representatives in the ongoing oversight of the health services.</P>
      <P>The regulations will specify the title of each forum and define its functional area, the number of members for each forum, the number of <Col N="851"/>members from each city and county council to be nominated to each forum and the requirements relating to the manner in which the functions of a forum are to be performed. They will also set out the procedures for appointing members to a forum, the election of a chairperson and vice-chairperson of a forum, filling of casual vacancies, the meetings of a forum, the establishment of committees and the appointment of their members and ensuring the proper administration of each forum.</P>
      <P>The Department has prepared a draft of the regulations and has been in consultation with the Health Service Executive on the provisions in the draft regulations. Following the completion of that consultation, the T&aacute;naiste will consult with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the regulations, as required by the 2004 Act prior to making the regulations. It is her intention to complete these consultations quickly so as to have regulations made and the regional health forums established as soon as possible. The regulations establishing the forums will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as they have been made.</P>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste looks forward to having the regional health forums established as soon as possible so that local elected public representatives can make their views known to the Health Service Executive on issues relating to the range and operation of health and personal social services within the functional area of their regional health forum. I thank the Senator for raising the matter in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>The easiest way to table this issue is to read from a letter that describes a situation very eloquently:</P>
      <P LI="1">I am a voluntary worker for the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. I am writing regarding the scheme of community support for older people first introduced in 1997-98, now being administered by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. I am very frustrated with the way this scheme is being administered. First, the applications this year had to be received by 5 p.m. on 24 March. So far, no application for socially monitored personal alarms sent by me through our regional office <Col N="852"/>in Limerick has received any funding or any explanation as to when funding will be allocated.</P>
      <P LI="1" el="0">Second, I am receiving applications practically every week for these alarms from elderly people who have lost their partners, brothers or sisters and are now living on their own, mostly, may I add, in rural areas. I have to tell you that the scheme will not be operational until 2006 while applications will be submitted by the end of May. They may possibly be eligible for a personal alarm by October-November, which means a waiting period of 12 months. Surely this is not a scheme to benefit the elderly, who are advised to live in their own homes and not be a burden on the State by being cared for in nursing homes or hospitals.</P>
      <P LI="1" el="0">Third, when the scheme was first introduced, the grant for same was 90% of the cost. Since being administered by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, the grant has been reduced to &euro;300, which means that a pensioner is expected to pay &euro;165, whereas with a 90% grant, all a person had to pay was approximately &euro;50. Surely this is a sad reflection on how the Government is treating its senior citizens. I might add that the need for these personal alarms is greater each day. Old age pensioners cannot afford &euro;165 for these alarms, as they find it very difficult to live on their small pensions considering the cost of living increases in fuel, ESB, etc. each month.</P>
      <P LI="1" el="0">Finally, I am requesting you to have something positive done at once to eradicate this total disregard for our elderly, to reinstate the grant to 90% and make provision for an emergency fund to be made available for alarms to be fitted when the urgent need arises.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Even were I to prepare a script, I could not articulate the matter better than this person, who is genuinely concerned about the issue. From time to time and in my capacity as a public representative for the area, I refer people for consideration for these security alarms, which are extremely important to elderly people living on their own. A situation I have seen evolving over the past ten years is that of a number of break-ins in rural locations. It is a sad reflection on our times that this is happening but these people rely on security pendants or monitors. People who voluntarily provide this service are expecting a more professional approach from the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department.</P>
      <P>Regarding dormant accounts funding, and the Minister of State may correct me, the funding is within his Department. Therefore, it appears there is funding to examine this issue. The main two components would be to return to the 90% of cost grant and that, for a person who applies in October or November, it will not be November of next year before they get an alarm. The <Col N="853"/>Department must be able to respond on a more urgent basis if a case warrants it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Finucane. As he said, the scheme of community support for older people was transferred to the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in 2002 from the Department of Social and Family Affairs. The scheme was originally established in the mid-1990s in response to a spate of burglaries of homes of older people and was based on the concept of contact with people at local level. For this reason, the funding was provided to voluntary and community organisations rather than grant aiding individuals in order to assist and stimulate broader community support for older people. The scheme is, therefore, administered by local community and voluntary groups with the support of my Department.</P>
      <P>Since its inception, funding of &euro;30 million has been awarded to community and voluntary organisations to provide socially monitored alarms and other security items for those members of the community in need of such equipment. Funding can be provided under the scheme for the once-off cost of installing socially monitored alarm systems, window locks, door locks, door chains designed to strengthen points of entry to the dwelling and outside security lighting. In 2004, we introduced a grant in respect of smoke alarms.</P>
      <P>The maximum grants available to individuals are &euro;300 in respect of socially monitored alarms, &euro;150 in respect of physical security equipment, such as locks and chains, &euro;150 in respect of security lighting and &euro;50 in respect of smoke alarms. Many community groups that apply do so for a range of these. Some groups that might be more attached to a number of installers are inclined to apply under only one heading, namely, the alarms. However, the real community groups apply for a range of different items and it is very easy to spot the different applications.</P>
      <P>Funding was provided at 90% of the cost of the equipment between 1997 to 2003. In 2004, following a review of the scheme, this 90% limit on funding was abolished and replaced with individual maximum grants, as I mentioned above. Grant levels were fixed by the Department on the basis of the grants sought and paid out in the previous year. Therefore, we are giving grants and asking people to send in details of their quotations to determine what is happening. Previously, some suppliers kept on putting up prices and we were giving them 90% of whatever the quotation was. The aim of the individual maximum grant measure is to encourage competition between suppliers in the interest of ensuring value for money both for taxpayers and individual applicants.</P><Col N="854"/>
      <P Just="Left">I am aware that a number of suppliers have quoted under &euro;300 for the installation of socially monitored alarms, which are, therefore, being grant-aided to 100% under the scheme. This effectively leaves the individual applicants with nothing to pay for their socially monitored alarms. This is why we placed a limit. It was not to save money or get any elderly person to pay a portion. We saw that different suppliers were sending in prices from &euro;250 up to &euro;450 or &euro;500 and we were paying 90%, which did not seem to make sense for different products that were roughly the same. We felt that we should place a guideline limit on the scheme, which was not the lowest figure. This year, a number of applications and quotations have been received below the &euro;300 mark. In these cases, our funding goes further and everyone seems to be happy.</P>
      <P>The changes introduced last year have no implications for the overall funding available for the scheme. A total of &euro;2.8 million has been allocated to the scheme this year, which is an increase of 17% on last year&rsquo;s amount of &euro;2.4 million. The scheme is currently advertised on an annual basis with a specified closing date. Given the nature of the scheme, my Department exercises a degree of flexibility concerning the closing date. After this date and in circumstances where an individual requires equipment urgently, the Department will accept additional applicants to the group&rsquo;s application during the period of processing. If someone contacts us and says they need more before we give them the grant, we can adjust the application at that stage, which is a period of a few months.</P>
      <P>The Department has also received a number of proposals in respect of the facilitation of emergency cases on a year-long basis. I accept there is occasionally a need for this but many groups seem to get by. Perhaps they have ordered 20 or 50 and some people have moved out of the area or passed on by the time they arrive. Therefore, they often have a spare or two. Most groups seem to get by without experiencing major problems. The idea of an emergency fund will be considered when the guidelines come up for next year. We have a closing date once a year and it was much earlier this year than last. People wanted us to bring it forward and we did. The Department considers these situations on a case by case basis when they arise. Every effort is made by the Department, in co-operation with the voluntary bodies, to facilitate such cases.</P>
      <P>I am sure Senator Finucane will appreciate the scheme has run for the greater part of a decade, supplying security equipment to many elderly people. As I mentioned, this scheme has provided approximately &euro;30 million to assist elderly people. I am sure many homes in villages and towns and many community groups have a great deal of second-hand equipment they have taken back from people who are no longer in a position <Col N="855"/>to use it. Often that second-hand equipment will suffice in an emergency situation for a month or two before the new grant is received.</P>
      <P>Personal security depends on a range of factors. This scheme makes a valid contribution to the security requirements of eligible older people. We have closing date guidelines but we are extremely flexible. Nobody was refused or sent away and no application was returned because it was received on the Monday morning after the Friday closing date. We are extremely flexible while cases are being processed. Approximately 100 groups have already received funding this year and we are processing other applications. Some of the paperwork may not have been correct and we sent a request for further details. It is a flexible scheme which is advertised once a year. We are examining the possibility of one or two groups carrying an emergency supply of equipment but we are not examining restoring the grant of 90% of the cost. Those changes will remain. They have been extremely effective and the scheme is working well. I thank the Senator for raising the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his response. I welcome the fact he would apportion a fund for emergency situations. A person applying now must wait until the closing date next May and might not get the security pendant until the same time next year. The situation of a group of houses in a housing estate is different from that of houses in isolated rural areas such as those in west Limerick about which I am often approached. I refer people in these areas to the people involved for advice. Is the situation differ<Col N="856"/>ent if security suppliers are given the equipment in bulk for an estate rather than for an isolated rural area, where people often have to pay a burden of more than &euro;160?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not see how that is possible. Perhaps they should shop around for better value. Some groups that provide a service to community groups and senior citizen groups take good care of the groups but they are not cheap. It may be that some products are better than others but I do not think major differences exist.</P>
      <P>The Department is flexible, even if an application was received two or three months previously and that group contacts us to request more equipment, it is possible to meet that request while applications are being processed. Once the cheque is sent out, it is regarded as completed for the year. It is not as rigid as some people might suggest.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The grant of 90% is gone. The only disadvantage to that is some alarms are more than personal alarms, they are medical aids that may cost up to &euro;1,000. Some of them may have been covered by the grant of 90% but they are not a security measure. Some are alarms to alert a person if his or her blood or sugar levels are up or down. One or two of those cases may no longer be covered, but it is arguable whether they should ever have been approved. We work with many community groups that provide an excellent service at voluntary level and we are prepared to examine good suggestions. At the same time we want a manageable scheme.</P>
