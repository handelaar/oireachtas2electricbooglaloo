    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have received notice from Senator Mooney that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to confirm if she supports the National Heart Alliance recommendations on the marketing of unhealthy foods to children.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Mansergh of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to review the capping of community employment schemes so quotas can remain filled to the benefit of the community and particularly those participants for whom this type of employment is best suited, and the case for the reinstatement of more flexible rules previously obtaining.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Bradford of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to engage in immediate dialogue with all interested parties concerning the future of the Irish sugar beet industry.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>
      <P>As this is the last sitting day before Christmas, I wish everybody a happy Christmas. I thank all Senators who co-operated with me during the past session. I thank the Leader who must be commended for being most amenable to requests made from the other side of the House. I also thank the leaders of the other groups, Senators Brian Hayes, O&rsquo;Toole, Ryan and Dardis, for their co-operation. In addition, I thank my own staff, the Clerk, the Clerk Assistant and others who helped me perform my duties as Cathaoirleach of the Seanad. We all deserve the rest. I wish everybody a very enjoyable, happy and holy Christmas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I will begin by going on the wishes trail. I thank the Cathaoirleach for his good wishes. In return, I wish him and his family a happy and peaceful Christmas. I thank him for his forbearing nature. He kept his sense of humour even when matters became slightly heated, which is very important in his job. I thank all of the parties and the leaders of each group for the various little interchanges we had to have outside the Chamber to settle some outstanding business which was going forward.</P>
      <P>I thank Ms Deirdre Lane and her staff for their forbearing nature. They always seek to accommodate Senators, tell them things and help them along the way. We do not pay sufficient thanks to the parliamentary reporters in the House who must sometimes be bored to tears. They stay at their stations and faithfully record all that is said.</P>
      <P>I would particularly like to thank Jimmy Walsh of <i>The Irish Times</i>. I know the Cathaoirleach will allow that. He is the only one who has his ear cocked when we are talking. We look forward to his reportage. I also thank RTE which, according to Senator Mooney, stated last night the D&aacute;il and Seanad would be closed until 25 January, which is not true. The Seanad was not mentioned at all.</P>
      <P>We nearly had a constitutional crisis this morning as the flag was not flying over the building when I surveyed it. Speedy Shay came into play and alerted the Army and the flag is now flying.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>We would not have been deemed to be in session if the flag was not flying. Senator Minihan would be aware of that fact.</P>
      <P>Finally, I thank the individual members of my and other parties who strove within their best abilities to make the House lively and instructive and gave careful scrutiny to legislation, all of which is important. Yesterday, we had a lovely hour and a half in the House when the Coroners (Amendment) Bill was debated and the parents of the young child were in the gallery. It showed that officialdom has a soft face and that legislation can be brought forward quickly when there is a need for it. I am proud that both Chambers were used for making legislation, which is what they are good at. It was a nice way to nearly end the Christmas season. In particular, I thank my partner in crime or, rather, in productivity, Senator Dardis.</P>

	<P>I wish the Cathaoirleach and his staff a happy Christmas and thank him for his co-operation and impartiality over the past session, which was one we all enjoyed. In particular, I want to wish the Leader of the House a happy Christmas. I was about to say &ldquo;our great Leader&rdquo; but I saw a programme on North Korea last night and I am not about to make the same connection. Congratulations on her efforts with regard to the flag this morning. I also wish a happy Christmas to all Members and group leaders.</P>
      <P>The House has worked hard this session and people have done a lot of work. It is important that not only should we recognise the work of the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s office but also the efforts of the parliamentary reporters in providing journals of debates so quickly, the ushers and, in particular, the role played by Mr. Jimmy Walsh of <i>The Irish Times</i> in terms of reporting this House to the outside world. On all our behalf, I wish everyone a happy Christmas and a peaceful New Year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The story of the flag reminded me of a great moment we experienced in the House about 15 years ago, when the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s illustrious predecessor from Ennis, former Senator Tras Honan, was in the Chair.</P>
      <P>Fianna F&aacute;il had just sold the pass and blinked on the extradition issue. They were very sore at that, so my illustrious colleague, former Senator John A. Murphy and I started softly to sing &ldquo;take it down from the mast, Irish traitor&rdquo;, until Tras lost it. It is still funny on this side of the House, although not over there.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I wish the Cathaoirleach, the Leas-Chathaoirleach and the team of people in the Chair a happy Christmas and thank them for their commitment and help throughout the course of the session. I pay similar respects to the Leader and, in particular, compliment the work done daily and in a most co-operative and open fashion by Mr. Eamonn McCormack, which has allowed the House to function efficiently.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for saying that. I did not want to.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="672"/>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I also commend the efforts of Ms Deirdre Lane, Ms Jody Blake and all the team in the Seanad office, who are still under-resourced in terms of the work they have to do on our behalf. They are always there to point out flaws in the amendments we put forward and to guide us. Their work is of a highly-professional standard, a matter which, perhaps, we take for granted. Like everything done well, it is made to look easy, but it is professional and skilled work which allows the Seanad to run smoothly.</P>
      <P>I share the remarks on the coverage that Jimmy Walsh and <i>The Irish Times</i> consistently give to the House. Five years ago, we would have discussed the fact that the Seanad receives little coverage. The issue now arises of the lack of coverage of politics. However, we should give attention in the new year to the fact that the most interesting time in the day in this House is, usually, the Order of Business. The Order of Business here is about four times more interesting than that of the other House, which is completely dull.</P>

	<P>Punch and Judy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>We should reconsider the idea of having a topical hour at that time, so that people from all sides can say what they have to say in a structured and orderly fashion.</P>
      <P>We on the Independent benches want to extend warm wishes for the Christmas season to all the people I mentioned, to the Office of the Editor of Debates and to the people who look after the sound. The Oireachtas website, which puts the business of the day in verbatim form on the Internet the following day, is more advanced than any other European parliament website. We should not take that for granted. I thank all for the work they have done, wish them well and look forward to seeing them in the New Year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with other Leaders in thanking the Cathaoirleach and the Leas-Chathaoirleach for the way in which they conducted proceedings during the past term. As always, they have been even-handed and fair and have attempted to accommodate everybody. I thank the Leader, in particular, for her work, much of which is unseen. It is a tribute to Eamonn that the House runs smoothly. We are fortunate in that an increasing amount of legislation is initiated in the Seanad, a welcome development which the Leader has progressed. It is not easy to bring Ministers here but requires a lot of hard work. Eamonn deserves credit for the extensive efforts he makes behind the scenes.</P>
      <P>I also join in the tributes made to all the other people, including, the ushers and the Clerk&rsquo;s office. I have made the point in the past and I repeat it now that there is an increasing burden of work being put on the Clerk&rsquo;s office by her statutory duties, such as, her involvement in the electoral commission. That imposes a lot of press<Col N="673"/>ure on the staff and it is remarkable that they produce amendments quickly and efficiently without the need for re-drafting.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Office of the Editor of Debates, I was critical of that area in the past but it is excellent now in terms of the speed at which accurate reports of proceedings are made available on the Internet for everybody to see.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>There were criticisms in the past with regard to the way in which our words were edited. I have to concede, of course, that there are many occasions on which they require to be edited because we do not speak clearly. Nevertheless, the record is accurate and good. I also join in the thanks given to Mr. Jimmy Walsh and to the other members of the press who cover our proceedings. I wish the Cathaoirleach, staff and Members of the House a happy Christmas and a peaceful time.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive. No. 1 is the Development Banks Bill 2005 &mdash; all Stages to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 1.30 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons to last ten minutes and the contributions of other Senators to last six minutes, and with the Minister to be called upon to reply not later than five minutes before the conclusion of Second Stage. No. 2, the Appropriation Bill 2005 &mdash; all Stages to be taken on the conclusion of No. 1 or at 1.30 p.m., if No. 1 has not concluded earlier, and to conclude not later than 1.45 p.m. The precedent was set some years ago that the Appropriation Bill is passed but the debate on it is postponed until our return. No. 3 is an earlier signature motion re the Appropriation Bill 2005, to be taken immediately without debate on the conclusion of No. 2. No. 4, the Social Welfare Bill 2005 &mdash; Committee and Remaining Stages, to be taken on the conclusion of No. 3 or at 1.45 p.m. if No. 3 has not concluded earlier and to conclude not later than 3.45 p.m. No. 5 is an earlier signature motion re the Social Welfare Bill 2005, to be taken without debate on the conclusion of No. 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>We agree with today&rsquo;s Order of Business. Some weeks ago, I asked for a debate to be held as soon as possible on the issue of legislation for on-the-runs and the proposals that the Government wants to put forward. The Leader, through her good office, might organise a debate early in the new session on this issue. The British Government today announced it would substantially amend the legislation to ensure that those who were previously able to abscond will now have to come before a court. That is some progress. It is similar to the Fine Gael leader Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s suggestion to our Government that instead of granting presidential pardons here we <Col N="674"/>ensure that people come before the courts, admit their guilt and then be released after a period of time as set out in the Good Friday Agreement. We need a debate on this early in the new session.</P>
      <P>The ESRI report, covered in a number of newspapers today, contained Armageddon-like predictions. While the ESRI is correct in pointing out our over-reliance on the construction industry and multinational investment and the problems in the US economy, gimmick-like suggestions such as the reintroduction of property tax or changing tax relief on mortgage interest are not good ideas. The economy has threats, particularly its reliance for employment on multinational investment, but the report&rsquo;s suggestions are of no benefit.</P>
      <P>Yesterday in the House much comment was made on the need for additional investment in third-level institutions, particularly in research and development. We will have a particular problem. Tony Blair&rsquo;s proposals on top-up fees will affect not just England and Wales but Northern Ireland. This means Northern Ireland universities will have additional revenue for research and development that we will not have. The Government has produced additional funding for the third-level sector this year and I welcome that but it will have to be a rolling programme to ensure more money exists for research and development. Otherwise Northern universities will have an advantage over those in the Republic. The Government needs to address that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue of housing stock must be addressed. Some weeks ago I asked the Leader about this after the OECD issued another frightening report that our housing stock is overvalued by between 15% and 20%. My concern is that since 1998 at least 500,000 houses have been built with cavity blocks to a lower level of insulation than will be required by the European directive of 6 January 2006. When these houses come on the market in the future, young couples who have struggled to put the pennies together, with the help of their parents and extended families, to buy houses will lose out by paying that 15% or 20%. I do not know why that is happening. I have raised the issue before. Too many people are saying our housing stock is overvalued and somebody will be right at some stage.</P>
      <P>Last week we saw another example of the Department of Education and Science hounding a family that sought the best for its autistic child, sought help from the Department, said the child was not being looked after properly, lost its case in the High Court and, with few resources, took on the State again and finally won in the Supreme Court. Why? Does somebody think parents already trying to deal with autism would go to the Supreme Court, risking everything they own, if they did not feel they had a real case? This is no way to handle it. I am sick and tired of the State pursuing individuals on these issues. I would like a discussion on that.</P><Col N="675"/>
      <P>It is the same attitude, but on a different level, that sees the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin demanding money back from the teachers who last week stood with the rest of the country on a point of principle about Ireland moving in the wrong direction on the day of action for Irish Ferries. She will never get that money but that she says she will reflects a particular attitude.</P>
      <P>The House is aware that I opposed the Burren Action Group. I was in favour of the interpretative centre being built in the Burren and I spoke many times on it and lost many votes as a result because the people who vote for me tend to be soft on those kinds of issues. The Burren Action Group brought the Government to the Supreme Court, won an important case and established important points. I did not like or support those points but it is wrong that the group be pursued for the money for taking that case. It did us a service even if we did not like it.</P>
      <P>Would the Leader consider having a debate in the new year on Gaelige? I suggest we consult the Commissioner of Languages, Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Cuirre&aacute;in, a progressive-minded person. He is reported today as having approached the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s. He will argue his case but he is open and practical and we could do worse than have a debate on the future of the Irish language, how it is used in the House, how it could be used more in the community and the impact of the Official Languages Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Although this matter was raised on last week&rsquo;s Order of Business, I feel I should again raise the case of Marie Therese O&rsquo;Loughlin who has been outside Leinster House for the past few months. I spoke to her this morning and spoke to representatives of the redress board and her solicitor. Her case will be considered by the redress board under Goldenbridge orphanage but she wishes to be considered under the Morning Star Home for mothers and children. Under the circumstances and in this season they should relent and allow that. She told me she will be here next Christmas if something does not happen. It is hard to see her there before Christmas. She is a bright, intelligent person and has very strong views. The redress board should bring her case forward and possibly consider the issue of the Morning Star Home too. I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to say that.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to consider early in the new year a further debate on health issues. I compliment the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, on establishing the consultative fora. All councillors throughout the country will be delighted. It is in accordance with my newsletter and, contrary to the comments by the Fine Gael group everything in it is accurate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We should have an opportunity to discuss health issues on a regular basis. The councillors will have the forum, we have the Joint Committee on Health and Children but the Seanad should have an opportunity to discuss health issues. I ask the Leader if we could have sometimes have a question and answer session with the Minister in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">On a weekly, if not daily, basis we speak on Iraq so we should recognise the success of yesterday&rsquo;s election in Iraq. Looking from afar this House and other European parliamentarians feel they know what is best for the people of Iraq but they want to chart their own way forward. That against almost insurmountable odds, almost 70% of Iraqis voted in an election is an amazing achievement. Hopefully it is the beginning of good days for Iraqis and will herald a new and positive beginning. Along with that development we must welcome the changed policy position of President George W. Bush on torture and the detaining of prisoners. The work of Senator John McCain is bearing fruit and if this is to be the new American position on prisoners and torture it is welcome.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Leyden&rsquo;s comments on the redress board. I raised this a number of weeks ago when Senator Dardis took the Order of Business. I pointed out that in correspondence I received from the Minister for Education and Science, it was stated that the difficulty stems from the fact the redress legislation does not provide for assistance for those people who were taken to Magdalene laundries and such places when they were over 16. If we must accept that yesterday&rsquo;s redress board deliberations have now shut down access for all new applicants, we must ask the Minister to put legislation in place to establish a board to assist the hundreds of people who are not included in the current scheme. The majority of these people were in Magdalene laundries and they are not provided for under the redress board legislation. In this Christmas season we should reach out to these people; if the redress board is now closed to new applicants we should consider a new scheme.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="677"/>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Taking a 20 year perspective, I would like in general terms to praise the ESRI for its medium-term reviews and reports and we should debate them when we come back. For a number of years, it has predicted a housing price crash. The price of prosperity is eternal vigilance and there are always various threats on the horizon. I agree with Senator Brian Hayes that a property tax might precipitate the very thing it is warning against. It would be totally unfair to those entering the market for the first time to pull the rug from under them by removing mortgage interest relief.</P>
      <P>Picking up on what the Leader said in her opening contribution, and seconding the tributes that have been paid to all who service the House, including &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;, I noticed that it signed off last night until the D&aacute;il comes back into plenary session. The name of the programme is &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;, not &ldquo;D&aacute;il Report&rdquo;. A shortened version should cover not just the Seanad but also committees that are in session to underline the point that the Oireachtas is working even when the D&aacute;il is not in plenary session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader arrange a debate during the next session on women&rsquo;s rights and sexual reproductive health? We have not had such a debate since I came into the Seanad and it would be timely to have it now. I was in Peru and Brazil recently with the Inter-European Parliamentary Forum on Population and Development to look at the subject and the trip opened my eyes in many ways. There are many issues in Ireland that should be addressed, particularly in light of the opinion of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on giving consideration to a reduction of the age of consent for females from 17 to 15 and the risk of the spread of AIDS and STIs among the young.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo Senator Bradford&rsquo;s comments on the extraordinary electoral performance in Iraq yesterday. Over 80% of the valid poll turned out, particularly in Tikrit, which was the home of Saddam Hussein, the heart of the insurgency and from where the suicide bombers who have been killing innocent Iraqis emerge. One could not help but be moved by the filmed reports, especially on CBS television last night, where the reaction of other Middle Eastern countries was covered. Egyptian television interviewed an Iraqi woman who was crying when she came out of the polling booth. The interviewer asked why she was crying and she said they were tears of joy. That sends a powerful message not just to Iraq but those who have purported to speak for it. Another voter, as he placed his vote in the ballot box, said it was a vote against terrorism.</P>
      <P>This also sends a powerful message to the coalition of the willing who remain in occupation in Iraq. It hastens the day when the people of Iraq will be able to take on board the right to rule <Col N="678"/>themselves. Over 70% of the security forces who were there yesterday for what was thankfully a peaceful day were Iraqi, not American or other occupying troops. That should be welcomed. I hope the Leader will convey the sentiments of this House to the Minister for Foreign Affairs so that he in turn would congratulate the Iraqi representatives on an outstanding democratic performance in an area that has not traditionally been known for it.</P>
      <P>In the new year, would the Leader consider asking the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to introduce the proposed broadcasting Bill in this House as a Seanad Bill, primarily because it would afford an opportunity for this House, as it always does so well, to debate this far reaching legislation? I am specifically concerned that RTE&rsquo;s public service mandate would be more clearly defined, not only in light of what Senator Mansergh said and what the Leader referred to last night. It was a shocking fall in standards from the &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; team that they did not even feel it necessary to refer to the fact that this House is sitting today or that we have business.</P>
      <P>If the Bill goes through, it will allow RTE to be given an enhanced public service mandate to broadcast to emigrants and to the Irish abroad. Under existing legislation it does not have a legal obligation to do that, its only legal obligation is to transmit within the 26 counties, and this would have a far-reaching and positive impact. The lack of RTE television programmes for our own people abroad is the main issue among emigrant welfare groups in Britain.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to wish those who have families abroad who will not be coming home this year a happy Christmas. In the context of immigration into this country, we now have a reversal of what I and many others experienced of not being able to go home for Christmas. There are many hundreds of thousands of people in this country who will not be able to go back to their native countries and we wish them a very happy time in Ireland, their adopted country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader for a discussion on the ESRI report at the earliest possible opportunity. I have not read the report so it is not fair to comment on it but I heard a representative of the group on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;. He let his imagination run away with him. He was looking at an imaginary situation that might develop in six or seven years. The construction industry needs our good wishes and support, it does not need not to be undermined. The attitude displayed today undermines the foundations of the building industry. I am sure he does not fully reflect the views of the ESRI but we should discuss it here. Maybe he was partying last night.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Substantial numbers of farmers in my area and throughout the country have not received their payment. This is particularly difficult at this time of year. A commitment was given that a certain percentage of the farming population would have received their payment. I know from personal experience that trying to contact the Department in Portlaoise is difficult. While there may be issues in regard to the applications of those for whom payment is outstanding, many of these are insignificant.</P>
      <P>I am aware of a farmer in my area who travelled to Portlaoise last week and sorted out the outstanding difficulties. He was in a position to do so because he lives in Kilkenny but this is not an option for many others. Will the Leader try to put as much pressure as she can on the Department of Agriculture and Food to ensure these payments are expedited? We are facing into Christmas and for many farming families, the single farm payment is of crucial significance in terms of the survival of their farming enterprises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonScanlon"><NameTxt>Mr. Scanlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the previous speaker in regard to the single payment. The Minister gave a commitment that the cheques would go out on 1 December. Some 80% of farmers have received their cheques since that date and I understand a run of payments will be processed today. In Sligo, some 92% of farmers have received their cheques to date. I spent 35 minutes yesterday trying to get through to the Department in Portlaoise. When I eventually succeeded, I do not know what happened. Perhaps somebody lifted the telephone and then put it down again. People are frustrated at the difficulty in getting through and the fact that when they succeed, they cannot get to talk to anybody.</P>
      <P>A helpline should be set up to deal with these queries. A failure to receive payment at this stage means there is a problem with one&rsquo;s application. Some of those problems are minor and can be sorted out with a telephone call. The departmental officials might consider a helpline to facilitate those with queries. This would help those 10% to 14% of farmers who have not yet been paid.</P>

	<P>Senator Brian Hayes asked for a debate on &ldquo;on the runs&rdquo;. We made preliminary inquiries to his office about the possibility of the Taoiseach coming to the House this week. As we know, however, EU issues have intervened and all European leaders are engaged with those. I will seek to have such a debate after Christmas. Senator Hayes also referred to the ESRI report on the construction industry. Bodies such as the ESRI do excellent work but tend, from time to time, to shoot from the top of their mouths. Senators will recall the National Competitive Council had some zany notion that property tax should be reinstated. Such bodies want to add <Col N="680"/>something startling to their reports and give them some edge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>They focus on the dismal signs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      <P>Senator Hayes also referred to the situation in the North where top-up fees mean there is more money available to third level institutions for research and development, which may leave us at a disadvantage. This is a valid point and we discussed the two-year add-on to the three-year degree yesterday. I understand the Senator was not arguing for the return of third level fees. None of us wants that. However, the existence of such fees in the North gives the colleges there an advantage relative to those in the South.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole added to the debate on the OECD report and referred to overvalued housing stock. I assure the Deputy we will have a debate on housing. He expressed concern about the lower insulation levels of new houses and how young couples are being short-changed. He also referred to the case of an autistic child and the lengths to which the parents had to go to get what they considered adequate educational services for their child. I am aware from my days in education that there is a reliance in Departments on pursuing matters through the courts until the bitter end at which point there is regret that this course was taken. Senator O&rsquo;Toole also spoke about the Burren Action Group and called for a debate on the Irish language.</P>
      <P>Senator Leyden referred to Ms Marie Therese O&rsquo;Loughlin at the gates of Leinster House. It is awful that she will be there for Christmas Day. The rest of us will be warm and cosy but she has told me she will spend Christmas Eve and Christmas Day and night there. I hope she will get an assurance in writing that her case will come under the aegis of some other of the institutions. Senator Leyden also observed that the consultative fora have been set up as he presaged in his newsletter and calls for further health debates in the House. I am indebted to Senator Brennan for showing me an extract from the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s press statement. It states that the Health Service Executive is obliged by regulations to &ldquo;deal expeditiously with Members correspondence&rdquo; and lists the documentation and information the executive must provide to them at their request. It will be great if that happens.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Bradford that the success of the elections in Iraq is amazing. We have seen images of women running to polling stations with their burkhas flowing. It is a great result and they showed us all how it should be done. We are all heartened when we see people turning out to vote &mdash; assuming they are going to vote for oneself. Senator Bradford also referred to the McCain amendment and raised the plight of Ms O&rsquo;Loughlin.</P>
      <P>Senator Mansergh praised the ESRI for its medium-term reports. Senator Terry called for a <Col N="681"/>debate on the reproductive rights of women. So many other health issues hinge on this and it would make a good umbrella title for a debate. Senator Mooney spoke about the women shedding tears of joy in Iraq and said this sends a strong message to the coalition of the willing. I will convey the views of Members in this regard to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern. Senator Mooney also asked that the proposed broadcasting Bill, which will provide RTE with an enhanced public service broadcasting remit, be introduced in this House. That would be useful. Senator Brady said he would not wish us to have imaginary debates about the imaginary future which the ESRI predicts.</P>
      <P>Senator John Paul Phelan asked about the single farmer&rsquo;s payment. I also welcome Senator Scanlon&rsquo;s contribution on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Leader suggest there is a single farmer&rsquo;s payment and a married farmer&rsquo;s payment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I apologise, I meant to say the &ldquo;single farm payment&rdquo;. Whether the farmers are single or married is immaterial. I suggest that if Senators cannot get through to the Department in Portlaoise, they should telephone the Minister&rsquo;s office. The staff there are very helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that. That is something I can do, however, but most farmers cannot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>It seems the officials are getting slightly hung up on the minutiae of requirements in regard to the terminology of the application forms and so on. I have received information to the effect that there are queries on such matters as inheritance rights or that forms were not completed correctly in respect of those farmers who have not received their cheques. The extent of the information required is significant. One wonders whether it is necessary to go to the nth degree in this way.</P>
      <P>At the same time, however, the Minister has done an excellent job on her commitment to deliver on 1 December. More than 80% of farmers have received their payment and we only hear about the hard cases. We wish the Minister well at the WTO talks.</P>

    <Title>Development Banks Bill 2005: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Development Banks Bill provides for Ireland&rsquo;s future membership of the Asian Development Bank, the extension of the activities of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, known as the <Col N="682"/>EBRD, to include Mongolia, and amendments to existing legislation governing Ireland&rsquo;s membership of a number of multilateral financial institutions, to better facilitate Ireland in meeting its obligations to these bodies.</P>
      <P>The Asian Development Bank is an important agent for development in that region. When it was established, Ireland was not in a position to join and add our financial support. Today, we seek to join the Asian Development Bank. It is an important element of Ireland&rsquo;s strategy to join a number of regional development banks, which was recommended to the Government in the 2002 report of the Ireland Aid review committee. Membership of this bank will contribute significantly to Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral development programme in the region, providing further impetus to the role played by Ireland in supporting economic development and social progress in Asia and, in particular, reducing poverty.</P>
      <P>The Asia strategy responds to the need identified for a concerted and strategic approach to the development of trade with Asia. Membership of the ADB was identified as a key objective of the Asia strategy. Into the future, China and other Asian countries will, to a progressively greater degree, influence political and economic developments throughout the world. Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the ADB will provide an opportunity to strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s voice and contribution to Asian development. It will confer economic benefits in providing greater opportunities for Irish companies and consultants to tender for various projects funded by the ADB and in helping to develop a greater awareness of business and commercial opportunities in Asia. The Government&rsquo;s primary motivation, however, is its belief that Ireland should, on foot of the progressive improvements in our national prosperity, deepen and widen our contribution towards helping the less fortunate peoples of the world to improve their different positions.</P>
      <P>The Asian Development Bank is a multilateral development finance institution dedicated to reducing poverty in Asia and the Pacific. It aims to improve the quality of people&rsquo;s lives by providing loans and technical assistance for a broad range of economic and social development activities. It was founded in 1966 to promote social and economic progress in the region and to make loans to more developed member countries at market rates of interest. The ADB is owned by the existing 64 member countries, of which 46 are from the region and 18 are non-regional members, including EU states. It is a well-established and highly-respected development agency fostering progress in the Asia region.</P>
      <P>Japan and the United States are co-equally the largest shareholders, each with almost 16% of the bank&rsquo;s total subscribed capital. I will outline briefly the governance and management structures for the bank. Each member country nominates a governor to the board of governors, often the Minister for Finance, to vote on its behalf. <Col N="683"/>The board of governors meets formally once a year at the ADB&rsquo;s annual meeting. The members elect the president for a term of five years. Four vice-presidents are appointed by the board of directors on the recommendation of the president.</P>
      <P>The board of governors also elects the 12 members of the board of directors. Eight are elected by member countries from within the Asia-Pacific region, and four others are elected by member countries from outside of the region. The board of directors performs its duties full time at the ADB headquarters in Manila and holds formal and executive sessions regularly. Members are arranged in constituencies, headed by one of the 12 directors. Ireland will, after membership, join an existing constituency as part of a group of members from outside Asia. Ireland will not have permanent staff assigned to the ADB.</P>
      <P>The scale of the bank&rsquo;s operations are significant. In 2004, the bank&rsquo;s loans amounted to $5.3 billion. An excellent and timely example of the work of the Asian Development Bank, as we approach the first anniversary of the Asian tsunami, is its response to this disaster. The bank responded rapidly, moving to assist those countries most directly affected by the disaster, providing assistance of more than $750 million. It established a $600 million Asian tsunami fund and identified $175 million in funding to be redirected from ongoing projects and programmes, bringing the bank&rsquo;s total financial commitment to $775 million in this sad situation.</P>
      <P>Indonesia, the Maldives, Sri Lanka and India requested the ADB&rsquo;s assistance in their rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts. In these countries, the bank&rsquo;s assistance packages support disaster management, helping to restore critical infrastructure, such as water supply, sanitation, solid waste management, power, agriculture and fisheries and to rehabilitate and reconstruct roads and railways. Disbursement priority areas include housing reconstruction, microfinance for livelihoods and coastal protection. The support of the bank, together with different national efforts and the work of the international community, has made an enormous contribution to the recovery of these countries which were severely affected by the tsunami.</P>
      <P>More recently, the Asian Development Bank is playing a significant role in regard to the earthquake disaster in Pakistan. The bank has already completed a preliminary damage and needs assessment report in association with the World Bank. This estimates that Pakistan needs approximately $5.2 billion to effectively implement a relief, recovery and reconstruction strategy. Of this, $3.5 billion is for the physical reconstruction of housing, schools, health facilities, roads and other public infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The Asian Development Bank has already established a special Pakistan earthquake fund <Col N="684"/>with an initial contribution of more than $80 million. This fund is similar to that set up by the bank in response to the tsunami just a year ago. It will pool and promptly deliver emergency grant financing for projects that support immediate reconstruction, urgent rehabilitation and other associated development activities. In addition, the bank has announced that it will provide about $1 billion in concessional support for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of earthquake-hit Pakistan, with a focus on transport, power, health and education, and governance and institution building.</P>
      <P>The initial cost to Ireland of entry to the ADB will be in the order of $40 million, or &euro;33 million, depending on the rate of exchange prevailing at the time. This is made up of the following commitments which will be assumed by Ireland: a 12,040 shareholding in the ADB, of which 847 will be paid in capital shares at a cost of $10 million, or some &euro;8.4 million, and 11,193 will be callable shares, this is the shareholding structure required of new members from outside the region; an initial contribution of some $28.046 million, or &euro;23.102 million, to the Asian Development Fund which is a key resource and a major instrument of concessional financing, available for development from the ADB; and an initial contribution of some $2 million, or &euro;1.6 million, to two trust funds operated by the ADB which support specific objectives.</P>
      <P>It is proposed that Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the bank&rsquo;s share capital and to the Asian development fund will be paid in equal instalments over four years. A once-off payment will be made into the two trust funds, namely, the governance co-operation fund and the gender and development co-operation fund. The governance co-operation fund supports government-led governance reform activities to improve transparency, accountability, predictability and-or participation. The objective of the gender and development co-operation fund is to promote gender equality and women&rsquo;s empowerment in the Asia-Pacific region, and to implement programmes and projects to narrow gender gaps in order to meet the millennium development goals. Ireland will also have to give the conventional legal immunities to the ADB which other international agencies have in respect of staff and other matters.</P>
      <P>The House will wish to note that at the UN summit in September this year, Ireland recommitted to achieving the UN target of 0.7% of GNP for overseas development assistance by 2012. Given current economic projections, this implies a tripling of Ireland&rsquo;s ODA above current levels. Fulfilling the financial obligations which membership of the ADB entails will help achieve the objectives set by us for the coming year.</P>
      <P>Let me now turn to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, of which Ireland was a founder member. The EBRD is a multilateral financial institution established in 1991 following the collapse of communism. It was <Col N="685"/>a response to the recognition that the emerging democratic states in central and eastern European and ex-Soviet republics required significant financial support to nurture their economic development.</P>
      <P>The EBRD invests in businesses and financial institutions that underpin the development of market economies in 27 countries of operation, from central Europe to central Asia. In 2004, the EBRD invested some &euro;4.1 billion in 129 different projects. Investments are designed to foster and accelerate the transition to open market-oriented economies and to promote private sector development. The span of operations of the EBRD encompasses some of the less-developed countries in Europe and central Asia.</P>
      <P>Mongolia lies in the heart of the Asian continent and has existed for decades as a buffer state between the Soviet Union and China. Amid the collapse of communism and the Soviet Union&rsquo;s disintegration, Mongolia too underwent rapid change. In January 1992, a new constitution was adopted that renounced socialism and made Mongolia a republic with a parliamentary government and a directly elected President. Mongolia has remained neutral in international affairs. Until 1990, Mongolian economic development had been directed by a series of Soviet-style central plans. Since then, Mongolia&rsquo;s economy has suffered substantially due to the withdrawal of Soviet aid for development.</P>
      <P>At the time of establishment of the EBRD, Mongolia was neither part of the Soviet Union nor a founding member of the bank. Since Mongolia&rsquo;s needs for assistance are consistent with the needs generally faced by the EBRD&rsquo;s countries of operations, it was deemed appropriate that Mongolia should become a member of the bank. This took place in October 2000. Since early 2001, the EBRD has been providing technical assistance to Mongolia, using donor funds made available through the Mongolia co-operation fund.</P>
      <P>However, the Mongolian authorities considered that the involvement of the bank should not be limited to technical assistance but should also include the financing of specific projects. In July 2003, the Prime Minister of Mongolia formally expressed an interest that Mongolia be granted &ldquo;country of operation&rdquo; status. However, being non-European and located outside the territory that the bank&rsquo;s founders had originally intended for its activities, Mongolia could only become eligible for EBRD financing after an amendment of the agreement establishing the bank at the outset. In January 2004, the board of governors unanimously adopted a resolution establishing an amendment to the agreement establishing the bank in order to admit Mongolia as a &ldquo;country of operations&rdquo;. The resolution must, however, be ratified by all members of the bank. Passage of this Bill will enable Ireland to ratify that important resolution.</P><Col N="686"/>
      <P>Ireland is currently a member of several multilateral financial institutions. These are the International Monetary Fund, known as the IMF, the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the European Investment Bank and, most recently, the Council of Europe Development Bank. A significant element of this Bill is the proposed amendment to the current legislation governing Ireland&rsquo;s participation in these international financial institutions. This will allow for future changes in the articles of agreement of those institutions to be approved by resolution of the D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann rather than through primary legislation, but only where this is consistent with constitutional requirements.</P>
      <P>I will outline briefly the constitutional and legal position. Article 29.5.1&deg; of the Constitution requires that every international agreement to which the State becomes a party shall be laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. However, under Article 29.5.2&deg; the State is not bound by an international agreement involving a charge upon public funds unless the terms of the agreement have been approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. Traditionally, our participation in these organisations and related entities such as the International Development Association has been provided for exclusively by primary legislation thus necessitating the passage of new primary legislation to ratify every and any change in the establishing agreements.</P>
      <P>These changes could encompass, for example, the requirement for additional financial contributions or the extension of operations to new member states. Legislation cannot be drafted until the change has been agreed by the members of the bank. There is then significant pressure for the agreed change to take effect immediately or for Ireland to meet agreed financial commitments. The required legislation has, in many cases, been delayed due to other legislative priorities and as a result Ireland has, in some instances, had to seek time extensions or has been unable to make timely payments when required.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, this Bill will provide that in future, where appropriate, approval of an international agreement to which Article 29.5.2&deg; of the Constitution applies would be done by way of D&aacute;il resolution in accordance with that provision of the Constitution rather than by way of primary legislation and that the definitions in those existing cases already dealt with by way of primary legislation would be amended to allow any future changes to be approved by resolution of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. The advice of the Attorney General will be sought on each future amendment to an existing agreement to ensure that it does not require substantive changes in primary legislation, or substantive Irish law, for effective domestic implementation.</P>
      <P>I will now turn to the specific provisions of the nine sections of this Bill. Section 1 sets out the definitions used in the Bill. Section 2 provides for the approval of the terms of agreement for membership of the Asian Development Bank. The <Col N="687"/>articles of agreement establishing the Asian Development Bank are set out in a Schedule to the Act. Section 3 sets out the financial and other provisions associated with joining the bank. Section 4 provides for an extension of the definition of &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo; in section 1 of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Act 1991 to take account of the EBRD&rsquo;s resolution dated 30 January 2004 providing for the extension of the bank&rsquo;s activities to Mongolia. In the case of sections 2 and 4 the Bill provides for future changes to the terms of agreement to be approved by resolution of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and for publication in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i> of notice of any such approval. Sections 5 to 8, inclusive, amend the Bretton Woods Agreements Act 1957, the International Development Association Act 1960, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency Act 1988 and the Council of Europe Development Bank Act 2004 in a similar fashion.</P>
      <P>The Bill will allow Ireland play a much more significant role in supporting Asian development through membership of the ADB and the extension of the EBRD activities to Mongolia and facilitate meeting Ireland&rsquo;s international obligations in a timely fashion fully consistent with our constitutional Oireachtas requirements. This will be critical in enabling us to provide our contribution to debt relief in Africa, in line with the World Bank&rsquo;s multilateral debt relief initiative, which builds on the proposals that emerged from the G8 Summit in Gleneagles. It also contributes in an important way to the delivery of the Government&rsquo;s objective of increasing Ireland&rsquo;s overseas development assistance towards the UN target. I commend the Bill to the House for approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and wish him and his departmental colleagues a happy Christmas.</P>
      <P>I have no particular issues with what is contained in this Bill and Fine Gael will not be opposing it in any way. It is appropriate and consistent with Government policy over a long period that we should join as many development banks as we can. The Minister of State outlined the development banks of which we are a part. The Bill is a logical progression and the next step in that development area.</P>
      <P>The entry cost involved of &euro;33 million spread over four years is not a huge sum of money and neither the Opposition nor, I am sure, the Government would have a problem with that. Furthermore, I have no problem with the &euro;1.6 million due to be paid into the two trust funds. The idea of the two trust funds, as announced and expanded on by the Minister of State, are two areas where we should seek to develop new initiatives as in this case in the Asian continent but also throughout the rest of the world. Of the total, the contribution of more than &euro;23 million is to be made to the Asian development fund. <Col N="688"/>The Minister of State outlined the natural disasters and events that have occurred in that continent during the past 12 months. The contribution of &euro;23 million to that fund is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State referred to our contribution to overseas development aid and the Government&rsquo;s new target. While it is not satisfactory that the target was changed, we must strive to ensure that the target now in place is met. Fine Gael is committed to fulfilling that commitment as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the establishment of the Asian Development Bank, that it is owned by 63 members and was established in 1966. From an Irish perspective, it is obvious that we were not in a position in 1956 to be a part of or among the founding members of that bank. However, when one considers the economic miracle that has taken place here during the past 40 years, it is fitting that we should now become a member. When one considers the numerous campaigns that have taken place during recent years such as Drop the Debt campaign and the Live Aid campaign which took place last year, it is fitting at this juncture that we would seek to become part of it. The bank is involved in 19 residential missions, which support its objective of reducing poverty by strengthening representation in its regional and non-regional members and providing broader and more direct access to its constituencies.</P>
      <P>When I was doing some research on this matter, I learned that the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan has made significant progress in poverty reduction over recent years. The percentage of people in that country who live below the poverty line has decreased to 15%. It was considerably higher than that a couple of years ago, but the position has changed on foot of the support offered by the Asian Development Bank and other development agencies. We should seek to assist any body that is helping in such a meaningful way to improve the lives of people who are affected by poverty.</P>
      <P>The Bill highlights the general issue of development. Not only should Ireland make a commitment to economic liberalisation, it should also make a concerted effort to bring about a revolution in how developing countries are treated. We need to ensure that the benefits of global trade are spread more evenly throughout the world. The Bill before the House will contribute positively in that regard.</P>
      <P>As I have said, the recent Drop the Debt and Make Poverty History campaigns, which received a significant level of support in this country, highlighted the depth of feeling in Ireland and other countries about the need to play an active part in ensuring that the lives and conditions of people who are less fortunate than ourselves &mdash; on the continent of Asia in this case &mdash; are improved as a result of our financial contributions. Ireland is in a unique position in that regard, as I have said previously. Many people would argue that there <Col N="689"/>were never really that many poor people in this country. We have a unique perspective on the development of Ireland between the Famine and the Celtic tiger era. This country experienced the complete spectrum of relative poverty, or actual poverty, over those years. Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the Asian Development Bank is an important one for that reason.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to propose any amendments to this Bill, the general objectives and purpose of which are quite laudable and admirable. Fine Gael will ensure its speedy passage through the House this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, and his officials to the House. I warmly welcome the Development Banks Bill 2005. I do not think Senator John Paul Phelan should doubt that there was mass poverty in this country historically. It was a very serious problem 40 or 50 years ago. We did not worry about relative poverty in those days because it was a question of absolute poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left"><?oasys _dc14- ?>We have gone beyond that, thankfully. I welcome the comprehensive background detail that the Minister of State has given the House. He reminded the House that when the Asian Development Bank was established &ldquo;Ireland was not in a position to join and put in our financial support&rdquo;. Ireland would have liked to have contributed to many of the international efforts which were made 20 or 30 years ago, but the Governments of the time did not consider that the country was in a position to afford to do so.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
      <P>This legislation needs to be considered in the context of the substantial expansion of the Irish development aid programme. The multilateral element of that programme, which is primarily administered by the Department of Finance, has always been a significant, if less noticed, aspect of it. It is also dealt with by the World Bank and various other regional banks like the Asian Development Bank. It is important that Ireland, like other countries, is pulling its weight fully by contributing to such banks, especially now that it has a <i>per capita</i> income that, by any standards, places it among the wealthiest countries in the world. The Minister of State made it clear that Ireland is participating in this process for a mixture of reasons. It is clear that we are developing our economic links with Asia as part of the Asia strategy. While it is important that we assist poor countries to develop, we can also compete for contracts, etc., and thereby deepen our involvement in what is easily the most rapidly developing part of the world.</P>
      <P>It has been made clear to us over the past 12 months in a particularly forcible manner that Asia is one of the regions of the world that is most prone to natural disasters. The tsunami that affected many coastal regions of Asia very badly <Col N="690"/>just after last Christmas was followed this year by the aftermath of the earthquake in Kashmir. It is clear that it makes sense for Ireland to support the Asian Development Bank at this time, so that it can assist and co-operate with those who are dealing with some of the most acute problems in the world. It has been mentioned that &euro;8.4 million will be allocated to the bank over some years. That is by no means an exorbitant contribution, particularly in light of this country&rsquo;s expanding budget. When one&rsquo;s budget is increasing, there is a danger that one will start to spend money on things which are very much less than ideal. We can be assured that the expenditure of the money we are providing in this instance will be well vetted and supervised by the institution to which we are contributing under this Bill.</P>
      <P>Mongolia is one of the countries that is being assisted by the European Union&rsquo;s outreach to parts of the former Soviet Union which are adjacent to Russia. Such regions are in something of a limbo in organisational terms. When one thinks of Mongolia, one tends to think of horses galloping across the plains. One occasionally hears in political debate that a certain Minister &mdash; no name needs to be provided &mdash; is to the right of Genghis Khan. We should bear in mind that the Great Mogul, who came from Mongolia, was one of the great contributors to Indian civilisation, so we are talking about civilisation as well.</P>
      <P>The delegation of authority is correct. Debates like this are useful from time to time to bring us up to date with developments in this area, such as the various bodies to which this country contributes. I suggest that resolutions on such matters should not be taken in the House without debate &mdash; they should be debated so that Senators can focus on the multilateral contributions being made through the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I enormously welcome the Government&rsquo;s real commitment, as shown in the recent budget, to increasing its level of overseas development aid. A great deal of progress has been made over the past 30 years in this regard. As I recall, in 1992 the level had fallen to 0.16% of GNP which was roughly at the level of the United States which usually comes at the bottom of the list. It then rose to somewhere between 0.25% and 0.3% in the late 1990s. For most of the term of this Government it has been running at 0.4%.  This year it will be 0.47% and next year it will be 0.5%.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The difference between now and earlier times &mdash; I hope my friends and former colleagues in the Department of Finance will not be offended by this &mdash; is that the Department and Minister for Finance seem to be fully on board on this occasion, which is vital. It is not enough for the Minister for Foreign Affairs or even the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach to be fully on board. On this occasion the Minister for Finance has come from being Minister for Foreign Affairs so he has first-hand experience of this <Col N="691"/>programme to a greater extent than some of his predecessors may have had. I have a real confidence this time that the commitment will be adhered to and that is very important.</P>
      <P>I wish to make one other point on the delegation. I just had a little smile, because of the legislative difficulties we have had to seek a time extension as we were unable to make timely repayments when required. This, of course, has been the besetting sin of the United States <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the United Nations and certain other bodies. Certainly it would be good if we became members of the prompt payment category.</P>
      <P>I will conclude on a matter discussed at the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service. Part of the decentralisation programme involves the development aid division of the Department of Foreign Affairs being located in Limerick. It has been pointed that there has not been a significant number of volunteers. I did express some little surprise that people, I speak as an ex-Department official, are happy to be posted to Lagos, Lesotho and Lusaka but not to that exceptional hardship post of Limerick. I appeal to officials to look at the issue again. This is a relatively compact country and with all due respect Limerick, is not Outer Mongolia. The Government has made clear financial commitments in this area. I do not think there is any danger with the division being located in Limerick that somehow or other the case for funds will go by the board. There is no merit in that argument.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I warmly welcome the Minister of State to the House. This Bill gives us an opportunity to discuss wider issues in connection with overseas development aid. If there is something we have learned it is that when you give, you receive. Aid works. After the Second World War much of industry in western Europe was devastate, people were displaced, economies and cities lay in ruins and the American plan, the Marshall plan, allowed a regeneration of the economies, society and democracies. I am pleased that we have seen the European Community develop and extend that practice. Eastern Germany, which immediately comes to mind, is being developed by western Germany with the aid of EU funding. Eastern Europe has given us wonderful opportunities by providing many of the migrant workers we badly need here who are working hard. They are a fine example and are so welcome. It is our contribution to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the different development banks, including the Bretton Woods Agreement, that allows us to play our role. Ireland plays a personal role because the Irish are generous. We have seen this in our response to the tsunami and to the pain and suffering caused by famine. Some of the leading figures in this regard were Irish, such as Bob Geldof, Bono and the thousands of missionaries who gave <Col N="692"/>of their lives for others. That is a fine example of Ireland&rsquo;s response.</P>
      <P>We also have a fine political tradition. In a sense between the personal, the institutional and the political we are seeing the culmination of the vision of John Cardinal Newman who, more than 100 years ago, spoke about how he saw land. He saw land as a bridge between the less well-off and the well-off. He knew in his vision where Ireland would lie. I am proud that we are becoming that vision. We have never been colonists but we know poverty and we have experienced hardship.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In the early 1960s Ireland was a very different place from the Ireland of today. Our demographics were skewed and young people were leaving the country in their hundreds of thousands. It was a country where there were many elderly and many young people. There was not the economy that we know today. It was certainly less developed and, in a sense, it was hardly a self-sufficient economy. However, we grew that economy and opened up to world markets. We have a role to play in showing and helping others to get to where we are. We can thank people such as Lemass, the Civil Service and Ken Whitaker who played such an important role in bringing Ireland to where it is today.</P>
      <P>Institutions such as the Institute of Public Administration which educates and develops the public service will have a role in the future. Many of the countries we are aiding and will aid have difficulties in terms of corruption and the way they see things. They could benefit from coming here and learning from our fine Civil Service which has done so much to develop our country.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for aid to Mongolia. All politics is local. Within the past month I met the Mongolian ambassador in London. I was happy to bring him to this House and to have brought him and a delegation to the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business. Mongolia is not that far away. Senator Mansergh mentioned the great tradition in parts of Mongolia. The Mongolian Empire was the largest empire the world had ever seen and extended into China. Mongolia is referred to in that great poem by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, <i>Kubla Khan</i>, &ldquo;In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure-dome decree&rdquo;. There, Mongolians had built their palaces and had a fine culture, which went on to develop in India, China and other parts of the world.</P>

	<P>I welcome the fact that this Bill will facilitate Ireland in meeting its international obligations with regard to membership of international financial institutions. It will support the delivery of the Government&rsquo;s overseas development assistance strategy, including the policy of attaining the UN target for assistance of 0.7% of GNP by 2012.</P><Col N="693"/>
      <?oasys _cl11.7- ?>
      <P>The Bill provides for Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the Asian Development Bank, a multilateral development finance institution, dedicated to reducing poverty in Asia and the Pacific; the extension of the activities of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to include Mongolia; and amends existing legislation governing Ireland&rsquo;s membership of a number of multilateral financial institutions, to allow for changes to administrative and financial arrangements by D&aacute;il resolution rather than primary legislation. Membership of the Asian Development Bank is identified as an objective in the Asia strategy and Ireland has long wished to participate in the work of the bank in that region.</P>
      <P>Ireland will contribute over &euro;1.8 billion to overseas development aid over the next three years. This is a substantial contribution on behalf of a small economy, which I welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome my colleague from Galway, Deputy Treacy, to the House and also welcome the Development Banks Bill. I am delighted that we are now providing for membership of the Asian Development Bank and including Mongolia under the remit of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. There are very serious issues here regarding our commitment to meeting the target of 0.7% of GNP by 2012.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I am fortunate to chair the Oireachtas sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, which deals with overseas development aid. For many years, that committee has been dealing with the overseas aid issue, particularly concerning Africa. The committee, and indeed all Members of the Houses, were delighted that the Taoiseach announced our development aid targets in New York last September. He gave very specific targets for 2007, 2010 and 2012, which put Ireland in the top rank of donors worldwide. Most developing countries particularly welcome the fact that our aid is not tied aid, as is the case with many Western countries, some of which are more prosperous than Ireland. According to the OECD, Ireland&rsquo;s official aid programme is at the cutting edge of international development policy, particularly because the aid is not tied. There are challenges ahead but I hope we will always have quality aid. The committee has travelled to Africa to see at first hand some of the development programmes there. Our focus has been on Africa and in particular, on Ethiopia and Tanzania. I hope we will be able to further the UN millennium development goals because development is urgently needed.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11.7- ?>
      <P>The Government has now chosen two new programme countries in Asia, East Timor and Vietnam. This is very welcome and demonstrates how the programme has diversified. Ireland&rsquo;s experience of being a donor and its own develop<Col N="694"/>ment means that we have much to share with one of the world&rsquo;s newest countries, Timor-Leste. Membership of the Asian Development Bank will add another strand to Ireland&rsquo;s co-operation with the developing countries of Asia. The bank aims to promote social and economic progress in the Asian and Pacific regions and its development fund is particularly attractive. It lends at favourable rates to member countries with low<i> per capita</i> GNP, including Vietnam, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Nepal. Ireland&rsquo;s participation in that fund will allow it to contribute to economic and social development in these countries and to enhance its understanding of their policies and needs.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that a specific contribution is proposed for the bank&rsquo;s gender and development co-operation fund. Given that women constitute a majority of the poor and still experience low rates of literacy and high rates of maternal mortality in some countries, a special effort to promote the empowerment of women is welcome. Senator Mooney and I attended a conference on Africa in London during November and female empowerment was one of the issues raised there. It was interesting to note that in Rwanda, for example, almost half of the members of Parliament are women. This is an area of development focused on by the Asian Development Bank, in terms of its fund and its policy.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The governance co-operation fund is also a welcome and far-sighted project which aims to improve transparency, accountability and predictability in the administrations of the participating countries. This is very much in line with the emphasis on good governance in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s address to the Millennium Review Summit in New York in September. While this fund is good news, many issues have been raised regarding alleged corruption in some countries, particularly in Africa. Mr. John O&rsquo;Shea of GOAL, has highlighted problems in this area, with specific reference to Uganda, Tanzania and Ethiopia. He has raised serious concerns about democracy and human rights in these countries and has referred to a book written by Mr. Martin Meredith, entitled <i>The State of Africa: A History of Fifty Years of Independence</i>. That book vividly describes corruption in African society. This has serious implications for Ireland because it is increasing its development aid budget enormously between now and 2012. Corruption has implications for where the development funding is directed. I am not one to argue that we should do nothing to assist a country because of corruption. However, as a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and a Member of this House, it behoves me to put on record that Ireland must look at issues that are not being addressed by certain African leaders, particularly in the countries just mentioned.</P><Col N="695"/>
      <P>Africa has great potential for economic development but has been stunted by the predatory politics of certain elites, those who are in politics for personal gain. Such elites often precipitate violence against their own people for their own ends. The Nigerian academic, Claude Ake, in an essay on democracy and development in Africa argued that the problem was not so much that development has failed but that it was never really on the agenda in the first place. That sums up the style of certain leaders in some countries. While I put these concerns on record, they in no way take from what we have done in the past and plan to do in the future. I welcome the inclusion of countries in Asia in Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme and believe our objective of meeting the UN target of 0.7% of GNP will be furthered by the passing of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. It is significant, given the time of year, that Ireland is once again showing it is prepared to spread its prosperity to more disadvantaged areas of the world. Our decision to become part of the Asian Development Bank raises political issues regarding the various programmes in which it has been involved.</P>
      <P>Ireland has taken a strong position on the anti-democratic nature of Burma, which the military junta refers to as Myanmar. I hope that Ireland&rsquo;s participation will give it a stronger voice to ensure democracy returns to that unfortunate country. It seems in light of recent developments that the military junta wishes to tighten its grip on power, despite indulging in a sham form of democracy to offset criticism from the international community. At this time of year we should remember that Aung San Suu Kyi, who was given the freedom of this city and has received numerous international awards for her courageous humanitarian work, has in recent weeks been put under extended house arrest, which is a gross violation of human rights. I hope the Minister will tell the House what, if any, influence Ireland can bring to bear as a result of its membership of the Asian Development Bank, because we will be putting Irish taxpayers&rsquo; money into this region.</P>
      <P>I wish to deal with a hot potato arising from our move to the forefront of Asian affairs. While Ireland fully supports the one China policy I have often said that the island of Taiwan, despite being written off the political map, will not go away. It is the tenth largest economy in the world and its people live in a fully-fledged democracy while mainland China is far from being a democracy and seems to lack the stomach for the type of democracy we enjoy, despite the best efforts of the international community. Its violation of human rights is widely known. The Minister, the Taoiseach and the Government have taken every <Col N="696"/>opportunity to tell the Chinese leadership that its human rights record is unacceptable. I do not raise the matter to change the status of Taiwan but it is ironic that joining the development bank will open up trade opportunities for Irish companies. Taiwan is not recognised by the international community which is a bizarre state of affairs.</P>
      <P>If recent reports are to be believed Hong Kong may find itself a fully-fledged separate democracy within the Chinese family in the next ten to 15 years. I hope this will lead to a <i>rapprochement</i> between Taiwan and mainland China. With our membership of the development bank the Government has a role to play.</P>
      <P>I also endorse what my colleague Senator Kitt said about gender in governance. The emphasis on gender outlined by the Minister of State is to be welcomed, as is the Government&rsquo;s proactive approach. This is particulary relevant in Asia where most of the countries we will be assisting are overwhelmingly Muslim where, despite protests to the contrary, the status of women is at best questionable, particularly for those who wish to enter the political arena. At best it is frowned upon and at worst forbidden. I hope the Government continues to be proactive and welcomes the fact that such a policy is included in the overall thrust of our membership and engagement.</P>
      <P>Senator Kitt is also correct about governance. We have discussed governance as it applies to Africa, specifically to Uganda where a large amount of money from the ODA fund goes directly to the Ugandan exchequer. The Government stated that its engagement with Ugandan Government was acceptable and I take it at its word but, like Taiwan, John O&rsquo;Shea will not go away. He regularly supplies Members of both Houses with information about corrupt practices which require scrutiny.</P>
      <P>I commend the Bill and look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon"><NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened to Senator Mooney on the monitor in my office, as is my wont when important debates are taking place. I was impressed by what he said about Taiwan and wish to support him in the context of this Bill. People in Taiwan can practise banking freely, in a good capitalist sense, and can practise one religion. Taiwan does not sterilise people or force them to have abortions as mainland China does, nor does it lock up priests or operate a one child policy, among other things. When the fight against communism raged after the last war Chiang Kai-shek was lauded and supported by all the Western powers but his country is now abandoned because it stood with the West. Senator Mooney&rsquo;s comments should be applauded and I join with him in hoping Taiwan is recognised by being allowed to join the World Health Organisation and other <Col N="697"/>organisations to which it is willing to contribute millions of dollars but is continually blocked by its great master across the straits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their wide-ranging and interesting comments on this Bill. Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann have shown consistent and genuine concern for the affairs of the less well-off countries of the world and, on behalf of the Government, I fully acknowledge their contribution. I thank them for their contributions, sincerity and collective and individual support for and commitment to the development aid programme and democracy across the world.</P>
      <P>Senator Lydon and Senator Mooney mentioned Taiwan. Ireland has consistently pursued a one China policy; the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Conor Lenihan and their predecessors have raised the issue of human rights with the highest levels of the Chinese leadership. Obviously there is progress and change in China, and Taiwan is also making its contribution. I have had bilateral discussions on this issue recently and we are keeping a close eye on that situation. Bilateral improvements can be made between Taiwan and China in the future which will make a major contribution not alone to that region but to the greater world. We must be measured and careful about this in order to ensure democracy is supported and evolves in a broad macro-sense in the interests of individual citizens and of the people of the region.</P>
      <P>With regard to Aung San Suu Kyi, I addressed an international conference on behalf of Ireland last April in Jakarta. I led the campaign at that conference, which was represented by most of the democratic countries of the world, in a very strong manner, to give full freedom and release to Aung San Suu Kyi. We deplore the situation that prevails. I have a close personal interest in that area because my wife&rsquo;s late uncle who was a Columban priest in Burma was shot and wounded there and incarcerated for three years. During all that time, neither his family nor his order knew where he was. Accordingly I have since followed the situation in Burma with great interest. Regrettably, the man has since passed to his eternal reward, but as Senator Hanafin said, he and his colleagues made a major contribution on behalf of Ireland as missionaries, educationalists and leaders across the world. They also made a major contribution to democracy.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, raised this issue on the tenth anniversary of the Aung San Suu Kyi detention on 24 October last. The Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, has had a number of meetings on the issue with various people from <Col N="698"/>Burma and other areas. We will continue to raise the situation and give it the highest profile possible until equity and full mobility prevail for this outstanding person, a Nobel prizewinner who is making a major contribution in that area and should be given the freedom to make an even greater contribution in the future. If Senators have questions on any other issue I will be delighted to respond.</P>
      <P>We have benefited from the total contribution made to the economic and social development of Ireland by international development institutions. It is now time for us to acknowledge that past support and, as we have become wealthier, to show our support for other states and their development as they grapple with their problems. In joining the Asian Development Bank we are acknowledging our commitment to the less well off in the developing world. I thank all Senators for giving this Bill their speedy attention today.</P>
      <P>Earlier this week, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, on behalf of the Government, announced that in discussions held last week at the World Bank in Washington on the funding of the multilateral debt relief initiative, MDRI, which is aimed at cancelling debts mainly in Africa, Ireland promised to give the World Bank some &euro;59 million towards meeting the cost of this initiative. This additional funding, which will increase our overseas development aid spending for 2006, is to help meet the costs of the cancellation of existing debts due to the International Development Association, IDA, under the MDRI process.</P>
      <P>These debts to be cancelled relate to some of the world&rsquo;s poorest countries. The Minister for Finance said that Ireland, a long-time supporter of debt relief and of the World Bank&rsquo;s IDA loans and grants programme, would make this funding available upfront to help the World Bank proceed with this initiative immediately. Senators are probably aware that as a result of the decisions in Gleneagles, we have 40 years to make that contribution of nearly &euro;60 million, but we are making a once-off total payment of more than &euro;59 million. That shows our commitment as a Government and a nation to the multilateral debt relief initiative. Other states may pay for this debt cancellation over a much longer period in smaller instalments but subject to approval by the Oireachtas, Ireland is prepared to make its full contribution to the debt cancellation costs available during 2006 to help the World Bank make the many early adjustments needed to go ahead with this initiative.</P>
      <P>Some time ago we gave a commitment to reach an aid figure of 0.7% of GNP. We made the commitment in an open, public, international, genuine and sincere manner, with regard to our GNP at that time. As our economy since grew &mdash; a credit to the Government&rsquo;s management of the <Col N="699"/>country and to the people of Ireland &mdash; the figure was a moving target, and our commitment was for the position as it stood at the time. We are now exceeding the baseline figure set then. We can be proud of that major contribution and commitment.</P>
      <P>The early delivery of money by Ireland to provide upfront financing was especially welcomed at the meeting by the president of the World Bank, Mr. Paul Wolfowitz of the USA, as being helpful in driving the debt cancellation process forward. The World Bank is now likely to take formal decisions to go ahead with debt cancellation in early January. In his speech at the annual meetings of the World Bank and the IMF earlier this year, the Minister for Finance promised that Ireland would do all it could to assist with debt cancellation. This new money helps to deliver on that commitment.</P>
      <P Just="Left"><?oasys _dc14- ?>I thank all Senators for their interesting contributions and indeed for the cross-party support.

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>During the wide-ranging response on Second Stage by the Minister of State, a number of Senators raised the question of governance. I would be grateful if the Minister of State would reassure the House that governance will form a large part of the Irish engagement once we become involved in the dialogue on the dispersal of funds in the Asian Development Bank. I will not reiterate the arguments made on Second Stage, but following the Blair initiative of last year at the African summit, the <Col N="700"/>single criticism was that there did not seem to be a greater emphasis on governance. That criticism was made despite the high-flown ideals and noble aspirations expressed. No one questions the motives involved, and one applauds the subsequent fulfilment of the commitment made by world leaders towards reducing world poverty.</P>
      <P>John O&rsquo;Shea of GOAL distributed to the House and to the media certain material regarding Uganda and Ethiopia. I have total faith in the Government&rsquo;s ability to ensure that there is accountability and transparency regarding the money already being given under the ODA programme. I have equal faith and confidence in the Government&rsquo;s ability to ensure that any moneys which go into this current fund will also be subject to the usual international accountability and transparency criteria. As a small country, Ireland should have a role in ensuring proper governance in this area. In so doing we could ensure there is proper governance because events in Iraq yesterday showed that given the right environment and atmosphere, people are crying out for democracy, democratic institutions and good governance. I hope this is an area in which Ireland will continue to shine.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>There are two words which are always pertinent to Ireland&rsquo;s situation in the international arena &mdash;&ldquo;governance&rdquo; and &ldquo;generosity&rdquo;. We have always been as generous as possible taking into account the resources available and we always ensure governance is a key to ensure resources pledged both by the Government and the people are managed carefully, disbursed properly and get to where they should.</P>
      <P>Members will notice that following last year&rsquo;s tsunami and the various other disasters, the Government always pledges a small amount of money immediately as an <i>ad hoc </i>response to an immediate crisis. When it is satisfied governance is in order and that structures are in place so that funds can be managed properly, it then reviews the situation quickly and makes a further decision, if required. Members can be assured that the professional representation we have at the bank and in all the institutions in which we are represented and to which we contribute, governance is always one of the top two priorities along with generosity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this opportunity <Col N="701"/>to address the Seanad on the Appropriation Bill 2005. Given the Seanad&rsquo;s busy schedule, I appreciate today&rsquo;s debate will be very brief and, as the Leader indicated this morning, there will be a more substantial debate on public expenditure early in the new year.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The main purpose of this Bill is to give statutory effect to the departmental Estimates for supply services both current and capital, including all the Supplementary Estimates which have been approved by the D&aacute;il since the last Appropriation Act. The Bill also provides for the carryover of unspent voted capital into 2006 amounting to &euro;346 million under the multi-annual capital envelopes.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Bill, in line with what is now established practice, includes a technical provision to allow for the deferment of the end year deadline for the financial resolution passed on budget night. This year the Bill also includes a technical amendment to the Appropriation Act 1999 to allow for the payment of certain excise duties levied on tobacco products to the Health Service Executive Vote from 1 January 2006. In line with recent practice, the Seanad is also being asked to approve an earlier signature motion to facilitate a request to the President to sign the Bill earlier than she would normally do.</P>
      <P>Section 1 appropriates for the year 2005, the net sum of almost &euro;36.3 billion to the various services listed in Schedule 1. The 2005 sum includes Supplementary Estimates of &euro;91.3 million on eight Votes which have been approved by the D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</P>
      <P>Current indications are that overall spending this year will be within budget. There will be a capital carryover under the multi-annual capital envelopes of &euro;346 million from 2005 into 2006, or 5.8% of net voted capital for 2005. The corresponding capital carryover from 2004 to 2005 was &euro;237 million, or 4.3% of net voted capital. The actual end year Exchequer outturn will be published in the end year Exchequer statement on 4 January 2006. As is normal, the Bill also seeks approval for the use of departmental receipts of almost &euro;3.7 billion as appropriations-in-aid for the services listed in Schedule 1.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the provisions of section 91 of the Finance Act 2004, which is the legal basis for capital carryover, section 2 provides for the carryover of &euro;346 million. The relevant Votes are listed in Schedule 2. The &euro;346 million cannot be spent in 2006 until the D&aacute;il approves an order at the beginning of the year specifying the capital subheads in each of the Votes concerned against which the money will be spent as a first charge. The availability of the carryover facility of up to 10% of a Vote means that this money will not have to be surrendered at the end of the year and will not therefore be lost to the programmes concerned. I am sure we all endorse that approach.</P><Col N="702"/>
      <P>Article 17 of the Constitution requires that the financial resolutions of each year must be enacted into law by the end of that year. However, the end year deadline can be deferred if an Act to that effect is passed before the end of that year. This section makes provision for this deferment to be invoked by both Government and Parliament. The inclusion of this provision in the Appropriation Bill will maintain the normal statutory deadlines for passing budget measures into law. Identical provisions have been included since the 1997 Appropriation Act.</P>
      <P>There is a technical provision, by way of an amendment to the Appropriation Act 1999, to allow certain excise duties levied on tobacco products to be paid to the Health Service Executive Vote from I January 2006 rather than to the Vote of the Minister for the Health and Children as at present. Arising from a decision in budget 2000 to increase excise duty on cigarettes by 50p per packet of 20 and that the resulting revenue increase of &euro;167.6 million in a full year would be used to fund health services, this amount has been paid as appropriations-in-aid to the Department of Health and Children since 1 January 2000. As the relevant health services are now provided by the Health Service Executive which has its own Vote, it is appropriate that these appropriations-in-aid should be paid directly to the HSE.</P>
      <P>The Seanad is also being asked to approve an earlier signature motion. This is sought each year to ensure the necessary legislative authority is in place for the final end year issues from the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>This Government is fully committed to achieving value for money from public expenditure. Measures announced by the Government on ICT projects and consultancies and additional measures for securing value for money announced by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, in October last are being implemented. They build on measures already introduced, such as multi-annual budgets for capital programmes and new guidelines for the appraisal and management of capital projects. The cumulative impact of these is one of improved management of capital projects and programmes.</P>
      <P Just="Left">This Government has provided for over &euro;45.5 billion in gross spending on the public services in 2005. Substantial additional resources have been allocated to the priority areas of health, education, social welfare and capital investment. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister of State said, we will have an opportunity for a more detailed discussion on these issues in the new year. However, I wish to make a few comments on the Appropriation Bill. The Minister of State men<Col N="703"/>tioned the Government&rsquo;s commitment to spending taxpayers&rsquo; money wisely but nothing could be further from the truth if one looks at its record. I am certainly not convinced the necessary measures have been taken to prevent the scandalous waste of taxpayers&rsquo; money in certain areas as has happened in recent years. I refer, in particular, to the PPARS project. The report on PPARS was issued this week but the House did not get the opportunity to discuss it. Perhaps we will get the chance to discuss it in the new year.</P>
      <P>When it comes to the glaring examples of the misuse of public funds by this Government over the past few years, it is clear it has not learned any lessons so far. I am not convinced by anything the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, or the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, have said in this House or in the other one on the recent budget that they have learned anything from the misuse of public funds which has marred this Government, particularly since the 2002 general election.</P>
      <P>On umpteen occasions in this House and elsewhere, I have mentioned the River Nore flood relief scheme in County Kilkenny which was completed two years ago. The expected cost was &euro;14 million but it ended up costing &euro;48 million. There are still significant problems with that scheme in that there are environmental issues which have not been resolved.</P>
      <P>I already mentioned PPARS but there are numerous other examples. It is clear that in certain areas the Government is not spending taxpayers&rsquo; money as wisely as it should. I have never doubted the Government&rsquo;s ability to spend money, but I do question its ability to spend it correctly and wisely and to get the best value for it. Everything I have seen in the course of the time I have been in the House leads me to question that ability even more.</P>
      <P>I realise we will have an opportunity for a fuller debate on the Bill. There is no opposition to it from this side of the House today but there is a need to have a broader discussion on the Government&rsquo;s lack of ability to properly spend taxpayers&rsquo; money and to ensure that fiascoes like PPARS and other issues such as the Kilkenny flood relief scheme are not repeated in future. I will finish on that note.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and his officials. As we go into the Christmas season, the economy has rarely been in better order. Government finances are totally under control and there is full employment and high growth. Of course, there is a variety of threats and dangers on the horizon. That has always been the case and it always will be. However, we are in a better condition than we were in up to a few years ago <Col N="704"/>and also in a better state than most of our partner countries in the European Union.</P>
      <P>There is enormous appreciation of the new schools, new hospital wards, new roads and all the other things on which the Government has spent money. Of course there are isolated incidences of waste of expenditure, there always have been and there always will be. I do not believe the Comptroller and Auditor General will ever be made redundant. Lessons have constantly to be learned. I regret the attempt to present a totally distorted picture and to conjure up an image of large amounts of wasteful extravagant expenditure in order to sully the tremendous progress which is appreciated by most people. Our level of expenditure is very much at the lower end, about a third of national wealth, compared with our EU partners. If there is any argument it is a question of whether we should be spending a higher proportion on services. It is the absolute amount rather the relative amounts that count. We will be making a lot of progress on that side.</P>
      <P>I give Senator John Paul Phelan notice that when we come to have a fuller debate on this matter, I will have looked up the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s reports for 1995, 1996 and 1997 to demonstrate to him that there is nothing extraordinary about what the Comptroller and Auditor General has reported on this year or last year. He made the same type of reports and found the same type of scandals, if one wishes to call them that, during the period when Senator Phelan&rsquo;s party was in office. This is an integral part of Government. The Comptroller and Auditor General is doing his job and the Government is doing its job.</P>

Complaints were made by people who felt the salmon should be protected. The fisheries people tried to deal with that as best they could. I have not studied this issue nor do I have the expertise in this field to draw any conclusions on the matter but from my observations it would appear many agents were involved to ensure the project continued and to get the extra funding that was required.

It is a complex, multi-purpose, multi-functional system and I hope the problems can be resolved as it evolves because there is not much point spending money, either capital or current, on the delivery of permanent structures or ongoing services if the result will be a write-off that will not continue with the best value for money in the delivery of those services. I hope PPARS can be resolved in the interests of the taxpayer because of the large sum of money that has already been expended on it. I also hope that when financial historians and economists come to do an analysis of the investment that has been made in a decade or so that they will conclude that the initial purpose was good and that the final conclusion was correct.</P>
      <P>This is an important Bill which enables us to use our funds in the best way possible and that we can conclude the Votes in the most legal and constitutionally correct way that is required by both Oireachtas &Eacute;ireann and the Government.

    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 4, before section 4, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;4. &mdash;The Principal Act is amended in section 242 as follows:</P>
      <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) in page 177, line 1, by deleting subsection (1)(<i>a</i>), and</P>
      <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) in page 177, after line 28, by inserting the following new subsection:</P>
      <P LI="1">(4) Where a social welfare recipient is in receipt of a payment for a qualified adult or other dependent relative, that payment shall be paid directly to the qualified adult or dependent relative and shall be in his or her name.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I will not labour the point because we briefly discussed the matter yesterday. However, I want to make a pitch on behalf of these qualified dependants, most of whom are women. In terms of pension payments, if we look at the profile of women who do not have their own social insurance records, it is more than likely that they had to give up their jobs when they married. According to the culture of the time, many stayed at home <Col N="707"/>to rear their families, to look after their husbands and to keep house. They performed those tasks very well and we have all benefitted from their work.</P>
      <P Just="Left">While caring at home, however, they did not have any independence. These were women who could not even take out a loan. I remember an issue from many years ago where some individuals wanted to buy washing machines from the ESB but could not do so without the signatures of their husbands. They had no rights and, now they are in their twilight years, still do not have independence. With this measure, we could recognise the work they have done and give them some independence. As the Minister for Social and Family Affairs noted yesterday, an optional arrangement has been provided for with regard to this matter. The Minister and I realise that few women have managed to take it up and we will have done a good day&rsquo;s work by making it mandatory. He said that he does not need to provide for that in this Bill but I understand from his comments that he will consider it favourably and will make arrangements for it in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I indicated yesterday that I am interested in this subject and that I have held a number of meetings in my Department with a view to progressing it. The Senator will recall that, in 2002, a working group recommended the introduction of arrangements that would pay for the splitting of payments on a consensual basis. That is now up and running.</P>
      <P>Measures have been introduced over a number of years to ensure that as many people as possible qualify for pensions in their own rights. These include the reduction of the yearly average of contributions required for pension purposes from 20 to ten, the half-way pension for the self-employed and the special pre-53 pensions.</P>
      <P>In 1994, a homemaker&rsquo;s scheme was introduced which provides for a disregard of up to 20 years of homemaking when determining the yearly average test for old-age contributory pensions. The Senator&rsquo;s amendment specifically concerns making the payment a direct one on a mandatory basis. Serious administrative and policy issues arise in that regard but, if I can resolve these, I will try to progress it over the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister and hope that he will be able to resolve the issues holding this up. The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme, which was only implemented in 1994, will benefit many women in the future but it does nothing for the women who are retired or close to retirement and who spent 20 years or more caring for children. While it may not be appropriate at present to ask the Minister to consider the matter, it would be wel<Col N="708"/>comed if the scheme could be backdated to 1974. By that means, the work done by these women in the home would be recognised. Is that possible and, if so, how much would it cost the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>There would obviously be substantial financial implications in adding 20 years to the scheme. I will examine the matter but I do not want to make any commitments at this point in time. The scheme was established in 1994 and has been welcomed. Any changes made in these areas tend to be like pulling a string because the whole garment can follow and, as many schemes are interrelated, unintended consequences often arise when a scheme is changed. One must fully assess the knock-on issues. I do not have a figure in terms of the cost of adding 20 years but I will revert to the Senator if I can determine it.</P>

      <P LI="2">&ldquo;5.&mdash;The Minister for Social and Family Affairs shall, within three months of the commencement of supplement to this Act, lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas, a report on the review the family income supplement.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This amendment proposes to bring a report on the FIS to the Houses within three months. As we noted yesterday, FIS is a good scheme and its enhancement in the budget is welcome. We want to ensure that as many people as possible can avail of the supplement and, in that regard, the Minister indicated his plans for a national advertising campaign to ensure that people know their rights. I would appreciate a report on the scheme within three months because it would be helpful to know its performance and degree of uptake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The family income supplement is an important measure to help people on low incomes. This year, we spent an extra &euro;25 million on it. Whereas previously it was paid evenly, we changed the rules so larger amounts went to the larger families. That was a substantial change. <Col N="709"/>Not enough people are aware of the FIS and in view of this I plan a substantial campaign to bring it to the attention of those who need it. A number of suggestions on how we might do that have been made. Given our database we can communicate with large numbers of people, particularly those who are likely to need the FIS. We may do that and we will advertise it on radio and television. I share the Senator&rsquo;s support for the scheme, which makes a significant difference to people on low income. As I mentioned yesterday, a couple with two children under six years of age and on a salary of &euro;20,000 would receive &euro;4,233 on FIS. That helps people move further from unemployment. A family with four children and the same salary would receive &euro;7,900.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Apart from putting the extra &euro;25 million in this year we have weighted FIS in favour of larger families. That is significant although not widely known and I intend to bring it home to more people. In addition to the FIS, families would also receive child benefit and if the children are under six years of age they would also receive the new child care allowance, therefore, quite an amount is available.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11.7- ?>
      <P><?oasys _dc14- ?>On 31 December 2003 there were 12,317 recipients of FIS. In November 2005 there were 16,650. More people are becoming familiar with it but I need to promote the scheme because it is real money for people. We have discussed child dependent allowances. FIS is the bridge that takes people to the workplace and prevents them falling back to unemployment benefits. I share the Senator&rsquo;s enthusiasm and will try to promote it.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>

    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>I received the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s note telling me why amendments Nos. 4 and 5 are out of order on the grounds that they will involve potential charges on the Revenue and I accept that. The Minister will remember that we discussed this on Second Stage. This is a live issue for many women who are or who are about to go on maternity leave. Given that the substantial and welcome increase in the entitlement to leave will have a significant impact on families at the most important time of a child&rsquo;s life I felt it was important to table the amendments. When I did so I was not aware that they would be ruled out of order. Will the Minister could take it to his Cabinet colleagues and agree an amendment in the new year, perhaps under the Finance Bill? It is very important.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, I complimented the Minister on the &euro;1,000 payment for children under six years of age and the maternity leave extension and I do not mean to be critical. While everybody will know that an extra four weeks&rsquo; leave will be granted from March 2007 and can plan their families around that, many were taken by surprise by this announcement. When we increased tax on petrol and alcohol it was implemented from midnight on the night of the budget. I plead with the Minister and in doing so I reflect the wealth of feeling among women on this issue. I thank the Minister for this co-operation and his acceptance of my bona fides in putting it before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has raised this a number of times, I know her commitment to child care and this area and she exhorts the Government to make it easier for employers to introduce work-friendly and flexible child care systems. The present budget arithmetic is based on starting this in March. I have listened carefully to the Senator&rsquo;s suggestion that it be implemented in January. I have asked my Department to examine the potential cost and the mechanisms that might be available although I am not in a position to introduce an amendment on this today. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has a role since it is the prime legislator in this area. While we can examine it I am reluctant to upset the budget arithmetic, which is very finely balanced and the result of major negotiations over many months between me and the Minister for Finance and our Departments. The Minister for Finance would not thank me for doing that. I need to know the kind of funding that would be involved, although it does not sound like much. I will take a view based on that amount.</P>

      <P LI="1">In page 5, before section 8, to insert the following new section:</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The entitlement to maternity benefit is contingent on entitlement to maternity leave and the legislation on it is the preserve of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The maternity benefit scheme has been significantly improved over the past four years in terms of both the duration and level of payment. In 2001, improvements were made to increase the core maternity leave which attracted an entitlement to maternity benefit from 14 weeks to 18 weeks and the period of unpaid maternity leave was also increased from four to eight weeks, bringing the total period of maternity leave to which a woman is entitled to 26 weeks. More recently, maternity provisions were amended to provide for the postponement of receipt of maternity benefit in instances where the infant is hospitalised. Similar improvements are now being provided for in section 8 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The estimated cost of the maternity and adoptive benefit schemes for 2005 is &euro;137 million, an increase of &euro;59 million since 2001. These figures represent the extent of investment and the pace of progress in these two schemes over a short period. The improvement provided in the Bill before the House will further extend the duration of entitlement to maternity benefit to 22 weeks from March. There will also be improvements in the rate of payments as the percentage to be applied to reckonable earnings has increased from 75% to 80%. That was contained in the budget and arose from our commitments in Sustaining Progress.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to maternity and adoptive leave is provided in the 1994 and 1995 Acts. I do not know if the Senator wants me to go into further detail. I have reams of material about the usefulness of maternity benefit but I doubt if she wants me to go through it. She knows how useful it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome these benefits, they are an improvement on what we had and I hope such improvements will continue in the coming years <Col N="712"/>so we can enable women to stay at home for up to a year in the long term. We also want to see fathers being more involved and would welcome paternity leave. I am concerned, however, about delays with the Parental Leave Bill.

      <P LI="1">&ldquo;10.&mdash;The Minister for Social and Family Affairs shall, within three months of the commencement of this Act, lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas a report on benefit for one-parent families.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This benefit greatly helps one-parent families who are vulnerable because of their financial situation and the fact they are alone. It should ensure parents and children are not left in poverty. We have received many submissions from groups that work with one-parent families and it is our duty to ensure no child lives in poverty, although we know that is not the case. The overall measures in the budget and this Bill should help to alleviate that problem for many people.</P>
      <P>There will, of course, always be some people left in poverty for one reason or another because of social circumstances in families so we must strive to ensure there are no anomalies and that every child gets a good start in life. That means leaving home having eaten breakfast in the morning with warm clothes to wear.</P>
      <P>We must also recognise the stresses and pressures for parents. Getting them back into the workplace is vital and is the main way to protect people from poverty. There is no point in parents working, however, if the money they get does not supersede what they would get in benefits. The Minister is helping to address these issues and we must continue to work on them.</P>

      <P>The changes in the Bill are twofold. It increases the upper earnings threshold by &euro;82 per week to &euro;375, the first change in the threshold for many years, and the rates being paid will be &euro;16 and &euro;17 per week. That will help considerably.</P><Col N="713"/>
      <P>In January the Cabinet will finish its consideration of the report I am putting to it on reforms of the one-parent family area. I hope to publish that document then for consultation because the issues are emotive and complicated and I am anxious that any changes we make enjoy the maximum possible consensus.</P>
      <P>There are many issues in this area. I must look at the question of maintenance in the coming year. The report before Cabinet examines the issue briefly. At present, up to 50% of maintenance from the other parent can be disregarded under the means test. Additional allowances are made for up to &euro;95.23 per week of maintenance paid in respect of vouched housing costs. As we reform this area, it is not enough for the State alone to take responsibility, fathers must also take responsibility. The figures are not impressive if we look at the amount of maintenance being paid and the income it generates for lone parents as a proportion of their other income. That area must be worked on.</P>
      <P>There is a social aspect to this; it is important that fathers have contact with their children and if there is no financial connection, it is harder. I want to examine this area in the coming year to ensure maintenance payments for children from the father are reasonable. Any objective person looking at the area now would conclude not enough is being done and it must be studied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply and I agree that more work must be done to pursue fathers to ensure they contribute to the maintenance of their children. Can he tell us about the work being done in the area? What measures does the Department take to pursue fathers and how successful is it? Obviously it is not very successful so where are we falling down?</P>
      <P>It is not just about maintenance, it is about the social aspect of having fathers involved in the upbringing of their children. It is important not just for the children but for fathers. The child, however, should be at the heart of this and that must be our starting point. I support the Minister in doing whatever he can to improve this area so we can come to a successful conclusion for both the father and the child, ultimately helping the mother and reducing the cost to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will have to get back to Senator Terry on the precise figure in this regard. I understand some 14% of fathers are making payments, an alarmingly low figure. We only deal with those persons on welfare because there are many private arrangements about which we know nothing, involving people who are not customers of the Department. One of the reasons this figure is so low is that many of the fathers, like many of the mothers, are in receipt of welfare. The Department has not done much in the past, as an <Col N="714"/>administrative matter, to pursue fathers who are themselves on welfare. We have not taken a hard line on that. Whether we should or not is something we must discuss.</P>
      <P>The Department&rsquo;s records indicate that approximately 9,600 recipients of the one-parent family payment are in receipt of maintenance from their spouse or the other parent of their children. Many other recipients, however, could be in receipt of maintenance and still qualify for the maximum rate of one-parent family payment as a result of the provision allowing claimants to retain 50% of any maintenance received. It is an important point that they are allowed to keep 50% of any maintenance received without it affecting their lone parent allowance. We would not want maintenance to become an issue in reducing people&rsquo;s lone parent allowance. This does not detract from the fact that the number of fathers contributing in the welfare area is alarmingly low. It is something I intend to look at in the new year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a supplementary question. A figure of 14% is very low. In respect of one-parent families, in what percentage is there recognition of the father on the birth certificate? I understand a mother can choose whether to include the name of a child&rsquo;s father on the certificate. Is there a large percentage of unknown fathers who cannot be pursued?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Sections 10 and 11 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 9, before section 12, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;12.&mdash;The Minister for Social and Family affairs shall, within three months of the commencement of this Act, lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the review of social welfare payments for carers.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The Bill ensures far greater support for carers and means they will be allowed to earn more before their grant is affected by their income. How many are in receipt of the carer&rsquo;s allowance and what increase will they will receive?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The budget package of &euro;30 million in this area is designed to increase the level of support for carers. This increase makes the carer&rsquo;s allowance the largest single welfare benefit in the State, apart from the provision for the over 80s. The allowance rises to &euro;200 a week, <Col N="715"/>an increase of 17%, and the respite care grant increases by 25%, from &euro;1,000 to &euro;1,200. The income disregard for the carer&rsquo;s allowance is also increased so that recipients can earn more income.</P>
      <P>A number of speakers asked me on Second Stage about the complete abolition of the means test. This has been costed at &euro;140 million in a full year and it is debatable whether it would represent the best use of resources. I made provision in the budget for an increase in the carer&rsquo;s disregard. From April 2006, the disregard will increase to &euro;290 for a single carer and &euro;580 for a couple. This will ensure that a couple with two children earning a joint income of up to &euro;32,925 will qualify for the maximum carer&rsquo;s allowance. A couple with two children and an income of &euro;54,400 will qualify for the minimum carer&rsquo;s allowance, the household benefits package of free schemes and the respite care grant.</P>
      <P>The carer&rsquo;s allowance means test is one of the more flexible tests in terms of the assessment of household incomes. We are always prepared to make any changes necessary to existing arrangements where they are for the benefit of carers. I have continued to review the issues raised by the Carers Association, the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs and other bodies. The Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and I met with the representatives of the Carers Association before the budget and they explained their priorities. They were particularly interested in a carers&rsquo; strategy and we were able to tell them we had no difficulty in agreeing to a strategic approach to improving the position of carers. The more one does for carers, the more is done for those who require that care, which is the objective. These changes make the carer&rsquo;s allowance the largest single allowance in the State, ahead of unemployment support and pensions.</P>
      <P>Senator Cox gave the example yesterday of widows who take on a caring role and are unable to get the carer&rsquo;s allowance without forgoing their widow&rsquo;s pension. This restriction is based on the doctrine of one payment per welfare recipient. I looked closely at this issue because I had intended to move in the direction of introducing a half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance for persons such as those in receipt of the widow&rsquo;s pension. When we examined this issue, however, it opened up the vista of an entire range of other situations where one could argue for half-rate payment for those already in receipt of another welfare payment. There are serious difficulties in this regard.</P>
      <P>Instead, I decided to make the carer&rsquo;s allowance the largest allowance. We will try to keep it well ahead in years to come so that people will move to it from other rates because they will receive substantially more. Heretofore, the carer&rsquo;s allowance was less than other allowances <Col N="716"/>and there was no incentive to take a caring role. It is a better approach to ensure that carers move off their other allowances and receive the carer&rsquo;s allowance and the associated additional funds. This is the first step in providing adequate provision for carers. I previously believed pensions would increase to &euro;200 per week long before that figure was achieved for the carer&rsquo;s allowance. In the circumstances, however, it makes sense that the carers got there first.</P>
      <P>I understand the arguments in favour of the suggested half payment. However, such a provision would cause many difficulties throughout the system in breaking with the doctrine of one payment per welfare recipient. That principle must be retained or the entire system will come into considerable disrepute. The best way to recognise carers is to allocate significant funds to the carer&rsquo;s allowance. The funding of &euro;30 million makes it the highest allowance in the State, with the exception of the allowance for the over 80s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I was one of those who asked on Second Stage that the Minister would advance this matter further and reconsider the means testing of the carer&rsquo;s allowance. I note with interest the figure the Minister is putting on the removal of the means test which will amount to approximately &euro;150 million. Is that the cost of paying the full allowance to the present recipients of a carer&rsquo;s allowance, people who may be on a reduced rate, or is the expectation of what a carer&rsquo;s allowance would cost if a relative of everyone who was being cared for at home received the allowance? From where did the Minister get the sum of &euro;150 million? Is he basing it on bringing all present reduced rate recipients up to the full rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance or on the fact that he would expect thousands of extra successful applications for a carer&rsquo;s allowance?</P>
      <P>Regardless of whether the figure is &euro;150 million or more &mdash; I suspect it would amount to more to remove the means testing element of the carer&rsquo;s allowance &mdash; the issue of a carer&rsquo;s allowance is not just a financial matter. It is a philosophical issue about where we stand in regard to care of the elderly. It is the view of most politicians, and I hope all political parties, that the majority of elderly people, in as far as possible, should be allowed to remain in their own homes and to be looked after by their families. This would be very possible with the additional help of some financial incentive. Given the various reviews that are under way in the Minister&rsquo;s Department, perhaps over the next few months he will consider removing means testing for some carers, not just from a financial perspective but from the point of view of the Government making a strong philosophical statement about what we want for the elderly in our community.</P><Col N="717"/>
      <P>We know from studies and surveys that the majority of elderly people wish to remain at home. In many cases, their families can provide help or assistance. Under the new regulations, neighbours can also qualify for the carer&rsquo;s allowance. It would make a significant difference to a great number of people. It would make very good social policy and social care of the elderly to extend the carer&rsquo;s allowance to the maximum. This can only be done by removing means testing. I concede it would be the only social welfare allowance in the State without a means test. However, it is a unique allowance to provide for our elderly who built up this country and made it what it is. We should not be afraid to invest in the elderly.</P>
      <P>I welcome the improvements to date but we need to take this step. It would make a strong philosophical and policy statement on what we as a country think of our elderly. I ask the Minister to put that issue back on the table for discussion in the next couple of months. Notwithstanding that, I genuinely welcome the budgetary advances for carers. The fact that the allowance is now higher than any other allowance is a positive development and a sign of the Minister&rsquo;s commitment in this regard. However, a further step must be taken to remove means testing and bringing many more people within the ambit of the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased the Minister addressed the issue I raised yesterday on the second payment to widows, in particular, or widowers, who are moving into the caring profession. I accept his suggestion that it is a good idea to make the carer&rsquo;s allowance the larger payment so that people will be encouraged to become carers. It is always difficult to try to change the <i>status quo</i>. In order to achieve equality and equity, it should be changed for people who are in receipt of a widow&rsquo;s allowance, in particular, namely, a widow who receives an allowance by virtue of her status versus a person next door who has an income disregard of &euro;570, or a household that can earn &euro;30,000 and receive the maximum payment and &euro;54,000 and receive the minimum payment.</P>
      <P>There is no justification for not making the system flexible. I do not have the answers but I have no doubt there are serious issues involved. I accept the Minister&rsquo;s bona fides, but there is a fundamental issue of equity in regard to income disregard. A widow or widower may have lost a husband or wife and must be cared for. In some cases people may have to care for the in-laws of the deceased. This policy does not seem to be fair. While it may be difficult, if a review is taking place, the Minister should keep this issue on the agenda. There is always a way to deal with issues. It is just a question of finding the particular path.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="718"/>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>This discussion has been worthwhile because it is one of the most important issues with which we are dealing. We must ensure that as many people as possible remain at home. Unfortunately, one of the problems in our hospitals is that too many people are in hospital because they do not have someone to care for them. Given the improvements in the budget, many people will make themselves available to care for the elderly. The fact that it does not have to be a family member, and that someone who lives close by can care for a person, will make it more attractive to become involved in caring for people. It is a worthwhile allowance. We should continue to make improvements in this area.</P>
      <P>Other Senators and I said yesterday that the respite grant should be doubled to make it possible for people to go into a nursing home for two weeks rather than one week if they so wish. Many carers who carry the heavy burden of caring for people with disabilities or elderly people who need full-time care would need a two-week break. The respite grant would be one way of helping to deliver this. While I accept it cannot be delivered this year, perhaps next year the Minister will consider providing the equivalent of two weeks in a nursing home, taking into account the varying costs throughout the country. This would be of great benefit to carers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>On Senator Bradford&rsquo;s point about the cost of &euro;140 million to remove means testing, this is calculated on the basis of it becoming a universal payment. The reason the figure is lower than the Senator might think is that people must qualify under other conditions. One might think the figure should be much higher for a universal payment. However, if one removed the means test, one would not remove the other conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>Full-time care and attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The figure of &euro;140 million relates to the means test. The other conditions include being available to give full-time care and attention, apart from the 15 hours which is currently the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>Will it include the additional people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Only if they meet the conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the &euro;140 million to &euro;150 million include additional people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The assessment is that it would. This is where the main cost would be involved. It would include people who are not <Col N="719"/>currently in the net. People who failed the means test up to now could come back in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be a modest cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but the other conditions are equally important. I took the view this year that it would be better to put the money into respite care, making it the largest payment in the system, and putting the money into getting the allowances and the disregards up. This package cost &euro;30 million this year. We could have done none of this and used the &euro;140 million to remove the means test. While it would cover some of these people, it would not do much for the rate of payment. More people would be included but they would receive less money.</P>
      <P>I am always nervous about removing means tests. The distribution of taxpayers&rsquo; money must be done on the basis of people&rsquo;s needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>What about child care?</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>I knew the Senator would refer to child care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>Will Fine Gael introduce a tax on child benefit?</P>

	<P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to outline some interesting figures. The Central Statistics Office indicates that the total number of carers is 150,000 but the total number caring for more than four hours a day is 49,000. Of these, the number caring for more than ten hours a day is 16,000. While there is the headline figure of 150,000 carers, when one inquires about carers in terms of the number of hours of caring per day, the number caring for a long number of hours is much lower. For example, last year some 24,892 recipients received the carer&rsquo;s allowance. That is the number of carers to which that 150,000 whittled down. I do not expect there would be 150,000 full-time carers if the means test were removed because according to the figures given, that number of carers are not available to do the work.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Regarding the old age contributory pension, I draw the attention of the Minister to several complaints I received during the years <Col N="720"/>relating to loss of income incurred by self-employed people. I do not wish to delay the House on this issue. I will supply details to the Minister as I have received considerable correspondence on this matter. To be honest, I am not fully clear exactly what I am seeking. With 1988 being set as the date for qualification for self-employed contributions, there appears to be an anomaly which discriminates against certain old age pensioners in that they cannot get their average contribution up to a level that would enable them to qualify for the higher rate of pension. I will supply some details and the Minister, when finalising the legislation, might examine the question of self-employed contributions, especially in the case of people who have been self-employed for many years and have been taking care of their families who seem to be discriminated against.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for the work he has done, congratulate him on the work he has put into this Department since he took office and look forward to his further work in his area in next year&rsquo;s budget.

	<P>To follow up on Senator Terry&rsquo;s remarks, I thank the Minister and his officials for their work on this Bill. As I said yesterday and as the Minister would have said, a social welfare package of an additional &euro;1.5 billion on top of last year&rsquo;s package of &euro;12 billion is a great deal of money. It will make a real difference to every person and family in this country. This is the one Department that impacts on everybody from the moment we are born and throughout our lives until we pass away. I thank the Minister for his reflections on issues raised by Senator Terry, the Labour Party and Senators on this side of the <Col N="721"/>House. I compliment him on his openness to at least consider change. His legacy to the Department will be that he was a Minister who was willing to listen and implement change where possible. He referred to this as a two-part package. We look forward to next year and have no doubt that the package introduced then will be one of which we will also proud.</P>

I thank the Senators for the constructive debate we had on this Bill. Between us we got the legislation through expeditiously and I want to acknowledge that we learned something in the process.</P>
      <P>This Social Welfare Bill is historic for one main reason, namely, that apart from the huge increases in rates, it has a special &euro;300 million social reform package at its heart.

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, my friend and colleague, Deputy Brendan Smith, to the House for what is a timely Adjournment motion in light of the excesses in which all of us will inevitably indulge over the Christmas period. I would like to focus specifically on the report of the National Heart Alliance, entitled Position Paper on Marketing of Unhealthy Foods to Children, which was published in November in response to a separate report, entitled The Marketing of Unhealthy Food to Children in Europe, which had been published by the European Heart Network.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State is aware, the National Heart Alliance&rsquo;s report, which covers a wide range of issues, is supported by many regional and national bodies, including Barnardos, the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance and various groups involved in dietary matters. In its various sections, the alliance&rsquo;s report includes many recommendations relating to the media, the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland&rsquo;s code of conduct on the advertising of food products, the involvement of parents in the home, child care health services, hospitals, residential facilities, the retail sector, monitoring and data collection. The summary of the report, which makes for stark reading, states that an obesity epidemic is unquestionably waiting to happen in this country. As legislators, it is time for us to wake up to that unpalatable reality.</P>
      <P>The time in the not too distant past when obesity was a problem for more affluent countries than Ireland is within living memory. I refer to a time when there was not enough food on many <Col N="723"/>tables to prevent children from being hungry. There was no question of there being enough food to enable youngsters to become obese. There was a different rhythm to life in previous decades, when children took more exercise and spent more time in the open air. That is no longer the case as a result of changing trends, such as improvements in forms of technology like the information superhighway, which we are all now inevitably running on. Those of us who have children are aware that the level of participation in outdoor sports and other forms of physical activity has decreased. More and more couch potatoes are being reared. I genuinely fear for the next generation. All of us recognise the problem that exists, but we need to decide what we will do about it.</P>
      <P>The National Heart Alliance has performed a public service in publishing its position paper, which challenges the Government, various Departments, parents and certain State agencies. The report, which makes for very difficult reading, states:</P>
      <P LI="1">A study by the Green Party in September 2002 showed that 54% of all advertisements targeted at children were for foods high in salt, fat, sugar or a combination of one or more of these. As regards public opinion, a recent survey by the Southern Area of the HSE showed that 75% of parents considered television food advertisements to children usually promote unhealthy foods. In 2004 a national survey, conducted by Safefood Consumer Tracking Research showed that 56% of parents were concerned with the advertising of foods to children.</P>
      <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I would like to focus on the report&rsquo;s recommendations. I agree with the alliance in its acknowledgement that &ldquo;the Children&rsquo;s Advertising Code of the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, is a positive first step to provide some restrictions on advertising to children&rdquo;. However, I also agree with the alliance&rsquo;s belief that the code &ldquo;continues to expose children to the marketing of foods high in fat (specifically saturated and trans fats), sugar and salt; does not take into account the cumulative effect of advertising on children; and does not limit the number of food advertisements per segment or per day&rdquo;. The alliance recognises that &ldquo;the BCI&rsquo;s proposed evaluation would provide an important opportunity to address the limitations of the code identified above&rdquo;. I hope the Minister of State can have some influence in that regard, even if this matter is not directly related to his mandate.</P>
      <P>The alliance&rsquo;s report argues that the Government should support work at European level to:</P>
      <P LI="1">restrict the claims by some food manufacturers regarding the nutritional profile of their <Col N="724"/>foods, especially those high in fat, salt and sugar. Claims concerning the benefits of certain products may lead consumers to eat too much of something that should make up only a small part of a good diet.</P>
      <P FLI="0" Just="Left">Similarly, the report recommends that the EU should &ldquo;agree a common definition of unhealthy foods&rdquo;. Those of us who are aware of this problem like to examine the breakdown of the content of various brands of food when we go to the supermarket. However, we often find that full information is not available. It is clear that transparency continues to be a major issue for the food industry. Public opinion recently forced McDonald&rsquo;s to reduce the salt content of a wide variety of its foods, including its French fries. Further analysis recently indicated that the &ldquo;healthy option&rdquo; that is offered by McDonald&rsquo;s is far from healthy. I do not want to single out McDonald&rsquo;s, as similar problems are encountered in all fastfood outlets. Such products may be healthy if one eats them once a month, but not on a sustained and regular basis. I do not make any apologies for saying that junk food is bad for one &mdash; it is as simple as that. I do not care about the corporate power of certain multinational food organisations, which are able to get away with their actions by using the full force of that power.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The National Heart Alliance&rsquo;s report suggests that &ldquo;parents need to review and supervise their children&rsquo;s television viewing time&rdquo;, which is very nice in theory but not an easy thing to do. As a parent, I assure the House that it is almost impossible. The report also advises parents &ldquo;to be aware of the marketing strategies that impact in the home through television, the Internet, texting and product packaging&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Marketing on the Internet is a new form of advertising. We need to be aware that some clever marketing strategies are being employed. It may not be widely known that a strategy called product placement is used within the film industry in Hollywood. Certain products are placed in feature movies so that they are subliminally seen by viewers. Nobody ever asks how they get there &mdash; they get there because the companies concerned spend enormous sums of money on ensuring their products are placed on cinema screens, right in front of viewers. I do not doubt that similar activities are taking place in respect of television programming.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The report also contains some recommendations which apply to pre-schools, schools and the non-formal education sector. It states that &ldquo;the school environment needs to be guided by a health food policy which ensures that healthy food and snacks are provided in schools, for example, meals, tuck shops and vending machines&rdquo;. We all know about the fastfood industry. Crisps are part of the daily diet of many people. I do not want to be critical of anybody in <Col N="725"/>the teaching profession, but I am afraid there is a residual resistance within the profession as a whole to any form of acknowledgement that forms of junk food like crisps do not represent a healthy option for children. I fail to understand why more schools are not accepting the findings of documents like the National Health Alliance&rsquo;s report and ensuring that junk food is not available in school tuck shops.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The alliance&rsquo;s report points out that in the food sector, &ldquo;most of the money spent on marketing is for television advertisements&rdquo;. It continues:</P>
      <P LI="1">There are signs that advertising budgets spent on television may be declining slightly, with small but rising proportions being diverted into schools or via the Internet. A variety of creative marketing strategies are used to promote foods to children. These include linking food products with both children&rsquo;s heroes and cartoon characters from films and books; and linking food products with children&rsquo;s products/toys. Spending on media such as magazines, radio, cinema, mobile phones and outdoor advertising is normally a small proportion of total food marketing budgets. However, along with television, schools and the Internet, these media form part of a sophisticated and integrated mix of marketing techniques used by companies to sell their products.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I hope the Minister of State will assure the House and those who are concerned about the growing problem of obesity, especially among young people, that policies are in place to tackle the food companies in a more proactive manner in the marketplace in which they operate. If necessary, taxpayers&rsquo; money should be spent on combatting and countering the messages which are transmitted on television and cinema screens. There is a need for a Government programme to be specifically targeted at identifying the problems people face. If people are not aware of the risks, the Government, which represents the people, has a duty to provide the relevant information. Taxpayers&rsquo; money would be very well spent in that way.</P>

	<P>I am responding to Senator Mooney on the Adjournment on behalf of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney. I thank the Senator for raising this important matter because it has given me an opportunity to outline to the House the position of the Department of Health and Children on it. Senator Mooney outlined succinctly and clearly the issues which arise from the quality and range of food available to children in our affluent society.</P><Col N="726"/>
      <P>When the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, met representatives of the National Heart Alliance on 30 November last, he discussed with them the report mentioned by the Senator, Position Paper on Marketing of Unhealthy Foods to Children. The Minister of State advised the alliance that as part of the UK Presidency of the EU, a nutrition policy development group met specifically to discuss the issue of food promotion and marketing to children. The group was asked to consider possible restrictions on food advertising and promotion and to identify potential areas for action at community, member state or industry levels. The Department is awaiting the report which will feed back to the European Union&rsquo;s Platform for Action on Diet, Physical Activity and Health and inform future policy making in EU member states.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>At a national level the report of the national taskforce on obesity which was launched earlier this year reported that the media is one of the most popular vehicles through which consumers receive information and is powerful in influencing food selection and health behaviours. Senator Mooney also referred to the widespread new emerging forms of media.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11.7- ?>
      <P>Foods that are high in fat, sugar and salt attracted most of the &euro;132 million spend on advertising in Ireland in 2003. Many young children, especially those under the age of six, have difficulty understanding that advertising is a tool used to sell products; it is not until children approach the age of 12 that most are able to comprehend the purpose of advertising.</P>
      <P>Promotion of food products takes cognisance of the fact that children are attracted by foods in bright packaging and those accompanied by free gifts or promoted by cartoon characters. Processed foods like chocolates, crisps, soft drinks, pre-sugared breakfast cereals and fastfood meals that are high in salt, sugar or fat are among the most heavily-promoted, especially on television, but are usually the ones that dietary guidelines emphasise should be eaten the least. Young children are often the target group for the advertising of these products for the simple reason that they have a significant influence on foods bought by parents.</P>
      <P>A report from the WorId Health Organisation and the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations in 2003 concluded that the aggressive marketing of these types of food and drinks to young children could increase their risk of becoming obese. Part of the consistent, strong relationships between television viewing and obesity in children may relate to the food advertising to which they are exposed.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The report of the national taskforce on obesity contains 93 recommendations which relate to actions across six broad sectors, namely, high-level government, education, social and com<Col N="727"/>munity, health food commodities, production and supply and the physical environment. Recommendations made in relation to marketing include: Ireland should play an advocacy role within the European Union to reform policies relating to healthy eating and active living among those that govern activities relating to global trade; the regulation of marketing and advertising of food to children; the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Health and Children, together with the private sector and consumer groups, should immediately take multisectoral action on the marketing and advertising of products that contribute to weight gain, in particular those aimed at children; and a national, regularly reviewed code of practice must be developed in regard to industry sponsorship and funding of activities in schools and local communities.</P>
      <P>An implementation plan for this report is being developed by the Department of Health and Children and will involve all relevant stakeholders. Additional funding of &euro;3 million has been made available to the Health Service Executive in the Book of Estimates to support the implementation of the report&rsquo;s recommendations.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply. Today&rsquo;s edition of the <i>Irish Independent </i>carried a full page article on the dangers of obesity, not only directed at young children but on the dangers of excess eating for all of us over Christmas. It makes sobering reading and breaks down into specific areas the calorie intake which even for a mince pie, will add 283 calories to one&rsquo;s daily intake. I commend the <i>Irish Independent </i> and hope other newspapers will take note because the way forward is by getting the message out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Reflecting on the last contribution we have to be allowed a few cakes and ale over Christmas.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for taking this matter on the Adjournment. This matter is of grave concern in County Tipperary as I am sure it is in County Cavan likewise. It concerns community employment schemes and how they are structured with a limit on the number of years. Even a person over the age of 55 can work on a community employment scheme. There is also a three-year limit for people under 55. Nobody is arguing that young able-bodied people entering the workforce should be allowed stay for an unlimited period on F&Aacute;S schemes. We are talking overwhelmingly about people over the age of 35 who, for one reason or another, whether it is their skills, training or the opportunities available, community employment suits their circumstances. <Col N="728"/>There is not a ready alternative but also innumerable local voluntary organisations rely heavily on these schemes to keep their heads above water.</P>
      <P Just="Left"><?oasys _dc14- ?>Until 2001 these schemes were administered more flexibly. We are facing a situation in Tipperary where, if there is no change in the position, up to half or more of those on community employment schemes will have to leave and, in many case, will not be readily replaced, both to the detriment of the individuals and the organisations for which they work and where they have developed the skills required to carry out the functions required. The scheme suits everybody and the cost is not great. Five or six years ago when the decision was taken and we were heading into full employment people wondered whether there was a need for the scheme. I do not know what the position is in the major centres of population, I only know the position in the country.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
      <P>An agitated meeting took place in Dundrum because in some cases schemes will be decimated from mid-January. As a matter of acute urgency the Government must look at the rules. There is not a great deal of money involved. Nobody is arguing for an increase in the numbers. We are talking about individuals who are suited to the particular jobs being able to stay on. Obviously where jobs are being mainstreamed and made permanent by other authorities there would be no particular problem. It is a matter about which the trade union movement is concerned. I have no doubt the matter will be raised at social partnership talks. SIPTU is talking about having a march to the D&aacute;il on the matter. I do not wish to be critical of our Ministers in this area but they tend to come from the large cities and centres of population where the problems and the perspectives may be different. In rural Ireland community employment schemes matter and they serve a vital role.</P>
      <P>Given the healthy state of the economy and the finances why is it not possible to have the degree of flexibility that existed up to three or four years ago? As there is probably a Cavan interest as well as a Tipperary interest in this matter, I ask the Minister of State to do his best to communicate my concerns to the Minister responsible to have an urgent look at the problem before we get into a serious situation. Perhaps, the application of some of the rules could be suspended while the matter is being looked at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Mansergh for raising this important matter and articulating so well his concerns about an issue that is of importance to many individuals and communities.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of community employment as an active labour market programme is to reintegrate long-term unemployed persons into <Col N="729"/>open labour market jobs. Community employment provides unemployed people with temporary opportunities whereby they can develop their skills and obtain a recent track record of work experience.</P>
      <P>F&Aacute;S is continuing to develop the content of the community employment programme. The new approach will see the introduction of an individual learner planning process which will focus on meeting the learning needs of participants. The individual learner plan will provide for the planning, organising and recording of the work experience, training and development each community employment participant receives while working on the programme. It also includes further training and development for supervisors, a new application process and quality assurance procedures. The new approach should provide substantial benefits to F&Aacute;S clients and give increased value for the training budget invested.</P>
      <P>In 1999, the community employment programme was restructured to limit participation by new participants to three years, with effect from April 2000. This change was introduced to discourage repeated participation in community employment and to encourage unemployed persons to avail of training, education and employment options where possible. However, this three year cap was amended in August 2001 to allow particularly disadvantaged persons to remain on the programme for a further period. Approximately 20% of participants, including persons under 55 years of age, have benefited from an additional year on the programme under the flexibility guidelines introduced in August 2001.</P>
      <P>On foot of a review of F&Aacute;S employment schemes, which included detailed consultations with the social partners, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment introduced changes to community employment and other employment schemes with effect from 10 November 2004. The three year cap was removed for persons aged 55 or older. This means that those over 55 are now eligible to participate on community employment programmes for a maximum of six years. In the case of persons advancing beyond 55 years during their normal period of service on community employment, participation can also be extended for up to a maximum of six years. This change was designed to address the particular difficulty of finding replacements to participate in community employment schemes in certain rural areas. It also helps to secure the continuity of community services generally. Combined with the rural social scheme, under the aegis of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, where 2,500 places are available, the existing community service support framework will be maintained.</P>
      <P>The current ring fencing and prioritisation procedures for the essential services of child care, <Col N="730"/>health related services and drugs task force clients, are being maintained. Community employment will remain as an active labour market programme with the emphasis on progression to employment. For those aged under 55, the normal service of up to a maximum of three years will continue to apply, subject to the current flexibility guidelines administered by F&Aacute;S.</P>
      <P>In addition to the changes introduced to community employment programmes, it was also announced last November that participants remaining on job initiative schemes will have their contracts renewed on an annual basis. Participants who leave that programme voluntarily will be replaced by community employment participants to support the service being provided.</P>
      <P Just="Left">There will be no compulsory cessation of social economy programmes, which play a very valuable role in communities throughout the country. In situations where an enterprise decides itself to cease activity, the employees affected will be assisted by F&Aacute;S in finding alternative employment. From 1 January 2006, the social economy programme will be transferred to the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and will be administered by Pobail, formerly known as ADM.</P>
      <P>It was also announced in November 2004 that there would be 25,000 places overall on F&Aacute;S employment programmes which comprise community employment, social economy and job initiative. In fact, the latest figures show the total number of places on the three programmes is 900 in excess of this figure, with community employment places at over 22,300, which represents an increase of over 100 places compared with the end of 2004.</P>
      <P>The Government will continue to support the positive role of community employment in meeting the needs of long-term unemployed persons, while at the same time providing essential services to communities. I assure Senator Mansergh that I will bring the contents of his worthwhile contribution to the attention of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment as soon as the transcript becomes available.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply. He stated that social economy programmes will be transferred to the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht affairs from 2006. Does that include all F&Aacute;S employment schemes?</P>

	<P>I would be grateful for that because the meaning of the statement is not entirely clear.</P><Col N="731"/>
      <P>In the case of those over 55, the issue of reintegration into the work force does not apply and is not relevant. Would it be possible &mdash; assuming that the places are available and might otherwise be vacant &mdash; that when the six years have elapsed the community employment contract could be renewed on an annual, discretionary basis? Similarly, for those over 35, where the three years have elapsed, the personal and organisational circumstances allow continuation and there is no queue of people waiting to take the place, could the contract be renewed on an annual, discretionary basis? It would be very helpful if the scheme could be made more flexible in that way.</P>

    <Title>Sugar Beet Industry.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and am pleased to have this opportunity, as we close the political year, to make a plea to the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Government to ensure that the sugar beet industry in this country survives. We know what has happened in Brussels recently in that regard. The EU proposals on the sugar industry, agreed by our Government, have resulted in a situation where there is a serious chance that the Irish sugar industry will be wiped out and sugar beet will not be grown here again. We must ensure that does not happen. The sugar beet industry is important to almost 4,000 growers and to hundreds of workers in the factory in Mallow. It is also of great importance to the broader tillage industry, to many road hauliers and others working in associated areas. In fact, it is estimated that between 7,000 and 8,000 people in rural Ireland are dependent on the sugar beet industry.</P>
      <P>I recognise that the international climate has changed and that the sugar deal has been negotiated and finalised. The finer details, from a legal perspective, will be made clear in the coming weeks. The Minister must now sit down with all of the interested parties to map out a future for the industry and any changes that are required. Unfortunately, there is rampant confusion around the issue at present. A minority of farmers believes it might be possible to continue growing sugar beet but the majority does not see a future. Greencore believes that it will receive the bulk of the compensation package agreed in Brussels, while many farmers believe they will receive most of that money. We must ascertain the facts and the legalities to find out what money is due to whom and when it will be paid over so that we can map the way forward. Much discussion and speculation has taken place on the sugar beet industry becoming the driving force for alternative fuels. A farmer informed me during the week that he grew sugar beet but was not a sugar producer. The crop is suitable for use in alternative fuel production, as well as being <Col N="732"/>beneficial in terms of meeting the carbon emission targets of the Kyoto Agreement.</P>
      <P>The first issue is compensation. The Minister for Agriculture and Food must take charge of the debate and ensure that the bulk of the compensation from Brussels will be paid over to producers, to those who have invested in the industry such as hauliers and to those who work in the industry. If the industry is to survive we will need early decisions.</P>
      <P>We must move mountains to ensure that sugar beet will be grown in 2006. As long as the debate drifts on this becomes less likely, so the Minister for Agriculture and Food must bring the parties together at the earliest stage. Greencore would like to see sugar production continue and, if a financial package could be put together to make it viable, sugar producing farmers would like to keep growing the crop. In addition, workers in the industry want to keep their jobs so we should get all the interested parties together and move forward.</P>
      <P>If it is not possible we should consider alternative uses for the crop. Greencore has a factory in Mallow and still has one in Carlow and, with some adjustment, there is every possibility that these factories could produce biofuels, although I am not sure of the technology involved. I urge the Minister of State to ensure that talks begin quickly to end the confusion and get Greencore, beet growers and their representatives and workers together because the industry as it stands and, possibly, as a future alternative fuel source, is far too important to rural Ireland to allow it to die. On her return from Hong Kong and following a short rest, to which everybody is entitled, the Minister must get a grip on this issue before the final legal package from Brussels, which is due shortly, is announced.</P>
      <P>Every person I meet from the industry seems to have a different interpretation of what is on offer from Brussels and on what will happen next. They cannot all be right. It needs clarification because it is vital for the tillage industry and for rural Ireland. We must keep the plant in Mallow open and support the industry to keep sugar beet growing in the ground. Finland, working within the rules of the European Union, has put together a package to keep its sugar industry alive. I am advised by some growers that for as little as &euro;10 million per annum we could keep sugar production viable. We can only address the issue when everybody sits around the table and faces reality to ensure the tillage industry and, more important, the sugar beet industry, remain viable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Bradford for raising this important issue and for his considered contribution to the debate. This is the third time I have addressed the House on this issue in 2005. <Col N="733"/>On the first occasion Senator Mansergh made an important contribution. This is a matter which has understandably exercised the minds of Oireachtas Members of all parties during the year.</P>
      <P>The recent agreement by the Council of Agriculture Ministers on the reform of the EU sugar regime was the culmination of a protracted and difficult negotiating process. The outcome, from Ireland&rsquo;s perspective, was the best possible deal in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>The reasons reform of the sugar regime could no longer be postponed are well known. As well as the increasing internal EU pressures to bring sugar into line with the other agricultural sectors, there were also huge international pressures. These fell under three main headings, the everything but arms agreement, EBA, the WTO Doha Round of trade negotiations and the ruling by the WTO panel against aspects of the EU sugar regime, following a complaint by Brazil, Thailand and Australia. The recent decision by the WTO arbitrator that the EU must implement the panel ruling by next May added to the pressure for early action. There was also considerable support for the ambition of the UK Presidency to achieve political agreement ahead of this month&rsquo;s WTO ministerial meeting in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The sugar regime in its current form expires at the end of June 2006 so an early decision was needed on future arrangements to avoid a legal vacuum from next July. While it is over a year since the Commission first outlined its thinking on the future shape of the sugar regime, the formal legislative proposals only emerged at the end of June 2005. These proposals turned out to be even more severe than anybody had anticipated and they went even further than the Commission had initially envisaged.</P>
      <P>From the outset, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, availed of every opportunity to highlight the serious repercussions that the reform proposals would have for the Irish industry. Beet growing has long been a valuable cash crop for Irish farmers, as well as playing an important role in the tillage cycle as a break crop. In Brussels, Ireland played an active role in a group of 11 member states which had common cause in opposing the Commission&rsquo;s proposals. Along with her ministerial colleagues from these countries the Minister made joint submissions to the EU Agriculture Commissioner, the most recent one just before the formal discussions of the proposals at the October Council of Ministers meeting. Furthermore the Minister engaged, as did our officials, in an intensive round of discussions with the European Commission, the Presidency and other member states with a view to modifying the proposals to take account of Ireland&rsquo;s particular circumstances. Throughout this period, the Minister kept in close contact <Col N="734"/>with the representatives of the Irish sugar sector, at both production and processing levels.</P>
      <P>On 24 November, after three days of intensive negotiations in Brussels, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, had to make a judgment on what was the best possible deal for Ireland, taking account of the negotiating positions being adopted by other member states. The outcome of the negotiations represents the best possible deal that could have been achieved and is a considerable improvement on the Commission&rsquo;s initial proposals of last June.</P>
      <P>From Ireland&rsquo;s perspective, the main features of the agreement, as already announced, are a lower reduction in the support price of sugar than originally proposed, 36% instead of 39%; a phasing-in of the corresponding reduction in the minimum sugar beet price over four years, instead of the two-step reduction originally proposed; an increased rate of compensation for beet growers of up to 64% of the price reduction, to be paid in the form of direct payments worth approximately &euro;121 million to Irish beet growers over the next seven years; a once-off payment worth almost &euro;44 million exclusively for beet growers in the event that sugar beet production ceases in Ireland; and an aid package of up to &euro;145 million for the economic, social and environmental costs of restructuring the Irish sugar industry involving factory closure and renunciation of quota. In the event that sugar production ceases in Ireland, a once-off payment of almost &euro;44 million would be available for growers. The restructuring fund of up to &euro;145 million would also become available to provide compensation for the economic, social and environmental costs arising from factory closure. The agreement provides that at least 10% of the fund shall be reserved for sugar beet growers and machinery contractors to compensate notably for losses arising from investment in specialised machinery. This amount may be increased by member states after consultation with interested parties as long as the financial breakdown of the elements of the restructuring plan is kept balanced according to a sound economic proposal.</P>
      <P>The formal legal texts giving effect to the agreement will be adopted by the Council of Ministers early next year after the opinion of the European Parliament has been received. The Commission will then come forward with proposals for detailed implementing rules. Pending the publication and adoption of the European Union relevant regulations, it is not possible to provide any further information but as with the earlier phases of CAP reform, the Department of Agriculture and Food will make timely arrangements for implementing the new regime in due course.</P>
      <P>I assure Deputies Bradford and Mansergh and other public representatives that the Minister for <Col N="735"/>Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, have had numerous detailed meetings with representatives of the various organisations with a stake or interest in this industry. The Minister has met the main farming organisations since the Council of Agriculture Ministers, as has the Minister of State, Deputy Browne. I know this is an important issue in a number of counties. Senator Bradford requested that the Minister and Minister of State should maintain contact with all the stakeholders and he can be assured that, despite the busy diary and schedule of commitments which the Minister has, she will continue to consult with all the relevant players in this important matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">What the Minister of State said is already on the public record. I ask him to request the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, to set up some type of forum or mechanism to allow <Col N="736"/>everyone to talk at one table, because we are getting conflicting messages, signals and expectations. If the future of this industry is to be provided for, and if we are to ensure the growth of sugar beet in 2006 and onwards, be it for the production of sugar or alternative energy fuels, we need everyone talking together now. We cannot wait until March or April when the Brussels legalities are finalised. Farmers and the industry must plan ahead.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to set up some kind of national forum on the future of the sugar beet industry with all concerned parties in the immediate future. Otherwise, we will have no industry left to talk about by next Christmas. The situation is that serious. I know the Minister of State will consider my proposal.</P>
