	<P>I have received notice from Senator Bannon that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Finance to discuss the extension of the rural renewal scheme in County Longford for a further two years in light of the unprecedented number of development applications and the necessity for completion of current works.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2005 &mdash; Committee Stage, to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 5.15 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes, those of other Senators not to exceed ten minutes and Senators may share time. Report and Final Stages of the Bill will be taken at 6.15 p.m. and will conclude not later than 8 p.m. There will be a sos from 5.15 p.m. to 6.15 p.m.</P>
      <P>It has been said to me twice since we came into the ante-room and it would be marvellous if we could have business tomorrow morning and be free in the afternoon. However, the difficulty concerns ministerial availability. We can all be out canvassing in the morning rather than in the afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that allowed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>The Cabinet is deliberating on the Travers report today so we do not yet know the final context. However, newspaper reports suggest the T&aacute;naiste referred to systemic maladministration within the Department of Health and Children. It will be interesting to see how blame is apportioned and what degree of action <Col N="1142"/>takes place following this. If there was maladministration within the Department, effective action should be taken.</P>
      <P>The report is likely to be published this evening. Given its implications, I ask the Leader to consider the feasibility of the report being debated in the House this week. Many people are asking questions on what is likely to happen with regard to residents in private and public nursing homes. Therefore, I and other Members would like to question the Minister in regard to what is likely to happen, whether the Statute of Limitations will apply, whether those in private nursing homes will be eligible as a result of the introduction in 2001 of medical cards for those over 70 years of age and many other questions. The Leader should consider the feasibility of rescheduling this week&rsquo;s business to accommodate discussion of the report with the Minister.</P>
      <P>On another health-related issue, the three hallmarks of the health strategy as embodied by this Administration were supposed to be quality, fairness and equality of access. This morning, the accident and emergency unit at Cork University Hospital closed due to increased pressure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>It is open again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>During the week, a prominent oncologist left the hospital leaving only one remaining oncologist. An accident and emergency unit has been lying idle for over a year. If we judge these events in the context of the three hallmarks, we have not achieved quality, fairness or easy access. There are other questions I would like to ask when the T&aacute;naiste comes to the House because in focusing on the report, we may take our minds off other issues in regard to the health services.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Willie Walsh on his senior appointment with British Airways. It says a lot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not in order to congratulate from the floor of the House. One can praise a person but others might have different views and it would not be fair to the person when he is not present. I call Senator O&rsquo;Toole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Given what we often discussed and the points made in the House during the debate on Seanad reform, it would be wrong to ignore the Travers report this week. We should debate it tonight after taking the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill or tomorrow morning. We have space to deal with it at either time and I would like to hear the Leader&rsquo;s view on this. Today&rsquo;s business can proceed as planned and I do not propose any change to it. I do not foresee the slightest difficulty in debating the report this evening or tomorrow morning and it is crucial we do so.</P>
      <P>The point made by Senator Finucane is crucial. This will be the test to ascertain where blame lies and how it is dealt with, who is responsible for what went wrong, where we go from here and what conclusions or recommendations can be <Col N="1143"/>extrapolated from the report, if it contains conclusions, which I presume it must. It is important for Members to have a view on this matter at an early stage. If the report is published this afternoon, there is not the slightest reason we cannot debate it today and put the matter on the record.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to a related matter. We have faced a long court action and much discussion, argument and controversy about nursing homes. With regard to the question of unqualified and untrained teachers in national schools, the Government is walking itself into another difficult situation and leaving itself open to legal action. The requirement in the Constitution that the State provide for free primary education implies free professional primary education. Now that teachers are available there is no longer any excuse for not having fully qualified, fully trained teachers in primary schools. We should ask the Minister to attend the House to discuss this. It is only a matter of time before the Government faces a class action on a constitutional basis alleging it is not complying with its constitutional imperative in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>No doubt the Cathaoirleach is aware that this is International Women&rsquo;s Day. The Leader and I have come from a meeting with an extraordinary group of women, the McCartney sisters and Robert McCartney&rsquo;s partner, who are in Dublin today. It was a privilege to meet them. I applaud their courage and admire their stance in the cause of justice and truth. The leadership they have given has been awesome and is an example to all of us. I am sure all in this House support the work being done by the McCartney family not only in pursuing justice for their brother and partner but also in standing up for justice and truth on this island. That work gives us an opportunity to build a politics in Northern Ireland based on a foundation of democracy for the future.</P>
      <P>Since this is International Women&rsquo;s Day I also ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Health and Children why BreastCheck, the national screening programme, has still not been fully rolled out. I am sure the Leader does not need reminding there are women throughout the country with early cancers now undetected because of the failure to roll out BreastCheck. I am in regular contact with the organisation and I know delays are being experienced. I know the Leader agrees that we must find out what is causing this scandalous delay.</P>
      <P>I support the calls for an early debate on the Travers report. Even before its publication we know how important it is not only for administration in the Department of Health and Children but to consider why officialdom has failed, if that is the case, and has not acted. That is of crucial importance to administration in this country and it is critical that we debate it at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1144"/>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no doubt the Travers report is eagerly awaited and there is much speculation about its contents. It is also clear that the House should debate a report of such importance. It is worth pointing out, however, that tomorrow the House will consider the Health (Amendment) Bill 2005 for three hours on Second Stage. In effect that will become a debate on the Travers report if that report is available to us. I am sure many of the contributions will reflect that, so the proposed debate can in effect be held within the existing proposed business for tomorrow.</P>
      <P>I understand the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s stricture about congratulating people. Nevertheless, congratulations are due to David Gillick for winning the 400 m and Alistair Cragg for winning the 3,000 m in the European indoor athletics championships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not in order because such congratulations would be unending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been a matter of practice over the years to congratulate people who have brought home gold medals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Like the Castlepollard hurlers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no one to congratulate. A matter of major concern is that the Competition Authority has today found that the cost of insurance has been kept artificially high in Ireland. Worse, it found that barriers are preventing new entrants to the market. In 2003 and 2004 we rushed through legislation in this House to introduce very necessary reforms, on which there was all-party agreement, by means of the PIAB Act and the Civil Liability and Courts Act. That the Competition Authority has found today, two years later, that consumers are still overpaying, must be a matter of major concern to all of us and to everyone who has to pay insurance countrywide. The Leader might ask the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment how we could apply pressure to the insurance sector in order to reduce costs and charges to consumers. A number of Senators serve on the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business which has already issued a report on the issue and another is forthcoming. The joint committee has discussed some worthwhile measures. However, the rapid escalation in insurance profits has not been matched by a corresponding reduction in premiums to consumers. Will the Leader arrange for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to come before the Seanad regarding this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I previously raised an issue about fishing of our inland waterways. I ask that the appropriate Minister come before the House to hear the views of Members pertaining to certain conclusive evidence reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday, that one of the most famous carp fisheries in the country outside of Mullingar, Gaul<Col N="1145"/>moylestown Lake is being over-fished. The stock is being taken out without being replaced. This is a source of great worry to the local angling fraternity. I am sure Senator Dardis, who is a keen angler, and other Members will bear that out.</P>
      <P>I am increasingly concerned about the increased incidence of type 2 diabetes. This condition now affects between 3% and 4% of the population and merits screening, such is the increase in its incidence. It is an extremely dangerous condition and has serious implications for the health services and sufferers. I ask the Leader to arrange for the two appropriate Ministers to come before the House at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to comment on the Leader&rsquo;s statements. I think we all support the Leader in her struggles with Ministers. It is important that we make a stand as I have been in this House for nearly 20 years and cannot remember this sort of chopping and changing of dates. The Seanad used to meet at approximately the same time every week. It is difficult to have one&rsquo;s diary in order if our sitting days and times vary so much. I support Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, who is a strong Leader. She referred to the issue whereby the Seanad meets at different times each day and each week. We will support the Leader if she seeks some kind of regularity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>That is very kind of the Senator but I do not need it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Leader does not need our support, I would be grateful if the Seanad could have a more regular ordering of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the time when we are meant to be here, is it not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator will have an opportunity to reply to Senator Norris later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Thank you. My apologies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is unsatisfactory and unprofessional and does not suit the vast majority of Members. They would say the same on the Leader&rsquo;s side of the House in private.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise the report of the Human Rights Commission and its observations about abortion. I know this is a very sensitive and delicate issue and no one wishes to re-run the abortion referenda. However, we did have a referendum which inserted wording into the Constitution which, to the detriment of the medical profession, has never been articulated in law as it should. The people have spoken so why do legislators not face up to the situation?</P>
      <P>I refer to a study by a women named Catherine Conlon which deals with rogue counselling agencies that engage in intimidating women who have crisis pregnancies. They are not regulated because they do not offer the option of abortion information, so the Garda can do nothing about <Col N="1146"/>it. For example, there is a case of a woman who went in and thought she was going to receive dispassionate advice but was interviewed in a windowless basement room by a man who showed her a video of an abortion and photographs of an aborted foetus and then strung her along until it was too late for her to have the procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon"><NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
	<P>Killing a child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>This is wrong. As legislators, we ought to look at and address that subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator looking for a debate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am looking for a debate on the report of the Human Rights Commission with particular regard to the legislative deficit. The people have told us what they want and it is in the Constitution, but we are afraid to deal with it.</P>
      <P>I also wish to ask for a debate on the situation involving a family who went on air to publicise the difficulties they face with four autistic children. I heard that broadcast. Within a matter of days, the children had been taken from them by the health board and now they are being asked to undergo a psychiatric assessment. I would like to have a debate so that we can have some information on this issue. I have experienced both sides of the caring profession: the helpful, compassionate and professional side and the arrogant, ignorant and bullying side. I would like to know which side of the line the behaviour of the health board falls on. I believe it is the arrogant, ignorant and bullying side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a question of natural justice regarding some of the statements in the Travers report so we will wait and see if it will be approved and published. If it is published, we will have an opportunity to debate the issue in connection with the Bill before the House or at another date. I hope, Senator Finucane, you got through to the helpline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Leyden must address his remarks through the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I reiterate my request of last week that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform come to the House to discuss the regulations under the Solicitors (Amendment) Act 2002, which were signed on 7 November 2002. These regulations seemingly allow solicitors to advertise for business regarding nursing home claims. Certain politicians are also jumping on the bandwagon and calling public meetings. I will name these politicians and I will name and shame the two legal firms that are abusing the system and advertising on radio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <?oasys [cl11.5]?>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Leyden is seeking a debate but he cannot refer to anyone outside the House. That is not in order.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1147"/>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>If you allow me, a Chathaoirligh, I will play in the House recordings of the advertisements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Leyden, you are seeking a debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the case. Certain Opposition politicians are jumping on the bandwagon and calling public meetings to exploit this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator, you are entitled to seek a debate but you cannot refer to anyone outside the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>There is widespread confusion and fear among the many parents throughout the country who have autistic children as to what their fate might be if they criticise the Government or any other agency regarding the lack of facilities for families in great need. This has arisen following the order last week to commit the four children of a Meath family into care. It was high-handed of the Health Service Executive in this case to commit these children to respite care and overlook the fact that both parents had given up their jobs and deprived themselves of earnings in order to provide for their children where the agencies failed to support them. It is extremely important, and I support what Senator Norris said, that the Minister for Health and Children or the Minister for Education and Science immediately intervene to resolve this situation and allay the continuing and growing fear among many parents throughout the country that their children will be taken into care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>There are nine Senators offering but only ten minutes remaining on the Order of Business. I will not accept any other Senators who wish to speak and I ask the nine Senators offering to be brief. I call Senator Daly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Finance have been discussing the acute hospital budget and the development plans for acute hospitals that will be put into operation this year. Will the Leader persuade the Minister for Health and Children to as soon as possible provide the House with an outline what has been agreed and the projects that will proceed this year? I am especially interested in the Ennis hospital development plan, for which &euro;20 million has been set aside. I would like to get an indication from the Minister soon as to what is the likelihood for this development plan being undertaken this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I was impressed to discover that the infection rates in hospitals differ in different countries. This is especially the case with regard to the MSRA infection rate. In Britain the figure <Col N="1148"/>has dropped since the introduction of league tables of the most dangerous hospitals. If the message for management is that what gets measured gets dealt with, this is an ideal way for Ireland to operate. There have been problems with safety in hospitals. In Denmark there is a zero rate of MRSA occurrence as it has a system of cleaning individual bedsteads once patients leave. However, there are various ways of going about this. Can we introduce topics during the Minister&rsquo;s visit to this House that are not limited to the Health (Amendment) Bill 2005? The question of health is high on the agenda of many Senators and in the upcoming by-elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That would be a matter for the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the view that a debate on human rights must take place, particularly regarding the most essential right of all, the right to life. I would welcome the debate. It is poignant that, on International Women&rsquo;s Day, this right would be upheld and I ask the Leader to arrange this debate as soon as possible. Reaffirming that basic right could do no harm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call for a debate on the Travers report as there is a great deal of public disquiet about the manner in which the Government is handling the issue. It was twice brought to my notice at recent clinics that there are patients in long-stay institutions in the midlands who found no reference to this fact upon contacting the Health Service Executive. This is alarming as the only option left to these two families is to contact their solicitors. The Government is creating this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Has Senator Bannon a vested interest in solicitors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I also call for a debate on the Hanly report and on the Minister for Health and Children&rsquo;s actions in dismantling services throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>We have addressed that matter. It is gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Finucane spoke on events in Cork and Limerick. Services provided by ear, nose and throat clinics have been withdrawn from three main midland towns since the week beginning 28 February 2005. The towns involved are the Leader&rsquo;s home town of Athlone, Senator Glynn&rsquo;s town of Mullingar and my own town of Longford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>We will look after ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1149"/>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>This is causing the region&rsquo;s public great alarm. Two weeks ago saw the withdrawal of the taxi service for elderly people attending a clinic. This issue must be put on the record when the Minister for Health and Children clarifies the situation regarding the Longford-Westmeath General Hospital, which will come under significant threat after the next general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>There would be real trouble. We can go back to the 1980s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be timely to invite the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, to discuss the new planning guidelines as they relate to rural housing. It is high on his list of priorities and he has been exceptionally proactive in recent months in trying to bring this debate to a successful conclusion. However, there are still tens if not hundreds of cases throughout Ireland of young people being inexplicably refused permission to build in their own areas and on their own lands. The debate has been extended for longer than is necessary and it may be time for public representatives who are involved, such as those from this House, to be updated on the current status of the issue and to have an opportunity to comment on whatever guidelines may come into force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Norris about the need for the Minister for Education and Science to address the House. Parents of autistic children are currently entitled to a home tuition grant of approximately 40 hours per week at a maximum payable rate of &euro;520. However, it is crazy that there are no educational qualifications required of the person carrying out the work, that there is no supervision of who is carrying out the work involved and that children may not be in receipt of the full 40 hours per week. The needs of children with autism are even more special than the needs of children in mainstream schools. This is a ludicrous scenario. No doubt, down the line the State will be taken to court by either the children when they become adults or the parents which would be a waste of taxpayers&rsquo; money. Many parents groups have been formed to try and get special schools set up which would use the applied behavioural analysis method, but they are not getting the funding. However, money is being squandered elsewhere in a haphazard manner. It is time we had a proper debate on the issue.</P>
      <P>With regard to the appointment of Mr. Willie Walsh to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I just wish to make a general point. There is egg on the face of the Government. It is a reflection of the loss of confidence of the business community&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>For the fourth or fifth time, I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Foreign Affairs, or the Minister of State, to the House to discuss the situation in Sudan. The Government, this House and the European Union are silent on this issue. The worst sin of all is that the United Nations is also silent. The death toll has reached hundreds of thousands and 1 million people are being displaced as we watch. We must be seen to take a strong and proactive line on this issue and must demand that the United Nations fulfils its mandate. We have debated Iraq in this House on many occasions over the past 18 months. The scale of the turmoil, terror, killing and murder in Sudan is every bit as bad, but the issue is not getting the political attention it deserves. Our Government must use its voice at European and United Nations levels to plea for the people of Sudan. We have waited long enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>We got good news in the past few weeks on road development and on significant sums of money for the NRA. However, there is still no money for the Clare-Galway route. We also need money for the railway. Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Dooley referred to this issue last week and I support what they said with regard to the Sligo-Limerick line. I hope we have a debate on the issue, particularly on the missing section, namely, Collooney to Ennis. The other parts of the line north of Collooney and south of Ennis are included in the plans. A debate on the issue would be timely, particularly in view of the traffic problems, such as those at Claregalway on the N17. We should get the go-ahead and funding in the ten-year transport envelope for the Sligo-Limerick line. I would not worry about where to start as we will find a place to start once we get the go-ahead.</P>

	<P>Before I call the next speaker I am sure that Members of the House will wish to join with me in welcoming a parliamentary delegation from the Kenyan National Assembly, led by the Honourable Mr. David Musila, MP, Deputy Speaker of the Assembly, who are in the Distinguished Visitors Gallery.</P>
      <P>On my own behalf, and on behalf of all my colleagues in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, I extend a very warm welcome to them and sincere good wishes for a very successful visit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I too welcome the Kenyan delegation. I sympathise with the Leader of the House on being unable to get a Minister to come to the House tomorrow morning. I am not surprised by this because the majority of Ministers now conduct constituency tours on Wednesdays.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I presume that is the reason the Leader cannot get a Minister. It is disgraceful that we cannot proceed in the morning because we do not have a Minister available.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange for a debate on Aer Lingus? It is almost four months since Mr. Willie Walsh handed in his notice and we need an urgent debate to discuss the future of Aer Lingus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call for a debate on the future of Aer Lingus. As Senator Finucane correctly pointed out, it is more than four months since its chief executive resigned in controversial circumstances and a decision on his replacement has not been made. Time is of the essence. The future viability of the company will be undermined unless a decision is made.</P>
      <P>I refer to the issue of children who are taken into care. I was contacted by a woman earlier who has been through the wringer over the past year because a spurious allegation was made against her that her children were being abused and neglected. She asked what redress was open to her given that, at the end of the day, she has gone through a year of turmoil and upset but the person who made the allegation cannot be named by the authorities. While the correct procedures are in place, unfortunately great upset is being caused by such allegations, which are made by people who may lack information or who may not like the individuals about whom they complain. The Minister for Health and Children should come to the House to outline what procedures need to be changed to ensure this will not happen again.</P>

	<P>Senator Finucane asked for a debate on the Travers report, which we will not receive until tomorrow but I do not know at what <Col N="1152"/>time. I take the Senator&rsquo;s point and we will have an opportunity to discuss it.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole also referred to this report. He suggested that the debate on it could be taken later but Oireachtas Members will not the report until tomorrow. It would be premature to have a debate this evening. The Senator also brought up the matter of unqualified teachers. I heard a good debate on RTE radio between John Carr and a young woman who had qualified as a teacher but was finding it difficult to get a job. The Senator issued a warning about what could happen on the matter, particularly in the context of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Meara reminded us that it is International Women&rsquo;s Day and she applauded the McCartney sisters. She also raised the issue of BreastCheck, which can identify breast cancer early, and we should debate it. She also referred to the Travers report.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis referred to the Health (Amendment) Bill, while Senator Coghlan sought a debate on insurance costs.</P>

	<P>Senator Glynn called for debates on fishing and type 2 diabetes.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris mentioned the Human Rights Commission report and I would very much like to read and debate it.</P>
      <P>Senator Ulick Burke raised the case of the four autistic children who were taken into care. I only know what I have read but I am sure there are many sides to that case and my hope is that the children will be best served and well looked after through whatever care is given to them.</P>
      <P>Senator Leyden also referred to the Travers report and the care of autistic children. Senator Daly sought a debate on the budget of acute hospitals. Senator Quinn raised the issue of hospital cleanliness and variation in practices. I agree with him completely.</P>
      <P>Senator Hanafin requested a debate on the Human Rights Commission report and the more important debate on human life, about which he feels strongly.</P>
      <P>Senator Bannon commented on disquiet about the Travers report. We all deal with it in our clinics but I am sure he has read the newspaper reports. We talk about solicitors ambulance chasing. However, far more serious things are happening now which I thought I would never see. Public representatives have sought to hold clinics on the matter. Personally, I find that an appalling way to conduct business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, Senators do not hold clinics on that issue. The general public visit them to raise it and that is a reflection on the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I spoke not of Senators but of public representatives. That was the wording I used. However, they are fellows of the Senator.</P>
      <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; wished to discuss the new planning guidelines. He has asked for a debate on them previously and we will seek to have the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, attend the House. Senator Browne raised the home education grant to children who, for one reason or another, cannot attend a general educational facility. We could invite the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin. It would be a good matter for debate on the Adjournment, if the Senator does not mind my saying so.</P>
      <P>Senator Bradford called for a debate on Sudan. As soon as next week&rsquo;s business has been completed, we will seek to hold one on Darfur. Senator Kitt raised the western rail line, as did Senator O&rsquo;Toole and others last week. I believe that the report is to be published shortly, and as soon as we receive it, we will debate it.</P>
      <P>Senator Paddy Burke called for a report on Aer Lingus. I might point out that the matter is not with the Minister. The Bill was to come before the House tomorrow morning. However, so many amendments have been tabled to the Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill 2002 that the Civil Service was unable to assemble it all for tomorrow morning, when it was to be dealt with. I have no difficulty in getting Ministers to attend the House. I do not mean that they are falling over themselves to do so, but I pursue them in the correct manner, as does my office.</P>
      <P>Senator Feighan raised the issue of Aer Lingus and children taken into care. He seems to have a particular case in mind. Such matters, I have found from personal experience, make for very sensitive and delicate cases. When one considers it in the round and takes all the facts into account, there is no &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; solution. Individual cases have individual circumstances. I know the Senator will understand that point. They are very delicate and, while I know that the Senator would not do so, they do not warrant the immediate taking of sides. It is often the case that many matters are involved.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2005 is of course on Committee Stage, so there are no set times for speaking. I mistakenly said that, but one speaks on an amendment.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to the House.</P>

    <P>Section 1 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">NEW SECTIONS.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P><Col N="1154"/>
      <P LI="1">In page 6, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;2.&mdash;The Minister shall within 6 months from after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the earnings disregards applicable to schemes operated under the Social Welfare Acts and the impact of transition to work on the recipients of secondary benefits attaching to such schemes.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister to the House to debate this important Bill. A good deal of discussion was given to the Bill in the D&aacute;il, although my colleague, Senator Terry, has tabled specific amendments which have not been discussed in the D&aacute;il. My own amendments arise from the D&aacute;il discussions and I hope the Minister will broaden his view on them. I look forward to the debate on those amendments.</P>
      <P>This amendment concerns income disregards. I read the Minister&rsquo;s comments on the Committee Stage debate in the D&aacute;il and I know he agrees that this is an extremely important area. The Minister may not be aware that it has been referred to already on the Order of Business. As public representatives we regularly find ourselves at the coalface of people&rsquo;s experience of the social welfare system and their struggle to overcome the poverty trap, particularly their dependency on social welfare payments. There is an onus on us as public representatives, and particularly on the Minister, to ensure we have a system which on the one hand supports people sufficiently while, on the other hand, does not create such a level of dependency that they are unable or unwilling to break out of that dependency. A concern that would be shared across the House is that we must be careful to ensure we do everything we possibly can to put in place the supports people need to break out of social welfare dependency, and the whole issue of means testing and income disregards is crucial area. That is the reason I included it in the first amendment.</P>
      <P>I want to examine the impact of earnings disregards. We are trying to create a system which supports people, in particular those wishing to return to work. People are concerned that returning to work will have a major impact on their social welfare benefits in particular. I am aware much work has been done on the back to work allowance, which I welcome. That has been very successful and it does support people but we still have a road to travel on this whole area.</P>
      <P>Further consideration must be given to the impact of the earnings disregards rules in particular on low paid employment. If we are talking about people who are struggling to get back to work but if there is little or no difference between being on a social welfare payment or being at work, where is the incentive for them to do that? We must examine the impact of low pay in that regard too and employers&rsquo; responsibilities in this area, particularly in the context of a booming economy and so on. If our aim is to allow people <Col N="1155"/>to break out of the poverty trap, we must examine how the transition from social welfare into employment can be supported as fully as possible. There is no doubt that the differences between getting a social welfare payment and taking a job, and the impact of that on other benefits, is where we see the full impact of the income disregards.</P>
      <P>We must do everything we can to attract people into the working environment and something people have to consider when trying to return to work, particularly women, is the cost of child care. If people are considering taking up a relatively low paid job and take into account the cost of child care, they will discover that it will not be worth their while to do so. I wonder if, like me, the Minister has been informed of this when knocking on doors in Kildare. Women on full-time incomes who are often very well paid decide, when they give birth to their second or third children, to give up work because in light of the child care costs involved, it is not worth their while to remain in employment.</P>
      <P>People who are in receipt of social welfare payments and who are considering taking up low paid jobs must weigh up what they would earn, on one hand, and the costs relating to child care, transport to work, etc., on the other. The costs to which I refer are actually a disincentive for these people in terms of their taking up employment.</P>
      <P>We must consider the impact of the income disregard in this area and the way in which legislation, rules, regulations, etc., can act as supports for people and make it attractive for them to enter or return to the workforce. I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and support Senator O&rsquo;Meara&rsquo;s amendment. Sufficient consideration has not been given to the earnings disregard in respect of those in low paid employment who are eligible to receive social welfare benefits. Senator O&rsquo;Meara has outlined the anomaly that exists in very coherent terms. When one compares the earning capacity of a person in low paid employment against what he or she would receive in terms of social welfare payments and secondary benefits, it is apparent that consideration has not been given to the income disregard in the context of eligibility for such payments and benefits. We must make it attractive for people to give up social welfare payments and re-enter the workforce. I support the amendment in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators for their contributions. They will appreciate that the technicalities involved, the procedures with which the House must comply and the wording of the amendment are such that it is not possible for me to accept it as it stands. I am aware, however, that the amendments have been tabled in order to facilitate discussion and debate.</P><Col N="1156"/>
      <P>As stated on a number of occasions, I support measures for encouraging people to return to work and education. Good disregards are important in terms of making this happen. In that context, the first &euro;146.50 of weekly earnings plus 50% of the balance to &euro;293 is now disregarded in respect of one-parent family payments. In budget 2005 we provided for a transitional 50% payment for six months after the &euro;293 weekly threshold has been exceeded. That disregard is substantially greater than those that exist in other areas. As regards unemployment assistance, 40% of the net earnings from part-time work is disregarded. On disability allowance, the first &euro;120 of earnings from rehabilitative employment is disregarded.</P>
      <P>Retention of the rent and mortgage interest supplement and other secondary benefits is mainly done on a tapered basis. This is designed to make it easier for people to come to terms with their new circumstances. For example, the rent and mortgage supplement can be retained on a tapered basis for up to four years as follows &mdash; 75% in the first year; 50% in the second year; and 25% in the third and fourth years. The back to work allowance and family income supplement are also disregarded in terms of assessing household income for the purposes of the &euro;317 income limit.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Senators in terms of their argument for a more tapered retention system. We have sought to build this in to the various schemes. It has been clearly designed to encourage people back to work and back to education. Moving gradually from social security payments and other benefits to education and to work is the way to organise this. In that way, incentives will be increased. All these initiatives are designed to ensure that the sudden loss of social security payments is no longer an issue. It is critical that all of our schemes avoid the sudden loss situation and that they are tailored and tapered to be gradual. By doing that, we can encourage people to take up jobs.</P>
      <P>On that basis, I accept the spirit of the amendment. The amendment stipulates that I report to the House on the earliest disregard applicable to certain schemes. I have no difficulty discussing it in these Houses on a regular basis. There are many opportunities to do so, such as parliamentary questions, debates and legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his response. I appreciate that he will come back to the House to provide us with very valuable information. Some work has been done on this area through the National Economic and Social Forum. I look forward to seeing evidence of the impact of the disregards. Does the Minister know if there is successful entry into the workforce by people on social welfare as a result of this? Is the tapering working and is there evidence that people are coming off social welfare dependency and into the workforce?</P>
      <P>I recently met a woman in my office in Nenagh who showed me a letter she had received. It <Col N="1157"/>stated that she was 57 cent over the income limit for a dietary allowance. I thought that was a classic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to see that letter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I can get the Minister a copy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>We have rules and cut-off points, but at the same time we have to be sensible. The clearest evidence that the transition to work is having an effect is the falling unemployment figures. People are coming off unemployment and into the workforce. There is a also a constant flow of people back to education. However, I accept that we have to get a clearer measurement on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 6, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;2.&mdash;The Minister shall within 6 months from after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the impact of the social welfare system on one parent families and on proposals to remove the restriction on formation of a family unit which presently applies to recipients of such payments, and to alleviate the requirement that income disregard be assessed by reference to any particular week rather than averaged over a year or other period.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This amendment relates to the impact of the social welfare system on one parent families and on proposals to remove the restriction on the formation of a family unit, which currently applies to recipients of the lone parent allowance. It also relates to proposals to alleviate the requirement that income disregard be assessed by reference to any particular week rather than averaged over a year or other period. The amendment is quite clear, therefore, and raises a number of issues to which we must give priority. One such issue is how we can manage the matter of lone parenting. As the Minister pointed out in the D&aacute;il, lone parents are not just single women; we are also talking about widows, widowers and other groups. The most recent debate on this area has focused on the classic definition of lone parents &mdash; usually young women, often in their teens, who have one or more children, live in local authority housing, are dependent on social welfare, unemployed and need support. I wish to concentrate my remarks on that group in particular. As a public representative, I am in constant contact with such women and am concerned by the lack of support for them.</P>
      <P>I want to examine in particular the rent allowance system because most of the representations I receive from lone parents concern local authority housing. I fully support such women in their efforts to find accommodation because I see it as <Col N="1158"/>a way out of the dependency cycle in which they find themselves. I advise them, however, that they need to be in training or work but how will they go about doing so? Being in a local authority house means they are paying rent at a manageable level and are not trapped in the rent allowance cycle. I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s response to that point. I know he is conducting a review in this area arising from the recent controversial public debate. I hope the Minister will examine ways of ensuring we support, encourage, enable and empower this group of parents to participate actively in education and the workforce for their own sakes.</P>
      <P>I have advised young women &mdash; some of whom are not yet even 20 years of age and have one or two children &mdash; that they will still be young when their children are in secondary school. They may only be in their early thirties, so what will they do then? Are they going to sit around and do nothing? For their own sake and that of their children, they should be actively involved in education or the workforce. It is a matter of concern to us all that such lone parents are particularly at risk of repeating the cycle of dependency. In other words, their children are being raised in an environment of poverty, lone parenting and full dependency on the social welfare system. That cannot be regarded as a good thing.</P>
      <P>Such people are generally living in local authority housing or in private accommodation that is largely supported by rent allowances. Child care is critical in breaking that dependency. The children of such lone parents live in poverty and are at high risk of remaining so. It is important, therefore, that those children receive the best quality of child care available, not just to support their parents but also to give them the best start in life. This support should be available throughout their childhood years, thus ensuring they are less likely to remain in an inevitable cycle of dependency. The State must examine what measures need to be put in place to achieve such a goal. Financial support for lone parents must remain at current levels because we cannot fail to support them. I hope we have put behind us the time when lone parents were stigmatised and received no assistance.</P>
      <P>Now is the time to examine what real supports we can put in place. I appeal to the Minister to discuss this matter with his colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who has responsibility for the equal opportunities child care programme. Both Ministers should examine the option of channelling funds to disadvantaged families in communities, such as some in the Nenagh area, that may not be as disadvantaged as poor areas in our major cities. We must consider how child care facilities can be used to support children and parents, as well as education and work initiatives. Such supports should be integrated and regarded as a whole. That is the only way of breaking this cycle of dependency.</P><Col N="1159"/>
      <P>It must be a matter of concern to us that young women are continually entering the social welfare system, who effectively choose to be lone parents. We cannot and must not accept such a development as inevitable, however. The amendment has been tabled in the context of the current debate on lone parents. We will not be acting responsibly unless we examine this matter closely and take it on. We must constantly review and update the support mechanisms in addition to being flexible. I would like the Minister to respond on the rent allowance issue which is the single biggest disincentive for many young women to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Meara&rsquo;s amendment. It is our duty to support lone parents. That 31% of them are living in consistent poverty is all the more reason we should support them in every possible way. One must look at the Government&rsquo;s poor record in this regard, although it may not have happened on the current Minister&rsquo;s watch. I recall the &ldquo;savage 16&rdquo; cuts. Senator O&rsquo;Meara referred to some of them but the cut in the back-to-education allowance was only partially reversed in budget 2005. That allowance enabled people to help themselves.</P>
      <P>The Government was forced to reverse certain cuts, including the cr&egrave;che supplement and the widow&rsquo;s and lone parent&rsquo;s allowances. Senator O&rsquo;Meara referred to the issue of child care which comes into the equation. Last week, I commended the equal opportunities child care programme because there is no doubt that it provides capital assistance in disadvantaged areas. Social welfare services to such areas need to be integrated in order to help children and their parents. In this regard, the Minister should contact his counterpart in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to ensure such an integration of services in support of children and their parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>As Senators are aware, this debate has been going on for some time. I appreciate that the amendment before the House has been tabled for <i>pro forma</i> reasons to allow us to discuss the issue. I would have no difficulty in returning to the House to debate this subject from time to time. Indeed, I doubt if I could avoid it, given that the subject is so controversial.</P>
      <P>Senators have raised a number of issues. Some 79,181 persons are in receipt of one parent family payments, compared to a figure of 58,000 in 1997. We are now moving increasingly to localise the administration of the lone parent&rsquo;s allowance. That move is well under way which means the allowance will be dealt with locally rather than nationally and will bring lone parents more fully into the system. By getting closer to the system we will be in a position to help them on an individual basis.</P>
      <P>As Senator O&rsquo;Meara said, one-parent families do not form a homogenous group. They include widows, widowers, separated and divorced <Col N="1160"/>people, unmarried people and so on. It is important that we take that into account in discussing lone parents.</P>
      <P>I have spoken publicly on many occasions about the cohabiting rule. I am determined that we will examine this matter. I do not have a solution but it is not good social policy that requires inspectors to check up on homes to ensure that fathers are not living there. Having said that, it is a lone parent&rsquo;s allowance and until we find a solution we have to continue with the current system. I would like to find a solution to that.</P>
      <P>It is generally accepted that the most effective way out of poverty for all ages is through employment. One of my main objectives is to provide lone parents with employment and to ensure they are able to return to education. A recent figure indicated that only 50% of lone parents had completed primary education. That is a cause of concern. We will have to take a long and close look at how we can provide educational opportunities for that group of lone parents.</P>
      <P>We have to approach the debate from the point of view of not looking at lone parents as a problem. We must consider them as a national resource that is available to the workforce and to the education system, if that is their choice, rather than seeing them as a problem that has to be paid for and solved, as if signing a cheque solves the social issue when it does not.</P>
      <P>This is a significant challenge and the solutions are not easy but the direction is clear. We must find a way to lead and provide choice in terms of back to education opportunities and work. We must also examine the issue of cohabitation in terms of what kind of society would emerge if we were to continue to stand over the current system in the way we have to at present for administrative purposes. If we look at it from the child&rsquo;s point of view, it is not a social policy with which we can continue in the long term. We must find a way to deal with the matter.</P>
      <P>I spoke already about the disregards. In the context of lone parents they are designed to encourage people to return to employment. Senator O&rsquo;Meara asked me specifically about rent allowance. I am not sure if she suggested, as has been done on many occasions, that what lone parents worry about most is losing their rent allowance. It is fairly solid income&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>Losing the rent allowance is a disincentive to going back to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a difficult area. Any payment made to somebody who is unemployed &mdash; one has to be unemployed to get the rent allowance &mdash; could be called a disincentive. One could incentivise anyone fairly quickly by taking away his or her payments. He or she would get up the next morning with a great incentive but that would not be fair. I do not think Senator O&rsquo;Meara is suggesting we do that.</P>
      <P>The rent allowance is available to everybody who is unemployed or needs accommodation, not <Col N="1161"/>just lone parents. It is a good scheme that is much appreciated by lone parents and others who need it. Senator O&rsquo;Meara is correct in that if one takes a step towards employment, this can lead to a fear of losing one&rsquo;s security in terms of rent allowance and other payments. The disregard has increased to &euro;146 and &euro;293, respectively, at the minimum and maximum levels. It could be argued that those levels should be altered. We keep them constantly under review.</P>
      <P>The issue is clear but the solution is not that easy. What most people tell me when I call to their doors is that the solution is to allow people to keep their benefits for as long as possible while working or in education. I accept that. It is not simple to administer that, rather it is difficult because one has to reach a fine point where employment or education takes over and one will then be full-time in one system or the other, as opposed to being in both systems. What does one say to people who are in employment when they say they have a job but would like to get welfare as top-up money? The issues and the administration of the system are difficult but I am clear about the direction. I look forward to working with the Department and listening to whatever advice comes my way about how we can break out of some of these cycles.</P>
      <P>Rent allowance may be payable where someone is employed on a part-time basis but it is totally ruled out for full-time employment. I accept what Senator O&rsquo;Meara said. She suggested a similar approach to my own, which is to provide plenty of incentives but not to create disincentives in the system. We could take away the rent allowance tomorrow but I do not think either of us would suggest that as it would not help anybody.</P>

	<P>I am fearful of social welfare changes, especially in the area of lone parenting. Everybody agrees that the best place to bring up children is in the family unit. In assisting those who are unfortunate enough not to be in a family unit, we must ensure we do not discriminate against those who choose to live in a family unit. It is a major challenge to walk that fine line between the two. People in a family unit, who are happy to be there should not be at a disadvantage because of their choice. We should not come down in favour of the politically correct pro-liberal agenda that advocates that whatever anyone wants to do is wonderful.</P>
      <P>I am lucky enough to be in a solid relationship in a family with four children. I want that relationship to be protected. That is one of the challenges facing the Minister. It is worth putting on the record that there is a fine line to be taken between supporting family units and supporting lone parents.</P>
      <P>A comment was made about the back to education allowance. There is a particularly strong case for lone parents to be able to access this automatically. I accept that the qualifying terms were altered so that people had to be unem<Col N="1162"/>ployed and so on but lone parents should be able to go straight in to education. I also accept that there are many different access programmes but if I was a lone parent in the morning I would like to be able to immediately access an education course, be it at second or third level. I am almost certain it is possible to do so. The Minister should bear that in mind when considering cutbacks. It may already be on the cards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply and his comments on cohabiting couples, to which I did not refer. It is a difficult area. In the context of what Senator Cox said, we should support families and promote child-rearing in a family unit, whatever that might look like. We should not create a disincentive to the development of stable relationships for lone parents for their own benefit and also for the benefit of their children both emotionally and economically. It is cheaper to live together than to live apart.</P>
      <P>The lone parent payment is directed at lone parents. Clearly if somebody is cohabiting he or she is no longer a lone parent. We need to look at this in a wider context. I posed the question earlier as to why so many young women chose to be lone parents. The Minister referred to 80,000 lone parents. I do not know what percentage this represents but I described the women I am talking about. As a society we need to consider why women choose to have children on their own, raise them on their own and remain in a dependency situation. That is a wider debate, which we are all considering. In the context of the Minister&rsquo;s response and the debate we are having, I withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P LI="1">In page 6, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;2.&mdash;The Minister shall within 6 months from after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the social welfare treatment of income from SSIAs.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The amendment is straightforward. Will the Minister explain the Department&rsquo;s thinking on the social welfare treatment of income from SSIAs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for proposing the amendment. She will be aware that I asked the Department to carry out an examination of the current arrangements of the assessment of capital, particularly as they apply to SSIAs, with a view to bringing forward proposals which might be included in budget 2005. On budget day, we announced that the capital disregards for means test purposes for all schemes, except supplementary welfare allowance, would be increased to &euro;20,000, an increase of over &euro;7,300, which is a significant jump. The enhanced disregard applies to all capital, regardless of <Col N="1163"/>where it is held, be it in an SSIA, credit union, post office, bank or any other financial institution. This means that a single non-contributory pensioner with no other means can have capital of up to &euro;28,000 and still qualify for a pension at the maximum rate. This figure is doubled in the case of a pensioner couple.</P>
      <P>These improvements will come into effect in June or in April in the case of carer&rsquo;s allowance. They are designed and their main aim is to ensure social welfare means testing arrangements do not act as a disincentive to those who want to save.</P>
      <P>When SSIAs mature, it is estimated they will be probably amount to somewhat less than &euro;20,000. By setting the capital disregard at &euro;20,000, we have gone a long way towards dealing with the issue. In short, if one&rsquo;s only capital is an SSIA, it will be totally disregarded. On the other hand, if the SSIA is only part of one&rsquo;s portfolio, it is not possible to distinguish between different savings. What could one say to somebody who has savings in a credit union, for example? One cannot tell a social welfare recipient one is disregarding the SSIA <i>per se</i> while including credit union savings. I thought a sensible response would be to increase the disregard by over &euro;7,000 to &euro;20,000, a proposal welcomed by most sides in the other House. If a person only has an SSIA, it will be totally disregarded, although not because it is a SSIA <i>per se</i>. However, I pitched the figure to try to ensure an SSIA would be disregarded in assessing means if it was a pensioner&rsquo;s only capital. I hope this deals with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply. The SSIA scheme was designed as an incentive to save. However, if commentaries are anything to go by, it will create an incentive to spend when it matures, which goes against the whole spirit of the scheme. The matter is hard to judge. If the limit is set too low, it would create not only an incentive to spend but in some ways a need to spend. As we are trying to encourage people to save, I ask the Minister to keep an open mind and to review the impact of the measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment and welcome the Minister&rsquo;s response. I urge the Minister to keep on open mind on this issue. Some pensioners try to save whatever they can, including some of their pensions. Many live very frugally and put money by because this is a practice with which they have grown up. I hope that those who have been saving in SSIAs will not find themselves in difficulty when the accounts mature because they have been prudent throughout their lives and will not feel the need to spend. Many reach a stage where they could go over the threshold without realising they can put their pensions in jeopardy. While I welcome the increase in the capital disregard, I ask the Minister to keep an open mind, particularly if it is discovered that this will cause problems for many pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1164"/>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>

      <P LI="1">&ldquo;2.&mdash;The Minister shall within 6 months from after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the status of the 16 social welfare cuts imposed prior to the commencement of the term of office of the present Minister.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The amendment is self-explanatory. I wish to give the Minister an opportunity to signal what his plans might be, particularly with regard to the previous set of cuts which were the responsibility of other Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I am interested to hear how we are to move forward to reverse the cuts introduced last year but not dealt with this year. While some cuts have been reversed, some are still outstanding which we hoped would have been addressed. How will the Minister deal with these in the short term?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have made considerable changes in this area. Some 16 amendments were introduced last year. In the case of five or six amendments, depending on how one considers them, we have reverted to the previous situation. We made substantial amendments in another five or six areas and I will continue to review or discuss the remainder with the social partners, as necessary. We spent some time examining them in detail and substantial changes were made to the measures announced last year.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Changes were made in regard to lone parents, namely, the transitional payment for a one-parent family was restored and will now be available for a period of six months where a recipient&rsquo;s income exceeds &euro;293 per week. The back to education allowance scheme was amended and the qualifying period reduced from 15 months to 12 months. In addition, the cost of education allowance increased by &euro;254 to &euro;400 to assist in this area. I gave a commitment in the other House, which I am happy to repeat here, that between now and September, when most people will sign on for these courses, I will examine whether it is possible and practical for me to reduce the qualifying period further. The income limit for child dependency allowance was increased.</P>
      <?oasys [cl11.5]?>
      <P>With regard to the money advice and budgeting service, one of the 16 areas referred to, a saving of &euro;700,000 was announced last year. I have restored a similar figure to enable MABS to improve its services. It is a special, additional &euro;700,000 to match the &euro;700,000 that was not in its <Col N="1165"/>previous budget. It is not an exact reversal, though some Senators probably think it is, but a better way to do things because it allows MABS more freedom as a professional organisation to dictate.</P>
      <P>We have made substantial changes in the cr&egrave;che supplement, an area about which Senators were concerned. I have restored a figure of &euro;2.3 million which is exactly the saving achieved by the discontinuance of the supplement. That is now being made available to ensure that vulnerable families can continue to have access to the cr&egrave;che supplement, for example in cases where a social worker or public health nurse deems it necessary. I am consulting the Minister for Health and Children in terms of channelling this funding.</P>
      <P>We have restored a figure of &euro;2 million to improve the diet supplement arrangements in consultation with the professional institutes involved. That is a considerable amendment. Regarding rent allowance, I have abolished the six months entitlement rule which Senators were concerned about. Instead we have the requirement that applicants be bona fide tenants who experience a change of circumstances and are genuinely in need of accommodation. They will be required to demonstrate that, which is not difficult. Additionally, we have transferred &euro;19 million to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government as an initial measure to enable local authorities to put long term housing solutions in place.</P>
      <P>There are other measures which we have changed substantially but these are the main ones raised by Senators in previous debates, namely, cr&egrave;che, rent, diet and back to education allowances. I can go through the other measures if Senators wish me to do so. The amendments have been substantially altered and are now better targeted and focused. We will continue to review the remaining items and see what changes we can make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>

	<P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 6, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;3.&mdash;The Minister for Social and Family Affairs shall within 3 months of the commencement of this Act lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the effectiveness of Child Benefit and Child Income Support as a tool for tackling child poverty.&rdquo;.</P><Col N="1166"/>
      <P FLI="0">This amendment asks the Minister to return to the House in three months&rsquo; time to report on the effectiveness of child benefit and child income support as a tool for tackling child poverty. The Minister is aware that in 2001 the Government promised to spend &euro;1.27 billion on child benefit over three years. The Government delivered on that promise for the 2002 budget but failed to do so in 2003. It promised to deliver in the budgets for 2004 and 2005.</P>
      <P>The Minister will say he has done well and I admit that child benefit has improved greatly over the past years. However, given that it is one benefit which genuinely helps to tackle child poverty, I would like to see the promise given to people fulfilled in full as quickly as possible, certainly by next year. I am disappointed it was not fulfilled this year. I would like to hear what the Minister has to say and how he will deal with the matter in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Terry that, as we said before in this House, child benefit is one of the most effective methods of tackling child poverty. It must be recognised that in the past few years the Government addressed the matter appropriately. We encountered a blip because of the situation regarding incoming revenue. There are only so many things one can do when less money is coming in than was expected and one sometimes has to row back for a period of time.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage the Minister confirmed that the Government would be back on track next year in terms of fulfilling its commitments made in the programme for Government. I commend the Minister on that and I look forward to him repeating that confirmation with regard to this amendment. If it is suggested to means test or tax what is a universal benefit, the Minister, in his role as saviour of all the women and children in the country, must refuse to give in. A line must be drawn in the sand in this regard. If possible I would like the Minister to confirm his view on this aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators. Child poverty is of great concern to me and to all of us. Different figures arise. There is a famous figure of 66,000 children in poverty in Ireland. The figure varies depending on whatever report one takes heed of. I have also seen substantially larger figures. Whatever the figure is, there is an issue which must be addressed.</P>
      <P>Child benefit this year will come to about &euro;1.9 billion. In 2000, which is not that long ago, the figure was &euro;600 million, so that within four or five years there has been a massive investment by the taxpayer in child benefit, which helps substantially in tackling child poverty. I believe it will not on its own eradicate child poverty. That is why we have asked the National Economic and Social Council under the pending child poverty special <Col N="1167"/>initiative in Sustaining Progress to undertake an examination of child income arrangements with a view to considering the possibility of a second tier child related payment targeted at low income families, perhaps replacing the family income supplement, child dependent allowances and possibly the back to school, clothing and footwear allowances. During the course of this year I hope to get those proposals from the NESC.</P>
      <P>Although I believe child benefit alone will not eradicate child poverty, it is a universal payment. In response to Senator Cox, I know of no proposals or even whispers anywhere regarding means testing or taxing it. It is a universal payment for the benefit of children across the nation and that is the way it will stay. However, the NESC work in this area continues and it is incumbent on us to find a way, when we all repeat the mantra that we must treat all the children of the nation equally, to ensure that children in poverty, arguably 66,000, are treated more equally. We must find a way to ensure additional funds get to them. If that offends the constitutionalists among us, so be it. I would unapologetically try to face them down on that.</P>
      <P>The universality of child benefit is an important principle and will remain so, but we must find a way of getting additional income to those 66,000 children, or whatever the figure is, by means of some kind of second tier child benefit payment which would, by definition, not be universal. No doubt one will find people trying to make political capital out of this but it is one we must urgently address. I look forward to the NESC providing some proposals in the area as quickly as it can so that we can target those resources. I wish to reiterate the firm commitment given by the Minister for Finance and me that the child benefit package laid out some years ago will be completed next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I will take the Minister&rsquo;s word that the package will be completed next year. We will watch to ensure it is completed. I will support, or at least look favourably on, any proposal the Minister might bring forward to help children of lower-income families. The Minister will receive widespread support because we all accept that children are still living in poverty. While child benefit does not discriminate, it is given to every family regardless of their income. The child dependant allowance has not been increased although it could have been used in recent years as a vehicle to help those in the lower-income bracket. I note the Minister&rsquo;s comments and look forward to any proposals that will help take thousands of children out of the poverty trap in which they find themselves. This area needs to be tackled and I will commend the Minister if he manages to do so.</P>

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 17.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 18, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P LI="2">&ldquo;<i>(c)</i> paragraph <i>(b)</i> will continue in force for 2 years or such extended period (in any event, not exceeding 5 years) as may be prescribed by regulations made jointly by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">There is a well-established practice in law that is enshrined in section 10(4) of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act 1851 that prosecutions must be taken within six months of an offence. Section 17 extends the period within which a prosecution may be taken and section 17(<i>b</i>) allows for a prosecution to be taken up to 18 months after the Minister decides he or she has enough evidence to proceed. This could be three years or ten years later, which is too open ended and if acted on, could encounter constitutional difficulties.</P>
      <P>There must come a point where the Minister either decides he or she has sufficient evidence and proceeds or he or she does not and drops the matter. I am opposed to the idea that we allow such a broad and open measure to be enacted. The Minister will probably not agree to the section&rsquo;s deletion, but as a reasonable compromise and with an eye to the Constitution, the Minister should agree to my amendment which restricts section 17(<i>b</i>) so it will operate for two years only, with the possibility of extending it to five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>We discussed this at length on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il. This issue concerns prosecutions, a very important part of my Department&rsquo;s efforts to control fraud and abuse in social welfare schemes. Prosecutions are an important deterrent in combatting social welfare fraud. We have spoken at length about improving the lot of lone parents and others such as widows and the elderly, and of increasing child benefit. To do this, we must be absolutely firm on welfare fraud and make it clear that there is no scope or tolerance for it.</P>
      <P>The introduction of a limit as proposed by the Senator would seriously restrict the Department <Col N="1169"/>from taking a prosecution in cases where the evidence came to light more than five years after the event. It does not make much sense to remove that weapon from the Department&rsquo;s armoury when its single purpose is the detection of fraud. It is better to leave the weapon with the Department so that if the period in question is longer than five years, it can still be dealt with.</P>
      <P>The restriction proposed by the Senator could have the effect of weakening the Department&rsquo;s control programme which is aimed at ensuring that the payments it makes, which are funded by the taxpayer and social contributions, are only paid to those entitled to them. I am not suggesting the Senator is proposing that we be soft on this issue but I am reluctant to weaken the Department&rsquo;s weaponry and options when it comes to tackling fraud. I am fully supportive of improving the income, benefits and quality of life of all the people for whom the Department has responsibility for supporting, but the price to be paid is that we are quite ruthless when it comes to fraud. The people that are being robbed are those who need the funds.</P>
      <P>In 2004, 503 case were forwarded to the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office to start proceedings. A total of 282 cases were finalised in court of which ten were served with prison sentences, 26 received suspended sentences, 158 were fined, three received community service and 43 received the benefit of the Probation Act. The remaining penalties included cases which were bound to the peace or adjourned with liberty to re-enter. Interestingly, savings for January 2005 amounted to &euro;27 million, which is 82% of our target. The Senator can see that it is a very important part of our armoury. Currently, we are attempting to ensure that electronic payments in particular are free of fraud. It is a new, developing area as more people opt to have their funds paid to their bank account and as everyone is aware, electronic funds transfer is more anonymous.</P>
      <P>We need the freedom to go back and pursue cases over the period in question and it would not be helpful to shorten it. Apart from fraud, there are also overpayments by the Department. I wish to make it clear that in such cases we agree a methodology of repayment with the person concerned and it is not done without his or her agreement. I note the Senator&rsquo;s point. However, when I looked at the issue carefully, I concluded that to weaken the Department&rsquo;s tools to tackle fraud would not send a good signal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>In support of the Minister, one feature of a fair and equitable social welfare system is a method to ensure that only those who should benefit from it do so and that those who try to defraud the system do not succeed. I became aware of at least two recent cases in the Galway area, which I reported, of incredible fraudulent abuse of the social welfare system. The relevant <Col N="1170"/>regional manager was very attentive and immediately began to deal with the cases. Given the changes in the social welfare system over the past number of years and changes in the country&rsquo;s demographics, a huge black market in PPS numbers has arisen. People have been receiving PPS numbers and selling them on. This area needs attention. We have witnessed the effectiveness of the insurance companies&rsquo; campaign against insurance fraud. The social welfare system must make it clear to people that they cannot steal from it because stealing from the social welfare system is stealing from the rest of us, particularly the people who most need money. I support the efforts of the Minister and his Department to combat social welfare fraud. Over the past number of years, we have seen an improvement in that area whereby people who were not entitled to payments have been foiled, money due to the State has been reclaimed and people who have consistently offended have been treated appropriately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not advocating that anyone guilty of social welfare fraud should escape scot free. However, the period the Department of Social and Family Affairs has to pursue cases is too open-ended. Information should be available at a much earlier stage if the systems within the Department are working correctly. Leaving the period so open can lead to a build-up of cases with the Department and create unnecessary work for staff. We have heard about a number of cases of overpayments by the Department recently. I understand the Minister&rsquo;s point about the need for those overpayments to be repaid and that repayments should be made after consultation with the individual concerned. That consultation did not appear to me to be present in a number of recent cases involving overpayments. I would like the Minister to assure me that no individual is put under serious pressure where an overpayment has been made. For example, a pensioner who received an overpayment might have spent the money at Christmas or felt inadvertently that he or she was getting a bonus. Individual circumstances must be taken into consideration when repayments are being made and that should be done very sensitively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure Senator Terry that I have been very impressed by the way the Department has dealt with cases of overpayment. Staff have made it clear to me that the person concerned is consulted directly or indirectly in all cases. Regarding the example of a pensioner cited by Senator Terry, that person would be consulted at some level and a suitable repayment schedule that would meet his or her individual requirements would be agreed. We will certainly continue this sensitive approach to the issue of overpayments, particularly in the very small number <Col N="1171"/>of cases where the overpayment was a result of a mistake by the Department. Regardless of how the overpayment came about, that sensitive approach to repaying overpayments will continue to be used.</P>
      <P>Both Senator Terry and I are coming from the same place in our opposition to social welfare fraud. As I said earlier, I am reluctant to send out the wrong signal. In 2004, we hauled back &euro;386 million through our anti-fraud and control measures. More than 100 people work in the control and anti-fraud section of the Department. In 2004, we took back &euro;120 million in fraudulent unemployment payments, &euro;110 million on fraudulent one parent family payments, &euro;18 million in fraudulent child benefit payments and &euro;55 million in fraudulent illness payments. More than 300,000 reviews were undertaken and from these reviews, &euro;386 million was recovered. Imagine what &euro;386 million could do for some of the cases with which the Department has to deal. I acknowledge that Senator Terry and the Deputies who promoted this amendment in the other House are acting in good faith in seeking a balance between the client and the Department. I want to reassure them that the balance is on the side of the individual at the moment. I would prefer not to send any signal, however inadvertently, that we were anything other than ruthless in dealing with social welfare fraud or as Senator Cox put it so well &ldquo;stealing from social welfare&rdquo;. This practice is just unacceptable.</P>

      <P LI="1">In page 21, before section 27, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;27.&mdash;A statute law restatement of the Pensions Acts as amended shall be published within three months of the passing of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have been in Seanad &Eacute;ireann for only two years but I have dealt with a good deal of legislation in that time. During that time, the pensions Act was the most difficult item  of legislation to navigate. It was extremely difficult to put the amendments in context because some other part of the Act had been amended previously. This is not conducive to openness and transparency. I would ask that my amendment be accepted and that we bring forward a consolidated Act which would help people when they are trying to get information on the pensions Act. If we want to encourage people to take out pensions, and people today are <Col N="1172"/>much more discerning and questioning about their investments, we need to make the pensions Act clearer. There should be no gaps in the Act because it was amended elsewhere. I would ask the Minister to make the Act more user-friendly in the interests of the general public. While the pensions industry produces information booklets, they often impart the industry&rsquo;s particular slant. This Bill should contain all the information needed in a user-friendly fashion. It is not user-friendly in its present state. I ask the Minister to urgently address this situation, which I think would be a simple matter.</P>

	<P>I support Senator Terry&rsquo;s amendment and the sentiments she expressed. It is extremely important for people to be equipped with all necessary information about preparing for life when they become pensioners. The legislation provides an extremely important framework in that regard. I agree with Senator Terry&rsquo;s assertion that it is extremely difficult to make one&rsquo;s way through the pensions Act. It is urgent that a simpler way to navigate be found.</P>

	<P>I have a particular query on a matter that came to my attention recently but it may not relate to this section. We in the parish of Salthill were lucky to have a missionary sister of the Holy Rosary, the Killeshandra sisters, speak about her mission during mass. One of her points was that the missionary orders did not provide for the care of their people in old age after sending them abroad and refusing them permission to take teaching, nursing or doctoral posts. Missionary sisters and brothers serving on the missions for many years have not been able to avail of the old age pension upon returning to Ireland. This is an unexpected issue that deserves the Minister&rsquo;s attention and his answer at a later date.</P>
      <P>Priests, sisters and brothers who have spent their lives on the missions are members of a clearly identifiable group, as are the women we spoke of who were treated differently for pension purposes because they were homemakers. Do they not deserve the State&rsquo;s recognition in their old age? I do not expect the Minister to be in a position to give an immediate answer but I ask him to address the issue as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Terry&rsquo;s amendment calls for a statutory restatement to be published within three months. The Pensions Board provides a legislation service by paying a fee, under which subscribers receive a non-statutory consolidated text of the Pensions Acts and regulations, including all amendments to date. The text of the legislation is made available in loose-leaf format, which allows it to be updated regularly. The legislation service is updated following any amendments to the Acts or regulations and is presented in two volumes. The first volume contains a consolidated text of the Pensions Acts and the <Col N="1173"/>second contains the regulations made under the Acts. Due to the availability of this service, a restatement of the Acts is not a priority at this time, but I will examine the issue again.</P>
      <P>Restatements do not change the law in any way. They combine the Acts and their amendments in a more reader-friendly and up-to-date version. This has already been achieved by the informal arrangements in place for the Pensions Acts. The Pensions Board produces a range of booklets, guides and frequently asked questions for non-practitioners, explaining the legislative requirements in an accessible and user-friendly way. I have asked the Pensions Board to conduct campaigns about pensions to describe what is on offer as a more effective way of dealing with this issue in the short term. I will also ask it to augment the awareness campaign it has under way at the moment.</P>
      <P>I agree that the area of pensions is a complicated minefield. Some are experts in it and others find it difficult territory. One must be financially literate to deal with the level of complexity involved. It is incumbent on a State authority, in this instance the Pensions Board, to explain, simplify and translate financial gobbledegook into concepts that people can understand. I will encourage the board to sustain its efforts.</P>
      <P>Senator Cox raised the issue of missionaries&rsquo; entitlements to old age pensions. There is support in place as they may qualify for means-tested non-contributory pensions on their return to Ireland, assuming they pass the means test. I will give the Senator more information on the topic but this is the advice I have received. They would not be entitled to contributory pensions as it is not likely that they would have made contributions to the social fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not satisfied with the Minister&rsquo;s answer. He acknowledges that the Act must be updated and made more presentable and concise. If this is the case the decision must be taken to follow through. This Government stated that it believes in openness and transparency. Let us see some and get this job done. I am not asking for something that would incur a cost on the State but it is in the public interest that it be done.</P>
      <P>On Senator Cox&rsquo;s query, it is my understanding that members of religious orders, such as those who acted as nurses and teachers abroad, are not entitled to old age non-contributory pensions upon returning. Will the Minister investigate if this is the case? I visited India with the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights at the end of 2004 and met a member of the Christian Brothers. He raised this issue with me, as did two sisters. They agreed that they are not entitled to a pension when they return to Ireland. This matter must be examined. I do not wish to contradict the officials&rsquo; advice but it is an issue encountered by several Senators. <Col N="1174"/>If the Minister finds this to be the case, it must be addressed. These people went abroad to spread their faith and good work and only returned for their final years, but if we cannot care for them at that stage it is a very poor reflection on the State. I thank Senator Cox for raising the issue.</P>

    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Section 27 agreed to.</P>
    <P>Sections 28 and 29 agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 8 to 10, inclusive, are related and will be discussed together by agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 22, before section 30, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;30.&mdash;The Principal Act is amended in section 10 by inserting the following new paragraph after paragraph (<i>a</i>):</P>
      <P LI="2">(<i>aa</i>) to carry out periodic reviews in order to ensure that there is a fair consumer-provider balance in the regulation and control of the pensions industry.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">These amendments are intended to ensure protection for the individual pensioner. I spoke with the Minister on this issue previously and told him that many of the developments in pensions legislation seem skewed towards the industry rather than consumer protection.</P>
      <P>The Pensions Board exists to act as guardian for the consumer. While it exists to promote the provision and extension of pensions, it must get the balance right between the provision of pensions and the extension of rights to the consumers and provider. The Minister will probably tell me the board is responsible for maintaining the balance. However, the balance is not apparent and it seems to me that the board works on behalf of the pensions industry to promote pensions. We see little coming from the board with regard to the protection of the consumer.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 9 seeks to insert a section that will provide a consumer protection code. This code should be drawn up by the pensions board and all pensions providers should be bound to comply with it. This is another measure to ensure the consumer is protected and that all companies within the industry live up to the code. These protection provisions should come from the pensions board because that is the reason it exists. I hope the Minister will accept these amendments and show there is concern for the consumer.</P>
      <P>As I said recently, the Minister must be aware of the crisis in the pensions industry. The public does not have any confidence in the industry and that is the reason people are not taking out pen<Col N="1175"/>sions. Despite the &euro;500,000 provided to the pensions board for a public awareness campaign over the past couple of years, people are not buying into pensions or PRSAs. People bought into the SSIAs because they knew what they were buying into and that they could take a risk with equities or take the safe option and know what they would get at the end of the day. People will not buy into the pensions industry any longer because for too long they have seen their parents&rsquo; pensions eroded to the point where they are not worth the paper they are written on by the time they come to draw them. We need to win back the support of the consumers. By offering them some protection, we may encourage them to take out pensions, but much more must be done before we can win back their general support in this regard.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 10 requires that all advertisements relating to pensions should carry a warning to consumers informing them of the risks involved, that benefits are not guaranteed and making them aware of the charges and fees involved. The funds of many companies are currently underfunded and they are asking their employees to move from defined benefit schemes to defined contribution schemes. As well as asking them to change, they are charging outrageous fees for doing so. This area needs to be investigated. Much of the money that goes to the pensions industry is eaten up by fees paid from the money paid by consumers into their pension funds. This is one of the reasons the pensions many people get when they retire are not worth the paper on which they are written.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to ensure that pensions, like mortgages, carry a warning in their advertisements. This is not asking too much. People are encouraged by the Government to take out a pension, but they should be told of the risks associated with these occupational pension schemes, particularly schemes with defined contributions. I do not know much about pensions. The area is a minefield and most people do not understand it. The pensions industry likes to keep it that way because if we knew more about it, fewer people would buy into it. Therefore, I urge the Minister to ensure that the pensions board will ensure that all advertisements carry warnings regarding risks, fees and charges associated with pension products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the comments of Senator Terry, particularly with regard to the need for people to be fully supported in providing for their future retirement. I have always found it interesting that Irish people like to invest in property. If we ask them why, they often say it is for their pension. They have a greater sense of security from investment in property than from <Col N="1176"/>investment in pension funds. The thinking on pensions is that they cannot be relied on.</P>
      <P>I would be interested to hear the Minister&rsquo;s comments on the take up of PRSAs. How successful or unsuccessful have they been? Do we need to revisit that area?</P>
      <P>Do people understand the provisions being made for their future? Pensions are a major issue for us, particularly considering our population balance and the demands that will be made on the State if pension provisions are not made. We acknowledge that much work has been done and that the issue is more in the open than previously. Legislation is also far stronger. Speaking for myself, I do not have the first clue about pensions. They are part of the area of mathematics, figures and financial calculations. I understand they should be carefully considered, but they are difficult to understand.</P>
      <P>The Pensions Board must have a role in keeping people informed or at least allow them to see how they can be kept informed of where they stand. It is a concern, for example, that people who work in a private company who believe their future pension is secure often find out that it is not. I acknowledge the concerns raised by Senator Terry and look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Pensions are complex but it is critical to have them. It is incumbent on all of us to try to strip away the complexity and get to the heart of the matter. Pensions are about the income of ordinary people during their later years and about providing a sense of security that this income will be there each month. While the area of pension fund managers, investment managers, yields, bonds, equities, properties, etc., is complicated, there is also an essential simplicity involved. It is incumbent on all of us to constantly highlight this and to measure the complexity against the simple objective of ensuring security, safety and sufficient income for everybody in their later years.</P>
      <P>Senator Terry has consistently spoken on behalf of pension fund customers and she has highlighted a wariness we should all have about the management and solvency of pension funds. I have no difficulty with that but the spirit of her amendments has been addressed. The Pensions Act 1990 established the Pensions Board. The board includes the Director of Consumer Affairs, pension industry representatives, social partners and so on and it is made up this way to achieve the consumer protection referred to by the Senator. The board is required to monitor and supervise the provisions of the Act, which provides a strong regulatory regime on behalf o the consumer.</P>
      <P>The Act also establishes significant protections for individual members of schemes and provides generally for the regulation of occupational pen<Col N="1177"/>sion schemes. It also provides protection of members&rsquo; benefits through the preservation of benefits, funding standards and equal treatment requirements. That regime is in place to protect the individual.</P>
      <P>Part 5 of the Act provides for transparency and openness through a broad disclosure regime, which is governed by detailed regulations. The Act also places onerous responsibilities on trustees to ensure occupational pension schemes are properly administered, members&rsquo; pensions rights are fully safeguarded and they and their dependants ultimately receive the pensions they have earned. The Pensions Acts are stringent in these areas and trustees are required to follow certain practices in making that happen. This legislation also contains substantial improvements. It provides that trustees must be of good repute and have relevant qualifications.</P>
      <P>The Pensions Act 2002 provided for the appointment of a Pensions Ombudsman. That was a significant development in consumer protection. The Pensions Ombudsman investigates and adjudicates on complaints and disputes involving occupational pension schemes and PRSAs. The office is completely independent and impartial and has done a fine job to date. The Act also provided for PRSAs. Charges are capped and investments are restricted. The Pensions Board supervises the activities of providers in regard to their approved products and it monitors PRSAs. The board&rsquo;s website contains a list of approved products and charges and a consumer guide to PRSAs was published by the Consumers Association of Ireland and the board to aid consumer protection.</P>
      <P>With regard to the disclosure of charges, persons entering into pension contracts receive full disclosure of all potential and actual commissions and other charges payable by contributors. That should address the Senator&rsquo;s concerns in this area. In addition, changes to charges must be notified at least two months beforehand. A significant number of consumer protection measures are in place and the Pensions Board remains vigilant in overseeing these measures. IFSRA published a draft consumer protection code and the board will monitor that closely to see if it can be improved.</P>
      <P>I have no difficulty with the spirit of the Senator&rsquo;s amendments but her concerns have been addressed in the array of legislative measures relating to responsibilities of the Pensions Board and IFSRA and the emphasis on consumer protection. They must be kept under review to ensure consumers are fully informed and protected before embarking on a pension strategy for themselves or their dependants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very disappointed the Minister has not taken the amendments on board. I do not accept that the current provisions offer consumer <Col N="1178"/>protection and the Minister knows this well. There is evidence that consumers are not protected and, hence, they are voting with their feet and not taking up products offered by the pensions industry.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the preservation of pensions and I acknowledge that an improvement was made in the Pensions Act 2002 but pre-1993 pensions were not preserved. They should have been taken into account. Thousands of people aged 55 and over have been drawing their pensions since before 1993 but the pensions were not preserved. These people paid into their pension schemes for years. The Minister should not mention the preservation of pensions because it has only been dealt with in recent years and the pensions of many people have not been preserved.</P>
      <P>Pension companies were permitted to take pension holidays by the Pensions Board during good times when their funds were in surplus but that has affected the underfunding of many pension schemes nowadays. I do not know whether that is still going on but I presume it is not because most schemes are underfunded. The pension schemes of the top ten companies in Ireland are underfunded to the tune of &euro;3 billion. I fail to understand how the Minister cannot accept that more needs to be done to protect the consumer.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Last week the Minister provided interesting statistics. He stated the Exchequer gave &euro;2.5 billion in tax relief on occupational pension scheme contributions last year while the non-contributory cost was &euro;2 billion. Where is the value for money in that relief? The Minister should consider what could be done with &euro;2.5 billion. The pensions industry is not paying back in kind for this relief. The Government would be better off not providing tax relief and paying individual pensions. Perhaps this should be examined. I am far from being an economist. I am a housewife, but I know that it is bad value for money. It must be examined and addressed. I ask the Minister to do so here in a few simple measures to bring the pensions industry to order and ensure that the consumer is protected.</P>
      <?oasys [cl11.5]?>
      <P>The figures with which the Minister provided me last week are shocking. He should not be able to stand over them and say that we will continue in this way. Neither the taxpayer nor the person with the occupational pension scheme is getting value for money. The pensions industry and the fat cats are getting fatter. We know that those in this country&rsquo;s top companies will ensure that millions are put by and ring-fenced for their pensions, but who cares about the PAYE worker? The Minister should care and ensure that something is done.</P>
      <P>I have the greatest confidence in IFSRA and would like to see it more involved in the pensions industry. I hope that it will be given the opportunity to do so. However, it does not have a great <Col N="1179"/>degree of responsibility for the pensions industry, which falls to the Pensions Board. I have more faith in how IFSRA is carrying out its work. It seems a very independent body which does not take sides but steers a middle way to get results for the consumer. I hope that the Minister will be able to address some of the queries that I have put to him and reconsider accepting my amendments on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to return to what Senator O&rsquo;Meara asked about PRSAs. I agree that the take-up has been disappointing. It now stands at 46,000 &mdash; that is the number of individual contracts. For that reason, I have formally asked the Pensions Board to bring forward from 2006 to this year the review that it is required to carry out of pensions coverage and adequacy. I expect the board&rsquo;s report this summer because of that situation.</P>
      <P>The preservation for pre-1991 benefits only came into force for those who left employment after June 2002 on foot of the Pensions (Amendment) Act 2002. It was considered, for cost reasons, that this requirement would not be met retrospectively. Regarding the &euro;2.5 billion &mdash; the figure that I gave Senator Terry last week, which refers to the gross cost of taxes paid when the pension is paid out &mdash; there are significant issues. They are being examined by the Department of Finance as part of the review of tax relief measures that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, has announced. They are also kept under review by the Pensions Board as part of general pensions strategy.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt where I stand on pensions. I am 100% on the side of pensioners. That is as it should be as it is my responsibility. Pension funds are able to look after themselves, as are boardroom directors. However, my responsibility is to make absolutely certain that the elderly have proper pensions. Having said that, I must live in the real world. I cannot simply make that statement and then say that I do not care what happens to pension funds. They are an amalgamation of funds which are invested and depend on the performance of markets, properties and equities and the quality of management. Occupational funds need all those things to come right. There is an element of risk involved, and the Senator rightly says that companies are increasingly finding that they cannot afford the benefit type of pension, with the result that they are moving to the contributory model. That means that the risk is increasingly moving from the employer to the employee.</P>
      <P>One can do several things, one being to say, for example, that schemes are &euro;3 billion underfunded, depending on how one measures them. There is a funding standard. One figure is based on an going concern and one on wrap-up <Col N="1180"/>or closure of the scheme. What figure one arrives at depends which measure is used. I am advised that the funding standard in place is a very conservative one based on a wind-up situation. Some 57% to 60% of funds are meeting that standard, which is extremely conservative and tough. Under this legislation the remaining funds are given a period of up to ten years to meet that same standard.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Pensions Board is required to sit on these funds to ensure that, each month, it receives returns and information to convince it that they are heading in the right direction. I explained to the Senator last week that were I to move in a more sudden fashion and demand that the 60% become 100%, I would probably effect what happened in the UK, where many firms were pushed into insolvency by the requirement that major payments be made to the pension fund in circumstances where it was not immediately necessary. On the other hand, it had the effect of closing down the company, with the ultimate result that no one gained. A better way is to grant the extended period, have the Pensions Board monitor schemes, and get everyone up to a funding standard over the period so that pensions can be paid out.</P>
      <P>Considered in that context and with that strategy, there will be no plethora of underfunded schemes. However, if one approaches it from an entirely different angle, I accept that one might arrive at that conclusion. That is not the perspective that I have chosen, since it is more sensible to adopt the strategy that we are now pursuing.</P>
      <P>Like every other speaker last week, I can indicate the size of the tax reliefs, which are very generous. However, one must also consider where they are going. They are not all going to boardroom types, and many are taken up by ordinary people on ordinary salaries who are allowed a tax benefit because they are buying pensions. A very substantial slice of that figure is going to ordinary, middle or low-income people who choose to take out a pension rather than pay the tax, since it is a better deal for them. Before one disturbs that, one must examine carefully whom it is helping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>It is helping only the pensions industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I argue that a large proportion of that &euro;2.5 billion is given in tax breaks to individuals against their wages and salaries so they can take out pensions. It is, therefore, given in tax relief to individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>Who is benefiting from that tax relief?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I argue that the individual is benefiting, since he or she is not taking out a pension. By forgoing tax, the State is helping that individual pay the premium to build up a pension. <Col N="1181"/>Therefore, the individual will obviously gain by being in the pension scheme and in the business of building up a pension for himself or herself with State support. One could argue, if that State support were not there, that they would not take out a pension, therefore resulting in no occupational pension on retirement and nothing other than the State pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>The State might be better off paying them a pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The figure is so large that one must be very wary of a broad-brush approach. A very substantial proportion of it is going to ordinary working people to help them build up pensions for the future. I do not doubt that an element is going where one might argue that it should not go. We should examine that area. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, is constantly reviewing all those tax reliefs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>From listening to the debate, it seems to me that there is a misunderstanding or fallacy. As regards the &euro;2.5 billion and the fact that it is benefiting the pensions industry, we are fortunate to be in the public service and part of that figure comprises pension contributions deducted from our incomes before we are taxed, which the Senator making the point may have overlooked. That applies across the public service.</P>
      <P>Those of us working in the public service, and I have some insight in that I worked on the other side of the fence for a long time, should be mindful of the tremendous advantage we have over those in the private sector in that we enjoy pensions which are index linked and which one could not purchase in the private sector because they would be too costly. We should be mindful of that when we talk about people who are in employment. The Minister might clarify the figure but I understand fewer than 50% of people in the private sector enjoy an occupational pension. The figure is quite low. I do not believe any of those would be inclined to put their money into a pension fund if tax relief was not available. The tax relief is an inducement.</P>
      <P>Another aspect we should take into account is the fact that the tax is not lost. It is deferred tax, similar to the way we offer depreciation in business. Ultimately, when the pension is being paid it will be subject to the full PAYE system. In the case of lump sums, and much innovative thinking has gone into improving the pension regime over the past four or five years, they are subject to tax at 23%. It is not as if the State does not get that money. It is a fallacy to believe that that &euro;2.5 billion will accrue to the Exchequer if a decision was made in the morning by the Minister for Finance to remove tax exemption from contributions to pension funds.</P><Col N="1182"/>
      <P>An argument may be made for allowing people in business to determine their own level of salary and where millions of euro may be placed in pension funds as a tax efficient means of accruing wealth. Perhaps we could examine that issue, but statistical data would be needed to research it properly to be able to determine where the hammer should be brought down, so to speak. Looking at the demographics of the country, the thrust of the legislation has to be to encourage more individuals to subscribe to pension schemes and, in particular, to encourage employers to participate and make pension schemes available to their staff.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of social equity that people who give their life to a company should, at the end of their days, have sufficient income to maintain themselves in retirement. Companies do not tend to have social consciences but many employers do and without this tax exemption that would not happen at all. Rather than remove incentives, the Minister should consider ways of encouraging more people to participate. As the Minister pointed out, we should examine the area in detail to determine if abuses are taking place. If this income is being siphoned off into pension funds we should examine that issue to determine the measures that need to be taken. To go the route Senator Terry suggested, however, would be folly because only a fraction of the &euro;2.5 billion would accrue to the Exchequer. It would be a self-defeating exercise. That suggestion was made from the comfort of a public sector pension, of which I am a beneficiary also, as are the other Members here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind the House that a Senator may speak only once on Report Stage, except the proposer of an amendment who may reply to the discussion on the amendment. On Report Stage, each amendment must be seconded.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, are related and may be taken together by agreement. Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 22, between lines 41 and 42, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;30.&mdash;The Principal Act is amended in section 10 by inserting the following new paragraph after paragraph (<i>a</i>):</P>
      <P LI="2">(<i>aa</i>) to carry out periodic reviews in order to ensure that there is a fair consumer-provider balance in the regulation and control of the pensions industry.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I apologise for boring the Minister but I want to conclude the debate on amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, which began on Committee Stage as amendments Nos. 8 to 10, inclusive.</P>
      <P>Senator Jim Walsh intervened in the debate on Committee Stage. He may have come to the House late because I do not believe he heard exactly what I said earlier in respect of the amendments. I stated that I was concerned about the extent of the tax relief the Government is giving in terms of occupational pensions scheme contributions. I inquired whether it is obtaining value for money from this tax relief provision that <Col N="1184"/>has been extended to the pensions industry. I am not advocating that reliefs to this industry should be withdrawn, I merely wish to ensure that the Government and taxpayers are getting value for money from them. I made the point that if the tax relief were withdrawn, it could be spent elsewhere and perhaps used to increase the non-contributory old age pension and extend it to others. We are giving generous tax reliefs to the pensions industry and we should receive value for money in respect of them. Will the Minister ensure that value for money is obtained when tax reliefs are extended to this sector and others?</P>
      <P>The Minister is now extending the funding period by seven years, from three to ten years, to companies which find themselves with schemes that are underfunded. I cannot see how he will alleviate the difficulties experienced by companies with these underfunded schemes. We were told as far back as 1996 that schemes were underfunded and in difficulty. By extending this funding period to ten years, we will not be in a better situation in seven years&rsquo; time. This is facilitating the pensions industry and we are not demanding anything in return. The Minister said that if he obliged the companies to have their pension schemes fully funded in three years, then many companies could go to the wall. What about the pensioner who is not getting his paid-up pension? By giving this seven year extension to companies, we will be in an even worse situation in seven or ten years&rsquo; time.</P>
      <P>I accept that companies are in difficulty, but they are not doing everything they can to ensure that pensions are preserved. While the pensions industry is doing everything it can to ensure that the industry will not be out of pocket, pensioners will be out of pocket and this funding period will do nothing to help the problem. Instead, it is putting off that day when the industry will have to face up to its responsibilities, yet its schemes will still be underfunded.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to accept these amendments. We should ensure that the consumer is protected. I have suggested simple measures that could be put in place to provide some protection for the pensioner and that will help to ensure that the pensions industry is not always seeking extensions that are changing their funding schemes from defined benefit to defined contribution.</P>
      <P>It is time the Minister stood up to the pensions industry. It is time he ensured that the trustees looked after the money with which they are entrusted on behalf of their employees. The Minister has been given one hour to reconsider my amendments. I hope he sees the value in them and accepts them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment. I support what Senator Terry said about the consumer and the protection of the consumer. We only have to think of the changes brought in on the <Col N="1185"/>way banks publish details which were hidden in the past, such as APR rates on loans. It became necessary to specify clearly what banks were required to publish for the customer. If it had not been required in the legislation, we know that it would not have happened. Companies are not inclined to tell people the full story.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 3 deals with advertising by pension providers so that consumers would be alerted to the risks, fees and all charges associated with taking out and maintaining a pension. That is a useful amendment and the Minister should consider accepting it so that the consumer can be protected. One could say that we are bending over backwards, but it is necessary to do that as we have seen from our experience with the banking industry. Banks are required to write to inform us how much we are being charged for each transaction, cheque and so on. Such information was buried inside statements in the past, but it is now published in separate statements. That has made a huge difference. This amendment would support the Pensions Board in acting on behalf of the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Terry for moving this amendment again. While I do not have any difficulty with the concepts in these amendments I am seeking a fair balance between the consumer and the provider and a code of protection for the consumer informing the participants about charges and so on. All of these are covered in the various regulations about which I spoke on Committee Stage. The Director of Consumer Affairs is on the Pensions Board. There are requirements to inform people about charges and there are a host of regulations regarding the work and responsibilities of the Pensions Board. The objectives laid down in these amendments are well and truly covered.</P>
      <P>I want to protect the consumer in the same way as every other person in this House. I will examine anything else that can be done to reassure consumers. I take the point that Senator Terry made about the &euro;3 billion deficit in the pension fund in the top ten Irish plcs. That is an accountancy deficit and is not something that would be called on immediately. It is the result of the changes in bonds and yields from bonds. If one was to react and demand immediate compliance and full cover, then matters could be made much worse. It is better to get them into shape than drive them out of business.</P>
      <P>However, I have an open mind on this issue. I have the same objective as the Senators, which is to protect the consumers and the pensioners. I am advised by the Pensions Board, which is required by statute to advise me, that the best way to do it is to give the extra number of years to monitor the pension funds on a monthly basis. They can <Col N="1186"/>gradually be brought to a situation where we have full funding.</P>
      <P>I brought forward, from 2006 to the summer of 2005, the report of the investigation of the Pensions Board into the adequacy and the coverage of pensions. The board will consider the funding standard and how we can improve matters in that area. I do not wish to be blas&eacute; about this and state that there is no cause for concern. There are issues surrounding pension funds, such as accountancy deficits and funding standards which have to be addressed. There is a movement from defined benefit to defined contribution, as well as changes regarding the risk which is transferred to the employee. All of these changes are ongoing and I am well aware of them.</P>
      <P>The funding standard is formally monitored on an annual basis. Companies would receive regular information from the funds as to how they are meeting the funding standards. They are formally required to make an annual assessment of the measure against the funding standard that is required. I support the direction in which the Senator is going with regard to these amendments but I am arguing that currently, by and large, they are taken care of.</P>
      <P>However, that is not to say that there are not other issues concerning further consumer protection. The best protection for consumers is to ensure that their funds are fully funded and adequate to meet requirements. The Pensions Board is working on that issue and monitoring it daily for me. I will continue to examine what more I can do to ensure those funds are fully able to meet its requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to reiterate my disappointment that the Minister is not accepting any of the three amendments. I thought that, at least, he could take on board amendment No. 3, which states:</P>
      <P LI="1">All advertising carried out by or on behalf of pension providers shall include a warning (of equal prominence as the substance of the advert) alerting consumers of the risks, fees and all charges associated with taking out and maintaining a pension.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Banks do that, although I am not sure if they are obliged to do so. However, it is something the pensions industry should be doing as a matter of course. The Minister is extending money to the Pensions Board for its public awareness campaign, which covers the promotion of pensions. Some of that money should also be spent on alerting people to the risks associated with taking out occupational pension schemes, especially the defined contribution schemes. That is the least the Minister could have accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of information, in the case of PRSAs, IFSRA insists on advertising carrying the kind of warning the Senator is seek<Col N="1187"/>ing. Therefore, what the Senator wants to achieve with regard to PRSAs is already the case. IFSRA insists upon it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>While that is to be welcomed, why can it not be extended to all occupational schemes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I presume that members of all occupational schemes are made fully aware of the conditions of the schemes and are fully informed of their contents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I hear of many schemes being advertised yet there is no warning attached to them. There should be. Perhaps the Minister could examine that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>Such a provision does not have to be included in the legislation but the Minister could introduce it at any time. I am left with no option, therefore, but to withdraw the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 26, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;33.&mdash;The Principal Act is amended by inserting the following new section after section 36:</P>
      <P LI="2">36A.&mdash;(1) A pensions provider operating or providing a service in the State shall, as and from 1 January 2006, furnish evidence acceptable to the Minister that the pensions provider, has entered into an arrangement satisfactory to the Minister for the protection of persons who, enter into contracts with the pensions provider.</P>
      <P LI="2">(2) The arrangement referred to in subsection (1) of this section is in this Act referred to as &lsquo;the Bond&rsquo;.</P>
      <P LI="2">(3) The Bond shall provide that, in the event of the inability or failure of the pensions provider concerned to meet its financial or contractual obligations in relation to the provision or maintenance of pensions, a sum of money will become available to the Minister, or to any person nominated or approved of by the Minister, as trustee, to be applied for the benefit of any customer of the pensions provider concerned who has incurred loss or liability because of such inability or failure to meet financial or contractual obligations.</P><Col N="1188"/>
      <P LI="2">(4) The Minister or, as the case may be, the person nominated or approved of by the Minister, as trustee, shall keep all proper and usual accounts, including an income and expenditure account and a balance sheet, of all moneys received by him on foot of a bond and of all disbursements made by him or her from any such moneys.</P>
      <P LI="2">(5) As soon as may be after the end of each year, accounts kept in pursuance of this section shall be submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit and, immediately after the audit, a copy of the income and expenditure account and of the balance sheet and a copy of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the accounts shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P LI="2">(6) Without prejudice to any existing right of a customer of a pensions provider to recover damages in relation to breach of contract, nothing in this section shall be construed as enabling such customer to recover any damages out of any sum of money made available under the Bond.</P>
      <P LI="2">(7) The Minister may, by regulations, provide that&mdash;</P>
      <P LI="3">(<i>a</i>) arrangements in relation to the Bond shall be entered into only with persons of a class or classes specified in the regulations, and</P>
      <P LI="3">(<i>b</i>) the Bond shall be for such minimum sum and valid for such minimum period as may be specified in the regulations.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This amendment is timely in that it represents a continuation of the debate we have just had. It seeks to put in place a bonding scheme to which all pension providers would have to sign up.</P>
      <P>The proposed section 36A(3) states</P>
      <P LI="1">The Bond shall provide that, in the event of the inability or failure of the pensions provider concerned to meet its financial or contractual obligations in relation to the provision or maintenance of pensions, a sum of money will become available to the Minister, or to any person nominated or approved of by the Minister, as trustee, to be applied for the benefit of any customer of the pensions provider concerned who has incurred loss or liability because of such inability or failure to meet financial or contractual obligations.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I am seeking a bonding system to be put in place as a safety net where a company fails to meet its obligations, where its scheme is underfunded or where the scheme is wound up. We know that is happening today. Perhaps the Minister could provide me with the figures concerning schemes that are currently underfunded, as well as those which have been wound up or are in the process <Col N="1189"/>of being wound up. The Pensions Board must be made aware of those situations. Will the Minister provide me with the number of such schemes?</P>
      <P>If such a bonding scheme was established, it would provide a safety net for the individuals concerned. Consumers are entitled to that. Bonding schemes are already in operation in many other industries. For instance, it has been a valuable tool in the airline industry in cases where holiday makers are left stranded abroad. Under the scheme, the airline industry can step in at a moment&rsquo;s notice to fly individuals home. If an airline goes bankrupt before a voyage occurs, people can be refunded the cost of their holiday.</P>
      <P>The amendment would provide the Minister with another option to provide a safety net for consumers. Given the profits that pension companies are making, they should be providing such a service. In light of the generous extension of the funding period the Minister is affording such companies, he should request them to provide this service in return for his generosity. The Minister has been extremely generous to pension companies in giving them a further seven years to ensure their schemes are fully funded, yet he is not asking for anything in return. We should aspire to ensuring that our consumers are protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment and support the idea of a bond, in principle. I would be interested to hear the Minister&rsquo;s response to this proposal. As Senator Terry said, it has been found necessary to put such a bonding system in place in other sectors. Given the impact on people of losing their pensions, should a provider fail to do what it says it will do, the idea certainly seems to be worth considering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for raising this issue, which needs to be considered. It involves many complicated aspects. The Pensions Board has advised me that it does not support the immediate introduction of a protection fund. However, the board has recommended me to consider it in the medium term, taking into account the UK experience, in particular.</P>
      <P>The pension benefit guarantee corporation has operated in the United States since the mid-1970s. More recently, arrangements have been made for the new pension protection fund in the UK. On a recent visit to London, I discussed the operation of that fund with the authorities there. I came to the conclusion that they are not yet fully satisfied that the fund will do what is required of it. They want to take some more time to see how it works.</P>
      <P>The issue of pension protection for defined benefit schemes was considered by the Pensions Board during the recent review of the funding standard. They came to the conclusion of which I have just informed the House. The pension <Col N="1190"/>benefit guarantee corporation in the United States is funded by insurance premia, investments and assets of plants that are taken over. The UK&rsquo;s pension protection fund will be funded by a levy on all defined benefit schemes. I am told that is having certain effects already in pushing people out of defined benefit schemes and into defined contribution schemes. They do not have to pay the levy because they are in contribution schemes as opposed to defined benefit schemes. That seems to have been an unintended consequence of the establishment of the new fund.</P>
      <P>The Pensions Board recognises, as I do, the substantial potential benefits of a well-designed pension protection fund. I do not rule out a protection fund or a bonding system but we are not in a position to address the matter in this legislation. It is too complicated. A great deal of practical and technical issues require further discussion in this House, the other House and at Government level.</P>
      <P>I have taken into account examples from other jurisdictions. On my visit to the United Kingdom, I detected considerable uncertainty there as to how the pension protection fund will work out. In the United States the protection fund, the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation, is itself in considerable deficit and a degree of uncertainty now surrounds it.</P>
      <P>I do not say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to this proposal. In the medium term some form of protective net may be required. Bonding is one approach, protection funds are another but no matter what we do we must ensure we make matters better not worse.</P>
      <P>I have details of the number of defined benefit schemes that failed the funding standards up to November 2004. I can provide Senator Terry with tables detailing the information. If she wishes I can provide her with the current position in writing. In 2003, 484 funding certificates were received. This was the board&rsquo;s experience of funding certificates and proposals from the beginning of 2003 to 5 November 2004. The number of funding certificates increased to 549 in 2004. A total of 408 out of 484 schemes satisfied the funding standards in 2003. A total of 317 out of 549 schemes satisfied the funding standards in 2004. I can provide Senator Terry with more detail on the matter and will correspond with her on the subject as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Senator Terry must wonder why I am not doing what I say. I cannot do it in the way she prescribed. It is worthwhile in the medium term examining whether some protective mechanism can be put in place, either by means of UK or US-style protection funds or a bonding system such as in the example Senator Terry gave in regard to the travel trade and other professions. I am not in a position to address the matter now.</P>
      <P>The Pensions Board looked at this issue during its examination of the funding standard and did not recommend the immediate introduction of <Col N="1191"/>such a fund. However, it recommended its consideration in the medium term. It is watching very closely how the UK experiment, in particular, works out. That is probably the prudent thing to do. We will keep it very much on the agenda. Although I do not accept the amendment I will keep the matter on the Government&rsquo;s agenda. We need to find out more about how it works, especially in the UK, and see if we can learn lessons from that experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s understanding and his sympathetic approach to this matter. I hope he will consider such a protective fund for the consumer. I do not accept that people are moving from defined benefit schemes to defined contribution schemes in the UK as a result of the charge. I believe people would be willing to pay if they thought their funds would be protected. It is like an insurance policy. That makes sense to me, as there is no protection for them at present. It is something worth examining. I believe there would be a large take-up if people could pay an insurance fee to protect and hold on to their defined benefit schemes.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the figures he outlined. As I have only raised the matter I accept that they may not be comprehensive in terms of the number of schemes that are underfunded or have been wound up. If my calculation is correct, 232 schemes were either underfunded or were wound up in 2004. That is a worrying increase on the 2003 figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>They were not wound up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>So they are underfunded schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>They did not meet the funding standard, which was very conservative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the same as being underfunded. If schemes do not meet the funding standard, they are underfunded. The figure for 2004 is most worrying. We can take it that by the end of 2005 the figures will have increased even more. That is a worrying trend. The number of schemes that do not qualify is spiralling. Extending the funding period to ten years, as the Minister has proposed, will do nothing to address that situation.</P>
      <P>The Minister should advance the bonding proposal. It would be a most welcome measure that might make the pensions industry sit up and take notice of its obligation to look after consumers, rather than just lining its own pockets with profits from the exorbitant fees and charges it demands. I take on board what the Minister said. I look forward to him coming back in future with a proposal in this regard to protect scheme members before the situation gets any worse. Matters are disimproving on an annual basis.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1192"/>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 30, line 19, after &ldquo;may&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;carry out some borrowing only for liquidity purposes and on a temporary basis&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This matter is one which causes me great concern. I was not convinced on Committee Stage that the Minister was looking after the best interests of the consumer. I am sorry to attack the Minister all the time but, as I said earlier, it is nothing personal.</P>
      <P>I read the EU directive carefully. It states that the home member state shall prohibit the institution from borrowing or acting as a guarantor on behalf of third parties. However, member states may authorise institutions to carry out some borrowing only for liquidity purposes and on a temporary basis.</P>
      <P>I am sorry to have to remind the Minister again that he agreed with that in the D&aacute;il when he spoke on the Bill on Second Stage. He took the view that if this was a prudent rule for some schemes, it was prudent for all, an approach supported by the Pensions Board. Somehow or other, between Second Stage and Report Stage in the D&aacute;il the Minister changed his mind. He did a U-turn and introduced an amendment that would allow him to exempt certain schemes from this prohibition by regulation. Article 18.2 is clear in its terms and it is not subject to any derogation. The Minister knows the clause to which I refer, as I previously read it out. For the most part, section 36 of the Bill as initiated gave effect to this requirement. Paragraph 15 of the preamble to the directive allows member states to exempt schemes of fewer than 100 members from this requirement. As a result of the Minister&rsquo;s U-turn, we face the prospect of Ireland being sanctioned by the Commission for being in breach of EU law. Member states have an obligation to transpose directives. The Minister will be aware that while there is some degree of flexibility with regard to how member states go about implementing directives, there is no flexibility in terms of the objective to be achieved. Article 22.1 provides that member states shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with the directive. Under Articles 22.3 and 22.4 member states are permitted to postpone the implementation of Articles 17.1, 17.2 and 18.1(<i>f</i>) but there is nothing in the directive which releases the Government from fully implementing Article 18.2 within the deadline provided.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister explain under what provision of the directive he is permitted to allow for borrowing in any circumstances as the Bill provides? He must explain what motivated him to make this U-turn. He should state whether he or his officials had meetings with pension industry rep<Col N="1193"/>resentatives who raised this point and explain why he did not take the advice of the Pensions Board not to make this amendment.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated earlier in the debate that he did not want to prevent a person from providing for his or her pension by buying a property for his or her business. That is not the purpose of pensions. If an individual wants to buy a property, whether residential or commercial, there are ways of doing so. For example, he or she could borrow the money from a bank if capable of making the repayments. However, to use a pension fund to allow somebody to buy property is not the purpose of the pension fund. This would not abide by the directives whereby we must have a good spread of investment and it does not provide for somebody buying a property for his or her pension.</P>
      <P>As Senator O&rsquo;Meara noted, many people are buying property for their pensions instead of buying into pension industry schemes. However, the Bill is not a vehicle for doing this and it is strictly prohibited in this EU directive, which we are obliged to implement. We can only borrow for liquidity purposes and this must only be on a temporary basis. What the Minister is providing for is not for liquidity purposes. The wording in his amendment flies in the face of what is provided for in the EU directive. I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment. What Senator Terry stated is important. Her suggestion that the Minister may have changed his mind since speaking on the Bill in the D&aacute;il is a matter of some consequence. I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s response because important issues relate to the amendment. I thank Senator Terry for proposing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator asks me to reverse an amendment which I put forward and dealt with on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il. When I spoke in the House on Second Stage, the amendment broadened the regulatory power to allow borrowing for more than liquidity purposes, as the Senator noted. I made the amendment to allow me flexibility to respond to concerns raised in a significant volume of correspondence received by me and some comment in the media regarding borrowing by pension schemes for investment purposes.</P>
      <P>I do not want to interfere with the proper running of pension schemes and do not see any difference between a scheme with 100 members and one with 95 members, for example. The prudential concerns are the same in both cases. That said, I am not convinced that the same prudential concerns arise in regard to single member schemes. I am concerned that changes in this area could adversely impact on coverage. I am conscious of the advice I have received from the Pen<Col N="1194"/>sions Board. Moreover, there are prudential requirements in regard to PRSAs, which are effectively single member schemes.</P>
      <P>The borrowing issue cannot be seen in isolation from other investment rules which may, in any event, indirectly impact on any facility to borrow. All of these issues need careful consideration and for this purpose I am establishing a working group comprising my Department, the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners, the Pensions Board and the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority. I have asked the group to examine all issues related to borrowing and investment. I will consider its view fully before making the regulations.</P>
      <P>I inserted an amendment in the D&aacute;il which will allow me to make the regulations I will have to make before September, when the directive kicks in. Before then, the working group comprising the various bodies involved will consult as to how best to make any such regulations.</P>
      <P>With regard to U-turns, it depends on from where one starts. The present situation is that one can borrow for single member schemes and the Bill does not change this situation. Rather, it might be suspected that we are reverting to the previous position which is that, as the former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, arranged last year, one could borrow for small single member funds.</P>
      <P>I take the Senator&rsquo;s point that an issue arises in that for a person to buy a property for a pension fund is not the purpose of a pension. That said, my responsibility concerns the prudential side rather than tax breaks for pensions, which are a matter for the Minister for Finance and a broader issue. The issue concerns whether one is to allow a person who wants to buy a property as a pension to borrow money to buy that property. Do I have prudential responsibilities to protect an individual pensioner from himself or herself?</P>
      <P>Large pension funds are not allowed to borrow because they have a multiplicity of members and are administered by pension trustees, as are small funds. They must have a mix of investments, equities, bonds and properties and, therefore, the members are a long way back. As a result of this, they must be protected by law, which is what the EU achieved as does our directive. However, with regard to an individual who buys a property and puts it into a pension fund, although there is a legal distance, there is not a great distance between the pensioner, the trustees and the investment manager. Arguably, one might be talking about three people in a closely knit pension fund.</P>
      <P>We will examine whether we need to close this loophole. However, as one is allowed to do this, no U-turn has taken place yet. It could be argued that if I was not to do what I am doing, I could be accused of a U-turn. I am closing a gap that currently exists. One is currently allowed to bor<Col N="1195"/>row money for small schemes. I have taken power to allow the possibility of continuing this because that is my thinking at this time. However, we have until September to allow the group to consider how far we should go. It may be that the group, comprising IFSRA, the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Finance, the Pensions Board and my Department, will come to a conclusion and advise me that some limitation on borrowing or some ratio between borrowing and the fund might be useful. If they recommend that, we will consider it. I hold no brief for people amassing properties but I hold one for extending coverage. I do not want to make speeches up and down the country, begging people to take out increased pension cover and protect themselves by building a pension fund and then introduce legislation which makes it harder for them to do that. I am trying to extend coverage, to give people options to provide for themselves. I see the tax issue as separate and broader but from a prudential point of view, we must encourage rather than discourage the individual providing for his or her future in a pension fund.</P>
      <P>I will take account of what the Senator has said as an input to the deliberation of the group between now and September but I need to be convinced of any need to change the situation. We will see if the group has strong views on that. The legislation merely gives us the powers to make those regulations. We are not currently making them.</P>

	<P>The directive is clear in setting out what a member state institution can do. It can borrow only for liquidity purposes and on a temporary basis. Investing in a property through a pension fund does not improve anyone&rsquo;s liquidity and is certainly not on a short-term basis.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I see no need for this working group. The Minister could withdraw his amendment tonight, accept mine or contact the EU Commission, which I am surprised he has not done, to see if we will be materially breaching this EU directive. If the Minister proceeds with this tonight, I will contact the Commission and ask if the Minister is in breach of the directive.</P>
      <?oasys [cl11.5]?>
      <P>The Minister did not answer a number of questions I put to him about who convinced him to change his mind on this matter on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il. He said he received correspondence. I would bet my bottom dollar that the correspondence was from the pensions industry because this is a very lucrative loophole for it.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to newspaper articles, which I also read. The sequence of events is interesting. Those articles were published on Sunday, 27 February. At that stage the Minister had not done his U-turn. The articles indicated that the Minister might make a U-turn. They make interesting reading. While the journalists&rsquo; bylines <Col N="1196"/>were attached, I would also bet they were written by those in the pensions industry. These articles greatly encouraged the Minister to make a U-turn and, lo and behold, he came to the D&aacute;il on Tuesday, 1 March and did so. In last Sunday&rsquo;s newspapers, there was no mention of that U-turn. The articles&rsquo; purpose was to influence the Minister and they did so, along with the correspondence the Minister received and any other contact he had with the pensions industry.</P>
      <P>This confirms much of what I have been saying, namely, that the Minister is greatly influenced by the pensions industry and bends over backwards to facilitate it. However, I have heard nothing from the Minister tonight regarding efforts to protect the consumer, nor have I heard anything from the industry in that regard. I am also concerned about the EU directive. If the Minister contacts the Commission tomorrow it will give him the advice he needs. If I am wrong, I will admit it. The Minister does not need to set up this working group.</P>
      <P>The Minister should accept my amendment tonight or at least return to the Bill as initiated because if he continues down this road we will be in trouble. I do not want to wait until September to see whether another working group will tell the Minister he is right or wrong.</P>
      <P>I am not convinced of the Minister&rsquo;s argument about encouraging people to buy properties through their pension funds. The Minister knows well that only very wealthy individuals with very large pension funds will do that. The ordinary PAYE worker on a modest income will not be availing of it. Once again, it is the wealthy who will be helped by this and who will avail of further generous tax reliefs. That is not how we should be dealing with our pension schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I can save the Senator a telephone call to the Commission because those calls are expensive nowadays. The directive states:</P>
      <P LI="1">With the exception of Article 19, member states may choose not to apply this directive in whole or in part to any institution located in their territories which operates pensions schemes which together have less than 100 members in total.</P>
      <P FLI="0">It is quite clear from this, Article 5 of the directive, that we are fully authorised to introduce an amendment if we wish not to apply the directive in whole or in part in certain cases. That is what the Commission would tell the Senator. I am exercising the option given.</P>
      <P>Senator Terry insists that I am somehow working for the pension industry in this matter and she continues to talk of a U-turn. People were already allowed to borrow money as individuals, as one-member pension funds, to buy themselves a property or something to provide for their pensions for the future. I have not altered that. If I <Col N="1197"/>implemented the directive in full I would remove that provision. Senator Terry argues that I should remove it. We are heading in that direction but cannot fully make that decision yet. Thousands of people &mdash; I do not know the exact number &mdash; have used the existing law to borrow from the banks in order to buy properties to provide a pension for themselves and their families. Other than suggesting pension funds are a sinister force, Senator Terry has provided no good reason for me to tell people that I need to protect them against themselves.</P>
      <P>I see nobody losing on the present arrangement so I am not minded to change it. I will not suggest that people get themselves sorted with pensions and at the same time tell them I am taking away their rights to set up their own pension funds, buy themselves properties and borrow money to do so. The Senator has given me no good reason to stop people from looking after their individual pensions through the purchase of individual properties if that is their choice.</P>
      <P>Senator Terry may have an argument on the tax side but that is a separate issue. Tax breaks for this type of arrangement are a bigger issue. On the pension side, in terms of prudence, many people would disagree with Senator Terry. She herself has half made the argument to me. If a member of her family was joining a pension fund, she might be the first to advise him or her to stick with a shop in a shopping centre, an industrial unit or an apartment.</P>
      <P>One would be better off doing this than subjecting one&rsquo;s money to the whims of the Stock Exchange where an Elan-type fall might occur and wipe out one&rsquo;s money in a split second. Culturally, Irish people are attached to bricks and mortar and seem to feel safer with property. The Senator has taken me to task for retaining an existing situation. I will not change it without an extremely good reason and a catch-all directive from Brussels is not enough, particularly when it permits me to make an exemption for such scenarios. I have not yet heard a good reason to prevent ordinary citizens from covering themselves for a pension but if I hear an impressive valid reason, I will consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Bill reported without amendment and received for final consideration.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister put it up to me again. I thought I had provided the Minister with numerous reasons he should not continue on his current route. Anyone I know who wishes to buy a property goes to the bank to borrow the money to do so, if they can afford to make the repayments. Pension funds should not be used to do <Col N="1198"/>so. I obviously have not made the argument sufficiently well. I thought the terms of the directive clearly implied that one can only borrow for liquidity purposes. I have lost the argument and will await the findings of the Minister&rsquo;s working group.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister and his officials for the time they have given me on this Bill. I ask him to consider a number of the points I raised during the debates and at other times regarding pensions. I raise the issue because a considerable number of people known to me are extremely concerned about their pension provision and suffer at the hands of the pensions industry. The industry is going through a difficult period and people will not receive the pension they had expected and worked for all their lives. Something must be done and people need protection. The pensions industry must do more to ensure that pensions are protected for the future. If they cannot do so, the Minister will be obliged to step in and devise another model. He has previously suggested that he will examine the issue to see whether some other mechanism could be used to provide for pensions. There may be, given the fantastic uptake of the SSIA scheme which people have embraced and from which they will benefit. We are a nation of savers.</P>
      <P>I no longer have the statistics to hand, but many people do not have protected pensions schemes. It is all very well for the Members and for State employees who have a protected pension to look forward to. However, a very large percentage of our population does not have a protected pension and thousands more do not have a pension at all. The Minister is spending money in an effort to encourage people to take out pensions but is wasting it, because they will not do so. However, if he can offer something similar to the SSIA scheme, they will take it up. People are not taking up the PRSAs either, as they are not guaranteed. I ask the Minister to consider a number of my points to see if we can work together to make some improvements. I again thank the Minister and his officials for the time that has been put into the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister and his officials for their work on this important legislation. The Minister has onerous responsibilities. The Bill shows this clearly, as it ranges from social welfare to pensions and people&rsquo;s futures. These futures rely on decisions made by the Minister. I acknowledge the work of Senator Terry in raising a number of important issues regarding pensions. SSIAs are very popular because of their attractive return. If the return on PRSAs were as attractive, people would queue to sign up for them as they did for SSIAs. Hopefully, we can return to debate the pensions issue. It would be important to discuss means of ensuring that those who do not have protection get some and those <Col N="1199"/>who can make decisions at present to safeguard their future do so. With the help of the Minister and the Pensions Board we should examine how we might facilitate or encourage that to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister and his officials for coming before us today and on previous occasions to discuss the Bill. It is a tremendous achievement. We have had a very detailed discussion about pensions but we should not lose sight of the fact that this is the most significant piece of social welfare legislation that has come before us to date. Social welfare spending is at an all-time high. This year, major increases will make a real difference to the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in receipt of child benefit, disability payments, pensions, respite care grants and a range of benefits paid to the less well off. The Bill also recognises the importance of pensions.</P>
      <P>Senator Terry should be complimented, irrespective of whether we agree with the thrust of her specific points on pensions. Her contribution forces us to analyse the information and the work being carried out on pensions. If the working group on pensions reports to the Minister in September, it will have had plenty of food for thought which can only lead to a better situation. I am delighted the Minister has reiterated that next year will see the finalisation of the Government&rsquo;s commitments on child benefit. We also look forward to the introduction of the two-tiered child benefit payment that may address some of the concerns we have about child poverty. I am proud to be on this side of the House, having passed a piece of legislation enabling the highest ever spending on social welfare. I compliment the Minister on the way he must have fought his corner at the Cabinet table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators for their consideration of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill. As I stated earlier, I deliberately used the word &ldquo;pensions&rdquo; in the legislation&rsquo;s title for the first time. It would normally be termed a Social Welfare Bill but I included the word to demonstrate my concern about the pensions issue and to acknowledge that an important directive was being transposed.</P>
      <P>I thank every Senator who contributed to this debate, particularly Senator Terry who put in a considerable amount of work and raised some challenging issues. I listened carefully to all the arguments that were put forward and have an open mind on these matters. My objective is to bring about better pensions and more adequacy, coverage, security and certainty for our pensioners going forward. I will do whatever it takes to realise that objective.</P><Col N="1200"/>
      <P>My reluctance to accept amendments at this stage comes from the complexity of the issues. Some of them are at too early a stage for me to form a definite view on them. I will form a view as soon as possible. As Senator Cox noted, the social welfare aspects of the Bill are also extremely important given that child benefit is such a major investment by the Irish taxpayer. I thank all the Senators for their contributions, I noted carefully what they have said and I will act on it at the earliest opportunity.</P>

    <Title>Rural Renewal Schemes.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The upper Shannon rural renewal tax incentive has been a very beneficial incentive for County Longford. Since its introduction, it has brought about major increases in business, tourism and building development. All of this work has been undertaken by many people within Longford. Some of these projects have been completed, while others have yet to be completed or are at the planning stage.</P>
      <P>One of the main reasons I have raised this matter is the need to allow communities who may have missed out due to delays in other local government programmes, such as water services and small sewerage schemes, to gain some benefits from this rural renewal incentive. With some schemes either just developed or close to construction stage, the advantage to be gained from joined-up Government policy will be lost if tax incentives are withdrawn. These incentives have been withdrawn since 31 December 2004. Time rang out on the scheme as development applications were flooding into Longford County Council. I ask the Minister to extend the programme for another two years until December 2006 for receipt of planning applications and December 2008 for the completion of works.</P>
      <P>The large number of locally based applications at the latter stage of the rural renewal scheme highlights the positive economic effect of the initiative and, according to Michael Killeen, Longford county manager, the trend will continue if the deadlines are extended. The scheme has had a significant and positive impact on the social and economic wellbeing of the area covered in the upper Shannon renewal tax incentive, the original designation of which was based on poor economic performance and weak population structure. It could be argued that the areas <Col N="1201"/>covered did not have the capacity to develop in the early stages of the scheme because they were so poorly positioned in terms of economic performance. Longford is still the cheapest county in which to buy a house and is the county that pays the lowest level of tax, evidence that the scheme is still needed.</P>
      <P>The Minister can appreciate the huge benefits that were provided by this scheme. As the initiative has progressed, it has had a positive impact on the economic strength of the region and greater numbers are in a position to take advantage of all the scheme has to offer. To remove the benefits of the scheme at this juncture would be counterproductive and have a regressive effect on the communities involved. The county managers of the five counties affected by the withdrawal of the scheme &mdash; Longford, Roscommon, Cavan, Sligo and Leitrim &mdash; have taken the unprecedented step of coming together to request the extension of the scheme and have strongly petitioned the Minister to continue to fund this very important initiative. I also have the backing of the 21 members of Longford County Council, the nine members of Longford Town Council and the nine members of Granard Town Council to push for the continuance of the scheme. The chambers of commerce in Longford, Granard, Edgeworthstown, Ballymahon and Lanesboro also all back the continuance of the scheme. I join them in impressing on the Minister the importance to Longford and the other counties that come under the umbrella of the upper Shannon rural renewal tax incentive scheme of the continuance of funding to extend and expand the benefits to them.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware that we are in the BMW region and there is a huge underspend of funding in that region, as was highlighted in the mid-term report. There are many clear reasons this scheme should be continued. The area it covers is small and the most underdeveloped in the country. We would greatly appreciate if the Minister could give due consideration to the continuance of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The rural renewal scheme was introduced in the Finance Act 1998 to address some of the problems facing the upper Shannon area. It was at that stage becoming apparent that this area, with its history of persistent high emigration, poor land and fragmented holdings, was not sharing in the economic turnabout experienced from the mid-1990s in other parts of the State. The 1996 census, for example, showed that the populations of both counties Longford and Leitrim had declined while every other county in the State had shown moderate or significant increases. In contrast, since the mid-1980s a succession of urban renewal schemes had succeeded in rejuvenating many inner city areas.</P><Col N="1202"/>
      <P>In light of the success of the urban renewal schemes, the then Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, decided that the concept of tax incentives for the rejuvenation of urban areas could be successfully applied to the upper Shannon area on a pilot basis and consequently he introduced the scheme in the Finance Act 1998. The areas designated for relief under the scheme included all of counties Longford and Leitrim and parts of the adjoining counties Cavan, Roscommon and Sligo. The objectives for the scheme were to reverse the pattern of continuing population decline and to promote private sector investment in the area.</P>
      <P>The package of incentives available under the scheme is broadly similar to the reliefs contained in the other area-based incentive schemes such as the urban renewal scheme and the town renewal scheme, that is, 100% accelerated capital allowances for the construction or refurbishment of certain commercial and industrial buildings and tax relief for the construction and refurbishment of owner occupied and rented residential properties.</P>
      <P>The rural renewal scheme is the most extensive and wide-ranging area based tax relief scheme in the State. In the other area based schemes, only certain sub-areas and sites qualify for tax relief and in most cases each of the qualifying sub-areas or sites qualify for a limited range of reliefs. In comparison, all of the qualifying areas in the rural renewal scheme are eligible for the full range of reliefs available under the scheme. This was deliberative policy aimed at rejuvenating the area.</P>
      <P>The Senator&rsquo;s request follows on from those of all my parliamentary colleagues from the areas concerned who made a request to have the deadline extended in discussions with the Minister for Finance before the budget. The Minister for Finance could not accede to this request, bearing in my mind that the scheme was originally due to terminate on 31 December 2001 and has already been extended on a number of occasions since then. In the Finance Act 2000, this original December 2001 deadline was extended by an additional year until December 2002 and in the Finance Act 2002, the deadline was extended by a further two years until December 2004.</P>
      <P>In the case of this two-year extension to December 2004, there were no qualifying conditions attached to the extended time period, as is the case for other schemes such as the urban renewal scheme, the relief for multi-storey car parks and the reliefs for hotels and holiday cottages. In effect, the scheme benefited from a straight two-year extension and was one of the few area based tax incentive schemes to do so.</P>
      <P>In the Finance Act 2004, the deadline for incurring qualifying expenditure was again extended until 31 July 2006 where a full and valid planning application is received by the relevant planning <Col N="1203"/>authority on or before 31 December 2004. This latest extension to the deadline, along with a similar extension of other reliefs, was introduced to provide for an orderly winding down of the schemes and to cater for pipeline projects subject to unforeseen delays. As announced in budget 2005, the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners will undertake a thorough evaluation of the effect of the various tax incentive reliefs, including the rural renewal scheme.</P>
      <P>In this context, the Minister for Finance also confirmed to the House that the termination dates for the various schemes laid down in the Finance Act 2004 will remain unchanged. The review will evaluate their impact and operation, including their economic and social benefits for the different locations and sectors involved and for the wider community. The review will examine the degree to which these schemes allow high-<Col N="1204"/>income individuals to reduce their tax liabilities. As part of this review, the Minister for Finance wrote to the five relevant county managers and advised them that there will be an opportunity for their local authorities to contribute to the evaluation of the scheme as part of the process. The scheme has been a tremendous boost for the areas concerned during its long operation and I am proud that it was a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister for Finance who introduced it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister for Finance who is ending the scheme. I ask that this decision be reconsidered and that the scheme be extended for two years. There was a large deficit in funding for water and sewerage schemes in the area and development could not take place for the first two or three years as a result. Further investigation is warranted in this regard.</P>
