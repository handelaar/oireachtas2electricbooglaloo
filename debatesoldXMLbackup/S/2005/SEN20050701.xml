	<P>On No. 5, I understand the Minister will come to the House this morning&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The Minister, Deputy Coughlan, is coming to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>She will do that with the Senator&rsquo;s colleague, Senator Bradford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome that. It is appropriate it would happen.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform initiated a public inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the death of a young boy, Brian Rossiter, in Clonmel in September 2002. He was found in a coma in Garda custody. This is clearly a depressing case which involved a 14 year old boy. The question must be asked as to why he was detained in custody that evening. However, a further question which must be asked is why it has taken the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform almost three years to launch an investigation into the circumstances surrounding his death. I understand the Department was informed in January 2004 of the circumstances yet it has taken almost 18 months for the Minister to initiate an inquiry.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday last, Senator Cummins, myself and other Members were debating an amendment to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill which brings up to date the Dublin Police Act 1924 to allow for such independent public inquiries. I would have thought it prudent that the Minister would have put on the record of the House at that time that he intended to initiate such an inquiry. He had informed the family that morning, on Wednesday last. Why did he not put on the record of the House the fact he intended to use the very amendment we were discussing that evening to initiate a public inquiry into the tragic circumstances of this case?</P>
      <P>I reiterate the point I made last week. Why is it the case that the Government continues with <Col N="2523"/>its practice of not making important public statements in this House or the other House? While I welcome the fact there is to be an inquiry, the Minister should have told Members of his intention when we were debating the very amendment which gave him the power to initiate such an inquiry. I regret this did not happen.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to make known my views and those of my colleagues to all Ministers. There is no point talking about Seanad reform, D&aacute;il reform or any kind of reform unless the Government reforms the way it treats the Houses of the Oireachtas. I hope that is the lesson we learn this summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Henry recently raised the question of the difficulties for non-EU qualified doctors of gaining recognition, acceptance and entrance to practice in this country. She particularly raised issues with regard to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. There is also the issue of how the Medical Council deals with this issue. It has been represented to me that the process is long, expensive and highly bureaucratic, and that it demands academic standards that would not be demanded of Irish qualified and trained doctors.</P>
      <P>I raise this issue because it is one which the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children could deal with on our behalf. There is a shortage of doctors in Ireland, an issue to which the T&aacute;naiste referred in the House. The Medical Council is established by statute. Therefore, it is important we would have some indication of how it conducts its business. This issue arises with other professions. There is a similar difficulty in education with regard to the teastas c&aacute;il&iacute;ochta sa Ghaoluinn, the recognition examination that non-Irish trained or qualified teachers must go through. It may be that there is a connection between all these issues.</P>
      <P>However, the difficulty experienced by non-EU qualified doctors in gaining recognition and entry to practice in Ireland is extraordinary. In the new session, we would benefit from a discussion with the T&aacute;naiste, which she would find helpful in light of the fact she has referred on a number of occasions to the shortage of doctors and the difficulty of getting trained doctors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the remarks of Senator Brian Hayes. When I heard the Minister make his remarks yesterday about the death of the young boy, Brian Rossiter, in Clonmel, and the delay in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, my initial reaction was to say, &ldquo;That is the Department of justice for you. What else do you expect?&rdquo; However, on contemplation, we must state that this is not acceptable. The circumstances of this case were such that they should have set alarm bells ringing in the Department and elsewhere. A young boy of 14 died in custody. It is remarkable and unacceptable that it took so long for somebody in the Department to <Col N="2524"/>accept something was wrong and should be looked at. Something is wrong in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that should be looked at.</P>
      <P>The coming weekend is one of those rare weekends when much of humankind will be focused on one issue, namely, poverty and development in Africa. I ask the Leader to use her influence in Government and with her nephew, the responsible Minister of State, to get back on track the commitment of this country to assisting the development of Africa. Many Members on all sides of the House have lamented the fact we have resiled from our commitment to meet the UN target on aid. In a sense, that is a closed chapter but it is important we put in place an immediate and ambitious target that we can meet. Whatever is said, we are ahead of the pack in the EU in terms of the commitments we currently meet. It would be very disappointing if the Government was happy, as it seems to be, to simply fall back into the pack and make the same commitment as other EU countries.</P>
      <P>It is important we put in place an immediate and ambitious target, not in 2015, when those currently in Government will expect to be out of Government, so, in a sense, they are making a vague promise for somebody&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>They do not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not talking about parties. Most individuals will expect to be out of Government. They are making a vague commitment for some future Government sometime in the next decade. It is important it is a tangible target of which people feel a sense of ownership, and one on which we can deliver immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Apropos of the matter raised by Senator Brian Hayes, there should be an automatic and expeditious inquiry into any death in Garda custody, for whatever reason.</P>
      <P>When the House resumes in the autumn, we ought to have a debate on the challenges facing what an expert from the ESRI called our &ldquo;red hot economy&rdquo;. Employment is growing at 1,400 a week and we have the lowest unemployment rate in the EU. As the Commission President, Mr. Barroso, stated yesterday at the Forum for Europe, nothing is more social than employment.</P>
      <P>Great credit is due to all concerned. It is not due only to this Government but to Governments over a period of years, the social partners and so on. We have a very healthy, strong economy. Our priority must be to keep it that way so, among other things, we can address social problems at home but also continue to increase, rather than stagnate, our development aid contribution, a process I support. I have every confidence we will do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I raised previously in the House the issue of the escalating cost of electricity. Last year charges increased by 13%. Last Tuesday, the <Col N="2525"/>energy regulator came before the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. He outlined the difficulties with regard to the cost of inputs and fuels. While he refuted a statement in a recent newspaper report that electricity charges could increase by 36%, he would give no definitive response on what the likely increase will be, except to state it would probably increase in September next. The D&aacute;il and Seanad will be in recess at that time and will not be able to give the reaction that might be anticipated on this matter.</P>
      <P>It is a serious situation. There is a public service obligation in all electricity legislation yet the input from peat is now only 5% of all the fuels used. The regulator stated the public service obligation is anti-competitive. If this is the case, the Minister should at the stroke of a pen delete it from the legislation and the ordinary consumer should not have to pay for it.</P>
      <P>I am critical of the regulator and the Department in regard to alternative energy. There are many announcements concerning wind energy but there is too much wind on the issue. We know the megawatt capacity and we know that a multiplicity of projects are waiting for approval. As I pointed out to the regulator, a terrible situation exists where people are making planning applications to local authorities, which I can guarantee will never be approved. At this stage someone has not quantified the situation, stated that the figure will be 13.5% and that there is already a certain capacity in place if these applications are accepted. People are being put to considerable expense in framing proposals to planning authorities. I asked the energy regulator if he would collaborate with the Department on a report on the status of the situation. Let us not deceive people making applications in good faith and remove this unnecessary expense. It does not take a rocket scientist for the regulator&rsquo;s office to employ 40 people to do a report and tell us when we have reached capacity and when applications can no longer be accepted. The situation is totally unfair and deceptive.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to come to the House when we resume in September to speak on energy policy. I wish to ask him many questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>The Health and Social Care Professionals Bill, which gives protection to a number of professional titles, was recently passed. It was disappointing to get a letter this morning from the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, RIAI. Senator Leyden, who is a member of that profession will be equally concerned that there are people masquerading as architects. A recent television programme referred to an individual who ripped people off left, right and centre. We have another legislative void regarding people who are struck off the register practising alternative medicine. Senators Finucane, Cummins, Kenneally and others raised the matter of the Killaloe clinic on which I would <Col N="2526"/>welcome proposals from the relevant Minister. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Dick Roche, is preparing legislation for the situation concerning architects. The practice of alternative medicine by people who are not suitable for inclusion on the medical register is a rip-off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not agree with Senator Brian Hayes&rsquo;s comments on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The case in Clonmel is tragic and, as Senator Mansergh suggested, an automatic inquiry should be held into such circumstances. I am not sure it would have been appropriate for the Minister to cite specific cases. We are often told it is not appropriate to name people in this House as it may rehash their grief. As long as the instrument is available, and is effectively used, it did not matter a damn in this instance where it was announced. There are other far more serious circumstances in which the House is bypassed.</P>
      <P>The tragic situation in Zimbabwe has been raised several times in the past two weeks. We heard of nuns trying to look after babies with AIDS who had been thrown out onto the street. However, there is some good news. I met with Mr. Roy Bennett some 18 months ago. His case was raised by me and some other Senators, including Senator Ross who raised it on the Adjournment and kindly shared time with me. Yesterday I heard that Mr. Bennett had been released from prison, partly as a result of efforts of people in this House. That is something positive on which to end the term.</P>
      <P>I look forward to the introduction of legislation in the autumn governing the rights of workers coming to this county. I hope amendments will be accepted in this House. Based on what we know at the moment it is not generous legislation. In America they ask for the huddled masses and the poor. We ask the developing world for its doctors, lawyers and graduates. We ask for all its talented people and if they are really good we will let them stay for five years. If we need them for any more exploitation they can remain for another period and then we will kick them out when we have bled them dry. That is not the correct way to approach this situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Those of us who were privileged to be in the Mansion House, including our colleagues on the Forum on Europe and other interested individuals, could not but have been uplifted by the inspiring, visionary speech by the European Commission President. In the words of our distinguished colleague and chairman, Senator Maurice Hayes, the response was the nearest to a standing ovation ever experienced in the forum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>A sitting ovation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>This momentous occasion showed real leadership at a time when leadership <Col N="2527"/>has been found to be lacking in Europe. I ask the Leader, in view of her stated commitment to continuing a debate on European matters, to formulate an opportunity to debate the European constitutional treaty in its various parts so that this House can continue to play the leading role started by the Leader when she introduced Members of the European Parliament to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Everyone will welcome the proposal of the Minister for Education an Science to revise the leaving certificate in a simple way. This will involve addressing the problems that have arisen over the years, including the 20% drop-out rate at leaving certificate stage and the further 20% of pupils who do not do well in the final examination. In her proposals to the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, which originally made far-reaching proposals, the Minister has adopted a sensible approach in suggesting a two-stage examination rather than the single terminal examination, which causes stress to students.</P>
      <P>At the same time we must remember that her predecessor, Deputy Noel Dempsey, decide to make the 180-day school year sacrosanct. Teachers and pupils had to be in school for that period. Now, the current Minister is proposing a second stage examination during the school year. How can this be incorporated if the rule on 180 days is sacrosanct? I hope the Leader can request a debate on education early in the next academic year, at the start of the new session, particularly on the new proposals for the leaving certificate.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s clear indication that she will not tinker with the transition year, and that it will be retained as a stand-alone year, in which students can assess the direction in which they may go. I ask for an early debate on the proposals for the leaving certificate, which will be welcomed by all, and will contribute to retaining the high standing of the leaving certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I reiterate the points made by Senator Ulick Burke. I was delighted to read the Minister&rsquo;s submission on revamping the leaving certificate. This has been a special interest of mine for many years. A debate in the autumn would be welcome. Perhaps we could have a brainstorming exercise on how we should move forward. The new system might work as described in the submission but I would like a full debate before we proceed.</P>
      <P>I was privileged to be at the Mansion House yesterday to hear the magnificent speech of President Barroso. I would welcome a copy of his presentation. He showed pure leadership and I have never experienced anything like it. We should meet the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Noel Treacy, to discuss how to move forward in the autumn to project the future of the EU constitution.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="2528"/>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to remind Members to keep their eyes on Sellafield this summer. A friend of mine who googled the word &ldquo;Sellafield&rdquo; could not believe how many results on implications for Ireland this search returns. We are downwind of Sellafield. To suggest that for nine months the people in Sellafield did not notice a leakage of 83,000 litres is unbelievable. I mention this because we are in danger of getting tired of listening to such reports. Sellafield is a Chernobyl-type threat to us and we have not paid enough attention to the problem. The danger is that during the next few months we may even forget the problem exists. We must keep an eye on the situation.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I was inspired by the President of the European Commission, Mr. Barroso, yesterday. He was enthusiastic and provided a vision of Europe for the future. There are some challenges to him because he has not managed to get the economy right. An article in today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The New York Times</i> states: &ldquo;. . . the only question is whether Germany and France will face reality: Either they become Ireland, or they become museums.&rdquo; It is a very interesting article and clearly identifies that the way of the future is the way Ireland is going. Let us make sure that during the next few months we keep our eyes on the challenges facing this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Eight Senators have offered to contribute, but we only have nine minutes left. I will do my best to accommodate those eight, but I cannot accept any more.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I have. I would like to bring it to the attention of the House that John Dowling of The<i> Star</i> newspaper has complimented the work of the Seanad. I would like to compliment the Leader of the House and all the people involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>In light of what I said &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Glynn&rsquo;s proposal regarding the professional registration Bill, which is long overdue. Discussions on the issue have been going on for approximately ten years and it is about time somebody decided to bring <Col N="2529"/>the Bill forward. The area is unregulated and it is a travesty that the Bill has not been introduced.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader consider having a debate when we return in the autumn on the crisis in Palestine? I led a delegation including Senator John Paul Phelan and Deputies &Oacute; Snodaigh, Gormley, Gregory and Gilmore to Palestine where a &ldquo;wall of shame&rdquo; is being built by CRH. I hope we can arrange a campaign to request shareholders of that discredited company to withdraw their support from a company that is building a &ldquo;wall of shame&rdquo; around Bethlehem which is the home and birthplace of Jesus Christ. How could CRH do it? The situation is a travesty. I am ashamed that a company from this country would supply the cement to build a wall 30 ft. high around the city of Bethlehem. I urge shareholders to withdraw their support from this discredited company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>They survived more than cement down the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Sellafield is a catastrophe waiting to happen. I tried to raise this issue yesterday. Sellafield must be closed in the interest of the health and safety of our nation. This is something we have been demanding for a long time. It is up to the Government to take this matter to the international courts again. What happened over the past nine months shows total negligence on the part of the staff at Sellafield. Fine Gael has called for independent observer status at Sellafield many times and this is something that must be granted while Sellafield remains open. The Government must pursue the issue again in the international courts.</P>
      <P>What action does the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government intend to take against the British Government on this issue? There is significant public concern about what is happening or has happened at Sellafield over the years. I think the call for the closure of Sellafield is unanimous in this House. It must happen and it is up to the Government to ensure it does, in the interest of the safety of the nation.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader for a debate in the new session on stem cells, particularly the situation where somatic stem cells in adult tissue are not investigated by the international community despite having the most promise. This offers an opportunity for Ireland to lead the way. The benefits in the next few years will derive from adult stem cells and germ line therapy. I urge that this country lead the way in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Norris for drawing the attention of the House to the problems non-EU doctors have, not just with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform but also with the Medical Council. Will the Leader urge that a new medical practitioners&rsquo; Bill, which has been sought by bodies such as the <Col N="2530"/>Medical Council for years and which has been promised for over a decade, be brought before the House in the next session? I am sure we could do as good a job on it as we did on the Veterinary Practice Bill.</P>
      <P>No. 18, motion 11 on the Order Paper, in the name of the Independent Senators, requests the Minister for Education and Science to increase the number of places for medical students this autumn, as recommended by the Hanly report. I am sure many Members support this motion and I would be grateful if they would add their names to it because this would lend far more weight to it for the Minister. We are not in a position to debate the motion between now and the leaving certificate results when there will be the usual moaning and groaning about the points required for medicine and the shortage of Irish doctors. Without support for this motion, nothing will have been done and matters will remain the same as they have been for the past 25 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>A report was published recently on the number of drug-related deaths in the Dublin area. The figures are shocking. In my area of Dublin 15 there have been 50 deaths in a four-year period and the figure for parts of the inner city is far higher. The issue is not being addressed in a manner that will curb the numbers of deaths. Some 100 recommendations were brought forward by the national drugs strategy two years ago. We are now midway through that strategy, yet only approximately 50% of the recommendations have been implemented. Many of them relate to treatment, timeframes for providing treatment, and an increase in the number of garda&iacute; qualified to deal with the drugs issue. It is vital that we progress and implement the 100 recommendations and do something to end the number of drug-related deaths in our communities in Dublin and throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader prioritise a debate on the MRSA superbug at the start of the next session? A lady from Kilkenny spoke to me on the issue this morning and there is significant anxiety among the public about it. Over 200 people attended a meeting in Dublin last week on the issue and over 100 attended a meeting on the issue in Kilkenny a few weeks ago. I have written to the HSE and the Department of Health and Children about the matter, but weeks later I still await a reply. This suggests they are not on top of their briefs. Officially, over 550 people died last year from MRSA, but the figure could be far higher. We should prioritise this debate in the new session.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Finucane regarding increased gas and electricity charges. If the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources did his job instead of sorting out Fianna F&aacute;il problems in Castlebar, perhaps we would not face such regular high increases.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="2531"/>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree that a debate on the MRSA superbug would be welcome. I was going to say that a gentleman from Carlow spoke to me this morning about it, but I did not.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Ulick Burke with regard to a debate with the Minister for Education and Science. I would welcome an opportunity in the new session to discuss the Minister&rsquo;s proposals. From what I have read this morning, the proposals seem like a good idea. It would be useful to discuss the proposals.</P>
      <P>I agree with the comments made by Senator Leyden. I was part of the delegation that visited Palestine. As somebody who did not really have any views on the subject before I went there, it was a real eye-opening experience for me to see the conditions in that part of the world. I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the problem at the earliest opportunity in the new session. Things seem to be getting much worse for Palestinians and significant issues remain to be resolved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Before I call the Leader to reply on the Order of Business, I remind Senators that the Head Usher of the Houses of the Oireachtas, Mr. Ray Hesse, who is in the Distinguished Visitors Gallery, will retire during the summer. I invite the Leader of the House and the leaders of the other groups to pay tribute to Mr. Hesse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be happy to do so. All Senators appreciate the work of the Head Usher of the Houses of the Oireachtas, Mr. Ray Hesse, who is present in the Chamber for the last time today. He plans to retire on 30 August next after 32 years of service in the Houses of the Oireachtas. During that time, Ray Hesse and his gorgeous gold braid have been essential features of the Houses. Senators strongly appreciate his courteous demeanour and the civility he shows to everyone. He was the first member of staff to attain Head Usher status from the service officer ranks. He was a service officer under the tutelage of Paddy Halligan for two years, before he became an usher in 1975. He worked in the textile industry before he joined the staff of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Ray Hesse&rsquo;s expertise in the Houses centred on Chamber attendance and a font of knowledge about the history of the Houses. I understand he is a great family man. He and his wife, Maura, have a daughter, Karen, and a son, Paul, both of whom have very successful careers. I am indebted to the Superintendent and his staff for the information they have supplied. Ray Hesse is a figure of great courtesy and dignity. That somebody of the calibre of Ray Hesse is minding the Chamber and minding us as we go about our business has been of great benefit to every one of us. We wish him great happiness.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Fine Gael group, I echo the Leader&rsquo;s comments in wishing Mr. Ray Hesse a long and happy retirement from this August. He was right to choose to retire in a month when the Houses will not be overburdened. He has given great and sterling service to the Houses over a long period of time, as the Leader has said. We are grateful for Ray Hesse&rsquo;s work and contribution, not only to the Houses but also to the notion of parliamentary democracy in this country. Members too often forget the contribution made by the officers of the Houses. I refer to the permanent Civil Service, who run the Houses in all our names.</P>
      <P>I thank Ray Hesse, on behalf of the thousands of citizens he has met over the years, for organising for tour groups to visit the Houses and for giving them information on such occasions. We often forget that the ushers are an essential cog in the wheel when schoolchildren and other groups come to Leinster House. They give the public the information they need about the workings of the Houses. I wish Ray Hesse a long and happy retirement. I hope he enjoys a break with his family after many years of distinguished public service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to associate the Senators on the Independent benches with the words which have been said by my colleagues about the retirement of Mr. Ray Hesse. I wish to express our gratitude to Ray for many years of diligent and polite service in these Houses. We have been impressed on many occasions by the even-handed manner in which he deals with people, regardless of whether they are mere schoolchildren or foreign dignitaries. He carries himself with the authority that is required of him in his position. He has represented us very well on many occasions. When I had the pleasure of meeting Ray Hesse and his daughter in other circumstances recently, I was impressed by him and his family. I know that he enjoys the success his family has achieved, as he is always happy to discuss such matters and to bring us up to date with developments.</P>
      <P>We have always found Ray Hesse to be approachable and supportive. He has always been diplomatic when he has had to deal with difficulties over the years. Many of us have lost our cool, got a bit above ourselves or pushed things to the limit in that time. In such circumstances, Ray Hesse has always behaved in the manner that has been required of him in the discharge of his responsibilities as an usher of the Houses. None of us was surprised when he continued to act in a similar manner when he adopted additional duties in recent times. We wish him well in his retirement. We thank him again for the support he has given us, our visitors and other people who have come to this House over many years.</P>

	<P>On behalf of the Labour Party Senators, I would like to be associated with the remarks made by the Leader about the retirement of Mr. Ray Hesse. We seem to be going through a curious period at present. We are losing many of those who have been linchpins of the Houses over recent decades.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Ray Hesse, who has worked in the Houses of the Oireachtas for over 30 years, is one of those linchpins. He has always been extraordinarily polite and civil in the guidance he has given all the Members of the Houses and the manner in which he has dealt with the various issues which have arisen over the years. I was looking forward to seeing his firm guidance coming into play yesterday, to deal with Senator<?oasys _jy?>Bannon. Perhaps it was not any harm that we were deprived of that last hurrah. In some ways, it is unfortunate that one does not learn much about servants of the Houses until one receives notes setting out their backgrounds when they are retiring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>

	<P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats group, I am delighted to be associated with the tributes to Mr. Ray Hesse. I wish him well in his retirement, which I hope he will enjoy. It is extraordinary that some of the staff of the Houses, like Ray, have served us for 32 years. Such an enormous record of public service is not generally recognised as it should be. Ray Hesse has always been a discreet, quiet and, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole said, authoritative presence. He will probably bring some secrets with him when he leaves the Oireachtas. I am reminded, perhaps inappropriately, of the Johnny Cash song:</P>
      <P LI="1">I&rsquo;ve seen &rsquo;em come and go and I&rsquo;ve seen them die</P>
      <P LI="1" el="0">And long ago I stopped askin&rsquo; why</P>
      <P FLI="0">Ray Hesse might be able to reflect on those lyrics. We are very well served by all the people who look after us in the Oireachtas. Ray has been a model to such people. I am sure other people will endeavour to follow in his footsteps, but it will be very hard to fill his boots. We wish him well in his retirement.</P>

On behalf of all the Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, I wish Ray many years of good luck and good health. As everyone knows, Ray has always been very courteous, helpful and calm, a combination that has made him one of the most popular members of staff. He has given great service to the Houses of the Oireachtas and will be sorely missed by his many friends here. Ray has always been a great family man. Now that his late nights in Leinster House are coming to an end, Ray and his wife Maura will have a great opportunity to pursue their hobby of ballroom dancing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Brian Hayes raised the matter of 14 year old Brian Rossiter, who died in Clonmel. He wondered why the Minister, when speaking on an amendment to the 1924 Act in this House, did not say he was setting up a committee or review group on the matter. I expect he considered he was dealing with the Bill and did not want to sidetrack. I do not know because I was not in the House at the time. The Senator made a general point about Ministers making announcements here or in the other House. Perhaps there is too much of a tendency to make announcements outside both Houses of the Oireachtas. The Houses of the Oireachtas is the place to make important announcements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I will ensure that message is passed on. We have been fortunate that most Ministers who have attended here took amendments in this House. There was evidence of this at the beginning of today&rsquo;s business when it was reported that the D&aacute;il has accepted amendments made to Bills in the Seanad. We have been very lucky. While it is part of their duty, Ministers have been prompt in coming to this House to debate legislation and we have found them to be entirely courteous and helpful.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred to the recognition of foreign trained doctors. This is linked to the motion he has tabled, about which Senator Henry has often spoken, to increase the intake of students into the schools of medicine here. It will take these students six or seven years to qualify. I would consider putting my name to that motion.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senator McDowell referred to Brian Rossiter. The attention is on Africa this weekend and on the call, &ldquo;making poverty history&rdquo;. I understand <Col N="2535"/>the Taoiseach will make a definitive statement on the matter at the UN meeting in September.</P>
      <P>Senator Mansergh said there should always be an expeditious and immediate investigation into any death in Garda custody. He referred to the ESRI and the red hot economy. I smiled this morning because usually George Lee is so lugubrious when talking about financial matters. Even when there was a good news story, he was still lugubrious this morning, but perhaps that is his manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We should not refer to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Economists are always gloomy; they like to be gloomy. The news from the ESRI this morning was very good. Senator Mansergh referred to President Barroso&rsquo;s statement yesterday that there is nothing more social than employment. If one is earning a living, many things are possible.</P>
      <P>Senator Finucane referred to ESB costs and the fact that the PSO should be deleted from bills. He said that the only alternative energy appears to be wind energy, which sometimes generates lots of hot air and not much else, and that there are other alternative energy sources. He asked that the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dempsey, come here in the autumn to debate the matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Glynn referred to the Health and Social Care Professionals Bill, people who masquerade as architects and alternative medicine. He said that legislation is required for the recognition of professionalism in various fields. I do not know if this can be composite legislation because the architects are currently the subject of debate. However, it is a fair point.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris referred to the House being bypassed, but I do not think so. He also referred to Zimbabwe and the fact that Roy Bennett and his wife have been released, about which we are pleased. He asked if we could debate the green card legislation because he is not satisfied with what he is reading about it.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney referred to the inspirational visit yesterday of President Barroso to the Mansion House. Everyone agreed that he acquitted himself well and that he gave inspiration to those who attended. Under the CPP, perhaps we could invite President Barroso to address the Seanad in the autumn. It would be remarkable if he wants to kick off a Europe-wide debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senator Ulick Burke spoke about the revision of the leaving certificate. What is being proposed is interesting. The Minister, Deputy Hanafin, who referred to the stress caused to students, opted for the 25% mark on the earlier examination. However, she made it clear that she wants rigorous attention paid to the proper rules for education and examinations. The <Col N="2536"/>Senator referred to the 180 day school year but I do not understand what that has to do with the issue. We might discuss it afterwards. The proposals are a great innovation because there is significant stress involved. At the same time, a final examination is a cause of stress to any student. How they cope with it is part of the growing up experience. I like the idea of an earlier examination and the fact that the Minister will not tinker with the transition year option. Senator Ormonde praised the idea of the revamp. We need to have a full debate on the matter. Obviously there is correspondence between ourselves and the national curriculum board, but we could benefit from a full debate on the matter.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Quinn that we should keep an eye on Sellafield. He spoke about the passion exemplified by President Barroso yesterday and the article in <i>The New York Times</i> which I would like to read. The comment on France and Germany was very interesting.</P>
      <P>Senator Leyden referred to <i>The Star</i> newspaper. The Cathaoirleach said that we should not compliment anyone. However, that will come in time. He also referred to the professional registration Bill, his experience in Palestine and the fact that the CRH should be discouraged from building a wall.</P>
      <P>Senator Bannon said that Sellafield is a catastrophe waiting to happen. When we were in Opposition nine years ago, the Taoiseach called for the closure of Sellafield and he has never flinched from that demand. I know the Senator&rsquo;s party did likewise. There appears to be a common emphasis on this. I do not believe the matter will reach closure until the plant is closed. There will always be leaks and terrible events at the plant. I am pleased the Senator is back in the House.</P>
      <P>Senator Hanafin asked for a debate on stem cell research when we return. Senator Henry referred to the problems regarding non-EU doctors. She asked about the medical practitioners Bill, which has been promised for ten years but has not yet been delivered. Her motion refers to the number of students studying medicine, as recommended in the Hanly report. We like some parts of Hanly but not others.</P>

	<P>Senator Terry said that in four years there have been 50 deaths from drugs in Dublin 15, which is a stark statistic. The national drugs strategy is another matter which should be debated.</P>
      <P>Senator Browne referred to the MRSA superbug and ESB costs. Senator John Paul Phelan asked for a debate with the Minister for Education and Science. It would be interesting to <Col N="2537"/>have this debate early in the autumn. He referred also to Palestine. One of the benefits of fact-finding trips abroad is the collegiality that develops between people of different parties and the Senator exhibited that when he agreed with Senator Leyden&rsquo;s comments. I was in Washington with Senator Mooney recently. A leading article in <i>The Washington Post</i> stated that one of the benefits of such trips was that members of opposing parties had the time to talk to one another and to share ideas.</P>

      <P>I extend good wishes to the Cathaoirleach and wish everybody in the House a pleasant break with their families. It is easy for people to suggest that Members have three months off to have fun but in reality we will be working for approximately two and a half of those months.</P>
      <P>I wish people respite, however, from the constant daily work. Under the aegis of the Cathaoirleach we have undertaken an immense amount of work in the past term. I am proud of the fact that the guillotine was not applied to any Bill, no matter how long or tortuous it was. There was plenty of time if debate on a Bill needed to be carried over to the following day. Every Bill, therefore, benefitted from long deliberation and detailed reflection in this House.</P>
      <P>It was interesting to get feedback from Ministers on that point. They like coming here where debates are civilised and there is an immediacy and an intimacy about the Chamber which lends itself to good debates when the tumult dies down. There have been instances of tumult which are inevitable in any chamber. There is bound to be an adversarial edge to proceedings but it is usually for the good of the business at hand.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I thank the leaders of the various parties who worked co-operatively with all of us. I thank the Ministers and the political parties who all gave generously of their time. I also thank the staff of the Seanad. I have often wandered through here at 10.30 p.m. to see them toiling away at amendments. Enormous respect and appreciation is due to them. I also wish to thank Eamonn McCormack who runs the office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Fine Gael group I wish the Cathaoirleach and his staff who have toiled in the vineyard over the past number of weeks an enjoyable break. As the Leader said, all of the committees are sitting in July and September and a lot of work will take place in that time. I put on record the appreciation of the Fine Gael group for the work of the Cathaoir<Col N="2538"/>leach and the work of the Clerk of the Seanad, the Clerk Assistant of the Seanad and their staff, particularly in the past two weeks when extensive amendments had to be made to Bills. It is to the credit of this House that we were able to discuss amendments that were unable to be discussed in the other House. We have played a significant role in ensuring that those debates took place in a calm and reflective way.</P>
      <P>I also put on record our thanks to the Leader and her staff, particularly Eamonn McCormack, for the way the office is run and for the fact that we are always kept informed of developments.</P>
      <P>Some new developments took place in this session which were very worthwhile. In particular the debate we had with colleagues from the European Parliament was very important from a parliamentary point of view. There needs to be more such debates.</P>
      <P>I wish all sides an enjoyable break. The last time the Government went away for a summer its members reinvented themselves as socialists. I am not sure what is going to happen in Inchydoney this September.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to be associated with the words of thanks to the Cathaoirleach, to the Leas-Chathaoirleach and the Acting Chairmen who have conducted the business of the House. I particularly extend thanks to the Leader and to Eamonn McCormack.</P>
      <P>It is important to recognise that we end this session with 11 Seanad Bills still sitting on the D&aacute;il Order Paper. There has been quite a revolution in the Seanad in the past few years whereby it is now common to introduce Bills here, particularly greenfield legislation. Ministers appreciate that and it has become an established practice. This would not have happened without the extraordinary work of the Clerk of the Seanad, the Clerk Assistant of the Seanad and the staff, who are undermanned and need support. Behind the scenes the Bills Office staff work hard to ensure efficiency.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Brian Hayes&rsquo;s points about opening up to other influences, particularly of a European nature, which has been a developing feature of our work. We need to examine the possibility of some form of question and answer session with Ministers in this House.</P>
      <P>We all appreciate the break from the business of the Chamber but it is important to recognise, <Col N="2539"/>as I hope members of the media will, that, in the words of a former Fine Gael Deputy many years ago, while the talkshop might be closed the workshop continues.</P>
      <P>It would be helpful for the Government or the parties to consider a better way of structuring the year. It is unnecessary to close the Houses of the Oireachtas for several months at a time. It would be better to meet in semesters, with times set aside for committees, rather than have a long break in the summer which is always used as a stick with which to beat us.</P>

      <P>The end of a session is always a tumultuous time and we got through it exceptionally efficiently this time. It is remarkable that we have not had a single guillotine on a serious issue during the course of the session, in stark contrast to the other House. As Senator Brian Hayes rightly said, this week we discussed amendments to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill that were not discussed at all in the other House. That is to the credit to the Leader and all the Members of the House who take their job seriously.</P>
      <P>One event I anticipate in the next few weeks is a statement by the provisional movement on its future intentions. I do not intend to discuss it now but we all hope the statement will be unambiguous and clear and will signal the end of militant republicanism in Ireland, which is no small thing. I ask the Leader if she will consider recalling the House if events justify in the next few weeks.</P>

There has been a gratifying level of co-operation which has helped us do our business in an orderly way. It is gratifying that an increasing number of Bills are initiated in this House, relative to several years ago. That is a tribute to the quality of the debate. The debates are helpful to Ministers in the development of legislation. I thank the Clerk of the Seanad, the Clerk Assistant and everybody in their office. It must have been a monumental task to organise <Col N="2540"/>all the amendments to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill 2005. I am in awe of how they can do it within the timeframe they are given.</P>
      <P>I also thank the Editor of Debates for the way that job is done. As I said on another occasion, we get the reports very quickly whereas it used to take several weeks. I thank Jimmy Walsh and other members of the media for their reporting and I thank the ushers and other staff in the Houses who looked after us during the session.

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the D&aacute;il. In accordance with Standing Order 103, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage. On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the D&aacute;il. This is looked upon as the report of the D&aacute;il amendments to the Seanad. For Senators&rsquo; convenience, I have arranged for the printing and circulation of the amendments. Senators may speak only once on Report Stage. The Minister will deal separately with the subject matter of each group of amendments. I have also circulated the proposed groupings. A Senator may contribute once on each grouping. The only matters, therefore, which may be discussed are the amendments made by the D&aacute;il.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P><Col N="2542"/>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 1, which took on board a similar amendment tabled in the D&aacute;il by Deputies Naughten and Crawford, provides for greater transparency in the Veterinary Council&rsquo;s affairs by requiring that details of gifts received should be shown in its annual report.</P>
      <P>The purpose of amendments Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 9, which concern section 33, is to address an issue raised by the council with my Department regarding removal from the register of persons who fail to pay the requisite registration fee. This procedure had previously been dealt with in section 79, which provides for disciplinary procedures arising from fitness to practise proceedings. Through amendment No. 2, the council is enabled to remove a person for non-payment after a period of three months following the due date. However, the council has been given leeway to decide if there are extenuating circumstances, which would justify retention of a person in a particular case. Consequential amendments arose in sections 79 and 86, with the latter section being deleted.</P>
      <P>The third grouping is amendments Nos. 8 and 22 to 25, inclusive. During the passage of the Bill through the House, there was considerable debate about the powers of entry that would be given to authorised officers of the council. I indicated that, having considered the matter since publication of the legislation, I had considerable sympathy with many of the views expressed and that I was in consultation with the Attorney General on the matter.</P>
      <P>I tabled amendments in the D&aacute;il to address the essential concerns about powers of entry to be granted to authorised officers of the council. Authorised officers when carrying out an investigation on behalf of the council, will have to obtain a search warrant to enter any premises, be it a veterinary premises or otherwise. However, as provided for in the new section 128, authorised officers will be enabled to carry out routine inspections in the context of the grant or renewal of certificates of suitability without the need for a search warrant on the assumption that the application will give his or her consent to enter the premises concerned. The substantive amendment arises in section 127 with consequential amendments arising in sections 75, 125, 126, 128 and 129.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the amendments. During the debate in the House, Senator Quinn, myself and others expressed concern about this issue. The Minister promised she would come back to the House with amendments and she has done so. She referred to the requirement for a court order for an authorised officer to enter &ldquo;any premises&rdquo;. Does that include farms?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the Minister has made these amendments because we were concerned that there should be equity in the right of author<Col N="2543"/>ised officers to undertake investigations. This is a substantial improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>This issue was the subject of much discussion in both Houses. With regard to farms, there must be reasonable suspicion before an application can be made to the court. I have provided for equity in this matter in that a search warrant must be obtained regardless.</P>
      <P>The fourth grouping is amendments Nos. 11, 12 and 14 to 19, inclusive. These relate to the accreditation of veterinary premises, which will be put on a statutory footing for the first time under the legislation. During the passage of the Bill through the House, a number of amendments were made to section 106 to better define instances where the certificate of suitability should not apply. Following further reflection, particularly on the exemptions aspect and on amendments tabled in the D&aacute;il, I tabled a further amendment to address scenarios where, apart from farms, a veterinarian may treat an animal away from his or her registered premises. This also addresses, for example, the case of a pet owned by an elderly person or a horse kept as a companion animal. This amendment covers these situations but also makes clear that the practitioner must nonetheless practise from an accredited veterinary premises.</P>
      <P>I also took on board advice from the Office of the Attorney General that the relevant provisions should be reformulated to make them clear and more coherent. Furthermore, the amendments also make it clear that the requirements for a certificate of suitability become mandatory only after the Veterinary Council has made a regulation specifying the details relating to different classes of veterinary premises and the application procedure for such premises.</P>
      <P>As regards amendment No. 18, during the debate on the Bill in this House concerns were expressed about the requirement that an original of a certificate of suitability must be displayed on the premises. At the close of the debate I undertook to discuss this matter further. Having consulted with the Attorney General I brought forward an amendment to enable the council to issue a certificate extract from the register of certificates of suitability. This extract will fulfil the display requirement.</P>
      <P>In summary, the reformulation of sections 105, 106, 108, 112, 123 and 124, together with the deletion of section 109, makes for a more coherent code governing the premises accreditation regime. I understand that the council is happy with these provisions from the point of view of implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for bringing in these amendments, particularly amendment No. 18, because when we debated this point we envisaged lost and stolen certificates scattered all over the countryside. The Minister&rsquo;s suggestion is admirable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I too thank the Minister for introducing this amendment which improves the Bill. Will she clarify whether an &ldquo;extract&rdquo; of the certificate means a copy of the certificate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an extract from the register, not a photocopy. All veterinary surgeons sign a register and an extract from that will be adequate. We have beaten this point to death, with all due respect to the Senator.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister on the Bill. We put so much work into it here I was afraid it would come back with numerous amendments. I am glad the D&aacute;il recognised how much effort went into it and accepted all our suggestions.</P>
      <P>I also congratulate the Minister on her visit to Russia. I was concerned that the Russians would never again buy beef from us after receiving the atrocious meat that was sent there some years ago. I frequently go to Russia and the Minister is correct that it is a significant market. I am sure her Department will help beef suppliers ensure that prime Irish beef is available in the best supermarkets in Russia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I too thank the Minister and the officials of her Department. This Bill has been a long time coming but as a result of much discussion and effort on all sides in this House it has been dramatically improved.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the Minister back &ldquo;from Russia with love&rdquo;. Does the Minister have good news for the farming community in regard to the overshoot on the beef premium? Has she made any progress on the &euro;90 million and more lost to the farming community?</P>

	<P>I am giving the Senator a good deal of latitude.</P>

	<P>I thank the Chair for that. There is something else I could say to him but I will refrain from saying it.</P>
      <P>I would be interested to hear the Minister&rsquo;s comments on that aspect of her visit to Russia.</P>
      <P>I thank all those involved in preparing the Bill, especially for the amount of discussion conducted with the various representatives of the veterinary <Col N="2545"/>profession such as the Veterinary Council. They have made a wonderful contribution. It shows that when everyone works together the community benefits as the farming and veterinary communities will from this Bill.</P>

      <P>I echo my colleagues&rsquo; comments. The Veterinary Council, Veterinary Ireland, practising veterinarians and their associations, had concerns about this Bill. On its initial Stages we were all concerned as to how well the Minister would listen to us. Not alone did she listen but she acted too, for which we thank her. She and her Department and Ministers of State were very receptive to many good suggestions which came from all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>During our last debate here on the Bill Senator Henry said the Minister should give us some bone. Not alone did she give us the bone but she gave us the carcase, dissected and put together again, remodelled, reshaped and rebuilt. All those who contributed to it have broadly accepted it. Everyone in the House thanks the Minister, as do all members of the profession concerned, and those who deal with them. We congratulate her, the Department officials and the Ministers of State.</P>

	<P>I thank the Seanad and the Members of the Lower House who facilitated the passage of this Bill since it was introduced in October 2004. Some 75% of the amendments introduced arose from discussions within both Houses and have been reflected in the legislation. Whether this Bill will last as long as the previous one which was enacted in 1931, we must wait and see. I hope it will last a considerable period.</P>
      <P>I thank the Veterinary Council which was very helpful and supportive in our discussions, the Irish Veterinary Union and most particularly my officials. I also thank the officials in the Office of the Attorney General who facilitated a significant amount of change and debate, which is reflected in an excellent Bill that covers everyone&rsquo;s concerns.</P>
      <P>It is a practical Bill which I hope augurs well for the future of the Veterinary Council. I thank the Seanad for facilitating the finalisation of this Bill on the day the House rises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Senator Callanan. I thank the Chair for affording me an opportunity to speak on the crisis facing the Irish sugar beet industry, and the need for the Minister and her Government colleagues to ensure the strongest possible case is made to the Commission to secure this fine native industry.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister is here to respond directly to this crucial issue. The sugar beet industry has helped to sustain Irish agriculture, particularly the tillage industry, since the late 1920s or early 1930s. At one time there were four sugar beet factories in Ireland. Now, as a result of the decision by Greencore to shut down the Carlow plant, only one such factory will remain, in Mallow. This afternoon I speak not only of a factory or those who work there or otherwise depend on it; I speak also of the broader industry and the interests of the Irish tillage sector. As the Minister well knows, if the proposals that have been put forward for the reform of the sugar beet sector are enacted, they will shut down the Irish sugar industry and bring the growing of sugar beet and the production of sugar in this country to an end.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I am aware that on 14 July the Minister will have her first set of discussions or negotiations in Brussels on this issue with her fellow European Agriculture Ministers. I demand, plead and confidently expect that she will fight the good fight at that level to have the initial Commission proposals rejected. There is no need for me to remind the Minister that if the proposals, with their substantial price cut and inadequate levels of compensation, are put in place, the Irish sugar industry will die. With it will go not just the livelihoods of the 4,000 or so growers but thousands of associated jobs in transport, factories and distribution. The tillage industry itself, with its whole basis of rotation, will be affected.</P>
      <P>There has been talk of compensation, and the early figures being put forward by Brussels are entirely inadequate. However, even if we have the best compensation package available, I hope the Minister will put at the top of her shopping list during the talks the retention of a viable industry in this country. Compensation is but a short-term solution. We need a long-term plan for the sugar industry and must ensure the Irish agriculture sector continues to benefit from growing sugar beet in the future. I ask the Minister to put <Col N="2547"/>all her efforts and those of her Department into this project. In that sense, will the same level of political input at ministerial and prime ministerial level be required as with the milk quota negotiations of 1983? I ask that she use her resources to save the Irish sugar beet industry and keep sugar beet a part of Irish agriculture.</P>
      <P>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to speak on this issue. I will allow Senator Callanan a moment or two to speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan"><NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Bradford for agreeing to share time. I do not want to add much. Yesterday I asked for a postponement of this debate. I am glad that everyone agreed, since we must have a substantial debate in the fall of this year when the Houses return. I do not think there will have been a decision. We are aware of where the Government and the Minister stand, and we support that stance. In particular, I support what Senator Bradford has said, so there is no point in my expanding on it.</P>
      <P>I am sad as a beet grower &mdash; I acknowledge my personal involvement &mdash; to see the farmers so divided. It is a great pity that the Irish nation is not united behind the effort for which the Senator has called and for which we know the Minister and the Government are working. We are not only talking about reform of the sugar industry. If we take into account Mr. Blair&rsquo;s campaign regarding the Common Agricultural Policy, we realise that we do not know the implications, if any, regarding sugar reform.</P>
      <P>I asked for a postponement yesterday until October, and I hope the Minister will facilitate a debate at that stage. We will have more information, and the Minister will have come through the Council of Ministers. One hopes she will have met the farmers and hammered a little sense into them, as well as Greencore. We will be able to have a more informed and better debate. I ask the Minister to put that in her diary.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Bradford and wish the Minister well, since she is in an impossible position, perhaps the toughest that she will ever be in as Minister. I repeat that and call publicly for beet growers to unite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators for affording me the opportunity to say a few words on this matter. I am encouraged by Senator Callanan&rsquo;s comment that this will be my toughest fight; I have not shirked my responsibilities thus far. I addressed the House on reform of the sugar regime last January. I am glad to have this opportunity to return to the subject in light of the Commission proposals.</P>
      <P>The arrangements for the common organisation of the market for sugar have worked well. Since the regulation specifies, among other things, an intervention price for white sugar and a minimum price for sugar beet, it has provided a good basis for a successful and profitable <Col N="2548"/>enterprise for both growers and manufacturers. Industrial users have a constant supply of raw material, and the consumer has a guaranteed and secure supply of high-quality sugar.</P>
      <P>The Irish sugar quota is 199,000 tonnes, just over 1% of the total EU quota. In almost every year since we joined the EU the sugar quota has been filled, and great credit is due to all concerned. The industry here has made an important contribution not only to the agriculture sector but also to rural development generally. We currently have approximately 3,800 sugar beet growers and one sugar manufacturing enterprise &mdash; Irish Sugar Limited. Approximately 800 people are employed in sugar manufacturing and associated industries.</P>
      <P>As Senators are all aware, major challenges face the EU sugar regime. First, a new EU sugar regime must be negotiated and put in place by the middle of 2006. Of course, 2006 also marks the beginning of a three-year cycle of winding down the import duties for sugar from the 49 least-developed countries under the Everything But Arms agreement. Then there is the new WTO round. That will bring strong pressure on the European Union to allow increased access to our markets for all products, including sugar, to third countries. In addition, demands will be made to reduce the level of export refunds paid on Community products being exported to third countries.</P>
      <P>Against that background the Commission outlined its broad ideas for reform of the regime in a communication to the Council and the European Parliament last July. Those initial reform ideas would have had serious repercussions for sugar beet growing and processing in this country. I made clear in discussions in the Council of Ministers at the time my opposition to the Commission&rsquo;s approach. Since then I have forged alliances with many like-minded member states. With nine other EU member states, I signed a letter to the EU Commissioner for Agriculture stating that the Commission proposals would have a devastating effect on farms and the industrial enterprises working in the sector.</P>
      <P>While we accepted the necessity to reform the existing regime, we made clear that reform should aim at maintaining the existing distribution of sugar beet and sugar production in the entire EU territory. We expressed the view that reform should be based on the following principles: an import system from third countries should be put in place to ensure predictable and regular import quantities; the price reduction should be significantly less and should be implemented more gradually; the impact of the quota reductions should fall mainly on those member states that are net exporters of sugar; and the transfer of quotas among member states should not be allowed.</P>
      <P>The situation worsened with the recent ruling by the WTO appellate body. It found that, although exports of non-quota sugar, known as &ldquo;C&rdquo; sugar, do not receive export refunds, those <Col N="2549"/>exports are cross-subsidised through the high prices paid for &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;B&rdquo; quota sugar. The WTO ruled that exports of &ldquo;C&rdquo; sugar, together with the re-export of ACP sugar, must be counted against the EU WTO limits on subsidised exports. That ruling has significant implications for the export of EU sugar.</P>
      <P>In very round figures, the EU produces 20 million tonnes of sugar annually and imports 1.9 million tonnes under preferential agreements with the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries. EU consumption is approximately 16.5 million tonnes. That means that, on current production, the EU needs to export around 5.5 million tonnes of sugar a year. The recent WTO ruling means in effect that the EU can export up to 1.27 million tonnes a year only.</P>
      <P>In January I advised the House that the Commission&rsquo;s formal legislative proposals were expected in May. Those were published on 22 June 2005. While it was generally accepted that the WTO ruling on subsidised exports would mean that more radical reform proposals would be put forward by the Commission, the proposals are even more severe than anticipated. The main elements are as follows. There would be a reduction of 39% in the price of sugar and 42% in the price of sugar beet. That would bring the price of sugar to &euro;385.5 per tonne and the price of sugar beet to &euro;25.05 per tonne. Compensation for farmers would be set at 60% of the drop in the support price and be paid as part of the single farm payment.</P>
      <P>While no compulsory quota cuts are proposed for four years, and the cross-border transfer of quota has been dropped, a new element in the proposals is the concept of a voluntary restructuring scheme. Under the scheme, funding is proposed for factory closures and the renunciation of quota.</P>
      <P>The scheme is to run for four years and provides a high degressive per tonne aid for factories wishing to cease production. The scheme will be resourced from a central fund to be provided by levies on all sweetener quota, that is, all quota for sugar, isoglucose and inulin.</P>
      <P>The proposals are totally unacceptable in their present form. It is unprecedented for the Commission to make proposals which could lead to the demise of an entire sector in a number of member states including Ireland. The level of price cuts proposed are such as to make sugar beet production uneconomic. The restructuring scheme is inequitable. It is not sufficiently recognised that the closure of a sugar factory would have huge implications for sugar beet growers. Apart from running counter to the expressed views of many member states, the proposals for price reductions have not found favour with the least developed countries.</P>
      <P>I expressed these serious concerns about the proposals when I met Commissioner Fischer Boel on 23 June, the day following their publication, during her visit to Ireland. Negotiations will commence in earnest when the proposals are <Col N="2550"/>presented to the Council of Ministers later this month and will continue over the coming months. My overall objective is to ensure the achievement of a more balanced agreement which will take Irish interests into account. There is no doubt these will be difficult negotiations given the severity of the proposals and the pressures for reform.</P>

	<P>I regret that neither the Minister for Education and Science nor one of the Ministers of State at that Department is in the House. However, I am sure the Minister for Agriculture and Food will give me a satisfactory response.</P>
      <P>I raise the issue of services for children with special educational needs at four schools in west Limerick, namely, Raheenagh, Ashford, Broadford and Templeglantine. I acknowledge the work done in this area by the board of management action group which has highlighted its concerns regarding the impact of the weighted system introduced by the Department on many schools in the County Limerick area. It is totally unjust to base the allocation of special education teachers on the total number of children. That allocation should be based on the needs of individual pupils<b>.</b></P>
      <P>On 28 June, representatives of the boards of management action group, namely, Miriam Magnier Flynn, Denise Airey and Chris Long, met a Fine Gael deputation of which I was a member. They also met Department of Education and Science officials to highlight the impact the new system was having on the schools to which I have referred.</P>
      <P>Some 2% of the normal population in primary schools falls under the second percentile. In comparison to this national average, these four schools in Limerick are particularly disadvantaged in that 13% of their pupils have scored under the second percentile, as diagnosed by qualified psychologists. This is six and a half times the national average and that must surely count as an exceptional circumstance which should be taken into consideration in calculating their allocation. These schools simply request a retention of the current level of special education teachers.</P>
      <P>The deputation that met the Minister&rsquo;s officials presented a comprehensive submission outlining the necessity for the retention of the learning support for these schools. In the case of Raheenagh, Ashford and Broadford, this would mean the allocation of two special education teachers would need to be increased to four, which would <Col N="2551"/>be compatible with the current allocation in these schools. Therefore, no extra staffing is required.</P>
      <P>Templeglantine school has a current allocation of 2.6, or 65 hours, and the allocation of two special education teachers created a deficit of 0.6, or 15 hours. The school requires a retention of 2.6 special education teachers to conform to the allocation it requires. This allocation is essential because embodied in Templeglantine&rsquo;s submission are five frozen applications which require an allocation of 12.5 hours. To continue to deprive children with special educational needs is most unjust. In order to redress this situation, the action group&rsquo;s submission proposed a cluster for Templeglantine and Athea, which need an allocation of 0.4, or ten hours, of special education teaching support.</P>
      <P>This is a fair minded request and I hope the Minister accedes to the validity of these demands. The deputation from the boards of management action group acknowledges the constructive discussion with the Minister&rsquo;s officials. I hope her response will acknowledge the general request for increased special education teaching support for these schools. The action group&rsquo;s submission proves the exceptional disadvantage that exists in these schools due to the high level of children with special educational needs, six and a half times the national average.</P>
      <P>Many parents are fearful of what will happen in September when the primary schools return. It is imperative that this uncertainty and fear is removed by ensuring the fair and justifiably proven special educational needs requirement, as outlined in the action group&rsquo;s submission, is granted. I have consistently highlighted in this House the injustice done to pupils in schools like these as a consequence of the new weighted system. I look forward to a positive response.</P>

	<P>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Seanad&oacute;ir thar ceann an Aire, agus ba mhaith liom &eacute; a chur ar an eolas maidir lena bhfuil ag dul ar aghaidh faoi l&aacute;thair. I wish to outline the new arrangements for providing resource teachers to schools for pupils with high-incidence special needs and learning support needs. I will also reflect on how this applies to the schools in Limerick to which the Senator refers.</P>
      <P>The reason for the new scheme is simple. Children with special needs such as dyslexia or mild learning difficulties are found in almost every school. It makes sense therefore that every school be allocated a number of resource teaching hours based on the number of pupils in the school. This is a major improvement on the previous system under which children with high-incidence special educational needs required a psychological assessment before they were allocated resource teaching hours by the Department of Education and Science. This was a time-consuming process that often led to delays in children getting the support they needed.</P><Col N="2552"/>
      <P>Resource teachers will now be in place in schools from the start of the school year so that children who need their assistance can get it straight away. Under the new arrangement, disadvantaged schools, boys&rsquo; schools and mixed schools will get extra resources, as research shows that pupils in these schools are more likely to have learning difficulties. To ensure every school has enough resource teaching hours to meet the needs of its pupils, an additional 660 resource teaching posts, including 340 permanent and 320 temporary, are being put in place for next September.</P>
      <P>This will ensure that children who had been given an individual allocation of resource teaching hours by the Department will keep them in situations where the general allocation to the school would not be sufficient to allow it to provide these hours from within its general allocation. The provision of these posts will ensure no child who has been allocated a specific number of hours with a resource teacher by the Department will lose these under the new arrangements. The reality is that the majority of schools are gaining resource teaching hours under the new scheme.</P>
      <P>A desire to address the concerns of small and rural schools was the reason the Minister for Education and Science initiated a review of the original general allocation model which had been announced last year to come into effect in the 2005-06 school year. Following this review, a special improved ratio for small schools has been introduced to ensure they are given resource teaching hours on a more favourable basis.</P>
      <P>It has been claimed by some that the new scheme prevents schools from providing one-to-one time with a resource teacher to children who need such support. This is simply not the case. While resources are not being provided on the basis of specific assessments of individual children&rsquo;s needs, it is up to the school to decide whether resource teachers work with children on a one-to-one basis or in groups.</P>
      <P>The new scheme ensures that all schools, including the schools in Limerick to which the Senator refers, have enough resources to ensure each child gets a level of support appropriate to his or her individual needs. The school can then use its professional judgment to decide how these hours are divided between different children in the school to ensure all their needs are met.</P>
      <P>Research shows that some children with special needs respond better with one-to-one tuition. Others, however, do better when taught in small groups. It is often best for resource teachers to work with children in the classroom rather than taking them away to a separate room as the children then have to catch up on work done by the rest of the class in their absence. The point is that the type of response needed depends on the child. While the new scheme will not prevent schools from giving one-to-one time with the resource teacher to children who need it, it is important to <Col N="2553"/>note that one-to-one teaching is not the best option for every child.</P>
      <P>The extra resources being provided to support the introduction of this new scheme are a further demonstration of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to improving services for children with special needs. In addition to the major increase in resource teachers in recent years, the introduction of this new general allocation scheme will ensure a faster and more flexible response for children with special needs.</P>
      <P>As of next September, there will be more than 5,000 teachers in our primary schools working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares to fewer than 1,500 in 1998. It is now the case that one of every five primary school teachers is working specifically with children with special needs.</P>
      <P>In regard to the four specific schools to which the Senator refers, I confirm that officials in the Department of Education and Science have received further information relating to the matter referred to by the Senator. Accordingly, once the examination of the correspondence submitted has been completed, officials in the Department will make direct contact with the schools to inform them of the outcome. On behalf of Senator Finucane, I will advise the Minister of the need to expedite this decision.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire. My Adjournment matter is simple. The recent announcement to allocate &euro;45 million to child care sounds like a lot of money but, by the time it is divided up around the country, it will be disbursed before long. Only two child care facilities received allocations in Carlow-Kilkenny, in Kells, County Kilkenny and in Loughlinbridge. I congratulate Loughlinbridge on receiving its allocation of more than &euro;700,000. This was a reflection of the hard work done there over the past two years. A lot of work remains to be done. It will be gratifying to see such a child care facility in Loughlinbridge.</P>
      <P>However, as in other areas of life, there are winners and losers. Shanagarry Community Childcare Limited was unfortunate in not receiving funding in this year&rsquo;s allocation. The Minister might clarify the reason for this lack of success. It will, I hope, reapply next year, in which case it will learn from its experience to ensure it receives funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to thank the Senator for raising this matter and for affording me the opportunity to update the House on the important issue of child care. I will refer specifi<Col N="2554"/>cally to Shanagarry Community Childcare Limited.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform told me that an application for capital grant assistance from Shanagarry Community Childcare Limited was submitted some time ago. As the Senator may be aware, each application for funding undergoes a thorough assessment by Area Development Management Limited, ADM, which is engaged to carry out the day-to-day administration of the EOCP. Once ADM makes an assessment, applications are then considered by the EOCP programme appraisal committee, chaired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Following the appraisal committee&rsquo;s recommendation, the Minister makes a final decision regarding funding.</P>
      <P>The Shanagarry application was assessed by ADM and subsequently considered by the programme appraisal committee in December 2004. At that time, the programme appraisal committee was unable to recommend that the project be funded. Issues were raised around possible duplication of services and the displacement of other local services, as the proposed project location is within three miles of another child care facility which has already received funding under the EOCP. Consequently, the Minister was not in a position to provide funding on that occasion.</P>
      <P>The group was informed of his decision by the child care directorate in December 2004. In February, this decision was appealed by the Shanagarry group. Following receipt of an appeal, ADM was requested to reassess the application by taking account of any additional information provided by the group in support of its application. With the completion of this assessment, the application is being considered further by the programme appraisal committee. I understand that the reappraisal of the Shanagarry project is in its final stages, following which a recommendation will be made to the Minister, who will then be in a position to make a decision on the matter. The group will be informed of the outcome in due course.</P>
      <P>Every effort is being made to achieve a fair geographical spread throughout the appraisal and approvals process. Sustainability of services and avoidance of duplication are key considerations. To date, County Carlow has benefitted from &euro;6.3 million under the child care programme and has had 24 capital grants approved to establish either new or enhanced community based not for profit or private child care facilities. The county has also benefited from 29 staffing grants to groups with a focus on disadvantage. This funding to child care providers in County Carlow is leading to the creation of 545 new centre based child care places and to the support of 493 existing places. Carlow County Childcare Committee also receives annual funding to support its developmental work, including special measures to support child minders, whose services are often the chosen child care option for Irish parents.</P><Col N="2555"/>
      <P>The Senator may be aware that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform recently launched a new report and a new initiative to encourage the increased provision of school age child care in order to support the needs of parents of primary school children. It is fair to emphasise that the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2001-06 has been central to the development of child care in Ireland over the past five years. I hope that Senator Browne will acknowledge the progress made to date under the programme in County Carlow and across the country. I will advise the Minister of the necessity of informing the Senator of the outcome of the deliberations on the appeal.</P>
