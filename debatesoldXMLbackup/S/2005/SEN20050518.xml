	<P>I have received notice from Senator Brian Hayes that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to grant a special needs assistant immediately to a student (details supplied), and if she will make a statement on the matter.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Tuffy of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to report on the urgent need for refurbishment works to be carried out at St. Brigid&rsquo;s national school in Palmerstown, Dublin 20.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Mooney of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to consider implementing the recommendations made recently by Leitrim, Sligo and Donegal child care committee.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Ulick Burke of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">To ask the Minister for Health and Children if she is aware that no additional funding was provided to the western region of the Health Service Executive for children under 12 years of age with special needs from the current funding allocation announced recently as all resources have been allocated for adult support.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Morrissey of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to provide a list of all primary and secondary schools which lack the necessary facilities to provide the level of physical activity recommended in the national task force report on obesity, such as the schools in Castleknock, Dublin 15, as specific examples of the lack of adequate facilities, and to provide an estimate <Col N="902"/>of the level of investment needed to ensure each school has adequate facilities for physical education classes.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and I have selected the matters raised by Senators Brian Hayes, Tuffy and Mooney and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, statements on the EU constitution, to be taken at 11.30 a.m. until 5.00 p.m., with the contribution of each speaker not to exceed six minutes and the Minister of State to be called upon to reply not later than 4.30 p.m., the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will begin the debate and the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, will conclude it; and No. 20, motion 12, re national competitiveness, to be taken from 5.00 p.m. until 7.00 p.m. There will be a sos from 1.00 p.m. until 2.30 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Last November, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stated boldly that actions taken by him in giving additional support to the Garda in Dublin had resulted in the breaking up of major criminal gangs in the city. He also claimed that he was confident that IRA criminality was a thing of the past. On both of those counts, the statements now ring hollow given his announcement yesterday that welcome additional resources are to be given to the Garda in Dublin.</P>
      <P>This is a bigger problem than just Dublin city and county. There have been ten murders in as many weeks throughout the country, as well as a proliferation of the gun culture within the criminal world. This must be tackled head on by the Government and the Garda. Fine Gael will allow a new Bill to pass swiftly through this House that criminalises gang membership and hostage taking. Will the Leader consider putting such a suggestion to the Minister? This is a Fine Gael initiative that we put to the Government yesterday and I ask her to put it to the Minister today.</P>
      <P>Senators Ross and Quinn have raised the issue of Sellafield this week. A suggestion was made in this House more than 12 months ago that the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, should have automatic status at the Sellafield plant in order to ensure independence in terms of monitoring and reporting to the Irish public. Will the Government put this suggestion again to the British Government? It is wrong that incidents and accidents at Sellafield should be reported by the management of the plant and the British nuclear industry to the Irish people. In all such cases, we should have an independent assessment by our own State body, the RPII. That <Col N="903"/>body should be represented at Sellafield on a permanent 24-hour basis to report to the Irish people in the same way that the International Atomic Energy Agency is based constantly at Sellafield. The British Government must move swiftly to allay Irish concerns on Sellafield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I raised the national report on obesity and related matters yesterday in regard to primary school children. Employees in my office telephoned 20 random primary schools yesterday and could not find one with a vending machine. This raises questions as to where the report&rsquo;s authors undertook their research. I pointed to the difficulties of many primary schools in terms of the provision of games and physical education and observed that many schools have no GP rooms and are forced to install prefabs in the school yard. In this context, I put forward the proposal that we should examine the possibility of appointing games co-ordinators and specialised PE teachers.</P>
      <P>There was one issue I neglected to mention but which we should also consider. Cookery is a subject that is no longer allocated any time on the primary school curriculum. The availability of specialist cookery teachers would mean primary children could learn how to cook properly. The pressures teachers are under to implement the curriculum mean there is not time for such instruction. The issue of specialisation in the areas of physical education and cookery should be considered.</P>
      <P>I understand the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, will make a public statement today on the new consumer strategy group proposals. This will apparently lead to the establishment of a new super-agency for consumer strategy. We must remind ourselves that a significant part of the problem in this area is that resources have never been made available to the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs to allow it to undertake its functions properly. The notion that some new all-encompassing body can now take over and perform more effectively will only prove true if the necessary resources are made available. The reality is those resources have never been provided before.</P>
      <P>I am confused on one particular point. What are the positions of the various political parties on the groceries order? Representatives from the same party often present different points of view on this issue. I understand the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business has unanimously supported the lifting of the order. Nevertheless, it seems the various political parties have different views on this and that the Government is fudging the issue. It is focusing on the consumer strategy group to secure headlines for something which may well never get the resources to undertake its functions effectively and which, at any rate, cannot come into existence until after legislation is passed through the Houses, which could take four years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>We all welcome the release of Dr. Mudawi Ibrahim Adam by the Sudanese authorities. There is no doubt the role of the Government and other parties contributed to his safety in custody and his speedy release. His wife and daughter were presented with an award last Friday by the President.</P>
      <P>All Members would welcome another debate on aviation policy, which seems to change by the week. It now seems we may have three terminals at Dublin Airport instead of two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>There will be one terminal for everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure whether the third one is a fictitious item to cover the nakedness of the Progressive Democrats. Nevertheless, a debate is necessary on this issue. In view of the Government&rsquo;s extraordinary apparent decision to sell a majority of the State&rsquo;s shareholding in Aer Lingus, one must wonder whether any consideration has been given to the national interest in this matter.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader agree to a debate on human rights with particular emphasis on that bastion of United States support in the Far East, Uzbekistan, where the authorities have been slaughtering their own people? If similar events took place in Cuba, an EU delegation and meetings of Foreign Ministers and the UN Security Council would ensue. These responses would be proper. Apparently Uzbekistan is to receive milder reproof.</P>
      <P>It is now reported that decisions about capital allocations for hospital building this year will be made by the T&aacute;naiste rather than the Health Service Executive. I would like a debate on this matter. At issue is not where the money goes but the withholding from the Health Service Executive, three months after it is set up, the ability to make major decisions based on professional assessments. The Health Service Executive is to inform the Minister for Health and Children of hospitals which need money but is not permitted to prioritise them because this might be made public under the Freedom of Information Act, resulting in embarrassment for the T&aacute;naiste when, presumably, Tallaght hospital receives a large sum of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>That is rubbish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the clearest indication that the Progressive Democrats are returning to its party of origin and want to govern by spending money on hospitals according to political priorities rather than medical needs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to inform this House that I am preparing a Private Members&rsquo; Bill, the Regis<Col N="905"/>tration of Wills Bill 2005. With the approval of the Leader and my colleagues in the Fianna F&aacute;il group, I hope to present it to the House. I have discussed this matter with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The Bill is &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have ruled that it has nothing to do with today&rsquo;s Order of Business. Does Senator Leyden have a point to make?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The point I wish to make is that this is a legislative Chamber, of which I am a Member.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter has nothing to do with today&rsquo;s Order of Business. There is a procedure involved in introducing legislation to this House. We will not discuss this further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with the remarks of Senator Brian Hayes. While I welcome the allocation of &euro;6.5 million announced by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I understand this sum will be spent in the Dublin area with the intention of controlling gangs and ending gangland killings, which has been a frequent occurrence recently. This type of lawlessness is not confined to Dublin. I raise the recent case in Limerick where a grenade was lobbed into a house. Limerick has problems with gangs and the availability of guns. Recently, a gangland killing took place in Sligo. I would like the Minister to make finance available not only to Dublin but to other parts of the country, such as Limerick and Sligo.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="906"/>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>The most notorious gangster in Limerick has been put away.</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>Senator Finucane without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>As Senator Dardis does not live in Limerick, he is not aware of the situation there. I will provide copies of the <i>Limerick Leader</i> for his perusal. I would like him to be briefed.</P>
      <P>I welcome the proposal for statements on aviation policy. For the past months, the media has discussed nothing but aviation policy. The Taoiseach recently received an award for person of the year but ditherer of the year might be a more appropriate title. I am disappointed that Senator Morrissey is not here because he is the Progressive Democrats&rsquo; aviation expert.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I met him in Dublin Airport last Friday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is improper to make reference to people who are not here.</P>

	<P>Come fly with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>We look forward to an announcement on aviation policy this evening, which will come to be called operation fudge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on ageism. This is Say No To Ageism Week and a report was published yesterday by the National Council on Ageing and Older People entitled Perceptions of Ageism in Health and Social Services. The study of more than 600 elderly people and health service staff found that the health service is guilty of discrimination against older people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is seeking a debate on ageism and she can raise those points when it is granted. We cannot have speeches on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an important issue. The report found direct discrimination in the upper age limit for breast cancer screening, that is, 65 years of age. Free screening is only available to women between 50 and 65 years of age in certain parts of the State and BreastCheck has stated there is mounting evidence that screening should be provided to women over 64 years of age. It is an important social issue and women over 64 years of age are not being treated equally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I again ask for a debate on Iraq. New material emerges all the time. As I pre<Col N="907"/>dicted, the Senate committee in America came up against the shattering force of the truth as told in a blistering fashion by George Galloway and it produced the usual weary old tired, forged documents. It could not even get the date sequence right. It was an astonishing performance but it clearly vindicated Mr. Galloway and exposed the Senate committee. It would be no harm if we continued to have a rolling debate on this issue.</P>
      <P>It is astonishing that there have been approximately eight or nine killings in the past month. One would be safer in Chicago these days. This is part of the inheritance of what is cosily called the &ldquo;republican community&rdquo;. This is a taint that was brought in &mdash; the guns, explosives and the drugs. We know exactly where to look to find from were this kind material came.</P>
      <P>In a way, my next point leads on from that. Many people have come to the House to talk to us, including distinguished people of various kinds. We have listened to their pious aspirations for this, that and the other, including the European Union and whatnot. Would it not be a good idea to invite the McCartney sisters to give evidence to Seanad &Eacute;ireann on the murder of their brother and the way in which they were intimidated by the Provisional IRA and Sinn F&eacute;in?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask that it be referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no procedure for such a&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I think I have found one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think the Senator has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, was going to protest about ageism but I forget what it was I wanted to say. We will have a debate later, or at least an exchange, on Europe. The Taoiseach was in Warsaw at a meeting of the Council of Europe. Perhaps the Leader could arrange for a report on that meeting so that we could have a discussion on the Council of Europe, particularly the European Court of Human Rights which appears to have a backlog of 80,000 cases. Whether its methods are right or whether sufficient resources are being devoted to it is of great importance to the ordinary citizen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>We have debated the illegal Irish community in the United States on a few occasions. I am sure colleagues are aware important legislation was published in the US last Thursday or Friday in the names of Senators John McCain and Ted Kennedy. This legislation will help to provide legal status and work permits for the illegal Irish community in the United States. The Bill, as published, must go through US Con<Col N="908"/>gress and Senate and it is important the Irish Government and body politic is seen to fully support the efforts of Senators McCain and Kennedy. I hope this House will have an early opportunity to discuss the issue of illegal Irish emigrants in the United States so Members can offer their support to them by trying to get the legislation through the US Congress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>A state exists where innocent people are living in fear and anxiety, where one is guilty until proven innocent, and where banks and other financial institutions can wash their hands of situations into which they enticed people over the years. If I was to assert that the state in question was Ireland, would Members sit up and take notice? Are Members aware that all over the country, men and women, widows and widowers and elderly people live in fear of next Monday, 23 May, when they must prove their innocence to the Revenue Commissioners?</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance must come to this House and defend the appalling policy that is currently being implemented whereby people are obliged to go back 20 years to prove that policies taken out for terms of ten years at £10 per week were not set up with hot money. People whose husbands or wives have died &mdash; this is an important point &mdash; should have a chance to state that they cannot prove this point as the relevant bank records and Revenue records are no longer available. This is what is happening and it is absolutely ridiculous. Other Members may think it is good enough, but I do not. Hot money does exist and Members do not agree with stashing money in offshore accounts and the like. However, ordinary innocent people should not be the ones who must prove their innocence. This is not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I also ask for a debate on health and health administration, specifically concerning the legislation passed to establish the Health Service Executive. No business plan from the Health Service Executive is yet available. Members should be informed as to when it is likely to be available and this House should have a debate on it to follow up the passing of the legislation.</P>
      <P>This issue is particularly relevant in light of the news today that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children intends to keep to herself the decision on where capital funding will be spent on hospitals in the coming year. This appears to go against the principle underpinning the establishment of the Health Service Executive as set out by the Minister herself. It also runs counter to the correspondence now coming from the Department of Health and Children which states that particular matters pertaining to health should be referred to the Health Service Executive. In other words, if an issue does not suit the Minister, it is the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s <Col N="909"/>problem, but if it is a matter with which she wishes to engage, she will do so. This was not the legislation&rsquo;s intention and is a serious development. I ask that the matter be debated in this House as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Cox regarding the letters being sent to elderly people, who may be tax-compliant, regarding money they may have invested in life assurance policies. It has raised fears in old people that they are now suspected of money laundering. We should have a debate in this House to put people&rsquo;s minds at ease, particularly elderly people who find themselves obliged to account for money they have saved over the years. Such people may be vulnerable simply by virtue of the fact that they must explain themselves. The issue has raised many fears in people and I agree with Senator Cox.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator White&rsquo;s call for an urgent debate on elderly people and the attitude that has arisen within the health and social services regarding them. It is unfortunate that elderly people are denied access to proper treatment, are sent home from hospitals before full recovery and are classified as &ldquo;bed blockers&rdquo; and other such terms. If it is true that the needs of people over the age of 82 are being disregarded in the health service, there will be serious consequences. Our society is ageing but the old health boards have adopted a policy of disregarding the needs of older people. The policy of ensuring that older people can live independently in their own homes is given little or no support. As a result, older people must live in long-stay institutions, which is demoralising for many of them. The Leader should ask either the Minister for Social and Family Affairs or the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House to debate this very important issue. We will all be among the ranks of older people in a short space of time.</P>

	<P>The health service appears to be on people&rsquo;s minds again. When the Mental Health Act 2001 was brought through the Houses of the Oireachtas, it was stated that it was urgently needed to replace the 1945 Act. However, we are still operating under the 1945 Act despite the establishment of the Mental Health Commission because of an impasse between psychiatrists and the Minister for Health and Children over the working of the mental health tribunals.</P>
      <P>Psychiatrists maintain that the funding is insufficient to put the tribunals in place. These tribunals have yet to be set up, a situation that is causing great distress to patients and their families. Could the Leader ask the Minister to urgently address this issue? I hope all Senators will support my call because a considerable amount of time and effort was put into the Act by Senators for a small amount of funding. Only 7% of the health budget is spent on mental health services, which includes the upkeep of buildings. We could probably set up these tribunals for a small amount of money. However, their establishment would mean a great deal to very large number of very ill people.</P>

	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred to the fact that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, will launch the consumer strategy report today. I am sure this report will resemble the proverbial curate&rsquo;s egg. The Senator may have inadvertently misled the House because, as I heard him, he said that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business had unanimously recommended the lifting of the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order 1987. I would like to put on the record that the committee unanimously recommended that the order should be retained.</P>

	<P>I would like to ask the Leader on the Order of Business to arrange a debate on this issue because I am sure the Minister and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment would welcome a debate on the consumer strategy report.</P>
      <P>There were many calls for a debate on aviation issues. An article in today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> states that the Dublin Airport Authority at a board meeting last week again spelled out its belief that it is not tenable for it to retain ownership of the Great Southern Hotels Group. The authority outlined different proposals&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have. Will the Leader arrange a debate on this issue? We have had so many calls for debates about terminals and so on but I and, I am sure, the Leader do not want to see the hotels group forgotten about. This is an important matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise with the Leader the alarming rate at which Irish fuel prices have increased in recent months. For the first time ever, the lower taxed diesel is now more expensive than unleaded petrol, with an increase of 5 cent in March alone. Of every euro spent on diesel, 66% goes to the State&rsquo;s coffers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader ask the relevant Minister to come into the House and debate the possibility of reducing this tax and giving a tax break? Irish motorists are being taken advantage of, not only by the insurance industry but by the State due to the State&rsquo;s accrual of so much of the motorists&rsquo; money. Will the Leader arrange a debate on this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Brian Hayes in his call for a debate on the Sellafield nuclear facility. There is much public disquiet in Ireland <Col N="912"/>concerning the manner in which the facility has reported incidents and accidents in recent times and the weak response by the Government to such incidents. In the interests of our people&rsquo;s safety, the time has come for all political parties in the State to take this issue to the European Court of Justice because it has serious implications for the entire Irish community. We want this facility closed once and for all in the interests of the safety of our people. A catastrophe is waiting to happen if we sit on the sidelines.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader invite the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, to the House and arrange a debate on a grant aid package for farmers who want to invest in waste storage facilities to comply with the new EU nitrates directives? As we know, farmers with fewer than 20 units cannot qualify for this grant aid at present. The Minister&rsquo;s own county has many such farmers. We must have a debate on this urgent issue.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome and endorse most of what Senator Cox had to say. Having a debate on the issue she raised would be useful although she is not completely right that everyone who held those insurance policies is getting a letter from the Revenue Commissioners. Two institutions are involved. One is the Revenue which sends out letters to old and infirm people who do not understand them and find them extremely intimidating and very threatening. We could quickly do something about this. Letters threatening prosecution are being sent to people who do not know what they are meant to have done wrong in terms of not paying tax. This is unfair.</P>
      <P>Senator Cox raised an almost identical issue, that of the apportionment of guilt where financial institutions are involved. What will occur on Monday, 23 May, is now on everyone&rsquo;s mind for it is on the radio every morning. Innocent people were seduced into taking out policies&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;or doing something unawares and have been penalised in the most extraordinarily unfair way when those who seduced them are not being prosecuted. This is a problem which <Col N="913"/>we could usefully address in a debate in the House. We could have a Minister here to tell us why the Government has not taken action against these institutions while poor people who have done wrong have had to pay fines of five or six times the original sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with Senators in calling for a debate on the financial institutions. I do not believe that we as politicians and legislators sufficiently highlighted the unfair deal agreed with them in regard to the offshore accounts. As Senator Ross rightly pointed out, we are all aware that many innocent people from abroad were seduced by them. I hope that we as legislators will try to redress the imbalance that exists. Many elderly people took what they believed to be good and impartial advice for which they are now paying the price. We must ensure that these innocent people will be protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Brian Hayes praised, <i>inter alia,</i> the initiative by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for providing &euro;6.5 million to deal with the Dublin criminal gangs. He said there was already an initiative to do so last autumn. Clearly there is a proliferation of crime and I admire the fact that this money is being made available. The main point of the Senator&rsquo;s contribution was that if a new Bill to criminalise gang culture was brought to this House he would facilitate it, for which I thank him.</P>
      <P>The Senator also referred to Sellafield and the fact that the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland should have automatic status at the plant. He called on the British Government to allow for this. Senator Brady sent me a note stating that last week, the institute addressed the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government on access to Sellafield and submitted a report on the matter. I will ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to come to the House to debate the matter.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole said that a random check was carried out on 20 primary schools and that no vending machines were found. I understand the machines are mainly in secondary schools. He referred to games co-ordinators and the idea of cookery teachers who could give talks on proper nutrition.</P>
      <P>The Senator also referred to the consumer strategy agency which will be announced by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin. He said there was a restriction on funding for the existing Director of Consumer Affairs, Ms Carmel Foley. She is an excellent person who does great work within very limited financial parameters. I took note when the Senator spoke about the groceries order and Senator Coghlan&rsquo;s correction of his inadvertent remark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologised.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="914"/>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that. We received a good publication from RGDATA this morning on the groceries order.</P>
      <P>I compliment Senator Ryan for raising the issue of Dr. Mudawi Ibrahim Adam, who has been released and received his award, something with which we all agree. The Senator asked about aviation policy and the proposed three terminals at Dublin Airport.</P>
      <P>The Senator referred to human rights in Uzbekistan. Given what we have been hearing, it appears that the country&rsquo;s understanding of human rights is extremely limited.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan also referred to the capital allocation to hospitals which will be made by the T&aacute;naiste. Senator Mansergh disputed this and said that if Ministers do not take responsibility they will be in the dock. When they take responsibility, based on valued advice, there is a hue and cry about it. Given what we know of the T&aacute;naiste, she is well able to make up her mind on matters.</P>
      <P>Senator Leyden referred to his Private Members&rsquo; Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator White has left the Chamber to join her sister and her school group. She asked for a debate on ageism and referred to a report on the perception of age in regard to health and social policy. She also called for free breast screening to be extended to women over the age of 64.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris called for a debate on Iraq. We have requested this from the Department of Foreign Affairs every week but we will try to have it next week. I love George Galloway&rsquo;s voice, <Col N="915"/>regardless of his activities. The US Senators look rather foolish in this matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris also mentioned the number of killings in Dublin which he says are the legacy of the republican community. His request for a Seanad hearing with the sisters of Robert McCartney will be submitted to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
      <P>Senator Maurice Hayes echoed the call for a debate on ageism. He would also like to hear a report of the deliberations at the Council of Europe. That would be useful and we might invite the Taoiseach to speak on those. He called particularly for a debate on the European Court of Human Rights which is an essential part of the Council of Europe.</P>
      <P>Senator Bradford asked that we do everything in our power to facilitate the passage of the valuable legislation, proposed by Senators McCain and Kennedy, to help the illegal Irish community in the United States.</P>
      <P>If Senator Cox said no more than she has already said today she will have made a mark. I agree that elderly people with life assurance policies are being cruelly treated. The most vulnerable people have the greatest fear, yet need have no fear.</P>
      <P>I receive many calls from women saying their husbands put ten shillings or £1 a week into the policies yet they are receiving these letters. I understood only those who had invested a lump sum in a policy would receive these letters. That is not so, and it appears the people to whom these letters are sent are picked at random. Well done to Senator Cox for raising the matter. I will pass on that point to the Department of Finance, or directly to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Meara spoke about the administration of the health services and the fact that we have had no debate on the business plan for the Health Service Executive and its capital funding. Senator Ormonde agrees with Senator Cox&rsquo;s remarks about the letters sent to elderly people about their life assurance policies.</P>
      <P>Senator Ulick Burke supports Senator White&rsquo;s remarks on discrimination against elderly people and called for the introduction of measures to enable them to stay in their own homes.</P>
      <P>Senator Mansergh talked about accountable democracy, a topic on which I fully agree with him. He said that certain Senators mention particular hospitals in their areas and seek funding for them. Advocacy will always be a proper part of our business. I did not catch everything Senator Mansergh said, which I regret.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Henry said we continue to operate under the Mental Health Act 1945 because the 2001 legislation which received great attention in this House is held up over a dispute <Col N="916"/>about funding between psychiatrists and the Minister for Health and Children. The Senator asked that the Minister address that matter.</P>

	<P>Indeed I am.</P>

	<P>The Dublin Airport Authority said it does not want to keep the Great Southern group of hotels. It should be told to keep and run them.</P>
      <P>Senator McCarthy said 66% of our diesel price is tax. Once again, I am indebted to Senator Mansergh for telling me that petrol prices here are approximately 20% lower than those in Northern Ireland. That is a small mercy. The licensed haulage industry is very exercised about the issue.</P>
      <P>Senator Bannon raised the issue of the Sellafield nuclear facility and asked for a robust reply on the matter of safety. He asked that the Minister for Agriculture and Food come before the House for a debate on a grant aid package for farmers who want to invest in waste storage facilities.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross supports the views expressed by Senator Cox with which I think the whole House would agree. His point is that the financial institutions have not been properly pursued by the Government, that it was they who gave the advice and now they appear to be wriggling free. They did the seducing and are getting away with it.</P>

	<P>On the Order of Business, we agreed the time slot for each speaker would be approximately six minutes. The Cathaoirleach allowed for the leader of each group to take one minute to welcome the MEPs, most of whom have arrived and others will arrive later. We are very gratified by the response and the agreement of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to allow the MEPs contribute to a discussion on the <Col N="917"/>forthcoming EU constitution which will be of significance to this country.</P>
      <P>As befits this Chamber varying opinions will be expressed during the discussion. Indeed this House has heard many and varied opinions on numerous matters, as is proper. Last year the House had visits from individual MEPs who informed us of their work in Europe and details of the committees on which they serve. That was most interesting, particularly as it is agreed a knowledge gap exists about what happens in Europe. This is probably also the case in other member states.</P>
      <P>This is a fine Chamber which will be properly used. A precedent was set to allow for such an occasion to take place. I offer a personal welcome as Leader of the House to our MEPs present.</P>

	<P>On behalf of the Fine Gael group I thank all our colleagues from the European Parliament who are attending this debate. They have not all arrived yet but will be joining in throughout the day. I am delighted to welcome the Fine Gael MEP, Deputy Simon Coveney. Our four other colleagues will be here later.</P>
      <P>This is a momentous day for the House, connecting the European parliamentarians representing this country in Brussels and Strasbourg with the plenary session of the House. This was one of the key recommendations in the document on proposals for reform of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo what my two colleagues have said. This occasion is a form of joined-up democracy in which those elected to different fora and at different levels engage with each other, which is very important.</P>
      <P>I welcome our two colleagues from the European Parliament to the Independent benches. Deputy Marian Harkin, a well-known community voice and a voice for the west is a Deputy and an MEP. She is a member of the Regional Development Committee of the European Parliament and is an independent voice. I am very happy to welcome her on that basis as an Independent MEP.</P>
      <P>Mary Lou McDonald, MEP, is definitely not an Independent. She is here to make history, being the first elected Sinn F&eacute;in representative to address Seanad &Eacute;ireann. We look forward to hearing her contribution. She gives me to understand her voice is less likely to be in agreement with some others in the House but that is to be welcomed. Mary Lou McDonald is a member of the Employment and Social Affairs Committee of the European Parliament.</P>

I am perhaps unique among the group leaders in that I am the only one who had some European ambitions at the last European election. I am glad the voters of Munster decided I <Col N="918"/>was better off in this House and obviously since I could not go to Europe, I had to do my best to bring Europe here.</P>
      <P>The Members of the European Parliament are very welcome. This is a very important, symbolic occasion in terms of creating a level of democratic accountability within our own Parliament for what happens in the European institutions as there is a significant gap in terms of knowledge and debate.</P>
      <P>I welcome all our colleagues, in particular, Proinsias De Rossa from my own party, a distinguished Member of the European Parliament who has given considerable service and has considerable knowledge. He has been an enlightening figure for many of us in the Labour Party about the positive aspects of the European project by giving a deeper understanding of what Europe needs to learn. I am looking forward to the debate which I believe will be lively and a good launch to what I hope will be a serious national discussion about the European constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I join in the general welcome to the MEPs and concur that this is a special day in this House. I welcome in particular, Eoin Ryan, MEP, who is present and Brian Crowley, MEP, who is on his way from the airport. As a member of the Joint Committee on European Affairs it was a matter of considerable pride for me to attend yesterday in Luxembourg the 33rd plenary session of COSAC, the umbrella group for those committees and inform it of this event. There was considerable surprise and admiration for the fact that a debate of this nature had been arranged. I hope it will be one of a number of ongoing debates. I thank the Cathaoirleach and the Leader for their role in arranging this debate.</P>
      <P>This event helps to bring the European Parliament closer to the citizens of the Union by affording a platform within the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, who is present, was also very active in this regard when he was a Minister of State with responsibility for these matters. He held an important conference in Wicklow about aspects of this work. This is a good day and we look forward to what our guests have to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>As Cathaoirleach, I would like to be associated with the words of welcome for our guests. This is an important day for Seanad &Eacute;ireann. Four of our MEPs served in this House and I had the honour of serving with them. They are welcome back today. I am sure they benefited from the debates in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I too congratulate and compliment the Seanad on what is a novel arrangement, which is unique in Europe. It represents a great use of this Chamber and, as <Col N="919"/>Senator O&rsquo;Toole has said, is an excellent way of interlinking the various democratic strands.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to take this opportunity to involve myself in the discussions today. I am happy to recognise on behalf of the Government the importance of the contribution of the European Parliament to the European constitutional treaty and to the convention that formed it. In particular I compliment the work of the Irish MEPs in that regard. The European Parliament played a major role in the negotiation of the European constitutional treaty through the participation of its Members in the Convention on the Future of Europe and through its continuing involvement in the subsequent Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
      <P>One of the features of the European constitution is the way it will strengthen the European Parliament&rsquo;s legislative and budgetary functions making it in most areas a co-equal legislator with the Council of Ministers. Moreover, the resolution on the constitution, which was adopted by the Parliament earlier this year and recently published in all our national newspapers, is a lucid and forceful statement of the case for the constitutional treaty. It was resoundingly endorsed by the majority of MEPs from across the political spectrum and from all sections and parts of Europe. This was an authoritative and credible statement from a wide and diverse range of democratically elected public representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, would it be possible for us to get a copy of the Minister&rsquo;s script?</P>

	<P>In other words it is not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>As I was saying before I was interrupted, the view taken by the MEPs across the political spectrum and from all corners of Europe was an authoritative and credible statement from a wide and diverse range of democratically elected public representatives.</P>
      <P>I will now set out briefly how the Government is approaching the ratification of the European constitution. I will also focus on six core positive reasons for supporting the constitution. In so <Col N="920"/>doing I will address a few of the negative arguments and new myths which are being advanced.</P>
      <P>The Government intends very soon to publish the Bill amending Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann to allow for ratification by the State of the European constitution. As is widely known, we have been consulting with the main Opposition parties with a view to reaching consensus on the exact text of the wording. While that process has inevitably taken some time, I expect it to be completed soon. Some sensational and inaccurate speculation has taken place about endorsement of the constitutional treaty and what that will mean.</P>
      <P>One recently promulgated myth is that it will in some way remove the right of the people to vote on future major treaty change. That is a myth and an untruth. However, it will not stop it being perpetuated and pedalled. The situation will remain as now. Major treaty change will have to be negotiated through a convention and then an Intergovernmental Conference. If it were deemed to go outside the scope and objectives of the current treaties, then under the terms of the Crotty judgment, a referendum would be required in Ireland. On the other hand, as is currently the case, if such change does not go outside the scope and objectives of the treaties, no referendum would be required. In other words, the situation will remain precisely as it is now. I mention this as one of the parties represented in the Chamber today, showing breathless disregard for the truth, has recently been pedalling the opposite view. The Government will be prepared to amend the Bill to avoid unnecessary controversy over this point.</P>
      <P>Following publication of the Bill, it would be the Government&rsquo;s intention to schedule some of the Oireachtas debate on it before the summer recess and to complete the legislative process later. It remains the case that no decision has been taken on the timing of the referendum &mdash; our commitment and requirement is to ratify by November 2006. Publication of the Bill will allow me to make an order establishing the Referendum Commission. The Government is determined that it will have the time and resources it needs, as it did for the second referendum on the Nice treaty. In June the Government will publish a White Paper to complement the earlier explanatory guide it published last year. We will send a short information booklet to every household &mdash; probably in the autumn. Copies of the constitution are available on the special Department of Foreign Affairs website, and are also available free of charge from the European Commission office in Dublin and from the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>I now turn to the substance of the constitution. We should support the constitutional treaty for many reasons. The first reason for supporting the European constitution is that it introduces much greater legal and political clarity than exists at present. Up to now, the European Union has been based on a series of treaties, dating back to the 1950s, which have been amended piecemeal <Col N="921"/>over the years. The constitution will replace that tangle of treaties with a single document. Moreover, the Union&rsquo;s basic values, objectives, principles and powers are set out much more clearly than before. The relationship between the European Union and its member states is described more clearly than ever before, as is who does what in the European Union. In an all-important area, the number of legal instruments is cut from 15 to six.</P>
      <P>I will not claim that the European constitution will win any awards for its prose style. It was legally necessary to carry forward a great mass of detail into Part III of the treaty. However, the first part of the constitution, which sets out the basic values and principles underpinning the Union&rsquo;s activities, is much more lucid and coherent than any previous treaty in describing what the Union is and does. I honestly believe that any interested citizen who takes the trouble to read Part I, the first 60 articles, covering a mere 29 well-spaced pages of large type, will have a far greater understanding of the Union than has ever before been possible.</P>
      <P>While the constitution makes some important changes, it does not substantially alter the current nature of the European Union or how it relates to the member states. It is absolutely untrue to state that it creates some kind of federal super-state. The word &ldquo;federal&rdquo; got some excited debate during the course of the convention and those who bothered to pay attention to it will realise the word was consigned to the bin. It is made crystal clear that the Union only has the competences which its member states unanimously have chosen to give it. The list of those powers is basically the same as in the current treaties, under which Ireland has thrived.</P>
      <P>It is important to recall those powers, which remain exclusively or overwhelmingly with the member states. They include the powers to create war and peace; law and order; taxation; pensions and social welfare; infrastructural development; education; health; culture and the arts. The Union&rsquo;s total budget remains at approximately 1% of our gross national income. An ongoing debate is taking place as to whether this should be 1% or 1.02%. Anybody who believes it would be possible to create a super-state on that basis is not remotely connected with reality. There is not much hope of a super-state on a budgetary contribution of 1% or less of gross national income.</P>
      <P>The document is a constitution inasmuch as it sets down in one place the basic law of the European Union, just as national constitutions set down the basic law of the member states. However, the legal form of the constitution remains a treaty between sovereign independent states. I emphasise this point as a few nights ago I listened to a councillor argue that the opposite was the case. The principle of the primacy of Union law, which is now treated as a somewhat sinister principle, has been in place since well before Ireland entered the Union and, by definition, it only operates in those areas where the <Col N="922"/>member states have decided to pool their sovereignty and give the Union its competence.</P>
      <P>A second reason for supporting the European constitution is the unique approach to preparing it. In the past, European Union treaties were largely negotiated by diplomats and officials behind closed doors. The European constitution was totally different. The draft text was prepared by a European Convention in which representatives of governments, national parliaments, the European Parliament and the EU Commission all played a part. I was proud to be a member of the Irish team, which included John Bruton, Proinsias de Rossa MEP and Deputies Gormley and Carey. It had more Opposition than Government representatives, and I believe that was an inspired decision made collectively across the political parties in this State. It meant that we were unique in that we were representative of the political parties in the Houses of the Oireachtas and, more importantly, that Ireland was very well represented on each of the groups within Europe. John Bruton was a member of the Presidium.</P>
      <P>The Convention met for a year and a half. All 49 days of its plenary sessions were in public. It held a series of fundamental debates on key aspects of the Union. All its working papers and contributions from members were published immediately on the web, as were all the successive drafts of constitutional articles and any amendments proposed to them. It was an absolute model of openness and transparency, and those who say otherwise are simply attempting to mislead. There have been attempts, particularly by Ms McDonald, MEP, who is in this House, to suggest that this was a sham and that the Presidium ran the entire show. I do not recall seeing her much in and around the Convention, but I was there for its entirety, and I can advise her absolutely that in this, as in so much else, she is deluded.</P>
      <P>There was, of course, a steering group. What body of any size would not have a central organ? It is possible that Sinn F&eacute;in has one too, as do bodies closely associated with that party. However, the point is that there was a real and genuine openness to debate and amendment. For instance, to take an area I worked on intensively, the Convention&rsquo;s final drafts on institutional matters, such as the Commission and the Council, were dramatically different from those put before the Convention by Mr. Giscard d&rsquo;Estaing. They were changed on the floor of the Convention by a combination of small and medium-sized member states.</P>
      <P>The outcome of the Convention was widely welcomed. It is ultimately the prerogative of governments to change the EU treaties, subject to national ratification. However, the governments were very supportive of the draft prepared by the Convention. Some 90% still stood after the Intergovernmental Conference, or IGC, which followed. That was clear evidence of the strength of the unique working method.</P><Col N="923"/>
      <P>Was it perfect? Of course not, but it comes as close to perfection as we are ever likely to get. It was open, transparent and all-inclusive. Not only were the 15 member states fully represented; the ten accession states were represented too, as were the three to follow them, and all the national parliaments. NGOs had a say. The Commission had only two members present, and member governments were also represented. For anyone to say that this was anything other than an open and transparent method is myth-peddling.</P>
      <P>Of course, it was the Irish Presidency of the EU that brokered the final agreement, though many thought it would be impossible in the timeframe. It was an immense achievement for the country, Irish democracy and diplomacy and, most importantly, for the Taoiseach personally, something that has been internationally recognised and applauded. I do not want to blow the Government&rsquo;s trumpet, but one point should be made. The key role that Ireland played shows how effectively small member states can contribute in a Union of 450 million people.</P>
      <P>A third reason for supporting the constitution is that it will help make the European Union more democratic and open in a range of ways. For instance, the role of national parliaments is considerably enhanced. They will now have the power to intervene directly in the legislative process where they believe that the Commission is proposing something that might better be done at a national level &mdash; the subsidiarity principle.</P>
      <P>As I said earlier, the rights of the European Parliament will also be increased in several policy areas. Clearly, in a unique and complex system such as Europe&rsquo;s, it will never be straightforward to ensure that the link between citizens and institutions is as direct and responsive as it can be at national level. However, taken together, the changes that I have mentioned are very welcome and a tremendous step in the right direction. It is entirely clear that, once again, they represent a major advance on current institutional arrangements.</P>
      <P>A fourth reason for supporting the constitution is that it strengthens the rights of individual citizens. The Charter of Fundamental Rights is an integral and legally binding part of the constitution. It lists the rights and principles to be respected and observed, from classical civil and political rights to social and economic rights. It should be clear that the charter will apply to EU institutions, and to member states when they are implementing Union law. As an Irish citizen, I will have my rights regarding the Irish State protected by Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann and those regarding Europe protected by the constitutional treaty. That is a great step forward. When Proinsias De Rossa, MEP, was here, he rightly described it as one of the most significant developments that we have seen. Moreover, the EU as a whole is to become party to the European Convention on Human Rights, and the Strasbourg-based European Court will be an external <Col N="924"/>monitor of the Union&rsquo;s own adherence to human rights, playing the same oversight role as it does for national governments.</P>
      <P>A fifth reason for supporting the constitutional treaty is that it makes several very significant changes to the Union&rsquo;s institutions. We must have a strong interest in a dynamic and effective Commission, and that is what is achieved here, since there is more balance than before. In future, every member state will be treated as an equal regarding the Commission. A new voting system in the Council, based on achieving clear majorities both of member states and of the population of the Union, is fairer, clearer, more logical, and more effective than the current complex arrangements. Member states will continue to chair most Councils on the basis of equal rotation. There are new posts of President of the European Council and Union foreign ministers, but those functions already exist, and the posts bring more coherence and clarity to the Union.</P>
      <P>The Union&rsquo;s common foreign and security policy, of which its security and defence policy is an integral part, is also strengthened. The usual criticisms have been made. The other night I listened to a Sinn F&eacute;in councillor arguing that this was somehow creating a military superstate. I was struck once again with the breathless disregard for truth and logic that the party sometimes shows &mdash; a disregard that would have made the late Dr. Goebbels blush. First, the EU&rsquo;s values and objectives &mdash; international peace, stability, respect for human rights and the promotion of democracy and justice &mdash; are enshrined in the constitution and supported by every democrat. Let me ask two questions. Does any serious observer of the international scene believe that the problem is that Europe is too strong and too assertive? The answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;. What can we deduce from the fact that among those who criticise the Union&rsquo;s efforts to develop its capacity are, apart from Sinn F&eacute;in and their fellow-travellers on one extreme, some of the leading American neo-con ideologues on the other?</P>
      <P>The sixth reason is that, over the last 20 years, there have been four new treaties. This constitutional treaty brings more coherence and an end to a period when Europe was continually re-inventing itself. Very often, the same issues were kicked from one conference to the next, and there were left-over issues. After this treaty, however, there will be no left-overs. Key issues were so thoroughly debated in the Convention and IGC that the final outcome is recognised as balanced in every way. There have once again been the usual myths and arguments about where we are regarding Eurofederalism and Euroscepticism. It is time that people recognised that the European Union is unique in that it is neither, being a union of member states that have come together and pooled their sovereignty to achieve great things. No one who has any sense of history, as we celebrate the 60th anniversary of the ending of the butchery on the continent that was the Second World War, could argue that the con<Col N="925"/>struction of the Union has not been an entirely happy period in history.</P>
      <P>There is a banner headline that another Europe is possible, something very often glibly and fatuously put forward. I suggest that it is misleading. If this constitutional treaty fails, there is simply no prospect that a substantially different document can be negotiated. Instead, the Union will be cast into a period of divisiveness and uncertainty, in no one&rsquo;s interest. It would have to continue to operate on the basis of existing treaties which, while serviceable, are clearly inferior to this.</P>
      <P>There is another sense in which another Europe is possible, however. We know from history what that Europe means. It would be a Europe of narrow nationalism and selfish balance of power politics. Anybody who has any sense of history or the truth knows exactly where that Europe brought us. We have been marking the 60th anniversary of its end in western Europe. The new member states that joined a year ago have more recent and bitter memories of what it meant for them.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Ireland&rsquo;s experience of the EU has been immensely positive. It will remain so if we have the confidence, the self-belief and the capacity to seize our opportunities and to help shape those opportunities. The European constitution does not ensure that the Union will continue to thrive and to serve all its people&rsquo;s interests any more than our own Constitution determines our success as a nation. However, it establishes a clear and enduring foundation for a successful future together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House. We have had him here before debating the broader issues of European Union policy, especially the constitution. We recognise the key role he has played in it and I congratulate him for it. I also welcome our colleagues from the European Parliament, some of whom have served here previously. Regardless of their political opinion, they will all have a key role in informing Irish public opinion over the course of the next few months. To have the MEPs here to engage with us and, through us with the broader public, is an excellent idea. It is part of the new thinking that we must use over the next few months if we are to ensure that the Irish people engage in the debate and take part in the referendum. Regardless of the outcome, it would be most unsatisfactory if there is a low turn-out for the referendum. Our aim must be to ensure that the public engages in the politics of Europe and the referendum.</P>
      <P>When the Nice Treaty referendum was defeated a few years ago, we all had to take note of what the public was saying. We were all accused of taking the public for granted and that was probably a reasonable charge. This morning, I would like to ask the public if it is taking Europe for granted. Have we taken for granted the most successful political project in the world since the <Col N="926"/>foundation of the United States of America in 1776? Are we taking for granted the peace which Europe has brought to this part of the world? Are taking for granted the economic, political and social progress that we have enjoyed since we joined the EEC in 1973? We must ask the Irish people to recognise that we would not be where we are today without the support of Europe and without our work at European level.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred briefly to last week&rsquo;s 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. Last week the Taoiseach and other Prime Ministers of Europe commemorated the fact that 60 years ago the people of Europe looked forward to a new dawn. We should not forget that the First World War ended 87 years ago, which was meant to be the war to end all wars. In 1918, the people of Europe felt that there was a new way forward and that peace and prosperity was the way of the future. Unfortunately, there was no political and social progress in the 1920s and 1930s and no attempt made to bring Europe together. Europe fell apart 20 years later and Europeans spilt their own blood. The great success story of the European project arose from the aftermath of the Second World War. The great political leaders of Europe, such as Adenauer and Schumann, came together and decided that they would put a European political project in place. It has led to where we are today. Western Europe was the first to develop and with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Soviet empire, that chance to develop and to prosper has now spread to eastern Europe.</P>
      <P>Those of us who have served on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs over the past 12 to 18 months have all admired the enthusiasm of the delegations we received from the countries of eastern Europe. We all know how the formerly downtrodden peoples of eastern Europe would like the Irish people to vote. That is the ultimate prize for us all, to build a Europe of people, nations and social, economic and political progress.</P>
      <P>It is important that we all use the next few weeks and months to spread the message of the European project. The Minister did not refer to recent surveys concerning attitudes in Ireland to the EU and to the constitution. It is extremely worrying to note that 45% of Irish people have apparently never heard of the constitution, despite the fact that so much of its finalisation occurred during the Irish Presidency of the EU. Ireland is ranked 22nd of 25 member states in its knowledge of Europe and the constitution. Our first challenge is to ensure that the people know what the project is about. It would be helpful if the political parties can reach political agreement informally over the next few weeks so that the referendum Bill can be published in advance of the summer recess thereby giving us the opportunity to debate and finalise the referendum legislation.</P>
      <P>The work of the Referendum Commission will be crucial, but we should try to reflect on how the <Col N="927"/>it does its business. The important thing is to ensure that every citizen has a reasonable knowledge of what the referendum will be about. I have grave doubts about the type of Referendum Commission practise that existed heretofore, where advertisements were placed in newspapers giving the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;No&rdquo; arguments. The electorate read very little of this. The Minister should ensure that the commission works in a way to encourage people to vote.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for listening, but six minutes gives little opportunity to say anything worthwhile. I look forward to much greater debate over the next few weeks and months because this is a matter of absolute importance to the Irish people. We would not be what we are today without support from Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister here today and I acknowledge the work that he put into the preparation of this constitutional treaty. I also thank the MEPs for their attendance in the House. It says something about the process of Seanad reform. Many years ago, we felt that it was important that we have links with the European Parliament to enable both sides to reach out to citizens. This is a golden opportunity to begin discussion on the ratification of the constitutional treaty. I also congratulate the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Treacy, who is in Galway today leading a discussion on the treaty.</P>
      <P>It is important to pay tribute to the excellent work done on the constitution by the Irish Presidency. The Taoiseach deserves particular praise for the manner in which he conducted himself during the Presidency and for his work in moulding this document.</P>
      <P>We must now consider how to prepare for the referendum and I will raise some points which may serve to stimulate the debate. The constitution is good for Ireland and for Europe. It was debated in an open, transparent and inclusive manner and sets out a blueprint and framework to enable the EU to develop into the future in a fair and efficient way. It expresses the Union&rsquo;s core values of respect for human dignity, democracy and human rights.</P>
      <P>Another important aspect of the constitution is that it enhances the powers of member states through the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. This means that if we are unhappy with any proposals from the EU we can produce a yellow card. This is a significant development. I hope all the scrutiny and debate that is taking place in respect of the constitution means citizens will understand that no decision can be made that is not acceptable in Ireland. One of the most important elements of the constitution is simplification in that it brings together all the other texts and treaties that have accumulated since the inception of the Union into one constitutional treaty. This will allow for a clearer interpretation of the rules and regulations of the EU.</P><Col N="928"/>
      <P>The key areas of concern to Ireland at the outset of the negotiations were tax, justice, defence and EU institutions in general. In regard to defence, the treaty&rsquo;s provisions make clear that Ireland will not be part of any common defence commitment. We will make our own decision whether to assist any member state in the event of an armed attack. Ireland will maintain its traditional policy of neutrality and that will be fully respected. There will be no EU army, no conscription and no military alliance. There is nothing in the constitution that threatens Ireland&rsquo;s long-held policy of military neutrality.</P>
      <P>Several misguided notions prevail in regard to the development of the EU. One argument still being trotted out is that the constitution will end Ireland&rsquo;s neutrality, turn the EU into a superpower and undermine national parliaments and their citizens. According to another school of thought, the European project is moving in a direction that is too liberal, the treaty is too Americanised and the welfare states, public services and trade union strength are increasingly at risk.</P>
      <P>There are undoubtedly concerns that our national and cultural identity may be eroded by closer integration at EU level. Most of all, there is concern about the level of knowledge that citizens have about the EU and the impact this may have on attitudes and political behaviour. Notwithstanding the generally positive attitude of citizens towards the EU, a lack of knowledge means a lack of interest. We need only refer to the first referendum on the Nice treaty for evidence of this. The lesson from that experience is that we must communicate and engage with citizens and mobilise them to support the treaty. The more people know about it, the more likely they are to support it. We must ensure citizens are informed through a vigorous public debate on television and radio.</P>
      <P>I compliment the National Forum on Europe for its excellent work under the chairmanship of Senator Maurice Hayes who is undertaking a nationwide series of information seminars. We cannot allow an information vacuum to develop because others will seek to exploit the holes in public awareness that arise from such a vacuum. National parliaments must work with the European Parliament to promote the treaty. I hope we can succeed in reaching out to citizens over the coming months so they can make an informed decision and ensure a successful referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister, Deputy Roche, for finally circulating his script. Following his departure, will another Minister now take his place for the debate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>No. The arrangements, as agreed by the party leaders and the Independent spokesperson, is that the Minister, Deputy Roche, should be present for the beginning of the debate and that another Minister should attend at the close. The main purpose of today&rsquo;s debate <Col N="929"/>is to facilitate a discussion between Members and MEPs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a pity a Minister will not be present but there is nothing to be done if this was agreed by the Whips. It serves to devalue the debate that there is no Government representative to listen to Members&rsquo; contributions. This experiment, which has so far been useful, is treated with a certain amount of disdain if it is not attended by a Minister. For all such discussions in future, we should insist that the relevant Minister remains in the House for the duration of the debate.</P>
      <P>The Minister made an interesting contribution on this matter. By definition, the benefits of the European Union are historical. For Ireland, membership has undoubtedly been tremendously beneficial and useful. Senator Bradford movingly and pointedly observed that the great but unproveable benefit of the EU is that we have had few conflicts of any nature since its formation. The evidence suggests that the efforts to make a political union have been extremely successful. There are occasional difficulties but those conflicts that have arisen have been resolved not by force of arms but by democratic and political means. This is a major and almost unanswerable argument for the benefits of the Union in the past.</P>
      <P>I spent the weekend before last in Berlin where the 60th anniversary VE Day was being celebrated. This was an interesting experience because in Moscow, London, Paris and many other places throughout Europe, citizens were comfortable in celebrating this occasion. However, it was difficult for the Germans to celebrate their own defeat and the awful historical footprints of which they are to some extent ashamed. The celebrations in Berlin were undertaken in a reasonably dignified manner. They focussed primarily on citizens&rsquo; awareness of their status as good Europeans and a recognition of their participation in a great European movement which has allowed them to put the war behind them to some extent. In addition, in a move of detached contrition and in a moving ceremony, Berlin opened a Holocaust memorial. Moreover, the city also had a day for democracy, the celebration of which took place over two days. In Europe, one can always have two bank holidays even though other countries seem to require only one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>That is socialism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>The celebrations in Berlin indicate that Europe has politically healed the wounds of the Second World War. I suspect this has much to do with the EU and the political closeness that has developed between the countries of Europe. I agree with everything that has been said on this unquestionable benefit.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed that the Minister, in his speech, never touched upon the issue of the <Col N="930"/>European economy, which is an awkward underbelly for those who are unapologetically pro-European. It is easy to be emotionally pro-European for the reasons I outlined. However, it is difficult to be honest about the reasons for the sluggishness of the European economy. I do not know the answer. It must be possible to ask whether the European Union is a factor in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator White&rsquo;s comment is fair but this remains a valid question. The world&rsquo;s two great economies, Europe and the United States, are moving at different speeds. We must ask whether the great European expressions which Senator Ormonde discussed and to which we pay tribute, such as proportionality and subsidiarity, are in some way stifling the European economy or whether the ideal of a social economy may somehow suppress European development and growth. This issue has not been addressed in this House. We must then ask how Ireland benefits economically. Ireland apparently benefited from both the European and the US economies. We benefit greatly from the European economy due, I suppose, to low interest rates. This country has boomed for the past seven or eight years, partially because low interest rates have allowed people to borrow large sums of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>It is called social partnership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>A housing boom continues. That is one of the reasons. At the same time, we have been riding the American boom. The Americans have a disdain for social partnership. Multinationals have been the engine of the growth for the economy.</P>
      <P>What will this constitution do for Ireland? I see what the European Union has done for Ireland in the past. It has been fantastic and a net payer to us. In the past, we have been enthusiastic Europeans because we received money from the arrangement. The moment we saw that the money was disappearing, we voted against the Nice treaty. If this constitution is to be passed, a hard rather than soft sell is needed from the Minister. He said there is no need to be frightened because the changes will not be significant. This is a soft sell which asks that people vote yes because they will not be injured by so doing. We need to know the positive elements for us or we will enter a vacuum of a campaign which may end in defeat because those who are negative will raise the same taboos as before. The Minister&rsquo;s speech betrayed a lack of conviction about the specific benefits for Ireland, while making a good historical case for past benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>If we have learned anything from our European colleagues, it is to speak to an issue within six minutes. The Members of this House are not proficient at doing so. I welcome our visit<Col N="931"/>ors and I am particularly pleased to see former Members of this House.</P>
      <P>I join the Minister in congratulating the Irish people who made an input into the constitution, including Mr. John Bruton, who was a member of the praesidium. The constitution brings together a series of earlier documents. It was extremely difficult, when campaigning on matters such as Maastricht or Amsterdam, to be required to refer constantly to earlier treaties. A roadmap was needed. These matters are now codified in one document. The attachment of the charter of fundamental rights is welcome and will allay concerns on social aspects of the treaty. Broader human rights and social aspects are cemented into the charter. I am glad that a White Paper will be published in June. This will result in wider debate.</P>
      <P>We need to nail several issues. There is a belief that the treaty involves creeping federalism and will create a federal state. The characteristics of a federal state are not present. Even if the EU was minded to introduce such a state, I do not know how a federal state could survive on 1% of GNP. I do not see any threat from a potential federal state.</P>
      <P>It was a matter of satisfaction that the COSAC meeting in Luxembourg urged national parliaments to spend a week in consideration of the work programme of the Commission and in examination of the annual legislative programme. This was echoed at the recent Speakers&rsquo; conference in Budapest where the Ceann Comhairle was instrumental in having the same approach adopted. It is welcome that this was incorporated into the conclusion of the COSAC meeting. I hope that further meetings of this nature will ensue. All the delegations were impressed that the Seanad is holding this debate.</P>
      <P>We must ask the purpose of a constitution. Our experience is that a constitution limits power and the executive is not given unfettered powers. A constitution proclaims and defends the rights of citizens. Regardless of the left or right wing nature of an administration, it is restricted by a constitution.</P>
      <P>The EU constitution is needed to bring coherence and clarity to former treaties. It was difficult for citizens to approach the earlier treaties. The proposed constitution makes it easier to understand the EU. It will not provide for a Union capable of transforming our administration into a liberal or conservative form. That is a matter for national governments and arises from interactions between people and their administrations, among other factors. The constitution confirms the <i>status quo</i>, which is that the EU is only allowed to legislate in those areas where it has been given competence to do so. We pooled our sovereignty in some but not all areas. This is an important issue because confusion existed at the recent hearings of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. It was assumed, in matters such <Col N="932"/>as Senator Norris&rsquo;s Civil Partnership Bill, that the EU would instruct us on what to do.</P>

	<P>Some of those who attended the committee&rsquo;s meetings were under the impression that the EU&rsquo;s influence was all-pervasive and would dictate all areas of life. It will do so only in areas in which competence has been vested. The decision to vest competence was in order to create the edifice of peace which Schuman, Spaak, Monet and others realised was needed on the European mainland after the cataclysm of the Second World War. Our domestic experience demonstrates that it is incorrect to claim that continuous peace has existed in Europe. However, it is an enduring legacy that global conflicts based on nationalism have been avoided. The EU has brought us more than economic benefit. It has influenced our national self-confidence and our relationship with our nearest neighbour. Those of us educated in the 1960s remember that our horizons were totally limited by our nearest neighbour. We never looked beyond it to any other model. Our Parliament is based on the Westminster model. We never looked to any other models. The European Union has given us significant national self-confidence and has transformed Irish life. The economic miracle has been part of it and, in some respects, a by-product of it. We have done much ourselves but the European Union has utterly transformed Irish life for the better.</P>
      <P>The constitution will put a restriction on the Union in terms of how it encroaches on the rights of member states, other than in those areas where we have given the competence. The qualified majority aspect is important but there must be unanimity in regard to defence, taxation and foreign policy. In regard to defence, it is important to say nothing can happen unless we so decide. If there is to be an EU army and a common defence policy, we must sign up. It must be unanimously agreed. If it is not unanimously agreed, it cannot happen and we cannot be forced into it. In any event, NATO is still the pillar to which most of the states will look in terms of the common defence aspect.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Presidency, getting rid of the six-month term and having a two and a half year one is useful in terms of continuity. There is the issue of the double hatting and the Foreign Minister. Somebody asked who they should telephone when a foreign policy issue arises. I have dealt with the defence aspect. There is also the issue of Commission reform which, when slimmed down, will make it better. The larger states have lost out in that they had two Commissioners. In regard to parliamentary reform, we have shown today we can adjust and be liberal. It is good to have our MEPs here and I look forward to hearing what they have to say.</P>

	<P>T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm a bheith anseo ar&iacute;st, ag caint faoi Bhunreacht na hEorpa. T&aacute; s&eacute; r&iacute;th&aacute;bhachtach go bhfuil an Seanad ag filleadh ar an cheist seo. T&aacute; a fhios againn go bhfuil daoine &aacute;irithe taobh amuigh den Teach seo ag iarraidh an obair a dhein na Feisir&iacute; Parlaiminte sa choinbhinsi&uacute;n a bhr&eacute;agn&uacute; agus a mhasl&uacute;. N&iacute; ghlacaim leis sin ar chor ar bith. Ghlac gach &eacute;inne den 200 Feisire l&aacute;n-ph&aacute;irt sna d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta&iacute; agus na comhr&eacute;iteacha polaiti&uacute;la a cuireadh i gcr&iacute;ch.</P>
      <P>The European Convention was made up of approximately 200 democratically-elected politicians from around Europe and from all political persuasions. Indeed, it included representatives of the social partners, the Commission, 28 governments and the European ombudsman. It reached a broad consensus which governments largely accepted and signed off on 12 months later. Decisions were not made by voting but by reaching a broad consensus through a process of exhaustive and, in many cases, exhausting discussion and negotiation in plenary sessions, in working groups and within each of the political families that participated in the Convention. The size of the Convention and the broadness of the consensus can be gauged by the fact that a Eurosceptical alternative document was signed by a mere eight participants out of over 200 who participated, one of whom, unfortunately, happened to be an Irishman.</P>
      <P>It is also important to bear in mind that what we have in this text is the consolidated text of five or six treaties. This text runs to 500 pages, half of which consist of protocols and declarations. The actual constitutional text is approximately half of that. What we have is a consolidation of existing treaties. Some 95% of that text is the existing treaty, so what we are asking the people of Ireland and of Europe to agree to is 5% of that text.</P>
      <P>The new element of that document is approximately 5% and it includes stating the values and the objectives of the Union, incorporating rights for the citizens of Europe, making various institutional changes to improve the effectiveness of how we make decisions, improving the democratic legitimacy of the decisions we make by giving a greater role to national parliaments and the European Parliament, and obliging the Ministers we send to Councils to meet openly and to discuss openly when making legislation.</P>
      <P>We in the Convention addressed all the questions the Laaken declaration obliged us to address, including the question as to whether powers which the European Union currently exercises should be dropped and left to the member states to implement. The Convention decided that was not a good thing to do but it also decided no new powers should be given to the European Union. Consequently, the constitutional text does not include new powers for the European Union to exercise exclusively. It places new responsibilities on the Union, on its various institutions, on the national parliaments, includ<Col N="934"/>ing the Oireachtas, and on the European Parliament by doubling the number of areas in which it must make legislation in co-decision with the Council. It also places new responsibilities on the Commission and, indeed, on the Council, as I indicated.</P>
      <P>We also believed efficiency was not good enough on its own and that if it was not accompanied by transparency and democratic accountability, it would not achieve the legitimacy with the citizens which is clearly needed. We consequently incorporated a whole range of innovations for a unique transnational organisation of sovereign states. A whole section of the constitution deals with the democratic life of the Union. No other organisation, including the WTO, the UN, the IMF, the World Bank or the Council of Europe, has a directly-elected parliament which shares the making of laws which apply to the entire Union and which oblige and give power to the national parliaments to challenge legally if they so choose. No other treaty provides, as a right, for the direct consultation of civil society organisations, including religious and non-religious organisations. Subsidiarity is now legally binding on all EU institutions.</P>
      <P>This constitutional treaty is a significant step forward in the democratic accountability of its decision making and of the quality of its choices and in the recognition that neither man nor woman lives by bread alone. This document is a coming of age for Europe. It is not a cause for anxiety or fear as some seek to pretend for narrow electoral advantage. It is a cause for hope and optimism. It gives us a framework in which to pursue democratically our respective objectives within the context of Europe&rsquo;s unique social model.</P>
      <P>We live in a world which is globalising everything except justice and democracy. In this constitution we seek to reverse that trend. It is not a perfect document. There are things in it I do not like and things not in it I would have liked. However, it is an honest compromise between different firmly held political convictions and it is a framework for me, as a person of the left, to argue and promote my politics and for those of the right to argue theirs and to seek through democratic mandate to pursue their politics.</P>
      <P>In his book,<i> The Age of Consent</i>, George Monbiot said:</P>
      <P LI="1">Everything has been globalised except our consent. Democracy alone has been confined to the nation state. It stands at the national border, suitcase in hand, without a passport.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I believe this constitution provides a passport for European democracy.</P>

	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh bhaill Pharlaimint na hEorpa. Senator Ormonde was kind enough to refer to my chairmanship of the National Forum on Europe. That imposes its own obligation on me to protect the integrity and independence of the forum. I will, therefore, deal <Col N="935"/>with structural matters. This is an extremely important occasion. It is an important development in the linkage between the European Parliament and the Oireachtas. I hope it could be important for the MEPs in providing them with a locus in which they could report on developments in Europe. It is extremely valuable and enriching for this House to get a feeling for what is happening in Europe. I hope we will have some feedback after today&rsquo;s session so we can develop a method whereby we do not simply talk at each other, but have a real interchange. Unlike Senator Ross, I do not see the necessity for a Minister to be present, as it changes the dynamic. Exchanges take place across the Chamber and while a Minister can often have an input or give his or her information on policy, the real exchange should be between the two groups of parliamentarians.</P>
      <P>I like to think that the forum provided a similar service to Proinsias De Rossa, MEP, and his colleagues when they were participating in the Convention. It gave them a place in Ireland to which they could return to tell the people of developments and receive reactions to what was being proposed or not proposed from a fairly representative group of people including all the parties as well as civil society.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister stated that the Referendum Commission was to be established fairly quickly and undertook to ensure that it was properly funded to carry out its necessary task. The commission and anyone who examined its work agrees that the more time it gets to do its task before a referendum, the better.</P>
      <P>I was prepared to offer the Minister a prize for the understatement of the year when he noted that the European draft constitution would not win any prizes for prose style. It certainly would not and its authors took, I believe, some 480 pages, to do what Jefferson achieved in a very small number of sentences. This is one of the problems people have when projecting a vision of Europe. It is happening currently in France. It is so diffuse that people cannot get a grip on it. It is necessary for all the parliamentarians here to help convey to people the message that they have a stake in Europe and should be interested in how it is governed and run.</P>
      <P>In this sense, whether it is governed by this constitution or some variant is immaterial. There is a real difficulty in making that connection and my concern in a referendum is not whether people voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the proposition put before them but whether they vote at all. A general turning away from politics as such has occurred, particularly among young people. The challenge is to encourage people to turn out in a referendum. Another challenge is to always ensure they are reasonably informed before they do so. They should be helped with information to make up their own minds on the issue.</P>
      <P>People are interested. For example, we had two meetings of the forum last week. One was in <Col N="936"/>Roscommon, which Proinsias De Rossa, MEP, the Minister and Deputy Gormley attended. Another took place two weeks earlier in Gweedore, in which S&eacute;an &Oacute; Neachtain, MEP, Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh and Alan Dukes were engaged. People were willing to be engaged and there was a thirst for information. This is the challenge for us all. Today however, laying the foundation for what I hope will be a long-term relationship between the Members of the European Parliament from Ireland and this House is more important than the actual debate on the constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell, MEP</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the House for this invitation. It is a privilege to be here today. The constitutional document contains four parts. Part I deals with the provisions which define the Union. Significantly, Part II deals with the charter of fundamental rights while Part IV contains the final clauses, which deal with procedures for adopting and revising the constitution. Part III contains something like 321 articles, or approximately three quarters of the total and deals with the policies and operation of the Union. In the main, it reproduces articles from previous treaties which set out the provisions governing the Union&rsquo;s policies in a re-numbered and more logical format. This part includes policies like the free movement of goods, services, persons and capital as well as the common agricultural and fisheries policies and other issues of that nature. We arrived at this point through a unique process.</P>
      <P>The biggest group in the Convention, some 55 of the 105 main members, were also members of national parliaments. I was Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs and we met members of our delegation before they went out and after they returned. The process involved both Government and Parliament and never before has such an effort been made to include people.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross asked what this will do for Ireland. Some 60 million people died in the first half of the last century and the Union has grown to include 25 member states. The constitution does for Ireland what it does for the other 24 member states. It helps us to continue providing the prerequisite for prosperity, namely, the stability and peaceful evolution of Europe. It does this and no more. If we forget that the primary objective of the European Union is to keep peace and stability in Europe, we will have lost our way. The constitution sets down the rules agreed by the 25 member states as to how that will be achieved, to be ratified by their parliaments or public.</P>
      <P>In the few minutes available to me, I will state something with which not everyone in this House or the D&aacute;il will agree. It is time we stopped eulogising Irish neutrality. I can only find two definitions for it, but thankfully people like Patrick Keating have written extensively about the issue. The first was set down by Se&aacute;n MacBride in 1949 when, as Minister for External Affairs, he stated <Col N="937"/>that we would become full charter members of NATO the day after partition ends. The second definition by the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, pledged that Ireland would take on common defence responsibilities when our GDP exceeded 80% of the European Union average. Although I am unsure what the present incumbent has stated on the issue, every other Taoiseach since Se&aacute;n Lemass has stated that if common defence becomes a requirement of our membership of the European Union, we would take it on.</P>
      <P>It is not a requirement under this treaty, but we should seek to make it so. We are losing a golden opportunity to shape the common defence of Europe in a way that best suits our interests. If memory serves, Article III-41 sets out the defence commitment and Protocol 24 also deals with it. Unlike the treaties of Maastricht, Amsterdam or Nice, these articles do not state that there may be a common defence, they state there will be a common defence and that those members who wish to join can do so. That will not include Ireland, because the Seville declaration excludes us and the second Nice treaty amendment specifically excludes a common defence without a referendum here.</P>
      <P>We can join a common defence policy with the inclusion of appropriate wording in the Bill to be announced by the Minister. We should do so now. We should empower the D&aacute;il &mdash; this matter falls to the D&aacute;il rather than to the Oireachtas &mdash; to join a common defence policy if the circumstances are right for Ireland.</P>
      <P>What should those circumstances be? For years we kept our heads down and told people what they wanted to hear. If we avoid doing so now and negotiate, we could negotiate a protocol which allows the four neutral states to opt in on a case-by-case basis. The D&aacute;il has the right to declare war. Why should it not have the right to declare, on a case-by-case basis, that we will participate in the defence of Europe? What is wrong with us as a people that we cannot debate this issue in either House of the Oireachtas or in public?</P>
      <P>We never have a proper debate on this issue. It is assumed that we all have the same opinion and that we are required to eulogise neutrality. We are missing a golden opportunity to join a common EU defence and provide for the security of our children into the future by playing party politics and putting our own selfish interests first. This course of action is wrong and is something about which we, as parliamentarians, should be concerned.</P>

	<P>It is always a useful <i>sine qua non</i> to have. I thank the Leader of the House, the House and the Cathaoirleach for inviting us here today. It is a reflection of this House&rsquo;s initiative that it has been the first such institution to give MEPs the opportunity to attend and discuss ongoing work in the EU because of its direct impact in Ireland. It is always difficult to know what area to cover when one is discussing a constitution because they have all been touched on or dealt with.</P>
      <P>I would like to begin in reverse order. I did not plan on mentioning it but in light of the fact that my esteemed colleague, Gay Mitchell, MEP, raised the issue with regard to defence and the changes that should made, I will address it. Whatever the rights and wrongs of being part of a common defence policy, alliance or union, that decision is the sole preserve of the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Mr. Crowley, MEP</NameTxt>
	<P>This decision should not be confused with issues surrounding the debate on the European constitution. There is sufficient confusion and scaremongering fostered by those opposed to the constitution regarding what it will achieve. Despite the fact that the same arguments were used since the early 1970s by opponents of Ireland&rsquo;s entry into the EEC and at every referendum since then, opponents of the constitution claim that the arguments have validity, even though they have been disproved over that 35-year period. While I welcome the opportunity to debate the issue raised by Mr. Mitchell, MEP, it is important to remember that it is a debate for another day.</P>
      <P>The treaty that we are now discussing cannot be renegotiated or altered despite what we may do in a Bill in the Oireachtas. The treaty clearly sets down that the position of Ireland&rsquo;s neutrality and the conditions attached to the civil declaration will not be changed. One of the issues that we could look at and discuss sometime in the future is the kind of arrangements in which we may wish to be involved. However, it is not an issue that is relevant to the debate on the European constitution.</P>
      <P>Turning to an issue the Minister and Proinsias De Rossa, MEP, touched upon earlier, the EU is a unique institution; there is nothing else like it in the world. It does not always run properly and efficiently but what it has done, as Senator Bradford said earlier, is stay true to its founding ideals. It has maintained peace within its core remit area, ensured economic development and co-operation within its core operating area and allowed for prosperity to develop. There are many more things it could do better or more quickly. However, if one looks at a number of areas that affect Ireland and allow for an expansion of opportunities for the Irish people, such as <Col N="939"/>social development, environmental laws and rules and regulations, the EU has been a success.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross asked about the benefits to Ireland of ratifying the European constitution. I recall that during the debate on the Maastricht treaty I was berated by the Senator for saying that the treaty would provide an additional £12.5 billion in Structural and Cohesion funds. He said that I should have focused on the text of the treaty rather than on the benefits to Ireland. That is the difficulty with this treaty for those of us who are in favour of it. It contains nothing that we can point out as the big idea, such as a single currency, opening up the market for goods, services and capital or creating new EU institutions. It is a more technical and ordered treaty.</P>
      <P>One of the greatest difficulties that we face, as pointed out by my good friend and colleague Senator Maurice Hayes, is invigorating people and getting them to participate. How do we ensure that people feel a sense of ownership or abhorrence on the issues? Both sides of the debate must be heard in order to get people involved. We are now dealing with a generation of people with no knowledge of what life was like just after the Second World War, while a large percentage of the population has no knowledge of what life was like before the end of the Cold War. They do not understand the sense of risk which motivated the founding fathers of the then EEC.</P>
      <P>However, that risk still exists because despite the strength that we think we possess, the foundations on which the EU are built are very shaky and depend on each one of us understanding our interdependence to ensure that the gifts we have received from our membership of the EU over the past 30 years will continue to come to Ireland but can also be spread to those new countries that have joined the EU and those that are anxious to join.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the treaty, the former Chief Rabbi of Great Britain, Jonathan Sacks, said, &ldquo;This treaty does give dignity to the difference that exists within the European Union and the wider European continent.&rdquo; That is a good place for Ireland to be, at the heart of it. It is an island by geographic circumstances but its heart and soul and the driving force for its future development remain at the very centre of Europe and decision making in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Ms Harkin, MEP</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak to Seanad &Eacute;ireann. I have spoken on a number of occasions in the Lower House but I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to speak in the Upper House. I thank the Leader of the Seanad, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, for giving this time to debate the proposed European constitution because over the next six to 12 months &mdash; whatever length of time we have &mdash; there will be many discussions, debates and seminars on the constitution. I believe this is critical because it is part of the pro<Col N="940"/>cess of informing people about the constitution and how it will affect them.</P>
      <P>In this context, I will repeat what I said in the European Parliament and elsewhere. A copy of the constitution should be sent to every household. I accept that it is a large document and that making copies of it will be expensive, but making it available to all is a worthwhile exercise. Not everyone will read it; some people will dip in and out of it. They might read a section in which they have an interest or because their interest has been piqued by a debate on television or an argument in the pub. They will check to see if what they have been told about the constitution is true or false.</P>
      <P>Sending a copy of the constitution to every household makes a statement to citizens that it is of sufficient importance for the Government to spend money on it so that people can be informed. There are other documents that inform people, such as the publication on the draft constitution, prepared by the European Convention, entitled Presentation to Citizens, A Constitution for Europe. Another example is the document entitled A Summary of the European Constitution. These are very worthwhile and useful but the text of the constitution should still be made available to every household.</P>
      <P>It might also be useful to include an insert that explains Article 29.4.10&deg; of the Irish Constitution in all documentation sent to citizens. This article sets out clearly the relationship between our Constitution and all European legislation and the proposed European constitution. It is worthwhile quoting Article 29.4.10&deg;:</P>
      <P LI="1">No provision of this Constitution invalidates laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the State which are necessitated by the obligations of membership of the European Union or of the Communities, or prevents laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the European Union or by the Communities or by institutions thereof, or by bodies competent under the Treaties establishing the Communities, from having the force of law in the State.</P>
      <P FLI="0">In other words, European legislation, where it has been agreed by all member states, has primacy and becomes our legislation, indeed it is already our legislation. Our Constitution already states that because we agreed to it in a referendum.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>There are many people who suggest that this new constitution will somehow change things, that it will now have primacy over our Constitution. However, that is already the case but only where we have given that competence and authority to the EU. As Senator Dardis said earlier, the <i>status quo</i> remains. I must confess to being particularly anxious about this point. I have spoken with many people recently and they are of the opinion that if we ratify this new constitution, it will mean a whole new scenario where our Constitution is redundant. This is simply untrue yet the message <Col N="941"/>is being pumped out again and again by those who oppose the constitution.</P>

    <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Ms Harkin, MEP</NameTxt>
	<P>I was speaking before the break about the issue of the new constitution for Europe having primacy over the Irish Constitution. I have already made the point that when we give authority or competence to the EU, or where we have given it, EU law has primacy. However, where we have not given authority to the EU to make laws, then Irish law has primacy. This is how it has been since we joined the EU. This new constitution will not change that situation.</P>
      <P>Some people might ask whether we really need a constitution. We have all the treaties, the EU is working well, so why do we need a constitution? In a sense, &ldquo;If it ain&rsquo;t broke, why do we need to fix it&rdquo;? This is a legitimate point of view but there is a very cogent counter argument to it. This was expressed by the European Parliament when it voted by a significant majority to accept a report on the new constitution which reads as follows:</P>
      <P LI="1">The European Parliament states that Europe must not rest on its laurels. It must deal with the new challenges facing it at the start of the 21st century, that is, the Union&rsquo;s role in international politics, globalisation, enlargement, the euro, internal and external security of our continent, terrorism, migratory flows, education, technological progress, racism, xenophobia or social exclusion.</P>
      <P FLI="0">In other words, the European Parliament is saying, and I agree with it, that we need this new constitution to cope with the new challenges facing Europe.</P>
      <P>One of the most important reasons for this new constitution is that it defines clearly the actions the EU can take. It also lays down the values and principles which guide those actions. This is what a constitution should do, namely, lay down the conditions governing and the limits to the exercise of power in the context of a political entity while at the same time safeguarding citizens&rsquo; rights.</P>
      <P>Many specific issues have been discussed here today and more will be discussed this afternoon. I would like to refer briefly to two issues. Many will argue that endowing the Union with a constitution is a first step, or even a further step, towards the creation of a centralised European <Col N="942"/>super state. However, I would argue precisely the opposite. First, a formal constitution offers member states and their citizens formal and legislative safeguards against Community action going too far. Second, if we ratify the constitution for Europe, then, for the first time ever, there will be an exit strategy for any country that wishes to leave the Union. This new constitution introduces the possibility of voluntary withdrawal from the EU. If a member state so wishes, it can negotiate agreements for its withdrawal and outline the relationship between the member state and the EU. Therefore, those who say that we will be locked into this mythical super state are simply not telling the truth. If at any time D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann decides that we wish to withdraw from the Union, that option will be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to repeat the welcome we gave earlier to MEPs who have taken the time to come here today. I was interested to learn that two minutes is the speaking slot in Europe, so three times that is very good here in the Seanad. As I am fascinated by the debate, I intend to stay until the end. I am learning more about the constitution than I thought. I already have fertile ground for debate among my constituents, including for meetings and so on. So many interesting comments have been made.</P>
      <P>One&rsquo;s belief in the constitution should be founded on passion about the idea of Europe. If one does not have that passion and philosophical belief in what Europe offers its citizens and member states, it is very difficult to become bureaucratic and deal with what appears a dull leaden book or debate, because it is not founded perhaps on the political passion of what has happened.</P>
      <P>After the catastrophe of the Second World War the founding fathers of the European Union determined that there would never again be within their region that type of all-out war which led to such destruction. Sixty years later that determination persists. In recent months we have seen many pictures and re-enactments of that period on television, particularly on the anniversary of VE Day. Ireland was not involved but it is important to see what people went through and how quickly they re-built their countries after the war with a determination not to allow such destruction in Europe again.</P>
      <P>We may not all believe in a united Europe and it is good that there are differing points of view. I do not get into a hissy fit because other people or parties may have different points of view. They are entitled to that view. It would be too bad if in this Chamber we did not allow the expression of differing points of view. I look forward to hearing them, as long as they are honest.</P>
      <P>Previous speakers made many interesting points. I rather liked the point made by Proinsias De Rossa, MEP, that only 5% of the document is new and therefore to be absorbed anew. The balance of this large tome is based on the treaties of Rome, Amsterdam, Maastricht and Nice. It is <Col N="943"/>realistic to expect us to grasp 5% of the document.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross mentioned our economic miracle and asked why the rest of Europe is faltering economically when Ireland is not. A measure of our success may be based on social partnership which has been of great benefit and allowed Ireland to continue to develop. Social partnership is very close to the ideals of the European Union. By 2007 social partnership will have existed for 20 years.</P>
      <P>Proinsias De Rossa, MEP, mentioned a coming of age and said that 45 years is like a passport. Armed with this passport and a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in the referendum on the European constitution, we will be truly citizens of Europe and entitled to be wherever we want to be.</P>
      <P>Brian Crowley and Gay Mitchell spoke about the size of the constitution and Mr. Mitchell proposed his interesting ideas. Mr. Crowley said that to bring the common defence policy into play in the early stages of the debate on the constitution somewhat muddies the waters. That debate can be postponed and everyone can voice their opinions later.</P>
      <P>My overriding concern is that there is a division in a large country such as France where even the might of President Chirac and the French Parliament find it difficult to sway the voters towards the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote. The Government in the Netherlands is having similar difficulty in advance of its referendum which will follow the French one. People are right to have their doubts but if all the facts are in the open and there is an open and honest debate there is no place for fear.</P>
      <P>The constitution was drawn up in an open and transparent way involving 200 public representatives from all the member states, as well as some bureaucrats and the Presidium. It is a miracle that a manageable solution was found, and we hope a similar miracle will happen and the constitution will be accepted.</P>
      <P>I am extremely worried that despite the good will here regarding anything European, the diffuse nature of the debate makes it easy for people to say they cannot and will not understand the constitution and dismiss it. I accept the point made by Ms Harkin, MEP, that every house should receive a copy of the constitution. They should also receive a copy of our own Constitution because Article 29.4 gives the lie to any talk about the European constitution obviating our Constitution.</P>
      <P>It is interesting for those of us listening to the Members of the European Parliament here today to learn how in some cases there is cross-party agreement on this matter. I denigrate nobody who holds a different opinion. How else could we manage a debate if we do not hear and deal with differing opinions?</P>
      <P>I thank all the Members of the European Parliament for coming here today.</P>

	<P>There is more honesty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I was wrong for a reason that was not a part of the debate, not because of economic issues but because of the cultural transformation of the country. This is evident in our sense of self-confidence and particularly our liberation from the neighbouring island. Our world view has expanded through the involvement of our public service and politicians in the European project. Nobody can dispute the values and principles that underlie this famous project.</P>
      <P>The most important of those values has been extraordinarily successful. Senator Maurice Hayes is probably the only person in this House who recalls what the world was like during the Second World War. I was recently in Africa, and the Africans, who are tiring of the Western world lecturing them about bloodshed, are quick to remind us of the scale of slaughter on a continent which sometimes strikes poses about its sense of superior civilisation. By comparison the scale of the slaughter in their countries was quite small, given their extra problems. The end of war between European countries is a significant achievement. War between France and Germany or between Great Britain and Germany is unthinkable now. That is a great achievement and it did not happen by accident.</P>
      <P>There are other areas, however, in which Europe has not lived up to its own ambitions. For example, I am unhappy about the economic values written into the Maastricht Treaty. They were profoundly liberal and to a degree inserted into the constitution a view of how the countries and the world should be organised which was characteristic of Thatcherism. Some of the strictures about stability are excessive, unnecessary and could well harm the European project.</P>
      <P>I have no problem with the expressed aspirations of the common foreign and security policy but I have problems with the way those aspirations are used. The high representative for the common foreign and security policy is extraordinarily determined to be secretive. If we are an open, democratic and accountable set of institutions at home and within the European project, there is no need for secrecy particularly in an institution which has no army, or covert operations abroad. This obsessive secrecy is worthy of serious consideration.</P>
      <P>I am profoundly unhappy with the involvement of the European Union in the Intel issue because <Col N="945"/>it appears to be rigidity gone mad. If we were diverting investment to Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has one minute remaining.</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>According to myself I have two minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has only one now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>You are the Cathaoirleach and on all things you are right. I am genuinely concerned about what I believe to be a movement which is operating on two sides of the political spectrum, in China and the United States, which is the decoupling of the market economy from democracy. There is an extraordinary experiment taking place in China in which it is developing a market economy within a non-democratic state. There is a degree to which the United States is also decoupling the concept of a free market from a properly functioning democracy. Europe should be the rallying point for the belief that a social market economy is successful, flexible and competitive within a genuinely functioning and operating democracy. The constitution is an albeit ambiguous, uncertain and unclear step in that direction.</P>
      <P>All arguments about national sovereignty are subordinated to the fact that we still have popular sovereignty which means, as Deputy Harkin, MEP, said that if we do not like it, if it is so wrong or repressive, we can always leave. So long as we can leave we will still have popular sovereignty. While national sovereignty in terms of economics is history, we still have popular sovereignty. If conditions in the EU become so awful we can withdraw from it, but we will not need to and we should, therefore, vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to this constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Mr. Eoin Ryan, MEP</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators and the Leader, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, in particular, for the invitation to MEPs to speak here on this important debate. The European Union treaty was agreed at a meeting of Heads of State in June 2004 which was the culmination of an extensive process. In 2001, EU Heads of Government set up a structure known as the EU Convention, which brought forward proposals for a new European Union treaty to the Heads of State meeting in Greece in 2003. It is important to emphasise this because in previous treaties on which we voted we were told by those who opposed them that they were not open and transparent. I congratulate the Irish members involved in this Convention &mdash; Deputy Carey, Proinsias De Rossa, MEP, John Bruton and Deputy Gormley &mdash; on all the work they did. Over 16 to 18 months they brought together many people, including the young, trade unions, civil society, national governments, national parliaments, European parliamentarians and groups representing many different areas of civic society, who had speaking <Col N="946"/>rights. They discussed this issue and put many ideas together. It is important to stress this because those who oppose the work of the Convention cannot in honesty say it was not a unique, open and transparent process worked out over a long period by many who put their own views forward.</P>
      <P>During the first six months of last year, under the Irish Presidency of the European Union, negotiations were intensified and the diplomatic skills of our key negotiatiors during this process must be recognised. The Taoiseach, as President of the EU Council of Ministers, used his extensive diplomatic skills to broker an agreement for a new EU treaty and achieved success, ably assisted by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, who was then Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, who was then Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with responsibility for European affairs.</P>
      <P>Securing agreement on a new EU treaty was a crowning achievement of the Government during its Presidency of the European Union. This was the Presidency that also oversaw the accession of ten new member states. One cannot underestimate the success of our Presidency. The work it did was extraordinary. Many said it could not be done but the Government did it and deserve our congratulations.</P>
      <P>We now live in a Union of 25 member states with 470 million people. The European Union is enlarging in size. Romania and Bulgaria are set to join in 2007 while the Union is embarking on an aggressive policy to ensure many of the countries in the Balkans can join.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to a point made by Senator Ross and referred to by the Leader. What will this do for Ireland? What is the future? We know what the Union has done in the past but what will it do in the future? Social partnership has helped us all. Senator Ross mentioned low inflation and low interest rates. One of the main benefits is that we have access to a market of 470 million people. That is extraordinary for a country of just over 4 million people. We have full economic access and we have made that pay for us.</P>
      <P>When the debate adjourned for lunch I opened some of our letters which contained a document stating that in 2005, the Irish workforce will reach 2 million, the economy will generate a projected 61,000 new jobs, there will be an 8.3% increase in demand for labour, 49% of companies have vacancies, 64% of companies are more likely to expand business, 75% of companies have difficulties in filling vacancies, 40% have expansion plans being hindered by recruitment difficulties and manufacturing redundancies will fall. If anybody wants an answer to my question I have just answered it. Can anybody honestly say we should not fully participate in the EU and have our feet under the table? If we want enlightened social policies we must have a vibrant economy. If we want to address social exclusion and have a <Col N="947"/>proper education system, proper schools, proper hospitals and a proper health care system we must have a vibrant economy. If we do not have a vibrant economy we will not have the money to do that. That is what Europe has done for us.</P>
      <P>We cannot ignore what Europe has delivered for us. As Proinsias De Rossa, MEP, said, it is not perfect. The constitution contains articles that I like as well as articles I dislike. It is a unique experiment. Never before in the history of the world have 25 nations come together. We are part of that process and we play a key role. We should continue to play such a role without prevaricating. I respect the views of others on the constitution, but they are not the same as mine.</P>
      <P>From an Irish perspective we had four main concerns entering into the Intergovernmental Conference process and they have been addressed. There is retention of unanimity with regard to all taxation matters. There is a maintenance of appropriate safeguards in the area of criminal law. Our traditional policy of military neutrality is fully protected and there is a maintenance of institutional balance, in particular, in regard to our representation in the EU Commission. Ireland has nothing to fear from this treaty but it is important for those of us who support it to fight a vigorous and determined campaign to ensure we ratify it because it represents a good deal for Ireland. It is also a good deal for the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Mr. Higgins, MEP</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with all sides in commending the Leader, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, and the House for the invitation to this important debate. Some 35 years ago, almost to the day, General de Gaulle expressed a dream and a wish that he wanted to see a united Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals. He was dismissed at the time as an old statesman, a dreamer, a misguided visionary. Who could blame people for being sceptical because of the situation at the time?</P>
      <P>All the eastern European states were locked in the icy grip of communism and of Moscow. The Berlin Wall was in place. There was military polarisation between the East and the West involving NATO on the one hand and the Warsaw Pact countries on the other. When any of the Warsaw Pact countries dared to step outside the defined boundaries of Moscow they were ruthlessly suppressed. Let us think, for example, of Hungary in 1956 when the Danube ran red with blood, of Czechoslovakia and the Dubcek revolt and when President Kennedy went to the Berlin Wall and said &ldquo;<i>Ich bin ein Berliner</i>&rdquo;. It was not an act of vision but an expression of solidarity with the beleaguered people of East Germany. How things have changed in the meantime. These new eastern democratic states, which are former members of the Warsaw Pact, are now sitting down with us in the European Parliament week in, week out. A number of weeks ago, the leader of the orange revolution, Victor Yushenko, visited the Parliament on behalf of his country, <Col N="948"/>Ukraine. He stated he was not tilting his hat towards Moscow but rather towards the European Union.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Bulgaria and Romania are now knocking at the door, talks on the accession of Turkey are ongoing and it is only a matter of time before Croatia becomes a member. We are participating in the most successful political and democratic exercise in the history of democracy, as has been stated on many occasions in this House.</P>
      <P>A new constitution is needed because the whole process of a constitution has grown up, Lego-like. The Treaty of Rome 1957 was followed by the Single European Act, the Maastrict treaty, as referred to by Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, the Amsterdam treaty in 1997, and the Nice treaties 1 and 2. What is required is a consolidated treaty to pull all the strands, principles, aims and values together into one document and what we are looking for is contained in this document.</P>
      <P>This document has been set down in the clearest possible terms. Although it enshrines the values of 25 countries, it is not a tome but rather a very concise document. Part 1 sets out the values, aims and principles. Part 2 is crucial and sets out the charter on fundamental rights. Part 3 sets out the policies and the actions. As Gay Mitchell, MEP, said when referring to Part 4 which deals with the new instruments and the changes, it allows for adaptations in the future.</P>
      <P>However, there is no point in having a fine product unless we can sell it and I am genuinely worried about the salesmanship involved. I have only one regret about today&rsquo;s debate, namely, that the Minister, Deputy Roche, was not in a position to give us a date for the referendum. We need a date so we can begin working on the campaign.</P>
      <P>Nothing I could say could pay adequate tribute to the Taoiseach for the manner in which he managed to do what the Italian Presidency did not do, to the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and to the then Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Roche. They did a magnificent job which demonstrated the capacity of Ireland to deal with tricky situations when other countries have failed. Getting agreement on the text of the document is one thing, selling it is another. It is essential to know the date because unless our campaign is vigorous and dynamic, I am fearful that the referendum will fall which would be a tragedy for Ireland and for Europe. This is a document that makes Europe more open, transparent and democratic, and that guarantees peace, prosperity and stability. We need to have the debate up and running immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome all our MEPs to the House. This debate is a manifestation of one of the most worthwhile aspects of Seanad reform on which I would like to compliment both the Leader and her colleagues.</P><Col N="949"/>
      <P>I wish to consider the constitutional treaty from a republican perspective. A united Ireland, like a united Germany, will only happen in a united Europe. A former French socialist Foreign Minister stated in Dublin recently that the treaty was a constitutional treaty between sovereign states, not a constitution for a federal state. Our membership of the European Union fulfils many of the dreams and aspirations of Irish Nationalists over four centuries.</P>
      <P>It was in 1627 that Owen Roe O&rsquo;Neill made a proposal for an Irish Republic under Spanish protection. Last week in the House we remembered the 260th anniversary of the battle of Fontenoy. I will quote the verses to which the Leader of the House referred:</P>
      <P LI="1">And Fontenoy, famed Fontenoy, had been a Waterloo, were not these exiles ready then, fresh, vehement and true.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Thomas Davis a century later said:</P>
      <P LI="1">Foreign alliances have ever stood among the pillars of national power. Again it is particularly needful for Ireland to have a foreign policy intimacy with the great powers who will guard us from English interference.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The leaders of the 1916 Rising needed for morale purposes to refer to gallant allies in Europe. The difference today is we live in a peaceful era and not a warlike one. We are able to have both a close British-Irish partnership and an equally important partnership with many European countries. This is a form of synthesis of history.</P>
      <P>The EU has enabled this Republic to flourish, to grow from having an income of less than two thirds of the EU average to the average and it is still on an upward trajectory. Full membership of the EU has enabled a relationship of better equality. It has helped us to vindicate the republican project in this part of Ireland, which has to be the basis of the republican project in any other part of Ireland. It pains me to hear any republican voice mouthing the mantras of Mrs. Thatcher at Bruges about a European superstate.</P>
      <P>Elementary Marxism will state that politics is based on economics. A superstate based on an income scarcely more than 1% of GDP is a complete absurdity. I am also surprised to see outside the House a former leading light of the Connolly Association who is now writing Eurosceptic documents for President Vaclav Klaus of the Czech Republic,  who is the leading disciple of Mrs. Thatcher in central Europe.</P>
      <P>There is talk of a European Foreign Minister but he or she will not have power on his or her own but only with the mandate of the member states. I see very little likelihood of a full-blown European defence in substitution of NATO. I do not think we either need or want to abandon our neutral traditions which are not incompatible with collective security under UN auspices on a regional basis. Who are we defending Europe against? One might say, terrorists, but if that is <Col N="950"/>the case, the solidarity clause is already provided for in this treaty.</P>
      <P>The EU is neither the ultra-liberal, Anglo-Saxon caricature nor the ultra-socialist one that is sometimes depicted for Britain. I was interested to read in today&rsquo;s newspapers of a eurozone being established in west Belfast. How that squares with the opposition of Sinn F&eacute;in to Ireland joining the euro I am not sure but it is a very welcome development. The one thing that is of interest to the Northern business community &mdash; which is made up of both traditions &mdash; is our greater ease and integration into Europe. The last thing we want is to align ourselves with a sort of Michael Howard party type policy on Europe.</P>
      <P>What is the advantage and attraction of such a policy if we are trying to persuade people of the greater attractions of a united Ireland? Opposition to a united Europe as represented in this constitution is damaging to the prospects of a united Ireland. A leading Sinn F&eacute;in person who is very well known, admitted to me recently that Sinn F&eacute;in policy on Europe had not been updated for 30 years. I appeal to Sinn F&eacute;in to rethink its opposition on the European project. We must realise that we must fight battles in Europe from within and not from without.</P>
      <P>All over central and eastern Europe can be seen the dynamic impact of the European project in widening democracy, human rights, peace and stability. I look forward to when de Gaulle&rsquo;s vision of a Europe stretching from the Atlantic to the Urals is realised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Listening to Senator Mansergh, I could not help observing how much more appropriate it would have been if the representative of Sinn F&eacute;in had been seated on the other side of the House along with Fianna F&aacute;il, the Republican Party, that spawned Sinn F&eacute;in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for reminding me that I am speaking about the European constitution. This afternoon represents an exercise very largely in historical blather. We have all this stuff about the war and so on. Does anybody suggest that if the treaty fails, which I believe is very likely, we would all be back to war again? I do not think so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The chief blatherer.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="951"/>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It seems as if that is going down a very dangerous and speculative road. We have also heard, probably correctly, that Europe will not interfere through its courts and through policy direction in what are regarded coyly in this country as moral matters and that Europe will not give central direction on issues like abortion, divorce, etc. While that is true, I point out that in the early days in a very undemocratic way a small unrepresentative group in this country got a protocol about abortion in an EU treaty without reference to either House of the Oireachtas or the people. That was not a particularly democratic move. I believe there is a democratic deficit, which I believe will continue under this new treaty. It has been acknowledged that a certain level of decision making is being removed from the people and transferred to the Oireachtas under these provisions.</P>
      <P>An esteemed former colleague, Mr. Crowley, MEP, is present. I was rather taken aback when I noticed that he and his party colleagues supported Mr. Buttiglioni. This refers to the European Union and I will say it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not agree. The Senator should speak on the European constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what I am doing. I am talking about the democratic deficit and I will continue to do so. Mr. Buttiglioni campaigned and voted on equality issues. I suggest to Mr. Crowley, MEP, that if he had campaigned and voted on the rights of people in wheelchairs in the same way he would have been very quick to get him off any committee that dealt with that area. However, I believe it is quite possible we will be let off the hook. Despite the superb work done in negotiating the treaty, for which I pay full tribute to the Taoiseach and the diplomatic staff involved, it looks very likely that France may vote down the treaty. According to the polls, the Netherlands, Poland, Denmark and Britain may do the same, in which case we would not face into a referendum here.</P>
      <P>I understand people have suggested that this treaty is only an exercise in consolidation. While that is very largely true &mdash; perhaps 95% true &mdash; I wish we had heard more from the Minister, Deputy Roche, and others about the 5% that is new. I have always been concerned about the incremental nature of these treaties and our involvement in processes that will disturb our neutrality, which I still cherish, such as our involvement with the Western European Union armament group.</P>
      <P>Other matters also concern me regarding negotiations from the Vatican. I have material from Catholics for a Free Choice. This does not represent a sectarian position. These are Catholics of conscience warning about the negotiations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>That is exactly what I am doing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am astonished that the Cathaoirleach could find that I am not. I am talking about the impact of lobbying on the constitution. I could not be more centrally directed or more focused. For the information of the Cathaoirleach, I am talking about paragraph 1 of section 52 of the treaty. Does that satisfy his requirements?</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>Probably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The church has acquired consultative status, which provides for the Catholic Church to be consulted in the pre-drafting stage of legislation when it is believed it would have an interest. People are right to feel concerned about the issue. I very much hope that this aspect at least will not be confirmed in the treaty.</P>
      <P>I am divided on the treaty. I was against earlier treaties because of their military aspect. However, the neo-conservative lobby is against this treaty because it fears a balance that a stronger Europe would give. The evil empire, which has sprung up under President Bush, violates every possible aspect of human rights and undermines democracy anywhere it springs up in its own backyard. While the Americans are quite happy to foster it in Russia&rsquo;s backyard, they do not like it anywhere near themselves. This worries me and it represents the best possible reason for having a strong European entity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Like my colleagues, I welcome our distinguished visitors to the House. I could not help but reflect on what Senator Norris had to say. When he talked about the blather of the war, I was thinking about all the homosexuals who were incarcerated in concentration camps. The treaty and the whole European Union project are about ensuring that such an event would never happen again.</P>
      <P>I did not defend anything Mr. Buttiglioni said. If anything was wrong about that affair it was the manner in which then European Parliament disgraced itself in the way in which it treated a man who had his own personal religious views. While we may talk about tolerance and equality, that <Col N="953"/>was an example of what can happen with the socio-liberal view that now seems so widespread in mainstream Europe.</P>

	<P>In the context of the European constitution and the purpose of the Union, which is about tolerance equality, and equity, that was an example of what can happen when somebody goes against the mainstream view. Voltaire was not too far wrong and perhaps Senator Norris might reflect on that matter also.</P>

	<P>This year is the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the European flag. It was adopted originally by the Council of Europe and was subsequently adopted as the European flag by the European Union. The person responsible for designing the flag was an Irish man, Gerard Slevin, the then Chief Herald of Ireland, in 1955.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>He was a Corkman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I said he was an Irishman. I presume Cork is part of Ireland. When the first referendum took place to allow entry into the EEC, I, along with my late father and my very much alive mother, was part of the 18% who voted against. I did so for a variety of reasons. The reasons put forward at the time are the same ones put forward by those opposed to the constitution. Senator Mansergh referred to parties needing to update their policies on Europe. I was wrong then and if I was wrong then I would be even more wrong today.</P>
      <P>The experience of the past 33 years has shown that membership of the European Union has been good for Ireland. Many shibboleths and fears existed then, which was only 40 years after the country had got partial independence. That fear is emulated to some degree and reflected in the attitude of many of the former Soviet states, which are fearful that they might be swapping one dictatorship in Moscow for another in Brussels. However, practically all the emerging states are now in favour of the European Union. I would be more inclined to take my lead from countries and from people who have suffered horrendously <Col N="954"/>after the falling of the Iron Curtain in 1945 than I would from those who are comfortable and living in a somewhat luxurious environment on the western periphery of Europe and never had to face up to those realities.</P>
      <P>Representing this Parliament, I was privileged to have been part of the debate on the charter on fundamental rights. Part I of the treaty, with the incorporation of that charter, has enshrined equality and human rights to an extraordinary degree. That is what the European Union has always been about. I fail to understand those who, when they use rhetoric against ratification of the treaty, refer to such matters as the improvement of equality and human rights. Surely the whole <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre </i>of the European Union is the protection of human rights. The Minister, Deputy Roche, referred to the European Court and quite rightly lauded that it would now become part of the wider European ideal in the context of the adoption of the treaty. There is a backlog of 80,000 cases, and this week the Council of Europe, meeting at a summit in Poland, heard a speech from the Taoiseach in which he called for reform of the European Court of Human Rights. I applaud that, since I believe that our colleagues in the European Parliament should work towards greater reform. It is obviously a popular concept with European citizens if 80,000 of them feel the European Court of Human Rights is the best place to secure redress.</P>
      <P>We all applaud the role of national parliaments, particularly the six-week window, and the fact that, if there is a consensus among a minimum number of states, the &ldquo;yellow card&rdquo; can be introduced regarding Commission proposals. That is a very real advance. There is a challenge for this Government and the Houses of the Oireachtas. There is not much point in granting the power to scrutinise European Union legislation if the House committees do not have the resources to do so effectively and properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>If there is a challenge at all in the context of this European treaty debate, from the point of view of a parliamentarian and a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, and with other colleagues on House committees who have been subjected to the scrutiny process so far, I can say that it is deeply flawed. I do not know who is responsible for the dispersal of funds, whether it be the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission or the Government of the day. However, we will be tilting at windmills if we seriously think we are addressing scrutiny while operating under the current system in the Oireachtas. That is my main point in the context of the drive towards adoption of the treaty.</P>
      <P>In the context of foreign policy, there is a triple lock. I am not totally in favour of it, as Macedonia constituted a peacekeeping effort in which Ireland was unable to take part because the Chinese vetoed a UN resolution owing to <Col N="955"/>Macedonia&rsquo;s recognition of Taiwan. That is where the triple lock is flawed. I do not believe that it will change in the short term, but the issue needs to be addressed in the medium to long term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Like other colleagues, I have no great enthusiasm for the constitution but no great difficulty with it either. The Labour Party has long since recanted its mistake in 1972 of opposing membership of the EEC &mdash; or at least most of us. From our political perspective, this comes from one simple realisation, namely, that capital is organised multinationally. To ensure one has proper standards of social provision, decent environmental standards and so on, one must operate on the basis of co-operation between nations at the very least. If there were no other reason, that would be sufficient for the Labour Party and the Social Democrats throughout Europe to support the European project generally.</P>
      <P>Personally, I would have liked to see something much more radical in the constitution. It should have gone a good deal further. I would like to have seen much more common foreign policy, including defence. We should be looking to establish structures from which a federal Europe can in time develop. However, it is far from that. What we have is very much a compromise that should, on the face of it, provide little difficulty for anyone.</P>
      <P>In the few minutes available to me, I wish to address an issue that I have not yet heard debated today. I suppose it may scare many of us off, and perhaps that is right. I speak of the elephant in the room, perhaps the biggest reason so many people in France, the Netherlands and Denmark may vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;, namely, immigration.</P>
      <P>In a sense, we are joining this debate at a very late stage. Our experience thus far has been unique. We have relatively transient immigrant communities. We do not know how long they will stay, but by and large they do not stay very long. We have not had the experience of Britain, France, Austria, the Netherlands or Germany. Large sections of major cities such as London, Paris and Berlin are occupied mainly by people who may very well not want to be there, who speak a different language from the host nation, have a different culture, and are frequently not welcomed.</P>
      <P>We must get our heads around this issue. I am not suggesting there is a clear or obvious division between those who argue for a multicultural society and those who wish to argue for integration. It is not that clear-cut. No one is suggesting that people who come intending to stay, bring up their children and die here should leave every element of their culture at home &mdash; far from it. Nor are we saying to people &mdash; I certainly am not &mdash; that they should come and take part of our city or country and make it like part of their own.</P><Col N="956"/>
      <P>We should be saying to immigrant communities that they should come and live among us, find out about us and our history, learn our language and know our culture, taking from it and giving to their children what they will. By all means, they should retain and practise their own culture too. However, we must make it clear that we want people to integrate and take of our Irishness, becoming Irish in a sense themselves. They should not turn their backs on their own country, culture, background and history but make theirs part of ours too. This is not relevant to tomorrow, next year or the year after, but it may very well be relevant in 20 years. It will be relevant if, in 25 years, we have a new generation of Irish people whose parents were not born here. It is high time we had that debate, since this issue is charged. It brings out emotions that for many can be quite raw. However, the worst thing we could do would be to ignore it, pretend there is no issue and that we do not in some way feel uncomfortable when we see something so dramatically different from our culture and way of life on our streets. We cannot pretend that we can integrate without making the effort of understanding and educating nor can we ask others to integrate without encouraging or assisting them to understand our culture and history. That is the primary point I wanted to make today.</P>
      <P>I support the constitution. Professor Richard Sinnott of UCD recently produced a study at the Joint Committee on European Affairs in which he showed that the various referenda we have had over the years on European issues have been no more than one referendum held every four years about the same issue, which is essentially a barometer of public opinion about &ldquo;Europe&rdquo;. Asking the people about Maastricht did not get a response on the single currency. People who voted on Nice II did not know a great deal more than when they voted differently a few years earlier on Nice I. In essence, all one is asking people at any given time is how they feel about Europe. Perhaps this is not politically correct, but we must ask ourselves whether this is a sensible way to run the Union.</P>
      <P>If we have a net question about which people are really concerned, such as participation in military alliances, by all means let us go to them with it, but we cannot go to them, assuming the constitution is passed &mdash; a big &ldquo;if&rdquo;&mdash; with each and every amendment. To do so is to court trouble and, frankly, does not increase our understanding of the European Union or add a great deal to our democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon"><NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe that if this constitutional treaty were called by another name, such as the EU Treaty or the Treaty of Paris or Dublin, it would not generate the same degree of negative comment. The very word &ldquo;constitution&rdquo; conjures up images of a superstate, a supranational parliament, and even of an empire, yet the process of drawing up this treaty was more participative, deliberative, open and transparent than any pre<Col N="957"/>vious treaty-making exercise in Europe. This is a value map to guide and determine the substance of the Union&rsquo;s action. Ultimately, the translation of these values and objectives into policy depends on sincere, committed and considered leadership, as well as political will. The treaty enhances the Union&rsquo;s capacity to act, while providing considerable gains in democracy and transparency, filling many of the lacunae identified in earlier treaties. It provides a flexible constitutional framework, which will enable the EU to meet its internal and external challenges in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>If this treaty is ratified, it will come into force on 1 November 2006, or on the first day of the second month after the last member state deposits its ratification. There is a provision to amend the treaty, but it is recommended as a permanent roadmap for the future of the EU. Whether the EU citizens share the vision of Schuman and the founding fathers will depend on debate and the political will of any given time. What we are doing today is a useful exercise as it is our job to encourage debate in a free and open way. This endeavour is not just to operate a set of rules and regulations &mdash; it is much more than that. It is a pathway to peace and an absence of war. Europe has been without this major war for a long time. War means death, pain, injustice, famine, disease and pestilence. Most of all it means hatred that goes on for generations. When the wounds are healed and the hatreds have stopped, we forget what happened.</P>
      <P>I suggest that people who do not intend voting for this treaty take a trip to Auschwitz and Belsen and other camps, where millions of people were put to death simply because they were Jews, homosexuals or gypsies. Let me remind the House what happened in the very first week that the Nazis entered Russia. They destroyed 1,000 aeroplanes and 5,000 tanks, but they killed 1 million men. The Russians themselves lost more than 28 million people in the war. They were no saints either and in one go they killed 10,000 Polish officers.</P>
      <P>Why do we need all of this? We have a roadmap and something that will enable us to stay with this peaceful process.  In that sense this is more than just a treaty. It is not just a constitution as it gives an opportunity for 25 nation states and 425 million people to keep the peace in Europe. That is the basis of all of this. The absence of peace is too horrific to imagine. We might say that it could not happen again, but we did not know the atrocities Pol Pot, Idi Amin or Hitler would commit. These things happen throughout history. We have a pathway to peace and I urge all peoples to walk this path, to ratify the constitution and to establish a Union where people can live, work and hope in a democratic community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Ms Doyle, MEP</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leader for inviting us here today and for her hospitality. I also thank the Irish Presidency of last year for a job very well done. This constitutional treaty, which is like a second Treaty of Rome, was signed last <Col N="958"/>October. The Single European Act in 1986 set the stage for an ever closer Union, which was envisaged by the signatories of the first Treaty of Rome in 1957. This was followed by the treaties of Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice, paving the way for the enlargement of Europe that we have today.</P>
      <P>Since our accession to the EEC in 1973, we have undergone profound social and economic changes. Any independent analysis of the impact of the European project on Ireland will show we have prospered economically. We have become a confident and psychologically independent nation only since we joined Europe and were weaned off our dependence on Britain, which still continues to be a very important trading partner. In 1973, the UK absorbed 75% of our exports yet 30 years and a single market later, we now send approximately 25% of our produce there. Britain is still an important trading partner, but in a completely different proportion. Access to the European market has arguably been the single most important factor in our economic growth and in our attitudinal development as a psychologically independent nation. In areas where member states have seen fit to co-operate on a European level, we have also seen the benefits of membership of this unique European community of nations. In social and environmental policy, as well as justice and home affairs, we have seen the direct benefits of membership of Europe in all our daily lives.</P>
      <P>However, these achievements do not take account of the original and most important impetus underpinning European integration. That is the determination never to allow a repeat of the great slaughters of the last century which wiped out over 60 million European men, women and children in the trenches of disease and of hunger. Peace and stability are the cornerstones of this European project. From six original members, the Union now has 25, soon to be 27 with the signing of an accession treaty by Bulgaria and Romania only last month.</P>
      <P>One of the greatest emotional scares is to claim that this treaty will push us into a superstate. Can I try to help others to put that to rest? Those fears are totally unfounded. I would never promote a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote for a constitutional treaty that would begin to produce a superstate as its end product. It is not a superstate because there are no rights to raise taxes autonomously, no right to run a budget deficit as any state can, no right to raise a military force, no right to act outside the competences given to it by the member states, and no right to spend more than 1% of the combined gross national income of all member states. National governments spend approximately 40% of gross national income and we are proposing a body that will have access to slightly more than 1% of gross national income. It is not a superstate because it has no right to dictate whether a member state can leave. The treaty provides an exit clause for member states to withdraw and for the first time, member states can exit if they so <Col N="959"/>wish. This is decidedly not a federal measure. Conversely, there will be no tolerance for rogue states within the Union. Should any member state consistently violate EU values, it will be possible to eject them from Europe in extreme cases.</P>
      <P>Co-decision between the Council and the Parliament with qualified majority voting &mdash; where 55% of member states represent 65% of European citizens &mdash; will be extended under the constitutional treaty. This is the most democratic decision making process and is necessary to achieve consensus in an enlarged Europe. Far from undermining sovereignty, this reinforces democratic accountability by conferring powers on the directly elected European Parliament and not just on the Council of Ministers. A third guarantee of sovereignty is the involvement of national parliaments. The revelation of what goes on behind closed doors in the Council of Ministers is also a very important part in creating transparency.</P>
      <P>There have been many scaremongers on defence issues. There was a recent statement by Sinn F&eacute;in that the ratification of the constitution will result in increased spending on weaponry and increased militarisation. I will not go into the glaring hypocrisy of such a statement, but it is factually incorrect. Defence remains entirely a national issue, with all member states retaining full power to decide how they wish to be involved. Ireland&rsquo;s triple lock will not be compromised by this treaty, although I agree with the reservations of Senator Mooney and we should be ashamed of the Macedonian example. I agree with the views of Gay Mitchell on neutrality, but the treaty itself does not purport to change our so-called position on neutrality. Due to the difficulty in explaining exactly what the treaty does, we must careful in how we enter this debate.</P>
      <P>Europe has reached a threshold which it must cross. Several decades of building Europe have resulted in a proliferation of treaties that can no longer be understood or accessed easily by citizens. Decisions are not made in the constitutional treaty but it facilitates EU governments and elected representatives to make informed decisions for which they must be accountable to EU citizens and social partners. The treaty does not take away any rights we already enjoy as Irish citizens but provides additional safeguards to protect our individual freedoms. Most important, the treaty lets us know our rights and responsibilities. It will not supersede the Irish Constitution which will continue to be the basic legal document of the State. It will provide the framework rather than the content of EU policy which will continue to be decided by policy makers at national level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the MEPs and thank them for their attendance at this crucial debate. Ireland has played a role at the heart of Europe&rsquo;s affairs for more than 50 years and the EU has benefitted from that role. We should not tamper lightly with this relationship and must ensure there is informed and debated decision making. I welcome the contributions of other Members and guests which expand on several provisions of the proposed constitution.</P>
      <P>However, I wish to focus on one issue, namely, the question of where power lies. For Irish people, EU affairs and referenda are often a question of whether we are ceding too much authority to the Union. Although referenda procedures and protocols generally deal with more specific topics, the debate is often reduced to this issue. The reasons for this concentration on what some might see as a minor issue are numerous. For many Irish people, this is a fundamental matter. As a nation we retain the memory of a struggle for independence and subsequent development on the international stage. We are in the main strongly attached to our Constitution, institutions and system of administration.</P>
      <P>Each of us, whether representatives of the Oireachtas or the EU, must be able to counter the claims, whether rational or otherwise, that the new constitution means giving up too much power to Brussels and that it will replace our own Constitution. We must refute the notion that a ratification of the EU constitution means Ireland will no longer decide how its own people want to live. To this end, there must be an emphasis on what the proposed EU constitution does and does not do.</P>
      <P>Three issues are crucial in this regard. First, people should be reminded that constitutions exist to limit the power of the state or the EU to encroach on citizens&rsquo; rights. Second, we must inform citizens that the proposed constitution affirms that the Union is a subsidiary to member states. The EU may act only in those areas where the objectives of the intended action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states but can rather be better achieved at Union level. The constitution establishes the principle that the Union derives its power from its member states. It does not represent the ceding of more power but rather prevents the Union from encroaching on the rights of member states other than in those areas in which they have been voluntarily ceded.</P>
      <P>Third, citizens are concerned about the EU having, for the first time, a legal personality under the proposed constitution. This concern is heightened by the statements of some parties that EU laws will trump all those of national Parliaments including the Oireachtas. Particular reference is made to the statement, &ldquo;The constitution and law adopted by the Union&rsquo;s institutions in exercising competences conferred on it shall have primacy over the law of the member states&rdquo;. Citizens must be reassured that this provision merely conforms the <i>status quo</i>. If the EU is allowed to legislate in the area of policy, its laws will overtake any <Col N="961"/>national laws but only where we have allowed it to do so. In areas where the EU does not legislate, Irish law prevails. This has always been the case and we must ensure it remains so. There will be some who try to confuse and frustrate on this matter and we have a duty to inform and explain so that scaremongering and lies do not gain status in this important debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the MEPs and thank the Leader for allowing this debate. Like other speakers, I commend the website of the Department of Foreign Affairs which gives clear, comprehensive and positive information on the constitution. A good deal of commentary tends to focus on what is not in the constitution. For example, we are frequently reminded that there will be no EU army and no conscription. The Department&rsquo;s website mentions the launch by the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, of a book, <i>The European Constitution Uncensored</i>, at the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology in Galway. The website observes that this book describes the constitution as the most democratic document ever produced in the long history of Europe. This is an important point.</P>
      <P>The simplification of procedures is clearly set out in the constitution in regard, for example, to the role of national parliaments and the EU Parliament and that EU laws must be made in public. We must bear one issue in mind. Most of us assumed the Nice treaty was concerned with a simple case of enlarging the Union. However, that treaty was initially rejected by the public and we cannot take an acceptance of the constitutional treaty for granted.</P>
      <P>We must acknowledge public concern about the many EU directives coming on board that we will not have an opportunity to discuss adequately. For instance, that restrictions have been placed on the cutting of turf is an important issue in the west and midlands. People often wonder if we are conserving the peat for all of Europe. I understand the need for the directive but I do not comprehend why people who stopped cutting in 1999 do not get paid the same rate as those who stopped in 2004. This is just one practical example of the issues with regard to directives.</P>
      <P>In the last few days I have received much correspondence about EU directives on recycling of electrical waste. Recycling is important and we are all in favour of it. However, many electrical retailers argue that it should be the producer who is obliged to deal with such waste. There are many issues such as this which we must explain clearly. From our experience of the first referendum on the Nice treaty, we cannot take it for granted that the constitution will be ratified. Information must be provided and explained clearly so that we can engage properly with the public in this debate.</P>

I commend the Leader and the Seanad for taking the initiative in holding this debate. I hope it will resonate across villages and towns throughout the State. On the next occasion that we meet, I hope each of the 16 MEPs elected in Ireland will have the opportunity to participate in this debate. Referenda on the constitutional treaty will take place both North and South, which means that for the first time, all voters in Ireland will be asked to give their verdict on European matters. In light of that, it is important that the debate and consideration is all-Ireland in nature.</P>
      <P>The debate is not about whether we are pro-European or anti-European. There is no question of whether Ireland is European because it is an ancient European nation. That is taken as a given. The debate is about the nature of the EU as a political project. Previous speakers have correctly identified that this project is a unique one and, in many respects, experimental. It is a project that must be closely attached and in line with popular wishes and demands. It is only in this way that it can command the level of interest and support that speakers wish it to have.</P>
      <P>The constitution brings us to a fork in the road. Despite what the Minister said earlier, another Europe is possible. I believe that a popular will exists to amend, change and, in some cases, transform the direction in which the European Union is currently set. A desire exists among sections of the political elite to establish a <i>de facto</i> federal Europe. I do not express the countervailing view with the intention of being awkward or irritating Members of this Chamber but because I do not believe that such a European Union would be in the best interests of people in Ireland or other jurisdictions.</P>
      <P>Earlier this week, Sinn F&eacute;in outlined its position and expressed its determination to campaign for a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in this referendum. The reasons for this relate to democracy, the militarisation of the EU and matters of economic policy. My colleague, Mr. Crowley, MEP, is correct to say these issues are old chestnuts which were of concern 30 years ago. I remind Members they are of equal concern today.</P>
      <P>The Laeken declaration told us that the Convention would consider how to address the democratic deficit. It is accepted that a democratic malaise lies at the heart of the European Union. The Convention was to solve this problem but has failed to do so. Today, there has been discussion in this Chamber about an enhanced role for national Parliaments. While increased information flow will undoubtedly result if this constitution is passed, no national parliament is given real teeth in terms of intervening in Commission proposals. The Commission is not bound to withdraw or amend a proposal should national Parliaments exercise a yellow card. We have been told about the citizens&rsquo; initiative, where 1 million citizens of a number of member states can put matters on the agenda. This is a sop, as is all the fine rhetoric on subsidiarity. The constitution has <Col N="963"/>chosen to overlook solutions to the democratic deficit. If it is passed, it will do nothing to remedy the democratic malaise at the heart of the European Union.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I have been criticised for scaremongering on the issue of militarisation but have done nothing of the sort. The constitution includes a special place for NATO. A UN mandate is not required for European operations. A provision exists for a European armaments agency. I remind Ms Doyle, MEP, that a requirement is placed on member states to increase military capabilities. This, to my logic, suggests an increase in military spending.</P>
      <P>I reject the suggestion that the economic dogma which is currently at the heart of the EU project should be set in a constitutional text. It is unprecedented and inappropriate. I concur with other speakers in asking the Government to bring forward, as speedily as possible, the referendum Bill and ask for the early announcement of a date for the referendum. In conclusion, I ask that people respect different views.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope to refute the negative arguments of my colleague, Ms McDonald, MEP. In seven countries, the European constitution has already been ratified by referendum or in Parliament. The suggestion today is that many countries will reject the constitution. If Ireland is to retain its standard of living and ensure international investment, it is critical that it remains at the heart of Europe. Common sense dictates that we vote yes. The Government has maintained pressure on Europe to allow us to retain the 12.5% corporation tax. We are entitled to this tax, which is one of the secrets of our success. I am pragmatic about the European Union. Quality of life for Irish people will be maintained through a positive vote.</P>
      <P>I wish to discuss current events in France. Two weeks ago, Mr. Nicolas Sarkozy, president of the UMP and a prospective presidential candidate in 2007, implored young French people to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; for Europe. He told them not to allow the negative attitude of French people to their sluggish economy and high level of unemployment to get in the way of voting for Europe. I do not need to repeat earlier arguments about the positive aspects of Europe. Mr. Sarkozy, who is 50 years of age, said that it was the first time a person of his age was not called up to fight in a war. This is all about Europe and its foundation of peace.</P>
      <P>While I studied for my leaving certificate in 1962, I was inundated with Government missives <Col N="964"/>on Europe and held discussions on topics such as bunt&aacute;ist&iacute; agus m&iacute;bhunt&aacute;ist&iacute; an ch&oacute;mhargadh. It is clear that Europe has been good for Ireland. Women, including myself in 1969, had to leave their jobs in the Civil Service after marriage until a European directive in 1973 ended this requirement. The charter of human rights will bring greater equality to women in Ireland.</P>

	<P>Senator Ross asked if the economic situation in some member states was as a result of the Union. In 1989 West Germany welcomed East Germany and the ostmark and, unfortunately, made the economic mistake of giving it the same value as the deutschemark. I visited East Germany twice after the Berlin Wall came down and saw the dilapidated state of East German industry. I congratulate the former Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, on reunifying Germany but it is still paying the price. France has sluggish, traditionalist and uncompetitive industry. It has a 35-hour working week and<?oasys _jy?>Nicolas Sarkozy said that was the reason it had high unemployment.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Leader for arranging this debate which is much more exciting than the one we had on the Nice Treaty last year.

	<P>It is an honour to speak in the Seanad for the first time. I congratulate those responsible for this debate and hope it is not the last time we have a long discussion on the Constitution for Europe before the people are asked to make a choice.</P>
      <P>Senator Brendan Ryan said he voted against Ireland joining the European Union in 1972. I was born in 1972 and have never known anything other than membership of what has developed into the current European Union. As a result, I am part of a relatively young generation of people in Ireland who are confident, ambitious, who have fewer hang-ups about our closest neighbour than perhaps many previous generations and who are perhaps spokespersons for a more independent and sovereign Ireland than has ever existed in the past thanks, in part, to membership of the European Union.</P>
      <P>Last week I attended an extraordinary debate in the European Parliament and listened to Members speak on the anniversary of the Second World War. What it signified for me was the difference in meaning of the European Union to the different countries. If one asks an Irish person what the European Union means to him or her, he or she will probably say it means sources of funding to build roads, tunnels and infrastructure, support systems for farmers, difficulties for fisheries and so on. If one asks a German what the European Union means to him or her, he or she will say it means peace and probably stability. The emotive contributions, particularly from the German leaders of the various groups in the European Parliament, were an example of how important is the European project to countries that are still at the heart of Europe. It was a timely reminder for many of the countries which joined later on and which were perhaps not involved in the two world wars to the same extent as many other European countries.</P>
      <P>I turn to the constitution for Europe, the purpose of this debate. In simple terms, there are two strong benefits to this constitutional treaty. The biggest plus is that it is a simplification of what have been a series of incredibly complex treaties, although it will not win any awards for prose.</P>

    <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa, MEP</NameTxt>
	<P>The preamble is not bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Mr. Coveney, MEP</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes. If one compares it to previous treaty documents, including the Nice Treaty and others, for which one would need a parliamentary draftsperson to explain what one was reading, then one can see the simplification and positive progress made in trying to address the democratic deficit, to which previous speakers referred. When one is canvassing, one can knock on a door and say to a person that it will take him or her a bit of time but if he or she reads this document or sections of it, he or she will have a good understanding of how the European Union works.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross might like to note that the constitution in a way represents a business plan for the European Union and how it works. It sets out the responsibilities of countries, governments, the Commission and the Council and the rights citizens have as members of this huge international club, which is unique in its set-up but that has been such a remarkable success in terms of guaranteeing peace and stability. That has been the essence of what has driven Europe&rsquo;s economy forward over the past 60 years.</P>
      <P>I wish to address some of the concerns raised because many of the things I was going to say have been outlined by other speakers and I do not wish to be repetitive. I would like to respond to the arguments made in support of a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in the upcoming referendum. There is concern in regard to future democracy in Europe, that there is a democratic deficit in the European Union at present and that constitution for Europe does nothing to remedy that. This debate is happening as a result of the constitutional treaty and it is the start of what I believe will be a very open, democratic and frank discussion which will involve the public between now and when we go to the polls. The process under which the constitution for Europe was put together was perhaps the greatest example of democratic involvement in the compilation of any EU treaty.</P>
      <P>With regard to militarisation, there is a reference in the constitution for Europe to security and defence in the European Union. Let us not deny that. Primarily, any militarisation linked to this constitution or the European Parliament specifically deals with peace keeping or peace enforcement issues or in trying to provide stability in countries torn apart by war. When one votes &ldquo;No&rdquo; here, that is what one is voting against. Ireland is not obliged to participate if it does not so wish. However, does anyone seriously suggest that the political, economic and fiscal power of the European Union should not be used for peacekeeping purposes across the world in the future?</P>
      <P>In the future, the European Union will be one of, if not the most influential blocs in the world. It is growing year by year and will have 500 million people as citizens after 2007, when Bulgaria and Romania join. Are we suggesting that we play no <Col N="967"/>role in sending European troops to parts of the world that desperately need intervention such as the Congo, Uganda or Darfur? Will we permit people to be slaughtered and then complain that the Americans did not intervene or that the UN Security Council could not get its act together?</P>
      <P>The European Union has a responsibility to its member states and population and also to those outside of the Union. That is a new element to its purpose. To date, the Union&rsquo;s purpose has primarily concerned peace and stability for its member states. The future for the European Union will see a continuation of that peace and stability. However, there will also be an attempt to spread the value system outlined in this constitution to other parts of the world, along with the kind of stability now guaranteed to us, following centuries of war.</P>
      <P>One way we can do this is by deploying EU troops. I hope that Ireland will contribute to this effort, but it is a decision for the Irish people and will not be forced by this constitution. However, if someone states that militarisation within the European Union is a reason to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;, that person is stating that we should not participate in peacekeeping missions as part of the enormous wealthy bloc of counties that make up the Union.</P>
      <P>The European Union comprises a group of countries which is not moving towards a federation. This is now more or less universally agreed within the European Parliament and individual member states. However, its<i> raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> changes from year to year, which is why the treaties must be updated from time to time. The new elements, which constitute just 5% of the document, aim to update the Union so that it can be run more efficiently and to ensure it is not criticised in five or ten years&rsquo; time for still being inefficient and overly bureaucratic. Practical measures are being taken, but the primary value of this treaty is in setting out the European Union&rsquo;s value system and purpose.</P>

N&iacute; hamh&aacute;in an rud a bh&iacute; scr&iacute;ofa ann ach an c&uacute;lra a bhaineann leis agus na f&eacute;idearthachta&iacute; at&aacute; taobh istigh den mh&iacute;ni&uacute; sin freisin. Ghabhaim bu&iacute;ochas le feisir&iacute; na hEorpa a th&aacute;inig isteach chugainn anseo agus a dtuairim&iacute; a nochtadh duinn. T&aacute; s&eacute; sin thar a bheith t&aacute;bhachtach.</P>
      <P>I am almost overawed by the passion and virtual unanimity that exists in the House on this subject. In the years since I first entered the Seanad, the diversity of opinions which are expressed here has greatly appealed to me. The Leader referred to this aspect to some extent when she spoke of having tolerance for another opinion and indeed not only having tolerance for it, but also endeavouring through debate to har<Col N="968"/>monise different views. The debate which will take place in this House will differ from the debate which will take place outside. Much will depend on the manner in which the media act, whereas a certain discipline and order exists in the House, in terms of both time and presentation.</P>
      <P>I can empathise with Senator Brendan Ryan in his reminiscences about 1972, because to an extent, I found myself in the same position. I shared a platform with Matt Merrigan, a very highly respected trade unionist and a local socialist in Cashel named Packie Lahey, neither of whom are with us any longer. Undoubtedly, they are listening with great interest to the debate. However, I am not as apologetic for my role in the 1970s as Senator Ryan may have been. Admittedly, he may not be apologetic because he usually stands by his opinions very strongly. The reason I am not apologetic is because I did not see my position as being in opposition to our entry into Europe, but in the context of generating a discussion.</P>
      <P>This is also vital in this case. How do we transmit the passion and unanimity expressed by Members outside of the House? Even if a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote is secured, there will be some negativity if we do not succeed in ensuring that the people feel ownership of what is happening. The key issue is not the actual vote or the acceptance of the constitution of Europe. Rather it is that in the future, when we encounter challenges, we must be able to tell people that they understood fully what they entered into. This struck home to me today when Senator Kitt raised the issue of turf cutting. While it might be regarded as a mundane issue in the middle of a highfalutin philosophical discussion, those Members with access to or interaction with the west and other parts of the country, including my own, knew the importance of the issue. Therefore, while it is important to have an overview and an ideological approach, we must also look at other issues.</P>
      <P>I probably take a different standpoint from most other speakers in that I compliment Sinn F&eacute;in, not for what it states, but for providing a focus for the debate. It took some courage for Ms McDonald, MEP, to express her views in this House in a climate of virtual unanimity. While we will be obliged to get behind the rhetoric and weigh each point of view when the time comes, if people do not provide a focus for debate, even if it is the opposite to what we believe, from where will the passion come to bring people out to vote?</P>
      <P>Unless I am mistaken, a by-election was held in Dublin which attracted a turnout of less than 30%. This is worrying and I have examined British statistics regarding voting patterns which demonstrate how, over the years, fewer and fewer people appear to be turning out to vote. The only way to ensure there will be a big turnout in the vote is by ensuring that a fully-fledged debate takes place now.</P>
      <P>Was Europe good for Ireland? Of course it was. Ireland was also good for Europe. Ireland is <Col N="969"/>an old European nation. We were European before the European Union existed. Interaction from this country took place under many headings. I am not just speaking of missionary activity but also about people who helped to develop legislatures, who interacted on education and so on. All the members are aware of this. We are the old Europeans.</P>
      <P>In a way, this raises a point made, I believe, by Senator Brendan Ryan. I can still remember the debate over Iraq when Europe was being chastened because it was &ldquo;old Europe&rdquo;. I was totally opposed to the war in Iraq. I stated as much in this House and the reason I did so was that I believed it to be illegal. I also believed it was immoral and unjust. I am particularly worried about some of the developments, in a military sense, currently emanating from America. We need to have a situation in Europe whereby we can stand up for ourselves when the time comes and not be lectured about democracy, rights and providing back-up support. We should not be rushed into situations.</P>
      <P>One thing to have emerged from the debate on the major issues today is how well-represented we are in Europe by our Members. It came across in this House more strongly than it has ever done in the European Parliament. One of the reasons for that is because it is so far removed from us. I hope that in whatever work or reform is carried out on the Seanad we will continue as before because we have proved that we can match any nation in Europe through the calibre of our representatives. Economically, we are the envy of Europe. I hope that in the context of defending our sovereignty and particularly our cultural identity, as years go by we will be able to say that as well.</P>

	<P>This has been a fascinating debate and I congratulate the Leader of the House for her imagination in initiating it. I am also very pleased that Senator Maurice Hayes is present here today because he has put so much work into the Forum on Europe, at which I had the pleasure of being a delegate. The views expressed here today have been almost unanimously in favour of promoting a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in this proposed referendum and I am also in favour of a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary to think the EU, which has been a most benign institution, should suddenly be governed by a malign constitution. I cannot see such a scenario happening. The promotion of the idea that people are looking for a federal Europe is mistaken. Any democratic deficit that occurs could be because we have not inspired sufficient people within the various member states to take an interest in EU affairs.</P><Col N="970"/>
      <P>The economic, social and cultural success of the EU has been spoken about at great length and I agree with all those who said it was extraordinarily important for Irish women. Women&rsquo;s rights in Ireland were very modest when Ireland joined the EEC in 1973. Without the rights which were established through our membership of the EU, Irish women would not have made the progress that they did.</P>
      <P>The European constitution could go further, particularly in the areas of health, education and research. Under the Lisbon Agenda, Europe is setting itself up as a prime location for research. Co-operation could possibly have been emphasised more within the various chapters. While the right to health care is enshrined, public health is promoted and the sharing of research is stressed, more rights could have been given to individuals across all of Europe, rather than treating them on a country-by-country basis. I know that improvements have been made for people who have residency in countries and people living in border areas but it could have gone much further. I am a great promoter of the Bologna process whereby third level education, mobility and establishment of degrees and third level diplomas are brought forward. However, I would have liked to have seen more developments in this area.</P>
      <P>We should not worry about the military situation. In the wake of the tenth anniversary of the terrible massacre at Srebenica, how can any of us feel anything other than dismayed that Europe was not in a position to do more than it did? I am far more concerned about US soldiers travelling through Shannon Airport to fight in an illegal war in Iraq and the possibility that prisoners are being covertly taken through the airport as well.</P>
      <P>We should not be too sanguine about the fact that many other people will vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; in referenda on the constitution before we must vote. I travelled through France the other day and saw a sign which stated &ldquo;Vote no to Tony Blair&rsquo;s Europe&rdquo;. If there is as much confusion in France about that, I would be very careful about what they are saying about opinion polls there.</P>

	<P>On my first visit to the European Parliament many years ago, I met a Member of the Parliament from a town in Germany which was just across the border from Strasbourg. I asked him whether the European Parliament was anything more than a talking shop. He asked me to wait so he could introduce me to a French colleague and then told me that their fathers had literally been shooting at each other across a local river during the Second World War. The image was so important that it never left me because the EU guarantees peace within its borders. The point made by Simon Coveney, MEP, is correct. How can we justify standing back and doing nothing when faced with conflicts? Have we not been reared to believe that evil will triumph if good people do nothing?</P><Col N="971"/>
      <P>The EU has benefited us culturally and guaranteed our identity. However, it has not benefited us in other areas such as fishing rights agus is m&oacute;r an n&aacute;ire d&uacute;inn n&aacute;r dheineamar beart ar son na Gaoluinne. Theip orainn sa mh&eacute;id sin, agus<?oasys _jy?>t&aacute;imid f&oacute;s ag iarraidh an f&oacute;d a sheasamh. N&iacute; fheadar an bhfuil buaite againn.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, as Senator Henry has noted, the EU has greatly benefited us on issues like labour rights, health and safety issues and equality for women. We would never have made the progress that we did without the EU. The EU has clearly benefited us economically and opened up a market that was never there before. It has reduced our dependence on the UK as most of our trade before our entry into the EEC was with the UK. The UK is still a very important trading partner but we now have access to the European market.</P>
      <P>Mary Lou McDonald, MEP, trotted out the easy line about the special place of NATO and the problems of a federal Europe. If someone talks to me about a federal Europe, I ask him or her to define what he or she is talking about, to tell me the difference between a confederation and a federation, to tell me what he or she is worried about and to put neutrality in the context of ethics, commitment, honesty and fairness. The moment when I began to question my commitment to Irish neutrality more than at any other time was when I watched people being slaughtered in Kosovo while nobody did anything about it. We are supposed to believe that doing nothing was the right course of action. There were no ethical grounds for the position we took at that time. I believe in neutrality in a perfect world but if we see wrong being done, we should take action.</P>
      <P>It is wrong to sit back and let NATO and the United States do what they have done twice in the Middle East and continue to do around the world. If a balance is not achieved in foreign policy, we will reap a poor reward down the line. We need to become involved in foreign policy, which should be carried out very slowly and correctly. My position on neutrality, which I have held for many years, is severely threatened by what I have seen around the world over the past ten or 15 years. These two things do not marry well. The way to deal with conflict is by democratic means through United Nations with a democratic mandate, which it does not have at the moment, and a foreign policy in Europe that is democratically arrived at and does not give a special place to NATO. We should move towards a confederation, which is quite different from a federation and would secure national and European boundaries.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to briefly reflect on this debate, which has been an excellent one for this House. I have gained a considerable amount from this debate in terms of the contributions from all colleagues in the European Parliament. Senator McDowell made a very important point when he asked why it was necessary to have a referendum when most people feel that that question is really a barometer of how people feel about the EU.</P>
      <P>I understand the point he made, however, it is important that we ask the people to support the new constitutional treaty that will shortly be presented and all of the treaties that have gone before. Holding a referendum puts pressure on those of us in politics to explain the most important change in Europe and this country that we have witnessed in a generation, which is the establishment of the EU. It puts pressure on us to get out there and explain the message and campaign and canvass for it.</P>
      <P>If established political parties learn any message from the defeat of the first Nice treaty, it is that they cannot take the electorate for granted. The Irish people cannot be taken for granted and we have a direct responsibility to campaign for something in which we believe. The defeat of the Nice treaty was useful because it obliged all of us to get out there and campaign in future referenda.</P>
      <P>Probably the greatest curse in Europe is the march of neo-nationalism, be it Irish, British, French or German. We must always be on our guard against it. The great construction of the European project is keeping a lid on neo-nationalism and all that it represented in terms of the First and Second World Wars. The rise of the British Nationalist Party, Sinn F&eacute;in, Mr. Jean Marie Le Pen&rsquo;s party in France, Mr. J&ouml;rg Haider&rsquo;s party in Austria is an expression of this deadly neo-nationalism that we must confront. When these political parties make their neo-nationalist claims, they must be confronted.</P>
      <P>The suggestion by Ms McDonald today that, by accepting this treaty, we are going down the road of a further militarised Europe is nonsense. Kofi Annan, when he initiated the reform procedure within the UN, said he expects regional autonomies such as the European Union to flex their muscles in the world and to do the job the UN cannot do. The reality is that, if we are serious about upholding UN law and the resolutions decided upon in New York, the EU and similar institutions must be the first people to uphold them. There is no point in having a collection of armies within the EU if we cannot uphold many of the resolutions that pass through the UN at various times. The notion that we can paddle our own canoe against what is happening in the rest of the world or within a region is nonsense and we must challenge it.</P><Col N="973"/>
      <P>We have much to be proud of in western Europe in comparison with the United States of America. Fewer people are incarcerated in prisons in western Europe than throughout the US, by a ratio of approximately 10:1. We spend more on education and health in western Europe than does the US. We spend more on social security protection and have much better labour laws in terms of workers&rsquo; rights. We have better environmental protections. How is this being brought about? It is a result of countries coming together to work in common cause and solidarity. This is the model we must explain to people when we argue why this treaty must be accepted.</P>
      <P>God willing, my three and a half year old will start his first day in school in September 2006. In that school I would like to see a quick summary of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann &mdash; I am sure there is one already &mdash; as he and the other children look to see what are their rights. As children go through school, it is also right that they see a summary of the new European treaty. The notion that one can obtain rights from only one country or entity is nonsensical and dated. The concept of the EU is that there are multifaceted rights and different layers of rights which are in favour of citizens. When my child and other children commence their education, I want them to live in a world in which they see their rights and obligations written clearly, whether it is from an Irish perspective or as part of the EU. This is one way we could popularise the notion of the EU.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the MEPs to this debate, as it is an important platform for them to get across the constitution&rsquo;s message. The message could be hijacked, as it has been many times in the past, by emotive opposition in certain areas that would destroy the debate. I warn the Government not to be as complacent as it was before the first referendum on the Nice Treaty when it failed to get the message across. The result was the electorate&rsquo;s punishment of the Government of the day, although it is unfortunate that the decision must be seen in that light.</P>
      <P>I concur with many Senators who pointed out it is not enough to send out leaflets and booklets on the constitution. The debate must be taken into the country to the electorate and the people must understand clearly what is on offer. For the first time, the electorate can see a clarity in this constitution that was not there to the same degree in any prior treaties in so far as we have the areas of national responsibility and European legal responsibility clearly outlined. Information is important and we have set in motion today the launch of the new campaign. When the referendum will be held is a decision for the Government. A platform such as this debate is important but we must congratulate RTE, as it has recently introduced through its political unit a programme about the European Parliament, in which we can see our MEPs and their contributions.</P>

I would like our MEP colleagues to explain these consequences fully.</P>
      <P>An area of great importance is the environment. Some of the directives that have been handed down are totally unsuited to our particular environment. Up until now we have been told we cannot interfere, that something is <i>fait accompli</i>. That is the end of the story.

This is my first time to speak in either House and it is a particular honour for me. I am not sure I got the etiquette right but I hope I did. I am pleased to be in the House and apologise that I was not here earlier for the debate. Interestingly, I was speaking with Tr&oacute;caire about many issues, including the European constitution, food policy and the millennium development goals.</P>
      <P>For the sixth time this week I mentioned the constitution in a meeting. Whichever side one is on, the constitution will be won or lost in this manner. At every event we go to, it behoves us all to talk about the constitution and what it means to us. Either one is for it or against it. Despite that some people think no one is interested in this issue, others are incredibly interested if one engages with them and uses language that is not &ldquo;European&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>Jargon kills debate. As a former journalist and someone who cut through much of the jargon, I believe we will destroy this debate unless we use the language we all use normally. Call it &ldquo;pub talk&rdquo; but use a language in which people understand what we are saying. I spoke with a large gathering of women at the ICA Meath federation and, by the end of the talk, they were engaged about the European Union and the constitution. While I have not taken down my political &ldquo;L plates&rdquo; yet, it strikes me as extraordinary that so many people know so little about the EU except the bad bits, which are all we talk about. Mr. Coveney could not have put it better.</P>
      <P>If one had sat in the European Parliament in Strasbourg last week, one would have cried as Members recalled what Europe meant to them. We are cosy over here. We did not feel the pain of the Second World War. If we had, we would think differently and, because they sadden me, I urge everyone to watch the pictures from the war. I make my children do so.</P>
      <P>In the early days when I looked at Strasbourg, the people there and the &ldquo;Tower of Babel&rdquo;, as an impatient journalist I was inclined to say, &ldquo;Oh God, is there ever going to be a conclusion&rdquo;. In his wisdom, Gay Mitchell said,&ldquo;This beats war&rdquo;. I quote him at every opportunity because it does beat war. Anyone who is against this constitution must be careful about what they say because I value the European Union deeply. The Union has been great for Ireland, certainly for women, and has been good for my children, who I want to know and love Europe just as I do. I want to have a real debate. This is a great opportunity for us to get together and tease out the issues. It troubled me on Monday night when the big issue among a gathering of very well informed people was abortion and euthanasia and that people thought the constitution would impose either on this nation. It will not. Whatever people bring up in regard to the constitution, all I ask is that they speak the truth.</P>
      <P>I will not take up six minutes because we get just two minutes in the European Parliament. Brevity is the soul of wit, so let us live with it.</P>

	<P>I thank Senators and Members of the European Parliament for their contributions here today. As Chairman of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution in the last D&aacute;il, I am aware its Members were very anxious to see Seanad &Eacute;ireann play a close role in monitoring developments in the European Union. One of our recommendations was that the Seanad should engage in more intensive scrutiny of European business and that Members of the European Par<Col N="976"/>liament should in some sense be associated with the work of this House. I welcome this debate, which is the first time there has been a plenary attendance by Members of the European Parliament at a Seanad debate. It is a good and welcome development.</P>
      <P>Mary Lou McDonald, MEP, referred to the fact that there could be representation in Seanad &Eacute;ireann from all the Members of the European Parliament on this island. This matter was addressed in the all-party committee. However, until the provisional movement faces up to its responsibilities under the Good Friday Agreement, that will not be possible. No one more than I would like to see that happen. It would be marvellous if Members of the European Parliament throughout the island associated themselves with the work of the House. I would support this in the context of European affairs but, regrettably, it is something which will have to wait for the full realisation of the guidelines and norms set down in the Belfast Agreement. It is very important that both the Belfast Agreement and the Good Friday Agreement are implemented so that this can take place.</P>
      <P>The common destiny of Ireland in Europe is also an important subject. There will be a referendum in Northern Ireland as well as in this part of Ireland on this issue. Many member states are holding referendums, therefore, there will be a common Irish debate on the subject. If those who have responsibilities under the Good Friday Agreement faced up to their responsibilities, it would be possible to have that type of debate in this House.</P>
      <P>The constitutional position was outlined by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, when he opened this debate. He made the point that constitutionally the situation will remain the same but major treaty change will have to be negotiated through an Intergovernmental Conference. If any treaty goes outside the scope and objectives of the current treaties, Ireland must hold a referendum. If a change does not go outside the scope and objectives of the treaties, no referendum will be required. The Government has been prepared to amend the Bill to avoid unnecessary controversy over this point. We will have to wait and see the Government&rsquo;s final proposal, but whether any treaty relating to the European Union goes beyond the scope of what our Constitution permits is a moot point.</P>
      <P>I had doubts as to whether the Nice Treaty arrangement should have been put to the people. However, a document as fundamental in its description as a treaty to establish a constitution for Europe is something that should be submitted to the people. Senator Ulick Burke said that we cannot take the people for granted, of which we are all well aware since the first Nice referendum. In considering this, we must consider the fact that it is a treaty. While people like to call it a constitution, it is a treaty establishing a constitution. Like all treaties, there was a meeting of persons <Col N="977"/>from different sovereign states. We all know the history of the convention and the subsequent discussions between the parties. It was at the final stages of the Irish Presidency last June that the various member states were brought into the room by the Taoiseach to do some horse trading, which the treaty reflects. We should not try to deceive the people on this issue. The treaty is a compromise between the different member states.</P>
      <P>A moment in time arises when a group of representatives of different sovereign states, who have their own priorities and requirements, are gathered in a room. To try to achieve a consensus and get an agreement between a group of states in that position is a very difficult exercise in practical politics. The exercise was performed and it is important that people understand this is the fruit of that particular labour.</P>
      <P>If one is considering any particular question, whether the competences of the Union, the values the document enshrines or the position of the Union in external relations and security, the document is a practical compromise embodied in a treaty. It is not Europe from first principles so to speak. Many Senators and Deputies would have views about how Europe could be constructed from first principles. However, it is impossible for a gathering of what previously comprised 15 sovereign states, now 25 sovereign states, to arrive at a description of Europe from first principles in the way the founding fathers of the United States were able to do when they formulated their constitution at the end of 18th century. They were inspired by enlightenment ideals. Not having expelled a colonial occupying power, they were able to apply these great enlightenment ideals to construct a constitution from first principles. While we may like to do so, the European project is so well entrenched, and has been in progress so solidly since 1945, with greater intensity from 1958, 1973 and 1992, that it is impossible for this train to be derailed suddenly and put onto an entirely new track.</P>
      <P>This treaty is not the result of that type of exercise. The exercise in question here involved the leaders of Europe gathering and doing their best to produce a document that will chart the Europe for the immediate future. If we examine that document, our diplomats and political leaders had certain key diplomatic objectives going into the negotiations, as had the representatives of the other states, and, by and large, we secured our objectives.</P>
      <P>There is no great threat in this particular treaty. It is a practical document which serves to consolidate the European legal norms. It makes these clear for citizens in a far more accessible form. It makes clear the rights and responsibilities of citizens and the competences of the Union and the member states, which is very valuable. We must move away from the first principles type of discussions we have had in most referendums since 1973 where we argue whether it would be a super power, a military threat or a threat to our <Col N="978"/>religious values. It is none of these things. It is a practical document, designed to produce a better Europe for the future. The practical task is to get that message across to the people in the referendum.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Government, I welcome the fact that Seanad &Eacute;ireann had this valuable debate. Clearly we will have many more such debates in the months ahead.</P>

	<P>I move:</P>
      <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann:</P>
      <P FLI="0" el="5">
        <?oasys _is1p8-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p2-?><?oasys _ix?>notes with alarm the publication in the past week of the latest American Express Holiday Cost of Living Index which revealed that Ireland now ranks second only to Norway as the most expensive holiday destination in Europe;</P>
      <P FLI="0" el="5">
        <?oasys _is1p8-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p2-?><?oasys _ix?>while conscious of the present low level of access fares to this country;</P>
      <P FLI="0" el="5">
        <?oasys _is1p8-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p2-?><?oasys _ix?> the constant efforts of the tourism industry to offer good value to our visitors;</P>
      <P FLI="0" el="5">
        <?oasys _is1p8-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p2-?><?oasys _ix?>records its concern at the continuing erosion of national competitiveness that these figures reflect, especially their possible knock-on effect on Ireland&rsquo;s attractiveness as an investment destination and as a source of export earnings.</P>
      <P FLI="0" el="5">The findings by the American Express survey are bad enough but my real concern arises from the absence of comment in the newspapers. When a heavyweight international survey found, in a report published last week, Ireland to be the second most expensive holiday destination in the world nobody batted an eyelid. The newspaper that carried the story referred to the comment of the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism the preceding week to the effect that rip-off Ireland was a myth. At the time the cost of Irish holidays had risen by 26% and the cost of holidays in the United States dropped by 20%.</P>
      <P>I am not suggesting the Government can solve these problems. That is largely due to the value of the dollar and so on. I was jolted, however, by the lack of concern or interest. I am also disappointed today by the Government amendment to the motion.</P>
      <P>I grew up in the tourism business. My father ran the Red Island Holiday Camp in Skerries. That is a great way for anybody in business to grow up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I visited there last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a lovely park now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Growing up in a holiday camp was a great start from a business point of view and would provide good lessons for anybody regardless of whether he or she is involved in tourism. Every week 500 guests travelled by boat or plane, from England, and we met them with buses. The deal my father made with them was that it was an all-in holiday, everything was included. The guests paid on the day they arrived and it would have been a breach of contract to try to take more money from them.</P>
      <P>That is an important message for every business. It is not understood in Irish terms or by tourism in Ireland as it should be. I see no sign of it being understood at Government level. It is essential if we are to succeed that we encourage our guests to return. My father measured success by the number of guests who came to him at the end of the week to say they had a good time and were returning the following year. Bringing the customers back is the basis of every business.</P>
      <P>Statistically, Ireland is not doing too badly in that regard. A reasonable number of people come to Ireland but figures released today show a decline in the number of visitors to the regions. Many people have been critical of the numbers coming to Dublin for stag night weekends over recent years. They are not being drip-fed into the regions. Today&rsquo;s figures show that Dublin is doing well but the rest of the country is not. One of the benefits of tourism is that it can be spread throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Price is not the only factor. The experience is important, whether with an airline, in a supermarket or a hotel. One sometimes pays a great deal more to stay in a high grade hotel than in another hotel. Those messages must be promoted. That is why I have put down this motion.</P>
      <P>I was in Brazil recently visiting supermarkets and was impressed to see many men doing the shopping in a very up-market store. I mentioned this to my guide who explained that these were the chauffeurs doing the shopping for the ladies of the houses. It is a reminder that we do not look at price alone but at the whole experience.</P>
      <P>I look forward to an open and wide-ranging debate on this subject. I quoted the American Express survey to underline a fact which does not need underlining, namely, that Ireland&rsquo;s high prices are no longer our secret. When this issue was highlighted last year there was what I consider to be an unworthy ministerial response. I am not sure I have heard that this year. It was suggested that anybody drawing attention to the problem was somehow or other letting the side down. This survey, and the wide international coverage it was given last week, should put an <Col N="980"/>end to the notion that we can keep this little cat in the bag. The world knows what our visitors in recent years have been telling us over and again. Ireland is an expensive place in which to spend one&rsquo;s holidays.</P>
      <P>The survey compared the cost of a tourist shopping basket of items in 12 different countries worldwide and found that Ireland was second only to Norway in price. It carried out two surveys, one including rent-a-car, and one without rent-a-car, but we are still the second most expensive country. The survey looked at the cost of 13 holiday expenses from the cost of having coffee, drinks and meals to the price tag on such holiday essentials as camera film, postcards and sun screen.The Irish shopping basket totalled over &euro;211, virtually double the cost of the Italian one. It was &euro;115 dearer than the lowest cost country, Thailand, which I can understand, which added up to only &euro;96. Some examples from the survey show the overall trend. For example, a tube of factor 15 sun screen sets visitors in Ireland back &euro;15.08 &mdash; higher than anywhere else in the world &mdash; whereas in South Africa it costs only &euro;1.69. Camera film is another item that is expensive here with a price tag of &euro;6.23 whereas in South Africa it costs only &euro;1. A snack lunch for four, including drinks, costs &euro;62 here, more than &euro;40 more expensive than in Thailand where it costs &euro;21.</P>
      <P>Separate from the holiday shopping basket, the survey also looked at the cost of car hire and how it varied throughout the world. Ireland came third highest at &euro;150 for three days car hire. This compares with only &euro;54 in Spain. As I well know, comparing shopping baskets can often be misleading. I have often argued this issue because every individual shopper buys a different basket of goods.</P>
      <P>This comparison has credibility because it focuses on the relatively narrow range of items bought by holidaymakers. It is worth pointing out it did not include the cost of getting here. One of the few bright spots in the picture is that the cost of getting here is relatively low because of cheaper air fares. On the other hand, those cheap air fares are available to most places that holidaymakers might choose. Therefore, there is no way we can argue that low access costs give us a competitive advantage.</P>
      <P>The reason I tabled this motion is that it is high time we faced up to the wider implications of the fact that Ireland has become a high cost country. This survey is not the only one of its kind to draw the same picture. It is clear to everybody that Ireland is a high cost place for everyone, not just holidaymakers. I shall give an example. Last year an international survey of the cost of living in 114 capital cities ranked Dublin 14th in the world. Another in <i>The Economist</i> magazine recently confirmed that Dublin is more expensive than New York. It is not only our tourism business that is at risk, important though that may be, a high cost Ireland affects every aspect of our economic future. It affects our ability to attract incoming <Col N="981"/>investment and our ability to produce goods and services for export to the rest of the world at competitive prices. The level of our cost base is, therefore, an important factor in our overall economic future.</P>
      <P>What can we do about this? A response should have two prongs. We should take the issue of costs more seriously. I do not believe the Government is doing that. We should give priority to keeping our costs from getting further and further out of reach of our competitors. We should not simply acknowledge that Ireland is a high cost country and a high cost economy and wash our hands of the matter.</P>
      <P>We are a high cost country and the reality is that we will remain one. It is a one-way street and we do not have an option to travel in any other direction. However, at the same time what matters a great deal is by how much we are more expensive than other places. If we can keep our costs within reach of the others that is one thing, if the gap continues to get wider that is another issue. We have to keep vigilant about costs, even if it is no longer realistic to hope we can ever get back to a position where we can use our costs as a competitive advantage. We should try to hold our costs at the present rate.</P>
      <P>The Government will tell us that today it announced a consumer strategy initiative. Clearly there is something we can do and I am sure some steps are being taken. The difference is that it is not just costs, it is innovation also and innovation does not come from looking at the costs issue on its own. The example we have often taken is that of open book costings. If one asked Aer Lingus ten or 15 years ago to look at its costs for going to London it would have said it could not reduce them. Yet, when a competitor comes in with innovative ideas the costs come tumbling down. It is not simply a question of asking whether these costs are legitimate and if it is fair to charge given prices. The Government&rsquo;s step today does not go anywhere near addressing this problem.</P>
      <P>The other prong is that we realise the importance of increasing the value of what we deliver. If we can no longer be a low-cost country, and I do not think we can, we can still aim to be a high value country, in other words, we must seek to justify our prices in terms of the overall value that the customer gets. In the case of tourism, this means that we should aim at giving our visitors a holiday experience that exceeds anything they can get anywhere else. We need in our tourism product to create a &ldquo;wow&rdquo; factor. We need to offer holidays that will leave visitors impressed with the quality of what they get during their time with us. We need to send them away not only satisfied with their holidays but with, what we call in business, making them missionaries. They have to go out and talk to others. It is a much cheaper form of advertising than anything one can pay for by having tourists speak as missionaries when they recommend to others a place to visit.</P>
      <P>My recommendations raise the bar very high but it is the only way we can carve out a secure <Col N="982"/>future for our tourism industry. As long as we take a need-to-know attitude to what we offer our visitors we put at risk the whole future of the industry. If we do not set out to offer something that is very special, sooner or later our costs will catch up with us and cripple the industry. The need for this approach goes far wider than tourism.</P>
      <P>In tabling this motion I was not just thinking about tourism. What is true of tourism applies to everything else we do. It applies particularly to what we offer our foreign companies who invest here. I am old enough to remember the days when IDA Ireland used to claim that Ireland was a low-cost place to come to, a good location with a cheap and willing labour force. Those days are long gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>IDA Ireland never said that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I think it did. I know the Senator has a link. I can remember the time when it said Ireland was a low-cost place in which to invest but those days are long gone. What we emphasise now is the education of our people and their ability to carry out high value tasks. Some people did that in the past also. What we have to remember is that anything we offer in these terms is offered by other countries.</P>
      <P>I was in India last year and was very impressed by the education standards there. In my own company when we needed help in technology we had to go to India for it. What will happen when those in India and China say they have got the education that the Irish have and that their costs are a fraction of those in Ireland? We have got to challenge both of those areas and we have a long way to go. They will say they can deliver the same education but at a much lower level of cost. How can we survive in the light of that challenge? Increasingly, it is the challenge we will have to face and failure to do so will inevitably lead to the consequences outlined in the survey to which I referred.</P>
      <P>I am concerned at the Government amendment. I thought the Government might table an amendment in which it would accept the first part of the motion and then go on to point out what is being done. The amendments proposes to delete the content of the motion, thereby appearing not to recognise the challenge. I hope I hear words that are different and that this does not become a confrontational issue because it is one on which we should all set our hearts on addressing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the motion and I thank my colleague, Senator Quinn, for tabling it. To reiterate some of the points he made, this afternoon I checked the American Express holiday cost of living index on Google. The first two pages that came up showed the Thailand tourist board and the Spanish tourist board, one claiming to be the cheapest in the world and the other claiming to be the cheapest in Europe. This is a <Col N="983"/>marketing issue and confirms what Senator Quinn has said.</P>
      <P>This is an important issue to debate. Neither Senator Quinn nor I have any problem with the amendment to the motion. I ask the Minister of State to consider adding the amendment as an addendum to the motion. I do not think Senator Quinn would have the slightest difficulty with that proposal. The motion and the amendment are not contradictory. I ask the Minister of State to accept the motion just as Senator Quinn and I can accept the amendment. The motion contains no criticism of the Government. I question the wisdom of putting down an amendment to this motion. I may be missing the point and the Minister of State will inform me if I am. I ask him to consider accepting the motion.</P>
      <P>I wish to concentrate on the positive aspects. For the past two years, the Irish rate of inflation has been in the lower end of the European scale. There has been a very marginal levelling off of 1% or 2% over the course of the past two years.</P>
      <P>The two biggest cost factors highlighted by the survey are car rental and a restaurant meal for two. The cost of car rental is related to insurance and illustrates and reinforces the importance of getting insurance costs in line. The insurance cost for car rental in Ireland is the reason for the exorbitant price and this should be examined. I am vice-president of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and am glad to see some improvement taking place in that area. I hope more will follow and the House will be discussing the subject next month but it will be a slow process.</P>
      <P>The other issue is that of restaurant prices. We cannot quibble with the report because we all know that a dinner for two in Ireland is more expensive than anywhere else in Europe. We should examine the reasons for this. I will illustrate the requirements which must be fulfilled by Irish restaurateurs.</P>
      <P>I was sitting in this seat in the House 15 years ago when the regulations for the establishment of restaurants were introduced. Senator Ross and I were on the point of being thrown out of the House because we objected to them. We regarded them as making it impossible to open a restaurant. France is the next on the list to Ireland in terms of expense. I suggest that when Members are next in France they walk into a restaurant and count the number of doors and toilets, and inspect the kitchen. I know of a young man who opened a sandwich bar recently. It had seating for fewer than ten people. He did everything by the book and complied with all the health and safety regulations. The local authority had a problem with the toilets. He explained he had installed a toilet with wheelchair access but the local authority regulations called for the provision of a staff toilet. He was forced to use some of his kitchen space to install an unnecessary toilet for the never more than three members of staff who ever worked there. He then had two <Col N="984"/>spanking new toilets in a place where people stay for a few minutes at a time.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State to consider the regulations which must be complied with in order to set up a restaurant and which are all about cost. There must be a certain number of doors between the kitchen, toilet and dining areas. These regulations do not apply in most of Europe and this is an issue we should consider. We can do something about the cost of restaurant meals and car hire.</P>
      <P>I raised an issue recently and received a lot of nasty mail as a result but I will raise it again. When I travel in Europe I always price the basic nine or ten-inch pizza margarita because it is a good indicator, like the hamburger index. I bought one in a beautiful, sit-down restaurant last week in Ireland. It was the cheapest pizza I had eaten since I was in Italy about two years ago. It cost &euro;6.75 in a nice restaurant which was brand new, with good food and the proper ambience. This may be a sign things are changing.</P>
      <P>People are beginning to question the prices. I was in a pub last weekend where a woman in the company called for the barman to inquire the reason for the difference in the price of a pint between one round of drinks and the next. There was a reasonable explanation given. However, it is good to see people querying prices because in the past we were not used to asking about the price of goods. As we become better off as a nation, I think we are becoming more confident about questioning prices.</P>
      <P>For the first time in 20 years, bed and breakfast houses are facing serious competition from hotels. The costs of hotel and bed and breakfast accommodation are being driven down. I know of a hotel owner who was concerned that the hotel was not achieving full occupancy, even though it is up to scratch. He spoke to the manager who explained that the surrounding guesthouses were full every night because they were charging prices 30% cheaper than the hotel. The owner said he wanted to see the cars parked outside the hotel every night and told the manager to do whatever was needed with the price and it happened overnight.</P>
      <P>Ireland will never become an area noted for low prices. I raised with the IFA on a number of occasions the reason Irish lamb is cheaper in France than in Ireland. The IFA could do what it threatened to do about food prices.</P>
      <P>I recently travelled by train from Bristol to Falmouth which is a three and a half hour trip, like the journey from Dublin to Cork, which cost over &euro;80 return, £55 sterling one way and £56 return. The following week I took a return train journey from Rosslare to Dublin and it cost &euro;24. Train travel is a lot cheaper in Ireland than in France or in the UK but it is cheaper in Spain and Italy than in Ireland. I have been a little disjointed in my contribution but this has been deliberate. I want the House to take a close look, as Senator Quinn requested, at the issue. Even though our prices are high, they are not high in every area. <Col N="985"/>We should consider what is low and what is high and take action on high prices inasmuch as we can. We should sell Ireland in terms of quality and level of service.</P>
      <P>I second the motion and I ask the Minister of State and the Government side to consider changing the amendment to an addendum to the motion.</P>

      <P LI="1">notes the continuing strong performance of Ireland as an international tourism destination and, while conscious of the competitiveness challenge facing the tourism industry here, notes with approval the Government&rsquo;s response to that challenge through the proposals for reform of general consumer protection arrangements and the implementation of the detailed two year action plan set out in the September 2003 report of the Tourism Policy Review Group entitled New Horizons for Irish Tourism: An Agenda for Action, incorporating a range of supporting initiatives and programmes on the part of the tourism State agencies.&rdquo;</P>
      <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I am delighted to speak on this important issue raised by Senators Quinn, O&rsquo;Toole, Henry, Norris and Ross. We all have seen reports in the newspapers and on television about the significant variations in the price of accommodation, meals and other entertainment. At the weekend I read an article in one of the Sunday newspapers which stated that Ireland is the world&rsquo;s second most expensive place to visit. This is not a situation of which we as a country should be proud. We have all heard stories and seen for ourselves the extent to which prices have risen in many areas. Depending on the area, prices have risen, come down or spiralled out of control. In many cases the price increases are driven by greed and not by the need to meet wages and cover costs.</P>
      <P>Thankfully the cost of travel by air to Ireland has fallen dramatically in recent years. This has resulted in more tourists coming to our shores for short breaks, many of them on weekend breaks. Much credit must be given to our national carrier, Aer Lingus, and Ryanair for the service they both provide by bringing so many tourists into the country. Shannon Airport recently received a huge boost with the introduction of new flights to Spain, Sweden, Italy, Belgium and France. It is predicted that this massive investment by Ryanair in the Shannon region will deliver 1.5 million extra passengers for the airport this year, bringing a huge boost to tourism and jobs in the mid-west and establishing Shannon as the low cost gateway to Ireland.</P>
      <P>Likewise Cork Airport is booming and the announcement last week that two weekly transatlantic flights are to operate from Cork Airport is <Col N="986"/>great news for the Cork region and a great vote of confidence in the airport. In 2003, 2.2 million passengers passed through Cork Airport, and I have no doubt that these new routes will add thousands of passengers. To the best of my knowledge the aircraft will fly between Cork Airport and John F. Kennedy Airport in New York, the busiest airport on the eastern US seaboard. This will be good for business as well as tourism and I hope that it will help to build further trade links between the Cork region and the US.</P>
      <P>When the House debated the break-up of Aer Rianta and the establishment of independent airport authorities at Cork and Shannon some people said it was a bad idea. These two examples of the increase in routes from both Shannon and Cork prove that allowing these two airports to grow and develop their own business without having to report to a Dublin board will be positive.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KieranPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. K. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>On another topic I wish to compliment some of our State agencies. Great credit must be given to the Office of Public Works for the manner in which it maintains many of the tourism attractions in the country. There are many aspects to tourism here in Ireland and much of it relates to internal tourism. I am pleased with the initiatives on which many of the regions throughout the country have embarked to attract Irish visitors for weekend breaks or for their summer holidays. We have all seen the advertisement in the newspapers, on television and radio, in magazines and even on billboards, inviting us to spend a hard earned break in various parts of the country. I am pleased to see this type of marketing and advertising, because as someone who was involved in the East Coast and Midlands Tourism, I know only to well the benefit of Irish visitors can bring to a region.</P>
      <P>We can be proud of many of the initiatives the Government introduced around the country to give incentives to build holiday-homes, cottages and other tourist facilities. The previous Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, was very forward thinking in some of the schemes he introduced. Senators will also be aware of the benefit of these tax incentives in ensuring the building of high quality accommodation across the country.</P>
      <P>The announcement of the establishment of a new consumer agency to take action on prices is most welcome. This new watchdog must use its powers to the fullest possible extent to clamp down on soaring costs across the country. When fully operational, the agency will benefit both consumers here in Ireland and tourists. I am pleased this State agency will be handed statutory powers including the authority to close down businesses and impose on-the-spot fines on those who rip off consumers, including tourists.</P>
      <P>Various studies have shown the areas of most concern to tourists coming to Ireland. It goes without saying that the main complaint is about <Col N="987"/>the weather, about which we cannot do anything. However, we can be proactive and promote activities abroad that are not dependent on beautiful sunshine or calm clear days. I am encouraged that the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, has allocated an indicative grant fund of &euro;12 million to be divided between the Border midlands and western, and southern and eastern regions. This will see an increased investment in outdoor pursuits such as equestrian, cycling, walking, specialist outdoor activities, water-based tourism and health tourism.</P>
      <P>It would be foolish for me to try to defend some of the costs that our tourists are faced with in Ireland. The American Express report is, and should be a huge wake-up call for all those involved in the tourism sector. The Government listened carefully to the concerns of many within the sector and ensured no increases in VAT or in excise duty on alcohol. Unfortunately, this freeze on the part of the Government was not matched by many in the industry.</P>
      <P>Cost factors are undoubtedly a significant influence on Ireland&rsquo;s competitive position as a tourism destination. This has been identified as a key issue that needs to be addressed if we are to increase overseas tourism numbers. F&aacute;ilte Ireland is rolling out programmes to help individual tourism enterprises to better manage costs and also to benchmark performance against competition, both national and international. Initiatives such as this are most welcome and this work should continue. The focus is not so much on price as on value and my message is not so much about high prices as value for money for tourists.</P>
      <P>We have to be real in our criticism of the tourism industry in Ireland. However, for many years Ireland has not been a cheap holiday destination. It has never been, nor does it intend to be, on a par with the cheap mass-market destinations such as the south of Spain, Greece or Turkey. However, Ireland was competitive in the 1990s. It has always been my view that if Ireland&rsquo;s tourism industry is to restore the competitiveness it enjoyed in the boom years, a multifaceted approach by both the private and public sectors is required. It is also worth pointing out that the strength of the euro and related weakness of the US dollar and sterling present additional challenges for domestic tourism in Ireland in terms of the perception of value for money. Unfortunately these exchange rate changes are out of our control.</P>
      <P>People who take advantage of a special occasion or function to increase their prices undermine the efforts of State agencies to sell the country. These greedy individuals give our country and our fine tourism industry a very bad name and, in the words of my colleague Senator Leyden, they should be named and shamed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I support the motion that notes <Col N="988"/>with alarm the publication of a notable American Express holiday cost of living index, which revealed that Ireland now ranks second only to Norway as the most expensive holiday destination in Europe. How times have changed. Only 15 or 20 years ago in the west of Ireland from where I come beside Lough Kee Forest Park, we were very used to Germans holidaying on the river Shannon and we took them for granted. We thought they had endless amounts of money. We also saw the American bus tours passing through the town. They used to stop off at the abbey and gave small tips. I had a newsagent shop selling Belleek pottery and small gifts. As a town with a Cistercian abbey and much history we had a booming tourism industry at the time.</P>
      <P>However, in the past 15 years there has been a lack of investment in the Lough Kee Forest Park and Americans no longer seem to pass through the town. While people may say the country has a booming tourism industry, in those pockets, which used to have such an industry, nothing is now happening. This may be because we have become affluent and the Americans and Germans do not seem to have the money we apparently have or it may be because they are finding better value, which is what I believe. They are finding better value because we have failed to keep an eye on our costs.</P>
      <P>Let us consider what is termed &ldquo;Rip-off Ireland&rdquo;. Perhaps Senator Leyden highlighted it in his name and shame campaign. Fine Gael launched a website, <i>www.ripoff.ie</i>. While I take no pleasure in introducing a website in which people highlight being ripped off, the rip-off is evident. The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, took issue with this campaign and said we should not be saying such things. It is not unpatriotic to point out areas where there is not good value. It does the country a service. A few weeks ago a delegation from North West Tourism appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Arts, Sport and Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. The CEO dared to suggest we should not be highlighting this matter as it sends out the wrong message. However, the fact is that Ireland has become too expensive.</P>
      <P>I agree that there are some positive aspects. Years ago we only had a few quality hotels and we now have many good hotels, which provide good value. However, the people being caught out are the bars, restaurants and small bed and breakfasts, which cannot compete on economies of scale. They have not increased their prices simply because they are out to make money, rather, they have increased them because rates and the cost of insurance and electricity have increased.</P>
      <P>As Senator O&rsquo;Toole pointed out, regulation has driven many out of business. There is one aspect I very much welcome that is also a major factor in smaller businesses, namely, the minimum wage. Smaller hotels that had a low cost base have now seen those costs go up and are passing them on to the consumer.</P><Col N="989"/>
      <P>Those who cannot compete will suffer. However, if one looks around the country, one sees that most towns, restaurants and pubs are now run not by Irish people but by Indians, Chinese or other foreign workers, who frequently put no value on their time. I came from that business and did not put value on my time either. I remember doing a course with the Bank of Ireland many years ago and thought that we were making money. The man said that I worked approximately 70 hours a week, my mother 75 and my father 70. He said that, if I received the then minimum wage, I would be making more working for McDonalds, and he was right. Many Irish people involved in tourism are moving out of it because there is no money to be made.</P>
      <P>The alternative is to hike up the prices. That has been brought on by affluence, but also by the Government, which, while it has done a little, has not done enough regarding regulations and the increase in rates.</P>
      <P>The Minister has claimed that we are bringing more tourists into the country. I accept that many initiatives have helped. I see that over &euro;6 million of European funding is coming into Lough Key Forest Park, which is excellent. However, we must thank Michael O&rsquo;Leary of Ryanair, who has brought in tens of thousands of tourists.</P>

	<P>I am loath to interrupt, but it might be dangerous to mention names. The Senator might praise the gentleman, but others might do otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am praising the CEO of Ryanair and the company itself as they have done more to bring tourists to this country than any other agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>They put millions into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Feighan without interruption, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish that fact to be recorded. Those tourists are not flying into the west of Ireland. They are now beginning to fly into Shannon, but most tourists are staying in Dublin. That is good, but it is creating a bigger divide. Research carried out by the Irish Tourist Industry Federation showed that the number of nights spent by tourists outside the capital in 2003 was 2.007 million fewer than in 1999. We are not merely down regarding tourists entering the country; we now have an imbalance whereby tourists are no longer leaving Dublin city. I pay tribute to the Dublin tourism industry, which has provided a better service. I get on the Dublin tourist bus, and it is great. The drivers are very friendly, and the product provided here is much improved in the last five years. However, there is an imbalance in the country. Bed and breakfast establishments and other areas in which Ireland was unique will not survive unless they get some kind of assistance. We saw how tax breaks <Col N="990"/>assisted many of the major hotels and helped create a vibrant hotel industry. It is now time to consider some imaginative assistance for bed and breakfast establishments so that a fundamental part of the Irish tourism industry might survive.</P>
      <P>We appear to be losing sight of a few issues. Where is the Irish welcome now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>Good question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have had many girls and boys working in my businesses. They all had university degrees, but it seems we are losing the ability to say &ldquo;please&rdquo;, &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; and &ldquo;hello&rdquo; and our friendly smile, which costs nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the one issue we need to address. It is a matter of education, common sense and common decency.</P>
      <P>We talk a great deal about the weather but I believe we can have a year-round product in this country. We undersell ourselves; one can carry out nearly any sport or pastime, including walking, fishing and golf all year around. I did not realise that the Gulf Stream made such a difference to the climate. We have a moderate climate in Ireland. When one goes to central and eastern Europe and such places as northern Germany, Russia and Poland, the tourism season is restricted because it is so cold. I do not believe the weather is a great factor in the tourist industry here.</P>
      <P>There is something seriously wrong if the number of people indulging in activity holidays such as fishing, walking, golf and cruiser hire is decreasing. Why is the number falling when we are getting much more fitness-oriented and into activity holidays?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>We are getting other visitors instead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not getting visitors to those areas, and it is quite difficult.</P>
      <P>I support the motion. We are all wearing the same jersey; we all want to ensure that more tourists come to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>The Cathaoirleach has caught me by surprise, since I had thought that the Minister would speak at this stage.</P>
      <P>I support the amendment. While we have some concerns about the survey that has been published &mdash; I have not seen the figures &mdash; we should not be unduly alarmed. Nevertheless, we must take account of it. There are positive indications. I have just looked through the quarterly report of the Central Bank that shows inflation has eased substantially. There is also the prospect of a fall in oil prices and a possibility that the lower inflation rate will lower wage demands. A combination of the two could lower expectations generally, and lower wage demands could be reflected in later figures.</P><Col N="991"/>
      <P>We saw a very serious increase in inflation from 2002 to 2004. That is now easing off, and the Central Bank&rsquo;s quarterly report shows that. It is very positive about the prospects for the economy. Nevertheless, in the tourism industry it is time for a further review. The policy review body established by the Minister has been examining this to see how we might counteract the adverse effects of changing trends in the marketplace over recent years.</P>
      <P>Senator Feighan mentioned the weather, but the research in that regard came from studies conducted with visitors, who complained about it. Half of those surveyed said the reason they were dissatisfied was that they felt that Ireland was far more expensive for food and drink than they had expected. For that reason, many said they would not return. It is important to bear in mind that the figures regarding the weather came from visitors.</P>
      <P>We have activities here that have to some extent been put on the back burner for the past few years. One relates to the availability of excellent fishing in Ireland, something we still have, despite all the adverse comments about it. We have a national treasure in our inland fisheries although they have been neglected and to some extent ignored by those involved in the business. I do not want to reopen past controversies about investment in inland fisheries, but they are our most neglected national resource. The very people who should be investing in them, the fishermen and anglers themselves, were the first to object to a small investment to put that resource on a firmer footing by dealing with pollution, poaching and other matters that are devastating the fisheries. We have the conditions for excellent salmon and trout fishing, white trout fishing, as well as coast and deep sea angling which has never been fully promoted by the tourism bodies.</P>
      <P>We have a coast and inland fishery resource which has been relatively under-exploited, especially in our main markets. Up to 80% of our market is in the UK, France and Germany, yet we have failed to exploit that for some inexplicable reason. The first job I got when I was elected was as spokesperson for Fianna F&aacute;il on the tourism business. We put forward proposals such as the opening of the Ballyconnell canal, which has now been completed.</P>
      <P>At that time, because of the declining state of the tourism industry, the Government decided to establish a Department of Tourism and also decided to double tourist numbers. It is now time to review that. We must identify where we can double numbers in the next four or five years and make strategic investments to ensure that we get more people in here.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware that the tourism industry has been going through a bad patch in the last few years. Numbers in hotels and restaurants have declined by about 6%, representing approximately 7,000 tourists. That is a very serious issue and is due to the fact that we have not been developing fully the potential of our tourism <Col N="992"/>industry, even in bad weather conditions. There is nothing to stop people from fishing in bad weather as they are used to it and they often like it. British anglers were the best spenders that came to Ireland. They went to guesthouses and bed and breakfasts, whose owners are now suffering a serious decline in their incomes. I appeal to the Minister of State to draw the attention of the Department and the tourism bodies to this problem.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for the increased investment this year in tourism. The social partners are putting up &euro;40 million as well, so there is a recognition of the need for investment, especially investment in marketing. It is important that assistance be provided for the small family businesses and guesthouses that find it difficult to continue.</P>
      <P>Senator Feighan indicated that this survey was a wake-up call to the industry, but it is also a wake-up call to the Minister. While we should not be alarmed, we must find ways and means to change a situation whereby we take the tourism industry for granted. When I was first elected 32 years ago, tourism was largely a seasonal business, with little economic impact, especially in the regions. It has been transformed since the Department of Tourism was established and since then, investment has improved the business. Investment in marketing will pay dividends in the numbers coming in here. We must put the Irish tourism industry, especially the Irish fishing industry, back in the dominant position that it once held. The sooner that is done, the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is normally the role of the Opposition to denounce the Government about inflation and so on. I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I think it is the first time he has been here in his new role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the first time I have met him. We are old friends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>We grace the Chamber together for the first time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>We served here when he was in a far less significant role. He is very welcome and we worked together in many places.</P>
      <P>The Irish Government and Margaret Thatcher&rsquo;s government persisted for years in protecting a cartel between Dublin and London. I want to emphasise the two governments involved. Ryanair is the beneficiary of deregulation and not the cause of it. It is the beneficiary of the decision by two governments &mdash; one of which is paraded as the model of pro-businees in Europe &mdash; to delay deliberately the ending of a cartel to fatten up British Airways before it was privatised. We knew then that controlled pricing in the airline industry was insane. It is a matter of regret that <Col N="993"/>Ryanair was the beneficiary rather than a more civilised airline, but that is a separate issue.</P>
      <P>We have stood back and allowed public demand for access to reasonable, sensible, licensed premises to be left out of line with the supply of such premises. Even as the two vintners&rsquo; organisations cry yet again that the wolf is at their door, we see pubs changing hands in Dublin for enormous sums of money. Those pubs are opened following enormous payments for rural licences. The figure quoted in one instance is &euro;170,000. If one is running a small family business for a small income, then &euro;170,000 is not to be sniffed at. There is a fear that the rampant demand for licenses for the greater Dublin area and for most of our big urban areas is the biggest single cause of the decline in the licensed trade and the closure of licensed premises in rural areas. When one is offered the security of &euro;170,000 for one&rsquo;s license and that is contrasted with the uncertainty of a rural licensed trade, many older people will choose the security. That has very little to do with smoking bans or anything else.</P>
      <P>The report published today makes it clear that restaurants and pubs have contributed spectacularly disproportionately to our price increases. I am not entirely sure why that is and I am always reluctant to claim that people are ripping us all off. However, I have not heard a convincing explanation of the situation where a half litre of beer in an off-licence costs around half of what it costs in a pub. We were told that the fundamental problem was the breweries, yet the licensed trade and the off-licensed trade pay the same amount. Then we were told it was Government duties, yet they are the same for both trades.</P>
      <P>We are now expected to believe that the 50% price difference between an off-licence and a pub is a consequence of labour costs. This is untenable because labour costs are directly related to the volume of sales and there is a good case that the volume of sales in an off-licence may well demand a greater outlay in labour costs. One can accept a marginal difference to pay for the comfort and ambience one expects in a pub but the significant gap is entirely questionable.</P>
      <P>This price difference arises because pub owners in most of our towns and cities do not live in a world of real competition but rather in a world of pretend competition. Irish people have decided they want to spend a large proportion of their newly found affluence on alcohol and publicans have been satisfied to accommodate them in this. They are also satisfied to take advantage of the fact that for a long time, we were profoundly indifferent to the price of alcohol in licensed premises. The solution to this problem is to ensure the existence of real competition. This was not done, however, and it is difficult to know why.</P>
      <P>Some years ago, in a restaurant in a tourist area, I overheard the owner lament the difficulty of making a living in the restaurant business. This particular restaurant closed in October and opened in May every year during which time the <Col N="994"/>owner lived in the Canaries. He also mentioned that one child of his was attending the most expensive boarding school in the State. He complained, however, that he could not make a living. The expectation of many people in the food and drinks industry of what constitutes a living seems to be entirely unrelated to that of ordinary people. A significant part of the problem may be these excessive expectations on the part of many of those involved in businesses critical for tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>It is always a pleasure to come to the Seanad. As the saying goes, I lost my feet and found my feet in this House. I welcome the opportunity to address Members on the important issues of competitiveness and tourism.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I will begin by discussing tourism with particular reference to the latest American Express holiday cost of living index. This document is essentially a table of the reported prices of 13 shopping basket items in 12 countries which might be purchased by a UK tourist in those countries. On the basis of a survey of only 12 countries, one cannot possibly say that one country is either the cheapest or the most expensive to holiday or live in, either in Europe or worldwide.</P>
      <P>Despite its title, this table is not an index of the holiday cost of living. No information is provided on the cost of access or accommodation, for instance, and no rationale is provided for the choice of the particular 13 items in the table. The cost of sunblock figures prominently. God speed the day when the cost of sunblock becomes a major preoccupation of tourists in Ireland whether from at home or abroad. The index is compiled simply by totting up the cost of the 13 items without any weighting whatsoever. No economist or statistician would call this a scientific exercise and its conclusions should be treated accordingly.</P>
      <P>It is important to look at the competitiveness issue from a tourism perspective. We all know Ireland is not a cheap destination, nor is it marketed as such. Nevertheless, there is no doubt the high cost of living here poses a competitiveness challenge. The report of the tourism policy review group was published in September 2003. That report set out an action plan to respond to the various challenges facing Irish tourism, and the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, appointed a group to oversee its implementation.</P>
      <P>The report identified competitiveness and value for money as key challenges facing Irish tourism. In 2002, visitor attitude surveys carried out by F&aacute;ilte Ireland showed that some 55% of overseas visitors were not satisfied with the value for money they obtained. Unfortunately, this increased to 62% in 2003. Poor customer perceptions are not helped by opportunistic price increases by certain elements of the tourism and hospitality industry during special sporting and <Col N="995"/>other entertainment events that attract high visitor numbers.</P>
      <P>Competitiveness relates not only to prices but is concerned also with value for money. People are prepared to pay high prices if they get commensurate value in terms of quality of product and service. In its first progress report, the implementation group outlined the nature of the challenge facing the industry. The group acknowledged there are many factors involved in creating the competitiveness challenge which are outside the control of the industry. However, the industry itself can do much to address that challenge.</P>
      <P>The report of the tourism policy review group set out a range of actions in this regard. It is the view of the tourism action plan implementation group that the industry generally has genuinely sought to address many of the issues within its remit in order to improve the perception among visitors in regard to the value for money they receive in Ireland. In this context, it is worth noting that the 2004 visitor attitudes survey, in contrast with recent trends, found there was no deterioration over the previous year in the level of satisfaction among visitors about the cost of access, accommodation or tourism-specific services such as car hire.</P>
      <P>Stopping the deterioration is one issue but it is another matter to reduce the level of dissatisfaction. The second progress report of the tourism action plan implementation group, which was published some weeks ago, highlighted a number of developments which are designed to address the ongoing competitiveness challenge. For instance, there were no increases in excise duties or VAT rates in budget 2005 and the annualised rate of inflation dropped to 2.1 % in March 2005. Some reductions have taken place in insurance premia due to more competition in the market and a new legal claims environment.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the industry continues to provide hundreds of special travel offers to overseas visitors on the Tourism Ireland website, <i>www.tourismireland.com</i>. F&aacute;ilte Ireland has launched a new website, <i>www.ireland.ie</i>, where special offers from the industry are packaged and offered to domestic and Northern Ireland customers. At present, more than 1,100 value breaks are listed on that website and I strongly urge Senators and the general public to examine it.</P>
      <P>Some 500 members are actively participating in the &ldquo;special offers&rdquo; section of the Irish Hotels Federation website, <i>www.irelandhotels.com</i>. In addition, the Irish Tour Operators Association, through its winter value breaks programme, offers a &ldquo;go as you please&rdquo; programme featuring more than 100 hotels and four car rental companies. This programme was extended to bed and breakfast accommodation in the 2004-05 season. The packages include up to 40% reductions on normal prices.</P>
      <P>The Restaurants Association of Ireland and the IHF with the support of F&aacute;ilte Ireland re-<Col N="996"/>launched their value menu initiative in August 2004. The pricing levels for 2004 and 2005 are more flexible and include a new value menu for wines which is supported by the wine trade. Over 500,000 copies of a brochure setting out the value on offer have been printed.</P>
      <P>Increasing productivity is one of the keys to improving competitiveness in any enterprise. Recently, F&aacute;ilte Ireland launched three new initiatives specifically designed to focus on helping enterprises address the competitiveness challenge. Performance plus is an online extranet benchmarking device for tourism enterprises to compare their performance in a range of areas to industry norms. A business solutions toolkit consists of an interactive CD-ROM guide to addressing cost management and business development issues within the tourism industry. A legal and financial advice platform provides a facility for tourism businesses to access top line advice from a range of blue chip professional companies. F&aacute;ilte Ireland has also introduced two new training initiatives for the sector on cost management, a diploma in financial management and cost control workshops. Ireland&rsquo;s best awards for high standards in service excellence were won by 50 businesses and F&aacute;ilte Ireland launched a programme which focuses on building business excellence and quality within tourism enterprises called the optimus programme. Finally, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has recently developed and launched a comprehensive human resource development strategy for the industry.</P>
      <P>Last year, Ireland returned to strong economic growth with GNP increasing by 5.5%, total employment increasing by an average of 3% and domestic demand growing by a substantial 4.4%. Ireland&rsquo;s rate of inflation is now very close to the euro area average. It is likely that our economy will continue its robust performance with growth rates of 5% to 6% forecast for 2005 and 2006. It is also likely that unemployment will remain close to the historically low level of about 4% in both 2005 and 2006.</P>
      <P>United Nations figures show that we attract considerably more global and EU foreign direct investment than the size of our country would naturally suggest. From just under 4% of the total in 2000, Ireland accounted for more than 8% of total inflows to the EU 15 in 2003. On a global basis, we won almost 5% of total world inflows. Hard nosed investment decisions are not made in favour of uncompetitive and lowly rated economies.</P>
      <P>According to Forf&aacute;s&rsquo;s recently published International Trade and Investment Report 2004, the US overtook the UK to become Ireland&rsquo;s largest single export market. From a position of accounting for less than one tenth of exports as recently as 1996, the US breached the 20% threshold in 2003, when exports to that country were worth almost &euro;17 billion. This report also found that exports of services continue to gain importance. Ireland recorded growth of 11% in service exports to &euro;3.6 billion in 2003, when $1 in every <Col N="997"/>$50 spent on traded services globally accrued in Ireland. Computer services accounted for almost half of the growth in service exports in 2003 and were the largest single category of services sold abroad. Business services, which are the second largest single category of Irish exports, saw growth of almost 9% in 2003, while the spectacular increase in exports of insurance services of recent years continued apace in 2003.</P>
      <P>Each year, the National Competitiveness Council undertakes a comprehensive analysis of Ireland&rsquo;s competitive performance. The NCC&rsquo;s competitiveness challenge 2004 states there is a need to make wage setting, government spending and taxation more responsive to changing competitive developments. Addressing these issues is and will continue to be a high priority for the Government.</P>
      <P>The Government has already taken several steps to address the issue of prices and costs in Ireland. By not increasing indirect taxes, the Government in its 2005 budget demonstrated its commitment to ensuring that the progress on reducing consumer price inflation last year continued into this year. The most recent consumer price index figures from the CSO show that inflation stands at 2.2% in April. This rate of inflation is now very close to the European average. Government action has also reduced some insurance costs.</P>
      <P>The key to reducing prices is to ensure that vibrant competition is a feature across all sectors of the economy. That is why the Government has strengthened the powers and resources of the Competition Authority, which is charged with combating anti-competitive practices in the economy. Today, the Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment launched the report of the consumer strategy group, entitled Make Consumers Count. The report stresses the needs for the balance of power to be shifted towards consumers and to awaken consumers to the potential economic and social power that they can wield. In this regard, I wish to inform the House that the Government has agreed to the establishment of a new national consumer agency as recommended by the CSG. Work will commence immediately on the necessary legislative and organisational work to ensure that the national consumer agency is established as soon as possible. A board for the new agency will act in an interim capacity until such time as legislation to formally establish the agency can be enacted.</P>
      <P>In conjunction with setting up the interim board and preparing the legislative and other work to establish the national consumer agency, consumer policy continues to develop. In addition to developments in European consumer law, it is vital that domestic legislation in this area is attuned to the needs of the modern consumer as acknowledged by the CSG in its report. In this regard, the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment is currently engaged in a comprehensive review of all existing consumer protection legislation. The extent to which consumer <Col N="998"/>interests are entwined with practically every facet of economic, political and social life can only be appreciated by reading the full report of the CSG, which covers such diverse areas and sectors as health, planning, utilities, transport, food and drink.</P>
      <P>The Government accepts that competitiveness is a key challenge. Addressing that challenge is one of its priorities. I believe that the actions I have described represent clear evidence of the Government&rsquo;s success and its intent and I would welcome this House&rsquo;s endorsement of its approach.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I am alarmed that we appear to take a complacent attitude to this debate. I am anxious because mention has not yet been made of the problem of Irish people being unable to take holidays in this country because it is too expensive. More money is spent by Irish tourists abroad than is spent by foreign tourists here. A friend of mine was given a holiday by her three daughters. I asked her where she planned to go, knowing that she likes to holiday in Ireland. She replied that, as her daughters would not be up to the cost of a holiday here, she would go to Lanzarote. Perhaps Senator Ryan&rsquo;s restaurateur friend was better off trying to live in the Canaries for the winter because it was probably much cheaper.</P>
      <P>We totally lose the perspective that Irish people might like to holiday in Ireland. However, it is much cheaper to go abroad. I was glad Senator Feighan, Senator Daly and others stressed the positive side to holidays in Ireland. There have been improvements in restaurants, in particular. I salute Myrtle Allen who has been recognised nationally and internationally for doing so much to promote food in this country. We have come a long way. However, prices are very high and I do not believe the rather complacent speech by the Minister of State is enough to describe what is happening.</P>
      <P>I went to Copenhagen recently and there were some Finnish people on the aeroplane. I asked them if they enjoyed their holiday. They said they did and asked me if I had been to Finland. I said I had and they responded by saying that they hoped I did not find it as expensive as they found Ireland. We have a big problem because with the euro, it is much easier to compare prices. With the US dollar being in dire straits, the Americans are finding it very difficult. British people, who are very careful about looking at what value they get, are the only ones who are not having problems with money here.</P>
      <P>I was in France recently and the prices there are about half what they are here and I am not talking about family run restaurants or anything <Col N="999"/>like that. Main courses like <i>fillet de canard </i>cost &euro;8.50 and <i>fillet de sanglier</i> cost &euro;8. One would pay that for starters here. Someone from England took me to lunch in a restaurant here. I had not been there for some years and the prices were shocking. I felt I had to apologise for the prices charged. We cannot blame it all on wine which can be quite expensive abroad. Bottle for bottle, it is much the same as prices are here, although some places have high mark ups. I think people have tried to get some control over the mark ups here.</P>
      <P>In small and not only family-run hotels in France and Germany, one can have dinner, bed and breakfast, as I have just had and I can show the receipts, for &euro;120 to &euro;130 per night with wine included. I know the Ibis hotel in the centre of Amsterdam is not a smart sort of hotel but bed and breakfast costs &euro;135 per night for two people.</P>
      <P>I did not think car rental was that much dearer than in some other countries until I had a horrific experience with some French people last summer. They landed in Rosslare and hired a car there from an international firm. They drove around the country, which is what we are encouraged to ask them to do, and were returning home from Dublin. This international firm charged them &euro;80 for returning the car to another destination. I did the same in Italy some time ago and was charged &euro;10. These firms have fleets of cars in each location and one is charged &euro;10 for the paperwork. One is not charged the money for someone to drive the car back to its original destination. These French people were absolutely furious. They had inquired ahead of time whether there would be a charge and those in Rosslare told them they were not quite sure what it would be. They thought at worst it would be perhaps &euro;20 or &euro;30 but it cost &euro;80, about half what it cost to hire the car for three days. They contemplated driving back down to Wexford with the car and returning to Dublin by train which is good value, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole pointed out. However, the train is very slow and takes three hours to travel the 90 miles from Wexford to Dublin. It would really need to speed up.</P>
      <P>The regulations restaurants must put in place seem excessive whereby there must be separate lavatories from men, women, disabled people and staff. I saw the way the Italians solved this problem recently. My husband and I went in separate doors but we met on the inside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to my colleague for sharing her time and I welcome the Minister of State back to the House with which he was once so familiar. The last section of Senator Quinn&rsquo;s motion deals with capital movement and investment. The news there is not bad. I have material which suggests we experienced a 35% increase in venture capital investment in the first quarter of 2005 compared with 2004. That is good. We are now the fourth most significant destination for US manufacturing and investment overseas. That <Col N="1000"/>worries me a little politically because I think it means we lickspittle the Americans frightfully because we are terrified they will pull their investment out of Ireland, not that they would.</P>
      <P>I very much agree with Senator Henry. I listened to young people on the radio who all said they would not dream of staying in Ireland because it was far too expensive and inconvenient. Senator Henry is also right about restaurants. Last weekend I attended the most magnificent dinner in Cathal Brugha Street. The food produced by the final year students there was superb as was the service. We have certain things going for us but the expense, particularly of hotels, is terrible as is the way they treat their guests. That they insist on guests staying two nights has been highlighted regularly on radio recently. If one wants to stay only on Saturday night, the hotel will say one must stay on Friday and Saturday nights. If there are rooms available, they should be available to clients. They should not be able to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; and to gamble because it would be better to have people stay Friday and Saturday nights.</P>
      <P>I heard of somebody who had been given a voucher for &euro;600 or so. She was hit with this requirement to stay two nights, to which she agreed. However, there was an extra &euro;50 surcharge if she did not have dinner in the hotel. It is absurd to try to penalise somebody because they do not want to stay for dinner. The hotels are terrified people might go elsewhere for dinner.</P>
      <P>It sounds very much as if there is a cartel of some kind operating in Kilkenny and the Minister of State should look into that. The radio shows telephoned hotels and got the same prices each time. It is quite an extraordinary coincidence. The Competition Authority should look into that issue.</P>
      <P>The defence the hotel industry makes is that it is under pressure because it has significantly higher rates of VAT compared with other countries. There may be an element of truth in that but it also employs a significant number of young eastern Europeans. I have a very strong suspicion that it is not quite paying them the same rates it might pay other people. It is getting cheap labour, bullying its customers and giving significantly bad value.</P>
      <P>I have been travelling but a little bit more modestly than my colleague, Senator Henry. I was in Galway, a beautiful destination. I dropped into Morans of the Weir in Clarinbridge where I met a former Member of the other House. He was there with his sister and brother-in-law from America who could not wait to get back because of the prices here. They were also hit by the requirement to stay two nights. That is wrong. As Senator Quinn usually says, the customer should be king.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Independent group for tabling this motion and the Minister of State for attending. The issue of competitiveness is paramount to this economy and is of crucial national importance. Continuing to compete not only in selling our goods and services but also in attracting foreign direct investment and creating high quality jobs are the key to our future growth. Economic competitiveness is central to the prosperity and well-being of our society. Despite the tenor of the motion, the prospects for the economy remain positive. Let us not lose sight of that during this debate.</P>
      <P>There are two essential elements at which we must look. One, which is outside our control, is the nature of international events and the other is whether we can do the right things at home in terms of our economic policy. I am adamant that the right decisions are taken for Ireland into the future. The policies to date have delivered unparalleled growth and prosperity for the people. We must work to ensure this continues during the lifetime of the Government. The context of our policies is of course the international climate. Movement in international exchange rates, interest rate policy and oil prices can and do play a significant part in our economic fortunes. The Government has been obliged to steer through some significant obstacles on the international economic front. However, to date, the sound basis for our prosperity has been maintained, especially over the last seven years. The Independent group&rsquo;s motion rightly remarks on the current state of competitiveness in the Irish economy and what a remarkable state we are in.</P>
      <P>The Irish economy has achieved remarkable rates of economic growth and has recorded one of the best economic performances in the world over the past decade. It grew by an average of more than 7.5% from 1997 to 2004, while in the EU, the average growth was just over 2%. I am reminded of the speech of the chairman of the National Competitiveness Council when he warned that the competitiveness of the economy is seriously impaired by the lack of competition in many sectors. He reports that markets in which competition is weak or absent are characterised by high prices, lower output, less innovation and lower levels of buyer satisfaction. The Independent group&rsquo;s motion mirrors some of these concerns.</P>
      <P>We have a duty to protect Ireland&rsquo;s economy and a duty to promote its competitiveness. Therefore, we must examine all markets that have restricted competition. The Competition Authority believes that in many markets in Ireland, competition has been severely restricted and in some cases, totally prevented. Restrictions are said to be widespread in existing retailing, transport, banking, communications, energy and many other private and public service sectors.</P><Col N="1002"/>
      <P>I share the concerns of the Independent group and the Competition Authority also concurs. The erosion of national competitiveness can also damage our attractiveness as a destination for visitors and investment. Where market restrictions lead to high prices, action must be taken by the Government. In markets which the Competition Authority has studied in detail, it has found that restrictions imposed high prices and are disproportionate to any clear public policy objective. It is worth restating that notwithstanding the economic progress I outlined earlier, the Government is not complacent about Ireland&rsquo;s future economic well-being. It is in the business of promoting economic growth, not as an end in itself, but as a mechanism to provide social progress. National competitiveness and social progress go hand in hand.</P>
      <P>It may seem untimely to focus on emerging threats to our future prosperity. However, the 2004 competitiveness report shows that considerable pressures remain on our competitive position. The motion from the Independent group echoes the specific areas of concern highlighted by the National Competitiveness Council&rsquo;s annual report. These include the continued growth in domestic prices and wages. However, we cannot have it both ways. This country now has a minimum wage which thankfully has been increased recently. It is turning into a high-value economy. When we go abroad on business or on holidays and pay what we call lower prices, those lower prices are a reflection of the fact that we are unlikely to work for the wages on offer. We do not want to work for such wages in this country any longer. This is the situation we must address.</P>
      <P>The tourism industry is fortunate that people are willing to come to this country so that prices can remain low. We are fortunate in having such a sizeable immigrant workforce in this country to take up those jobs which Irish people no longer want. As I stated earlier, the minimum wage might have increased our prices, but we do not have to apologise for that.</P>
      <P>In the tourism sector, the issue of travel is vital. If we want to create jobs, we must ensure that we have a competitive travel industry. Only last year, we successfully unbundled Aer Rianta. We can now see the benefits that will flow to Cork and Shannon and the regions to which people will be able to fly on new routes. Had this measure not been taken, I suspect that those regions would be less well-off than they are today. I thank the Independent group for the motion it has tabled but I remain secure in the knowledge that the Government is committed to ensuring we remain competitive in the years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo the remarks of Senator Morrissey in congratulating the Independent group for tabling this motion and stimulating a debate on the important issue of competitiveness within the tourism industry, particularly as summer approaches. All Members are aware that <Col N="1003"/>tourism is vital to our economy and I understand that more than 140,000 jobs are dependent on tourism. We must focus and recognise the enormous contribution tourism makes in this to the overall number of jobs in the economy. I remember that in the early 1990s, Deputy Richard Bruton, who was then Fine Gael&rsquo;s spokesperson on employment published a document which I believe was called Towards the Jobs Economy. That economic analysis document pointed out that in the 1980s and early 1990s, our problem was an inability to concentrate on doing things at which we excelled. Traditionally, one activity at which we excel has been the production of an excellent quality tourism product in which people from north America, Europe and the UK enjoy coming here to participate.</P>
      <P>However, in reality, perception is everything. The perception is that over the past number of years, Ireland has ceased to become the kind of destination people wish to visit because of the price hikes people see all around them. Senator Quinn makes a valid point when he highlights the fact that the American Express holiday cost of living index puts us in the invidious position of being second last only to Norway. This is a serious indicator for a country that depends so much on tourism as a revenue source. The Government must take note of this in the weeks and months ahead.</P>
      <P>As Senator Daly might be aware, I visit County Clare every year with my family, usually for the month of August. He will be glad to hear that I enjoy it and only go to County Clare for my summer holidays. I do not spend an enormous amount of money there, but do my bit to contribute to the local north Clare economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>One gets good value for money in County Clare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I am always stung for money there. However, last year while on holiday, I met another Dubliner who also takes his family there every year. He made the point to me that while he did not mind paying for things, he hated being screwed. Many people who holiday in Ireland feel they are screwed on a regular basis, whether it is eating out, the cost of accommodation or the jacked-up prices during the summer months for tourist attractions. This is the perception and while one might argue whether it is reality, it is as far as the product consumer is concerned. We must concentrate on this.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris also made a valid point. The vast majority of people who work in the hotel industry do not come from Ireland but are from the new EU accession states or are here because they have work visas and are paid very small sums of money. Guests pay enormous sums of money for this product on a nightly basis, but as far as the people who actually make the beds and prepare the food are concerned, historically the catering and tourist industries are one of the <Col N="1004"/>worst payers in the country. Someone is making a substantial killing from this and it is certainly not the people who work in the hotel industry.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to thank people from other countries who have made the Irish tourist industry such a success in recent years. In years gone by, many students or younger people used to take up those jobs. However, they no longer do this because, as Senator Morrissey has noted, such jobs do not pay massive sums of money. We should thank people who have come to this country for all kinds of reasons &mdash; Latvians, Estonians or people from the other accession states &mdash; and work in our tourism and catering industries doing so much to promote Irish tourism. This point must be made.</P>
      <P>It is essential that we do much more to stimulate interest in the UK market if we are serious about delivering this product and getting more people to visit Ireland. I understand that the UK market cumulatively amounts to &euro;2 billion worth of investment in terms of the Irish tourism industry every year, yet I understand that the amount we spend on marketing in the UK is pathetic compared with the amount of trade we receive from there. There is an enormous untapped market in the UK in terms of weekend products, golfing products and week-long holidays and we need to market these. A key aspect is the increase in low fares airlines flying to Ireland, particularly to destinations outside Dublin.</P>
      <P>I wish to do everything in my power to support the Irish tourism industry. I enjoy taking holidays in Ireland every year but we must drive down prices acriss the board so that the perception of Ireland as an expensive country is challenged and met by a range of strategies to drive down prices in the tourism industry. The reason why many people from North America are not coming to Ireland is primarily due to the change in the relationship between the dollar and the euro. However, we were too reliant on the North American market for many years. Tourists from North America were big spenders who stayed in the top hotels and we made enormous sums of money from that aspect of the industry. We may well have to venture abroad and look to new markets. One market that we must focus is the UK and I would ask the Minister to take that on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s statement to the House this evening gave us an indication of the affluent base that we are now looking at. This has its own impact on tourism. If one looks back at the tourism industry in the 1950s, 1960s and even into the 1970s, it was totally different. It was more folksy and much of the tourism trade that Ireland received at that time was largely from Irish-Americans. They felt an affinity with and loyalty to Ireland. To some extent, they regarded visiting Ireland as returning home and making a contribution to the Irish economy rather than as just a holiday.</P><Col N="1005"/>
      <P>In the years since then, we have become a very sophisticated country in many ways. Our infrastructure has changed and developed at a cost to both the State and private investors. The standards that have been achieved in our tourism industry are in many ways the envy of other countries. How many countries have sent delegations to Ireland over the years to study our tourism industry?</P>
      <P>On many occasions, the tourism industry was regarded as the jewel in the crown of the Irish economy. The industry was met with many challenges during that time, whether they were international affairs, a US presidential election, the foot and mouth crisis or the Troubles. When one travelled abroad and talked to local people, one realised that attracting tourists to Ireland on a loyalty basis was not as easy as it had once been. One had to attract them for other reasons. However, if one looks at the status of Ireland internationally from sports, arts and other perspectives, it is now ranked among the largest countries in the world in terms of recognition even though it is a very small nation. This can be a marketing tool as borne out by the amount of exposure Ireland gained from hosting the Eurovision Song Contest.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, all of these achievements cost money and someone has to foot the bill. Very often, it is the private investor, as well as the State, who has to pay. It is a matter of finding out whether we are getting value for money and comparing like with like. It makes no sense to compare different things. I have heard cases of people having a meal in a five-star hotel and stating that the meal would be much cheaper in the United States. However, they may be comparing the meal with a meal at a fast food outlet or a meal in a bar. I would ask them to compare it with the meals they can get in Irish pubs and the value of that. A high quality single course meal in many Irish pubs will only set a person back &euro;8 or &euro;9. This is the type of comparison that must be made.</P>
      <P>The days of family-run hotels are virtually gone. Like the religious orders running schools, running a hotel for these people was a vocation. They enjoyed the work and did not mind working long hours. It now has to be worth people&rsquo;s time to work in the tourism industry because unemployment levels are so low, at approximately<?oasys _jy?>4%. People have a selection of jobs they can enter, which must be paid for.</P>
      <P>We must ask whether we are prepared to lower standards in order to lower prices. We all know there will be a certain amount of people who will exploit situations but I think they are in a minority. I could be generalising slightly but most people I have met in the tourism industry are very committed, particularly if they are the owners of product. They are anxious to make the best presentation. How many times have Irish people apologised to tourists for our bad weather to be met with the reply that they did not come <Col N="1006"/>here for the weather, rather they came for the people.</P>
      <P>If one looks back at one of the major surveys that examined the preference of tourists, 67% said that the top attraction for them was national monuments. A survey was conducted recently on national monuments, many of which are saturated with tourists. A recent report recommended that there should be a cut-off point with regard to the number of visitors to the Rock of Cashel, which receives approximately 250,000 visitors per year, because the rock is being damaged. The same applies to Muckross House and possibly to Kilkenny Castle. It appears that there are at least four national monuments where tourist numbers are at saturation point. This finding does not indicate that the product is not being used. However, there are many other national monument attractions, many of which can be visited for free or for &euro;3 or &euro;4.</P>
      <P>I accept that food and accommodation are important considerations for tourists but there are many competitively priced attractions in Ireland. I do not wish to disregard the index or the survey that we were discussing but I accept the Minister&rsquo;s point. I do not believe the survey is very scientific because of the number of countries surveyed and the survey method, which involved the use of shopping baskets. If that is a fair indicator, why are tourist figures rising? Why do we see figures of 5% or 6% even in the most challenging times for tourism?</P>
      <P>We need to be careful that we do not shoot ourselves in the foot. There is always the danger that we will overemphasise one of our negative aspects. This is acceptable if it is done within a controlled situation like a board meeting, a committee or tourism agencies, but if it is done outside, it can generate negative publicity about the country and deter possible visitors. No business in a competitive world would begin by undermining itself. This does not mean that we should not examine faults and difficulties; we should do so. I agree with Senator Daly that there are areas that need support.</P>
      <P>Bed and breakfast establishments need support, an issue that is commonly ignored. Over the years, some of the best value could be found in bed and breakfasts. These establishments were located throughout the country. Many people invested both time and service in them. I do not think huge profits were ever made out of bed and breakfasts but a way needs to be found to help them.</P>
      <P>When the Convention Bureau of Ireland and Dublin Tourism &mdash; two organisations I would praise &mdash; came before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, I made the point that Dublin is saturated with tourists. I do not think it is good for people living in Dublin and tourists. Dublin Tourism and the Convention Bureau of Ireland should not be blamed for this state of affairs, rather we should look at the tour operators. Why have they changed their practice <Col N="1007"/>and begun to ignore the rest of Ireland? We need to examine the reasons behind this change of mind on the part of tour operators. There are people who do not regard the capital city as &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo;. It is an important experience but should not be the totality of people&rsquo;s experiences. We must get back to basics and examine why these changes have taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to debate the issue of competitiveness in general, with specific reference to the Irish tourism industry. I support this motion in the name of the Independent Senators. I wish to cover a number of areas but previous speakers referred to my own neck of the woods, Kilkenny city, and its situation as highlighted on the national airwaves over the past number of weeks, particularly on &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; on Radio 1. I reaffirm that the booking of hotels for single nights in Kilkenny is a major difficulty at weekend periods. I was surprised to read in some of the local media in recent weeks that a number of representatives of the city&rsquo;s hotel federation are expressing their opinion that there are enough beds to accommodate the visitors that wish to visit at any time of the year. From the examples that have been given here and in different local and national media, this is clearly not the case and there must be a significant expansion in the number of beds. Kilkenny is not unique but I want to put my personal views on the subject on record.</P>
      <P>I am somewhat disappointed by the nature of the amendment. As an Opposition speaker, I would prefer a much stronger tone in the motion tabled by the Independent Senators. Over the course of recent years I have raised this issue at every opportunity in the House in my capacity as spokesperson on finance and, previously, as spokesperson on tourism for Fine Gael. I am disappointed the Government is seeking to defeat this motion, which clearly flies in the face of what most of the Government Senators have said tonight and what the Government has said in its own programme for Government, wherein it has acknowledged serious issues exist in regard to competitiveness. However, it has taken little if any action to reverse the backward steps we have been taking in the past few years.</P>
      <P>The tourism sector is important to this country as there are over 140,000 people employed in the industry. Opposition Senators who have outlined the situations that have arisen and the cost factors that play havoc with the tourism sector are correct. I was amused and surprised by the tone of Senator Morrissey&rsquo;s contribution on the minimum wage. I welcomed the introduction of the minimum wage, as it was right to do so. Virtually all of European countries measured in the report referred to by Senator Quinn have minimum wages. Why do the Government and Government Senators say we have high costs in tourism because we have a minimum wage and that other countries have minimum wages that are lower <Col N="1008"/>than here? Why is the minimum wage at its current level? The reason is the cost of living. The minimum wage is currently appropriate but the Government is not doing anything to tackle the underlying causes of the high cost of living in this country. Everybody is affected by the high cost of living, whether tourists entering Ireland or Irish people who want to spend some time visiting different parts of the country.</P>
      <P>This is a cyclical argument. If the overall level of wages increases, the costs within the economy will increase also. A halt must be called at some point, which is the role of Government. Neither the Government, through the remarks of the Minister of State, nor Government Senators have said this is the time to think seriously about this problem which has emerged starkly in the past few years. Ireland has gone from fourth in 2000 to 30th in 2004 in the World Economic Forum&rsquo;s global competitiveness report. I do not know our exact ranking now but I do not think it has improved. Why was there such a dramatic downturn in our competitiveness in such a relatively brief period of time? From the perspective of the Government, there does not seem to be any clear thinking as to why this problem has emerged.</P>
      <P>The National Competitiveness Council has said that Irish prices rose by 22% more than those in other EU countries in the years 1999 to 2003. It is not good enough to suggest, as Senator Morrissey and others have done, that these are the problems of success. The economy had improved significantly in those few years but these are serious issues that have not been addressed by the Government in recent times. Some action must be taken sooner than the budget announcement at the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Ireland suffers more than most other European countries because we have the second highest VAT rate in the euro zone for hotel accommodation and eating out. This is why such costs are comparatively high, a point referred to by other Senators. However, the Government has not taken any of the opportunities presented to it by Finance Bills and budgets of recent years to act. I regret that the Government has not done so but hope it will reverse its engines sooner rather than later. We should not need to wait until the next budget. I thank Senator Quinn and the other Independent Senators for raising this important issue. We should have debates on competitiveness and the issues surrounding it more often. I am glad to have availed of the opportunity this evening.</P>

	<P>Senator Quinn was keen to merge the proposal and the amendment but I could not contact the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, as he is out of the <Col N="1009"/>country. The Cabinet is currently sitting and I cannot legitimately change an amendment that came from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>We must treat surveys with some caution. The Minister of State made the point that this American Express survey is very unscientific. The World Economic Forum global competitiveness report must also be taken with a pinch of salt. We have low unemployment, an excellent financial situation and great strengths in our economy. If one goes back less than 20 years, we had fewer than 2 million visitors to this country annually. We now have well over 6 million and, despite a dip in 2001 and 2002 due to events beyond our control such as those of 11 September 2001 and the foot and mouth disease scare, we are back on a growth path of 6%.</P>
      <P>A problem concerning the balance between Dublin and the other regions of the country must be addressed. I will play devil&rsquo;s advocate. For example, an article in today&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Times </i>makes a point that was also raised on the Order of Business. For 1,000 litres of automotive oil the cost is &euro;992 here but in Britain or the North, which is one of our main markets for tourism, the cost is &euro;1,320.60. This is a big difference.</P>

	<P>Our hotels have improved their competitiveness <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> bed and breakfast accommodation. Ten or 15 years ago, hotel accommodation cost much more in real terms than it does today. Unfortunately, that has tended to squeeze out bed and breakfasts. As Senator O&rsquo;Toole pointed out, a 100 mile or 200 mile journey by rail is much cheaper in Ireland than it is in Britain. We should not paint a completely negative picture. However, there are some negative aspects. Car hire in this country is quite expensive. I recently had direct experience of this in Killarney.</P>

      <P>I have spent a holiday here for at least one week for 40 or 50 years and I urge everyone to spend at least part of their holidays at home. There are fantastic places throughout the country, which could renew one in all sorts of ways. We have the cleanest waters in western Europe. They may not be as warm as the Mediterranean but they are cleaner. A good swim in July, August or September is a grand experience. It might even help to alleviate the obesity problem a little.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>Why did the Senator pick July to September?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I heard the Leader explain why she believes there is a difficulty. If the motion is acceptable to the Government side, from my point of view the amendment is acceptable. I thank Members for contributing to this positive debate and I wonder whether there should be a vote.</P>
      <P>I tabled the motion because of the complacency that exists. Senators Mansergh and &Oacute; Murch&uacute; referred to the fact that these surveys are not very scientific. I am aware from my experience in the grocery business that one always criticises surveys one does not like and one is thrilled when one is satisfied with the results of a survey. The problem is the headline in the newspaper, &ldquo;Ireland is the world&rsquo;s second most expensive place to visit&rdquo;. When one comes out badly in the grocery business, one keeps quiet but those who come out well shout from the rooftops. Spain and other countries will shout from the rooftops about how expensive Ireland is. They will say that people should visit them rather than going to Ireland.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to hear the Minister, Senator Morrissey and others say that the answer is not necessarily in the Government&rsquo;s hands. However, it can do something about national competitiveness. It announced today that there will be a new national consumer agency and that it will strengthen the Competition Authority. To a large extent, customers rule.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred to the fact that the Government can do something about the whole question of red tape and regulatory analysis. He told a story about the toilets in a sandwich bar. Senator Henry referred to her experience of male and female toilets. When her husband went in the male door and she went in the female door, they met inside in one toilet. The Government should carry out an impact analysis on the effect of regulations coming before it. This also applies to the minimum wage, to which Senator John Paul Phelan referred. Some jobs exist at a certain level that do not exist at another level. If we have the highest minimum wage in the world, there is a danger that some services cannot be offered. Some years ago, when one pulled up for petrol, someone served it, but once the minimum wage came in, it was no longer possible to have someone serve petrol. It is not a great loss but it means that jobs for people who used to do this work no longer exist.</P>
      <P>The debate will have been useful if it removes some of the complacency. The Minister of State gave figures on national competitiveness from 2003. I am not concerned about what happened in 2003. I am concerned about what is happening now. The Government should not be looking back by saying the figures were good two years ago. We must ensure we are competitive and do not become complacent. We must recognise that this challenge is in our own hands and is not necessarily in the hands of the Government.</P>
      <P>An English visitor who came here recently went to a restaurant in Dublin and was surprised <Col N="1011"/>that the bill was quite expensive. When he got back home and examined his Visa bill, he was surprised the Dublin restaurant had charged him in sterling. I was not aware one could do this, but it happened. Because it was a London-based visa card, they were able to charge sterling or euro. This Dublin restaurant charged in sterling on the visa card. This person will not go back to that restaurant. He ate in a different restaurant the following night.</P>
      <P>I welcome the debate tonight and thank the Senators who contributed. I hope we can remove the complacency that exists, not as a result of the survey, but as a result of the publicity it is likely to receive worldwide. I would like to see the tourism business in Ireland thrive in the future. Senator Henry said more Irish are now travelling abroad than there are tourists coming here. We spend more abroad than they spend with us, which is a serious reflection on this country. In other words, this is a tourism industry in which we are losing rather than gaining. This is a challenge about which we must do something and tonight&rsquo;s debate might help in some small way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, for selecting this matter. I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Callely, to the House to reply to it.</P>
      <P>It is not usually my form to raise on the Adjournment a particular matter concerning one individual. However, the reason I am raising this matter on the Adjournment is that the parents of this child have hit rock bottom in terms of their communications with the Department and the school. For the past number of years, the school has been asking the Department to provide the child in question with a special needs assistant. The child&rsquo;s parents recently told me they were prepared to remortgage their house to get the income required to provide their child with the kind of special needs assistance the State should provide.</P>
      <P>The child, who is seven years of age, suffers from autism and attends a school in Rathgar where all his needs are currently being met. However, it is the opinion of the school, the parents and the teachers that the child requires a special needs assistant. Over the past two years <Col N="1012"/>the school, which operates in unique circumstances, has applied to the Department of Education and Science and it has asked the Department to reply to this application. In each year that application has been turned down.</P>
      <P>I make these remarks against the context of the recent announcement by the Minister for Education and Science regarding the provision of additional permanent teaching posts in respect of special needs, which is very welcome. This child&rsquo;s needs are unique. We have an obligation to respond to this school which has been making this application for the past two years. The Lucena Clinic in Tallaght issued a psychological report on this child recently which describes his condition as autistic spectrum disorder. This entails severe receptive and expressive language disorder. The lengthy report concludes with the recommendation that the results of the assessment may be used to support the school&rsquo;s application for a special needs assistant for the child.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister of State to take note of what I have said this evening, to follow through on the school&rsquo;s application for a special needs assistant for this child, and to ensure that the Department will fully meet the needs of the child and the parents. This will give him the help he needs to avail of educational opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my good friend and fellow Clontarf man, Senator Brian Hayes, for affording me the opportunity to outline the position of the Department of Education and Science on this issue. The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, would be here if she could but she is attending to other business.</P>
      <P>I regret the comments made by Senator Brian Hayes because I agree that parents should not have to hit rock bottom in cases of this nature. One would like to see the necessary supports in place. We all subscribe to the principle of early intervention and the benefits it provides.</P>
      <P>The school, which the pupil to whom the Senator referred attends, is a special school, catering for pupils with emotional difficulties. It has an enrolment of 60 pupils. The school is under the patronage of the St. John of God Order and shares a campus with the Lucena Clinic. The Lucena Clinic provides a support service to the school and the community and focuses particularly on children who have experienced trauma, abuse and-or mental health problems.</P>
      <P>The school has the services of a principal, ten class teachers and 11 special needs assistants to cater for the care needs of the pupils in the school. The pupil teacher ratio ranges from 6:1 to 8:1 depending on the disability category of the pupils. The Department of Education and Science applied for an individual special needs assistant for the pupil in question. The Department, however, considered that it should be possible for the school to cater for this pupil&rsquo;s care needs from within the significant special needs assistant support already available. The school&rsquo;s <Col N="1013"/>special needs assistant allocation is in line with the recommendations of the report of the special education review committee.</P>
      <P>The National Council for Special Education has taken over responsibility for processing resource applications for children with special educational needs. One of its specific functions in this regard is responsibility for making decisions on applications for special needs assistant support. Under these new arrangements, the council, through the local special educational needs organiser, processes applications for special educational needs supports and informs schools of the outcome.</P>
      <P>In the case of decisions on resource teaching and special needs assistant support, the special educational needs organiser outlines the process to both the school and the parents of the child involved, where appropriate, and will at the end of the process outline the basis on which the decision was made. Officials at the Department of Education and Science are making arrangements for the local special educational needs organiser to examine the application to which the Senator referred. The special educational needs organiser will visit the school at the earliest opportunity.</P>
      <P>The Senator referred to the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to address the issue of education for those with special needs. The Department is anxious to ensure that special education support services are properly targeted at the children who require them and that the substantially increased resources being made available in the special educational area have the desired effect of ensuring that all children assessed as having special needs receive the support they require. I hope this clarifies the position for the Senator and that there is a successful and speedy outcome to the case he has raised. I will discuss the matter with the Minister and will keep an eye on developments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek an update on the need for refurbishment work to be carried out at St. Brigid&rsquo;s school in Palmerstown. I have visited the school and seen that there is much work to be done, for example, to repair ceilings and ventilation and so on. It is a good school, housed in an old building and this refurbishment is urgently needed to bring it up to the required standard for the teachers and pupils. They have waited a long time for this work although work has been carried out at many other schools in the vicinity. I hope the Minister of State will give a positive response to this request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to respond positively to Senator Tuffy&rsquo;s matter. We all acknowledge and recognise the importance of the work undertaken by the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin and her predecessor, Deputy Noel Dempsey, in addressing work of this nature. Since the beginning of the year the Minister has <Col N="1014"/>made several announcements regarding the schools building and modernisation programme. This year alone, &euro;270 million will be allocated to primary schools and &euro;223 million to post-primary schools for building works. This represents an increase of 14% on the 2004 allocation.</P>
      <P>The programmes supported will include the following: 141 major building projects already on site and more due to go on site soon; 122 major school building projects countrywide which will go to tender and construction during 2005 or early 2006; 192 primary schools which have been invited to take part in the small and rural schools initiative and the devolved scheme for providing additional accommodation; up to 120 schools which have been given approval to rent temporary premises pending delivery of a permanent solution to their long-term accommodation needs; 43 schools which have been authorised to start architectural planning of their major projects; 590 schools which were recently given approval to complete essential small-scale projects under the summer works scheme; and 124 schools to progress through architectural planning.</P>
      <P>The new schools building and modernisation programme, 2005-09, will be underpinned not just by a significant increase in overall funding but also by major improvements in the administration of the funding. Devolving more funding to local level through the summer works scheme and the small and rural schools initiative will allow schools to move ahead more quickly with smaller projects. The list I outlined shows many projects are moving forward, a development that will continue.</P>
      <P>The authorities at St Brigid&rsquo;s national school applied for major refurbishment works or permanent accommodation in April 1999. The project was given a band 2.3 rating by the Department in accordance with the published criteria for prioritising large-scale projects in 2005. The Department of Education and Science has included the building project for St. Brigid&rsquo;s national school, Palmerstown, in the recently announced list of school projects to be progressed through architectural planning in 2005.</P>
      <P>A design team has been appointed and has submitted stages 1, 2 and 3 of architectural planning, detailed plans and costs. The building unit&rsquo;s technical staff have examined the submission and on 5 May 2005 the school authorities were requested to instruct their design team to submit a revised stages 1, 2 and 3 submission. This submission is awaited. It appears there have been some changes to the school since the design team submitted its original report. Therefore, it is necessary for the school&rsquo;s architect to amend some of the proposed layout to reflect this.</P>
      <P>A decision on which school building projects will advance to tender and construction as part of the 2006 schools building and modernisation programme will be taken later in the year. I hope the information I have given to Senator Tuffy is helpful.</P>

    <Title>Child Care Facilities.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome my friend and colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Callely, to the House. I declare an interest in that I am chairman of the County Leitrim child care committee with which I am proud to be associated since it was statutorily set up. I am also the parent of a special needs child and consequently would have a wider agenda in terms of the provision of child care facilities. I am pleased to say the Department has substantially funded and supported, from its inception, the provision of a state-of-the-art child care facility in Drumshanbo, County Leitrim, my home town, at a cost in excess of &euro;1 million. The facility is progressing satisfactorily with in excess of 100 children being catered for throughout the day from pre-school through to after-school service in one part of the building, while a special needs class operates under the &ldquo;childhood days&rdquo; banner in other part of the building.</P>
      <P>The facility, which is based on a voluntary organisation is run voluntarily and, therefore, the prices for child care facilities reflect its voluntary nature, although run on a professional basis. The centre is in the process of applying for a further &euro;750,000 for a proposed extension. This is a reflection of the wider demand across the country that a small town with some 1,300 people on the register is able to cater for that number of children in its catchment area and also has a waiting list.</P>
      <P>A study was carried out on behalf of counties Leitrim, Sligo and Donegal child care committees to establish benchmarking for childminders which is a growing part of child care provision. Under the equal opportunities childcare programme the Department is actively encouraging more qualified childminders to take on this role. In Leitrim, which has a dispersed population as has Donegal and parts of Sligo, childminding initiatives are vital for the provision of a first class standardised child care service.</P>
      <P>In the context of the study visit, certain recommendations were brought forward which I passed on to the Department to help it formulate a response. It recommended that formal networks be established in the north west similar to those in the UK which are nationally recognised. The following measures need to be taken. There is a need for a national registration of all child minders irrespective of the number of children they mind. Implementation of this recommendation would streamline the child minding sector as there would be no difference between a notified or non-notified child minder. National registration for all childminders would also be an enticement for the childminder to operate within the formal economy. A national quality standard needs to be established in this area. It is recommended that one Department take on an inspectorate role with a separate brief for childminders, as distinct from the provision of child care facilities. Criminal record checks for all adults over 16 years of age who reside in the home where a child <Col N="1016"/>care service is carried out have obvious benefits. A tax credit for parents who use registered child minders as an incentive for parents to use quality child care should form part of the Government&rsquo;s approach to encouraging more people to take on a childminding role in their homes. The training structures which are in operation should be revised to offer accredited progression paths for child minders to tie in with the FETAC accreditation in child care at level 3. Level 3 is the optimum at which childminders operate.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the County Leitrim partnership, in association with my child care committee, which continues to organise courses for those wishing to enter the childminder and child care field by providing FETAC awards at levels 1, 2 and 3. This will apply to childminders who are the managers of home-based child care services. It is suggested that implementation of these measures would professionalise home-based child care. Formal networks can provide monitored quality tailored to local needs. They can be seen as a progression in networking which is a further option for quality improvement.</P>
      <P>It is also recommended that the establishment of one-stop-shops for children would further support quality child care and that membership of the NICMA by Donegal, Leitrim and Sligo child care committees as a quality partner would enable them to receive regular newsletters and information about childminding in the UK, which is the benchmark. The report on which these recommendations were based has been passed on to Childminding Ireland to assist its strategic work on policy development within the child minding sector and to explore further ideas for 2006. I hope these recommendations, which form part of the study visit and which were financed by the three child care committees in question, would help in the further development of child care facilities and childminding in Ireland which, as the Minister of State is aware, is the single biggest issue facing parents across the country, alongside the delivery of other services.</P>
      <P>Since the establishment of the equal opportunities childcare programme in 1997, significant amounts of money have been provided for child minding. There is also the recent promise of Exchequer funding which means we will not have to wait for what is coming from Europe. I would like to think the future for the expansion of child care and childminding facilities in Ireland is rosy. I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to respond to the matter raised on the Adjournment by my good friend and colleague, Senator Mooney. I take this opportunity to congratulate him and the other members of his child care committee. The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is aware of the commitment, interest and work of Senator Mooney in the area of child care and the work of his committee. I congratulate the Senator and ask him to keep up the good work.</P><Col N="1017"/>
      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, would like to be here but is involved in other business and has asked me to apologise on his behalf. It may be helpful to know that the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has not formally received a copy of the report to which the Senator referred and is not aware of the views of the Health Service Executive on the recommendations contained therein.</P>
      <P>The main recommendation in the report which relates to the Department of Health and Children is that there be a national registration of all childminders irrespective of the number of children they mind. The position is that the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations 1996 and amendment regulations 1997, give effect to the provisions of Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991 and provide for notification to, and inspection by, the Health Service Executive of pre-school services. The regulations apply to pre-schools, play groups, day nurseries, cr&egrave;ches, child minders looking after more than three children and other similar services which cater for children under six years of age.</P>
      <P>Childminders who care for not more than three pre-school children of different families, a sibling group or children of relatives are exempt from notification requirements and inspection requirements of the Child Care Act 1991 and the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations 1996 and amendment regulations 1997. New primary legislation would be required in order to introduce a requirement for such childminders to notify and be inspected or to introduce a registration system for such childminders, as referred to by Senator Mooney.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is aware of Senator Mooney&rsquo;s interest in this area. His Department has commenced a review of the preschool regulations due to be completed shortly. This may provide the opportunity to consider some of the issues raised validly by the Senator.</P>
      <P>A voluntary notification and support system for which funding was provided by the Department of Health and Children is in place aimed at childminders of preschool children who are not covered by existing legislation. These are childminders looking after three or fewer preschool children, a sibling group, or children of relatives, in the childminder&rsquo;s own home. Childminder advisory officers are employed to work specifically with such childminders. Their role includes providing information, facilitating the establishment of networks and organising training on relevant topics for childminders as well as providing advisory visits to the homes of childminders in order to assist them in developing best practice.</P>
      <P>The authors of this study visit report are employed in that capacity. The childminder advisory officers also work closely with the county child care committees. I note that other recommendations relate to tax credits for parents who <Col N="1018"/>use childminders and to a training structure for childminders.</P>
      <P>In previous years I availed of childminders. Tax credits for parents availing of child care and training issues for the child care sector are broader issues requiring consideration. I congratulate and thank Senator Mooney for bringing this matter to the attention of the House. The Senator may be interested to note that following a decision of the Cabinet committee on children, a high level group, chaired by the National Children&rsquo;s Office, NCO, was established to consider the issue of co-ordination in the early childhood care and education areas and the national policy implications arising from the OECD thematic review of the area.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the high level group on early childhood care and education are to recommend an integrated national policy on child care and early education which will result in improved co-ordination at national and local level and which incorporates a child-centred approach to service delivery. The group is chaired by the National Children&rsquo;s Office and comprises representatives of the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children, Education and Science, Social and Family Affairs, Finance and the centre for early childhood development and care. The high level group is due to report back to the Cabinet committee on children in July 2005. The report will include consideration of key policy issues in regard to the development of early childhood care and education in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The report referred to by the Senator also recommends criminal record checks on all adults over 16 years of age who reside in the home where a child care service is delivered. In this regard, on the basis of a working group on vetting report, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, announced last autumn on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the provision of additional staff resources for the Garda central vetting unit to enable the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s vetting services to be extended to all persons working with children and vulnerable adults. The announcement implements one of the key recommendations on vetting by the working group. The other practical recommendations are being brought forward by an implementation group chaired by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and comprising representatives of the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Education and Science, the Department of Finance, the Office of the Attorney General and the voluntary sector.</P>
      <P>The extension of the services of the Garda central unit will commence in the course of this year, as soon as the necessary practical arrangements are in place and public announcements will be made in this regard in due course. The extension of the vetting services to cover family members of child minders may be considered in the future subject to available resources.</P><Col N="1019"/>
      <P>The report makes other recommendations relating to membership of the National Childminding Association, UK, NCMA, presenting the report to Childminding Ireland and a suggested collaborative project, which the authors may wish to follow up with the Health Service Executive and the county child care committees.</P>
      <P>I am well aware, as is the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, of the valuable contribution which childminders make to child care in Ireland by caring for young children in a home-like setting. Material gathered by the Central Statistics Office under a special module of the quarterly national household survey, shows that childminding is the child care option chosen by many parents in Ireland. It may be delivered by relatives or by private childminders and through the formal economy or the informal economy.</P>
      <P>Apart from the development of new centre-based child care services and the support of community based not-for-profit services which make child care services available to very disadvantaged families, the equal opportunities childcare programme, or EOCP, which is operated by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform with EU and Exchequer funding also puts considerable resources into the enhancement of quality throughout the child care sector. This includes a number of initiatives which specifically support and enhance the quality of child care provided by childminders.</P>
      <P>Since 2002, the city and county child care committees have received funding for childminding initiatives, specifically to provide training, information and networking opportunities for childminders. From 2004, this effort was supplemented by a new initiative which provides each committee with funding for a small grant scheme for childminders who attend a quality awareness programme on key elements of child care delivery.</P>
      <P>The grant scheme provides grants of up to &euro;630 to childminders, to cover quality and/or safety <Col N="1020"/>enhancement costs. The key aims of the quality awareness programme is to bring childminders up to date with current thinking in the sector and to encourage them to consider formal training. There has been a high level of take-up in respect of the quality awareness programme &mdash; higher in fact than for the grants &mdash; and this is a heartening indication that childminders across the country are eager to further improve the quality of the services they provide.</P>
      <P>The programme also supports Childminding Ireland which was founded in 1983 as a professional association of childminders who are self-employed and work in their own homes. Along with six other national voluntary child care organisations, the programme funds them on the basis of annual action plans they submit to promote quality in the child care sector. Childminding Ireland has proved a valuable partner in the promotion of higher standards among childminders.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform believe the acknowledged success of such initiatives will enhance the quality of care for all the children cared for by childminders who benefit from the training, networking and other opportunities which they receive under activities supported under the EOCP and that this will enhance the quality of life of the childminders who will no longer operate in isolation. I hope this information is helpful to Senator Mooney. Working with our colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, I have no doubt we can make further progress in this area.</P>
