	<P>I have received notice from Senator Ulick Burke that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to indicate the forms of public transport, both rural and urban, that will be wheelchair accessible when the current Disability Bill is enacted.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Kitt of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to provide capital funding to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann for the five stages of the western rail corridor.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Leyden of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to review the procedures governing the making of wills and the desirability of providing a national registration system for wills.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, a referral motion whereby the subject matter of No. 14 on today&rsquo;s Order Paper is being referred to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights for consideration, to be taken without debate; No. 2, Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Bill 2004 &mdash; Committee Stage, to be taken at 3.15 p.m. until 5 p.m; and No. 3, Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Bill 2004 &mdash; Report and Final Stages, to be taken from 5 p.m. until 6 p.m.</P>
      <P>No. 1 is a motion regarding a proposal for a directive which aims at promoting the use of mediation in civil and commercial matters. It contains a number of important provisions dealing with the enforceability of mediation settlements, <Col N="850"/>the admissibility of evidence in civil proceedings and so on. The proposed regulation provides for a specific small claims procedure to be available in all member states as an option for those who are seeking a court decision in respect of a small claim that is capable of being specified in terms of a particular amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader may be aware the Government recently established a task force on student behaviour. I understand the task force is due to produce a report in June before its final report in the autumn. Teacher unions have raised the issue of school discipline and student behaviour in view of the small number of violent attacks on teachers and students in the classroom and the low-level disruption evident in some schools. In this context, will the Leader organise a debate to be attended by the Minister for Education and Science for a consideration of this issue?</P>
      <P>Today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> covers a report from the National Educational Welfare Board which expresses concern about children who are expelled. This is an issue that concerns us all. However, I am more concerned about the vast majority of students and teachers who want to work and study in a safe and peaceful environment. We must speak up for those students and for the teachers who have a difficult job to do. I only recently became aware that under the Education Act 1998, parents now have a right of ultimate appeal to the Department of Education and Science if they disagree with the expulsion of their child. Schools should have autonomy in this area to decide whether it is safe and proper that a particular pupil should remain in attendance. I am opposed to the notion that the Department can act as a final arbiter in such matters.</P>
      <P>We must be clear in our response to bad behaviour. The main losers are students who work hard in difficult environments. We must stand up for them and for teachers who are doing a difficult job. There is no doubt we must put in place many different alternatives for children who cannot attend school for whatever reason but we must focus on those students and teachers who study and work hard. They deserve our full support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has outlined the reason teachers so deserve their benchmarking payments.</P>

	<P>Exactly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Is this a response from the chianti-drinking socialists?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Brian Hayes has that phrase incorrect. It should be &ldquo;chianti-swilling socialists&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The report on the western rail corridor was published last week. I remind the Leader of her commitment to a debate on this issue and ask that she arrange it as soon as possible. It is important to show there is political support for the possibilities and potential which can be unlocked through the publication of this report.</P>
      <P>The national report on obesity and related matters has been much in the news over the last 24 hours. It would be helpful if the Leader were to ascertain from the authors of this report the country in which the review of primary schools was undertaken. In which schools can we find the vending machines which the report recommends should be banned? Did the authors notice that the vast majority of primary schools do not have GP rooms and that many of those that do are obliged to use those rooms as classrooms? Are they aware that in many areas, providing for physical education becomes impossible in any type of inclement weather and that there are significant difficulties of insurance, location and logistics in organising games, even large-scale games such as those organised by Dublin and Cork city councils? Whereas the ideas are good and would be supported by the education community, work is being done free gratis through voluntary contributions from teachers, parents, school management and, sometimes, the support of local clubs. A debate on this matter would be helpful in order to point out how proposals may be made to work. Physical education is possible in primary schools, as is an interest in games but we need to explore various aspects. Account must be taken of children who are not proficient at competitive games, do not like physical force games or have other interests. Various activities, from croquet to GAA, should be considered to give a child the outlet he or she requires. These actions call for political will but do not require significant sums of money. Teachers will be delighted to become involved.</P>
      <P>Some years ago, I proposed in this House that a games co-ordinator for primary and post-primary schools should be employed in every area. It would be helpful if this was so in the context of the important issues which are now faced. I call for a debate on this aspect of the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I would also like to debate the issues raised by Senator O&rsquo;Toole regarding the report of the national task force on obesity. Yesterday, the Taoiseach said he found it shocking that children are not allowed to run around school playgrounds because of fears of litigation. This news is neither shocking nor new. The play policy of the National Children&rsquo;s Office, which was published some years ago, found that litigation was forcing schools to curtail play. Play benefits many children who might not excel at sports as it provides a less rigidly organised learning opportunity. It is important that we try to tackle this problem.</P><Col N="852"/>
      <P>This issue is not confined to schools. In the context of play policy and playgrounds, the National Children&rsquo;s Office found that Ireland contains more golf courses than children&rsquo;s playgrounds. While approximately one golf course exists per 10,000 people, one playground exists per 24,000. I would welcome a debate on this issue.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise the report of the World Economic Forum on gender equality, which found that Ireland is 51st of 58 countries in terms of equality of economic opportunity. The employment of women in Ireland is concentrated in poorly paid or unskilled job ghettoes characterised by an absence of upward mobility or opportunity. The report stated that this situation is often the result of negative or obstructive attitudes as well as legal and social systems which use maternity laws and benefits to penalise women economically for child birth and child care responsibilities and discourage or actively prevent men from sharing family responsibilities. I wish to note two issues arising from this finding. First, men also lose out in this situation because they do not receive opportunities to spend time with their children. Second, actions must be taken in the area of child care. This issue was raised last week. Ireland is lagging in terms of ensuring that child care options as well as opportunities to spend time with children are provided to women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the publication of the report by the task force on obesity. It is relevant to the issue of type 2 diabetes, which I have raised in this House on a number of occasions. A consultant in a medical clinic in the midlands has 3,000 patients who suffer from diabetes. This figure represents cases of which we are aware. What about the many thousands about whom we do not know? This condition rivals cancer as one of the greatest killers of our people. Early detection is important but it will have an adverse impact on the health service. I call for a general screening to ascertain the number of people with type 2 diabetes, a very serious condition which must be tackled head on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday&rsquo;s news was dominated by the report of the task force on obesity but I am sure none of us had to wait for the report to know it was a problem. It is a problem which has been known about for many years. Changes have occurred in Irish society, including an increase in consumption of fast food and changes in schools. One no longer sees children bringing sandwiches to school but when the school doors close at lunchtime, one sees them going down the town and eating chips and all types of fast food. That is the convenience-type culture in which we live. I would deplore the introduction of a fat tax, which has been mentioned from time to time, in an attempt to combat this problem, to act as a disincentive and to put some money in the coffers. If we introduce a fat tax, in many cases we will only penalise those who resort to fast food because it is cheaper.</P><Col N="853"/>
      <P>I have raised the issue of special needs on many occasions and the Leader quite rightly indicated that the Minister was carrying out a review. Last weekend the Minister announced the results of her review and the allocation of 660 extra teachers, of whom 340 will be temporary.</P>
      <P>I was present at a public meeting in my constituency last Thursday night attended by 750 people. It was a very emotional meeting at which parents elaborated on the types of situations they faced with their children who were going through the primary school system and who, in many cases, were waiting up to two and a half years for psychological assessments. Even after the assessments, they were not given the results or told whether their children would be entitled to special tuition. Such a situation is a shocking indictment of our education system.</P>
      <P>Concerns about small rural schools were also expressed at that meeting. As I have said on many occasions, the devil is in the detail in respect of what the Minister announced last weekend and small rural schools are still concerned that pupils who benefited from special needs education in the past may not benefit from September onwards.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to come to the House to respond to specific queries on the changes taking place. It is hard for many people to understand this new weighted system. I would encourage such a debate. I assure the Leader that if such a meeting were held in any rural area, parents would relay the situations in which their children find themselves and the types of problems which may impact on them from September onwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Although I do not know how serious are the proposals, I wish to raise the proposed &euro;10 travel tax which some mad Eurocrat has brought forward to try to solve the Third World aid issue. Indeed, John O&rsquo;Shea of Goal has condemned this proposal as absolutely ridiculous. As an island nation, we need air travel. The imposition of further taxation would be a major blow to this country. Whoever brought forward this proposal has done much to undermine the EU constitution which is being discussed at present. This effort to, in a sense, pull the plug on the people&rsquo;s wish to pass the referendum on the EU constitution should be condemned.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister for Finance said such tax would not be introduced on his watch. I am sure Commissioner McCreevy will not allow it to be introduced. For those Members who will have the opportunity to debate the EU constitution with MEPs tomorrow, perhaps they might put that proposal to them to ensure the Parliament does not allow any such mad, lunatic fringe to introduce such a tax on the people of this country and the travelling public throughout Europe. I condemn any such proposal. We should remember that the first Nice treaty referendum was defeated. Although the second was passed, the success of the constitutional treaty is not guaranteed. If more of these mad proposals come for<Col N="854"/>ward, I assure the House that quite a number of people will vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; in that referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to communicate the concern of many Members in this House about reports in today&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Times</i> that the Office of Environmental Enforcement has advised farmers in the Aghancon valley in County Offaly not to engage in drainage projects because of the dangers of residual trace elements coming from wood preservatives. Chromium and heavy metals, which are fairly virulent poisons are present and this issue has been created by the T &amp; J Standish Sawmills development. The Environmental Protection Agency is seeking further information on the issue. It has also prosecuted this company in the past and I understand it secured a conviction. A fresh prosecution for breaches of the company&rsquo;s pollution control licence is in the pipeline. It was refused retention permission by An Bord Plean&aacute;la in 2003. Obviously, the company built the plant and then sought retrospective permission; the matter is going forward to a further appeal.</P>
      <P>I have tried to raise this matter several times in the House. The first time was as an Adjournment matter, which was ruled out of order because no ministerial responsibility existed. Thereafter, the Minister was publically rebuked at European Union level and I was able to raise it despite the lack of ministerial responsibility. However, it was decided that the matter was <i>sub judice</i>. It is not satisfactory that the matter can be <i>sub judice</i> for several years while the company continues to develop. I visited the area a week or so ago. The company has expanded right down the valley without planning permission despite these prosecutions against it. Since the matter cannot be debated because of these rulings, perhaps the Leader will communicate the concerns of Members from all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>I also ask for a debate on the proposed metro. I have asked for this several times because this is a moment when those elements within the Government who wish to proceed with the metro should be strengthened in their resolve to do so. This was brought home to me this morning while listening to the wireless as someone put figures on the record. Some 4,000 cars per hour make the journey from Dublin to the airport. In a couple of years, it is estimated that the figure will be 14,000 cars per hour. We cannot survive without a metro. It is important that this House, which initiated the debate on the metro, should support the Cabinet in taking a clear decision on this major infrastructural project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KateWalsh"><NameTxt>Ms K. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Glynn&rsquo;s call for a debate on diabetes. As an insulin-dependent diabetic for many years, I am aware there is little public information available. Thankfully, I have never passed out. However, if I did so in this House today, I wonder who might be able to come to my aid. Of course, we have Senator Henry who is a doctor. This is an important <Col N="855"/>debate which we might have at the Leader&rsquo;s discretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Health and Children to the House to debate the fair distribution of health services throughout the country. In the midlands, elderly and sick people leave their homes at 4 a.m. or 5 a.m. three days a week to access dialysis machines here in Dublin, Galway and elsewhere. Those facilities should be located in hospitals such the Longford Westmeath General Hospital in Mullingar, for example. It should be the Minister&rsquo;s objective to ensure that quality health services are accessible, irrespective of location. Currently &mdash; and I raised this last week on the Order of Business &mdash; emergency services are not available on a 24-hour basis in the midlands and elsewhere. Cutbacks are occurring as we speak.</P>
      <P>Mr. Kevin Kelly, the chief executive of the Health Service Executive, said recently that cutbacks of approximately &euro;200 million in the health service would be necessary between now and the end of 2005. As public representatives, we should be told which frontline services will be hit by the Government between now and the end of the year. This information is factual and was reported in the media last week and the previous week. Funding will be reduced to the tune of &euro;200 million, which will have very serious effects on the delivery of health services and we want to know which services will be affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the point made by Senator Brian Hayes concerning school discipline. This issue has been debated for many years. Discipline is particularly important at this time of the year when teachers are under considerable pressure to complete a programme of work in the run up to examinations but must face out of control blackguards who make their working conditions intolerable. Teachers simply do not know what to do.</P>
      <P>I also support the call for a debate on the task force on obesity and particularly note the points raised by Senator O&rsquo;Toole concerning how we can best integrate a new system into our primary and secondary education sectors. I would go further in arguing that this issue is about community leaders &mdash; parents, teachers, doctors and others &mdash; playing their part. Fighting obesity involves educating young people about diet and healthy living.</P>
      <P>A debate is required on planning legislation, which was to have been revisited at some stage. I acknowledge that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, is always ready to come here and debate issues with Members. I am dissatisfied with the guidelines concerning high rise developments and the gung-ho approach of some county managers in dealing with applications. The Minister should revisit this area and discuss it with the House.</P><Col N="856"/>
      <P>We also need a debate before the next general election on voter registration. This issue becomes very significant at election time when people suddenly discover they are not on the register of electors. The system of registering voters must be simplified. This issue could perhaps be included in future debates on environmental issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I am surprised that the recent troubles at the THORP reprocessing plant at Sellafield have attracted so little attention because they give us a chance to achieve what we want. The THORP plant has been closed down and will remain closed for a number of months. This closure provides us with an opportunity to push for the permanent closure of the THORP plant. The closure has apparently provoked discussions to this end. I am aware that Senator Ross, in particular, has raised the issue of Sellafield many times. It appears that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is still taking legal action against the British Government over the THORP plant. We should bring the maximum amount of pressure to bear on the British Government and not lose this opportunity to close the THORP plant for good.</P>
      <P>When will the new structures that were supposed to be established on foot of the Taxi Regulation Act 2003 be established? I read a report in one of today&rsquo;s newspapers that many problems and questions have arisen with regard to making complaints. The regulations do not appear to have been put in place. Could the Minister come to the House to inform us when they will be put in place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s call for a debate on the McCann report for West on Track, which was published last week. It would be most appropriate if this House would note the contents of the report and debate its many merits. This issue and the lobby for this project are not political. It is a great achievement by all the affected communities on the western seaboard to take the project to its current level. The House should debate the issue before the scheduled announcement of the ten-year transport envelope, which will come up in this session. I would like this House&rsquo;s views to be taken into account by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, and the Government when the final decision is being made on the West on Track project.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I reiterate my call for a debate on national resources, particularly Bord G&aacute;is. Will the Leader arrange for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, to come to the House so we might discuss that body&rsquo;s plans, or lack thereof, to extend the network through the north-west above County Galway? As we know, work is proceeding to bring this natural resource from the Corrib field ashore in County Mayo but there are no plans, or even the germ of an idea, on the part of <Col N="857"/>Bord G&aacute;is to make the resource available to the people of the north west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader schedule a debate on the issue of breast cancer and ask the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, to address the House regarding her detailed plan to ensure BreastCheck is rolled out in the west and south without further delay? When we learn that a high profile person, someone who is in her 30s and is known internationally in the music world, has breast cancer, it brings home the extent of the illness and that it can land on anyone&rsquo;s doorstep.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Many Members of the House, including the Leas-Chathaoirleach, attended the western rail corridor conference in Castlebar on Friday, 13 May. The report received a very positive response from two Ministers. The issue concerns the national spatial strategy and regional interconnections which has relevance for the south east and the west. It also addresses issues such as depopulation, as do the planning guidelines.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, launched on 16 May a report presented by the One Parent Exchange and Network, OPEN, organisation about the financial difficulties facing one-parent families. This matter would be well worth debating. The Minister has already shared some of his thoughts with this House on related topics. He has said he will speak with the banks about their refusal to deal with such people, throwing them back to moneylenders. We have a system whereby the European Central Bank sets base rates for interest rates. We should consider putting a ceiling on interest rates so that punitive 100% or 200% rates charged by financial institutions to vulnerable people would not only be illegal but those who demand them would go to jail&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with other Senators who have asked for a debate on education, particularly primary education. Senator Brian Hayes and others mentioned the area of school discipline in regard to both primary and secondary schools. This is an area that has not received enough attention in the past few years and is a serious problem in many classrooms. As someone who was a secondary school teacher briefly, I am all too familiar with some of the difficulties for teachers and pupils who are faced with unruly pupils.</P>
      <P>I also agree with the sentiments expressed by other Senators, particularly Senator O&rsquo;Toole, in respect of the report of the national task force on obesity. I know of a school in my parish where <Col N="858"/>the general purpose room is now three classrooms and the schoolyard virtually does not exist because of prefabs. The perimeter of the school has been hemmed in by new developments so there is very little space for children to take part in any type of activity at lunch time or PE time. This is a widespread issue throughout the country and we should have a discussion on it.</P>
      <P>My final point concerns staffing issues in primary schools. Last night I attended a public meeting in Urlingford in north County Kilkenny at which a couple of hundred parents gathered to discuss the pupil-teacher ratio. Sufficient progress has not been made in this regard. The Government gave a commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government that the pupil-teacher ratio would be reduced to 20:1, which is not close to being achieved. It is time there was a realistic discussion with the Minister to try to ensure that what is happening in schools such as the one in Urlingford, where there is a pupil-teacher ratio of 36:1 in several classes, does not continue in future. There should be positive action on the issue as a matter of urgency.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I support my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Meara, in calling for an early debate on breast cancer. We awoke this morning to the sad news from Australia that a certain lady is suffering from the early stages of cancer. This will highlight the issue of breast cancer, particularly among younger women, which is apt. A timely debate in the House would help in that regard. It is not just middle aged women who are threatened and lose their lives to breast cancer, it also happens to younger women. The whole area of education for younger women should be examined. We need to discuss how they are tested, whether by way of mammogram or MRI scan. Over the last couple of weeks, we learned that MRI scans now appear to be the way to detect breast cancer, particularly among younger women, where mammograms heretofore were not picking up tumours in young and middle aged women.</P>
      <P>One of our leading oncologists, Professor John Crown, is currently in Florida. He is one of the people who suggests that the MRI scan is the way to go in detecting breast cancer. This will not be cheap. However, given the number of women who lose their lives to breast cancer in Ireland because it is not detected at an early stage, the MRI scan should be made available not just to women of 55 years of age and over, but to all women from the age of 18 onwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish Senator Walsh very good health. We have enough drama in the House without my becoming involved in emergency medicine in the back of the Chamber.</P>

    </Speaker><Col N="859"/>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the Senators who called for a debate on the obesity task force report, which is very important. When I attended the launch of the report yesterday as president of the Diabetes Federation of Ireland, I suggested to the Taoiseach that we could start in Leinster House by leading by example. I suggested that pudding portions could be reduced by 50%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Never. What an outrageous suggestion. It is disgraceful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris can have super-sized portions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Excellent. I do already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly. It would be a good idea if we led by example. We lead very sedentary lives and get very little exercise, therefore, we must eat the delicious, nutritious food, of which there are very large portions.</P>
      <P>I support the calls for the extension of BreastCheck and the various developments that have taken place. However, we are neglecting one group of women in the country, namely, those families who have hereditary breast cancer. It is approximately one year before other members of these families, including sisters, mothers and daughters, can have a genetic test to determine if they have the similar gene. Is this right? Addressing this issue might reduce the incidence of breast cancer and death from breast cancer among young women, in particular, far more than MRI scans or BreastCheck. We know this is the case and that all it needs is money and people to be put in place in the centre in Crumlin. We are not seeking huge sums of money. A year is a very long time to wait if one wants to know if one has the cancer gene which could cause one to develop breast cancer.</P>

	<P>I support the many speakers who referred to the obesity task force report launched yesterday by the Taoiseach. If we do not take this matter seriously, particularly in regard to children, we will lose the opportunity to deal with the issue. Children no longer walk to school in towns and villages. Their parents drive them to and from school. That must change and we must allow young children to walk to and from school.</P>
      <P>As a former member of the health board, Senator Bannon should know that people in Longford no longer have to rise at 4 a.m. because recently a new dialysis unit was opened in Tullamore to cater for the midland region. I compliment the Department of Health and Children, the Minister and all her associates on opening the unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I too welcome the report of the Government&rsquo;s task force on obesity. It is a serious situation that more than 2,000 people will die this year from obesity-related illnesses and over 300,000 children are affected by the problem. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and <Col N="860"/>Local Government can also act on this issue. I drive to Dublin every second day and I see footpaths on the bypasses at Longford and Enfield which thousands of people use daily. Footpaths should be incorporated into the plans for any future bypasses or link roads to ensure people can walk.</P>
      <P>There has been talk about installing a gymnasium in Kildare House for almost ten years but to date there has been no value for money in that proposal. People have been working on it for the past 18 months but there is no gymnasium. How can we advise people to go out walking and get fit when we do not do so ourselves?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The National Council on Ageing and Older People published a report today entitled Perceptions of Ageism in Health and Social Services. The research found that many older people are being fobbed off with the answers they receive from the health service to queries about available services.</P>
      <P>The study also found the health service guilty of discriminating against older people in several areas. One public health nurse said that many general practitioners will not refer older people because they regard their complaints as part of the ageing process. One former health board would not take anyone over 65 years for stroke rehabilitation.</P>
      <P>This situation cannot continue. We must have a debate on ageism and older people. It is apt to have it now and I call on the Leader to arrange that debate at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I support many of the requests for debates but particularly on obesity and breast cancer. These are highly complex issues. People drive their children to school out of concern for their security. Schools do not allow children to play because they accept there is a risk and parents may sue the schools. Society must look at these issues. Senator Minihan made a good point, namely, that the diet of the poor is a poor diet which must be tackled by dealing with poverty.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission arrange for a position paper to be prepared in advance of such debates, particularly on a subject such as breast cancer. Some Members know a great deal about that subject, for which we are grateful, but our debates would be more informed if we had a general position paper. I call for more resources for the Oireachtas Library so a position paper setting out most of the facts would be made available before the debates.</P>

	<P>Today&rsquo;s debate has been a lively one. I am glad the Athlone group who had been in the Gallery have left before I reply. They were very welcome.</P>
      <P>Senator Brian Hayes referred to the task force on student behaviour which is to produce a report in June. He called for a debate on school discipline, disorder and school expulsions and asked who has the final say on whether a child leaves the school. That could be allied to the difficulties concerning bullying in school and the policy on that issue. A debate on that matter would be useful.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole said the report on the western rail corridor was published last week. Some Members appear to have received the report while others have not. I did not get a copy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Was the Leader at the launch?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>No. Surely everybody should get a copy of the report. We should have a debate on it and we had better get our copies of the report.</P>
      <P>The Senator also referred to the report on obesity and pointed out that GP rooms in many schools have become classrooms. He said also that parents, school managers and the community at large are very much involved in organising and carrying out games strategies, particularly community games. He referred to the fact that children had different preferences and that not all children liked physical games. Some may have other inclinations. The issue would make for a useful debate.</P>
      <P>Senator Tuffy referred to the report on obesity and noted that sport and play are very important. I agree with the Senator. Through play many children can express themselves and work out difficulties as they perceive them. The Senator referred to playgrounds and the proliferation of golf courses <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the number of school playgrounds.</P>
      <P>Senator Tuffy referred also to the report of the World Economic Forum on gender equality and women&rsquo;s economic capabilities. She said men have negative and obstructionist policies towards women advancing in the workplace. A lady who came to see me knows, as does everybody else, she did not get promotion because she had just returned from maternity leave. She will find it difficult to prove but I take the Senator&rsquo;s point.</P>
      <P>The Senator also noted the importance of child care. It is interesting to note how everybody is jumping on the issue of child care, and so they should because it is an important issue. To date, many Members have been prominent with regard to its provision and are bringing forward documents. If that is the case and with such brains as are in the House honed in on the issue of child care, we should get a good policy.</P>

	<P>That would suit Senator Minihan also.</P>
      <P>Senator Glynn welcomed the report of the task force on obesity and said it was relevant to the issue of type 2 diabetes. He pointed out that this condition rivals cancer as one of the greatest causes of death. It is lifestyle related. The Senator called for a general screening programme to ascertain the numbers suffering from the condition. That topic was taken up by Senator Maurice Hayes who agreed with the Senator.</P>
      <P>Senator Finucane raised the issue of the task force on obesity and asked about the introduction of a fat tax. The Government has set its face against a fat tax. I do not know what it means, unless it is a tax on those foods which are supposed to make one fat.</P>
      <P>The Senator also raised the issue of children with special needs. Some 660 extra resource teachers have been provided. These teachers were heretofore called remedial teachers. From now on the child does not need psychological testing. If the teacher is of the opinion that the child is in need of the services of a resource teacher that service will be made available. There used to be a long wait for psychological testing, which was damaging. The Senator asked if the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, would come into the House for a debate on the matter. I have requested such a debate.</P>
      <P>Senator Leyden raised the matter of the &euro;10 travel tax proposed as a means of helping the Third World. It is a ridiculous proposal and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, has refused to consider it. Senator Leyden rightly made the point that these proposals will lead us nowhere.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris expressed concern about dangers to the environment arising from drainage. He also asked for a debate on the metro. I have asked the Minister for Transport to come to the House to debate that issue.</P>
      <P>Senator Kate Walsh supported Senator Glynn&rsquo;s call for a debate on diabetes. Senator Bannon asked for a debate on the health services. Senator Moynihan made the point that Tullamore hospital has a new dialysis unit.</P>

I do not know if I have the nerve to ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, to come to the House again. She also asked for a debate on voter registration. I would be very interested in a debate on that subject as would all Members.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn asked for a debate on Sellafield. He said we should be shouting from the rooftops about this matter and I agree with him. He referred to the Taxi Regulation Act 2003. I will make inquiries in that regard.</P>
      <P>Senator MacSharry asked for a debate on the western rail corridor. He said it was a testament to all the communities who are active on this issue. He said a ten-year transport strategy is envisaged and it would be desirable if the western rail corridor was included. The Senator also asked for a debate on plans by Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann to extend the network to the north west.</P>
      <P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Meara&rsquo;s call for a debate on breast cancer and BreastCheck. Senator Mansergh referred to the western rail corridor conference in Castlebar. He referred to the OPEN report on the difficulties faced by one-parent families in their dealings with moneylenders.</P>
      <P>Senator John Paul Phelan supported calls for debates on school discipline, the national task force on obesity and the use of prefabs in schools. I agree that some schools have erected prefabs in the playground space but this is not the case in every school.</P>

      <P>Senator Moylan raised the issue of the unit in Tullamore hospital. Senator Feighan also conveyed his apologies by sign language across the floor of the House for leaving the House early. He asked for a debate on obesity and suggested we should all walk more. He asked why the gymnasium has not been provided. As soon as the gymnasium is provided all the commentators will be giving about it. Senator Cummins said that older people who seek stroke rehabilitation are being fobbed off and are more or less being told: &ldquo;It would be of no use to you, my dear.&rdquo; The Senator did not use those words; I am merely saying what might be said.</P>
      <P>Senator Maurice Hayes spoke about obesity and breast cancer. Generally people who cannot afford different kinds of food have bad diets. The Senator also asked that a position paper be prepared, in advance of such debates, particularly on a subject such as breast cancer. He did not say who should provide such a position paper and I certainly will not do it. However, his point was that the Oireachtas Library might have the resources to do so.</P>

      <P>On amendment No. 2, as Senator Cummins has pointed out, the definition as it stands is particularly wide and open to sweeping interpretation. For example, it is possible that a site manager on a construction site could be included because he or she controls or directs the work. We need to ensure that managers do not escape their responsibility and liability. However, a provision in section 80 addresses that particular concern.

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>There was some debate on this section in the other House, particularly on Committee Stage. The section provides for the gradual repeal of pre-1989 legislation and regulations. The Minister said in the other House on Committee Stage that a review was under way in his Department regarding the various pre-1989 provisions. The 1989 Act allows for the repeal of those provisions and this Bill, when enacted, will also provide for the repeal of previous enactments and regulations. Since it is now some time since the issue was debated in the D&aacute;il, perhaps the Minister of State might update us on how things stand regarding that review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator McDowell is perfectly correct. There are several enactments, some going back not only to the last century but to the previous one, which ought to have been repealed as a result of the 1989 Act. Some work has been under way in the Department, but it has not been possible to complete it. That will now be done in the context of the new legislation rather than the 1989 Act. Considerable progress has been made, but a fair amount will be dealt with by regulation, and until the regulations have been agreed on foot of this Bill, it will not be possible to repeal all the enactments mentioned in section 4.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 6 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>A debate on this section took place in the other House which there is little point in rehearsing. I am unclear regarding the exact scope of section 6(2)(<i>d</i>), which states that the provisions of the Bill do not relate to members of the Defence Forces engaged in training directly associated with any of the activities specified in the previous three subsections. On the face of it, that could be construed to exclude most if not all training in which the Defence Forces are engaged. That would remove from the Act&rsquo;s scope the issues that gave rise to the Army deafness cases of a few years ago. Section 6(2), paragraphs (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>), refer to states of emergency, active service abroad and so on. Perhaps, however, the Minister might clarify the position regarding day-to-day or routine training carried out in this country, something in which the Defence Forces regularly engage. Is it covered by legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure Senator McDowell that the example of Army deafness that he gave is covered under the legislation as it stands. The very narrow focus of this exclusion is activities that occur in the course of operational duties and that could not reasonably be covered. It was not specifically raised in the other House, despite a very long debate on the matter, but I assure the Senator that the provisions in this new legislation will cover such cases as Army deafness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for the clarification. My concern related to training. The other provisions are specific, but the training provision appears to be broad in scope, meaning that it could be used as a means of excluding a great deal of day-to-day Army activity or training. I accept the clarification.</P>

    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Sections 7 and 8 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 9.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 19, lines 47 to 49, to delete subsection (2) and substitute the following new subsection:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;(2) Where an employee of another undertaking is engaged in work activities in an employer&rsquo;s undertaking, that employer shall take measures to ensure that the employee&rsquo;s employer receives adequate information concerning the matters referred to in <i>subsection (1)</i>.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The rationale behind this amendment is to address the point that an employer&rsquo;s obligation to ensure, where he or she takes on the employees <Col N="868"/>of another business, that each employee receives all the information set out in section 9(1) is unworkable. It is often the case that employers using employees from another company, for example, for maintenance work or other such services, might not know which or how many people are coming to work at any given time. It would be far more straightforward to oblige employers to ensure that the actual employer of those workers were made aware of all the safety information. There would then be an obligation on that actual employer to pass on the information to his or her employees in the usual way, as if the workers were working for their own and not another employer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators Coghlan and Cummins are correct in this regard. As the legislation stands, it would appear that the obligation was on the employer to give information to employees of another employer, which could clearly be difficult in practice and would remove the obligation from the second employer, diminishing the health and safety requirements on him or her. I am therefore able to accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Minister of State might clarify what that means, taking Senator Cummins&rsquo;s example of a subcontractor on a site. Who is responsible for ensuring that the information is provided to the employee? Is it the subcontractor or the main contractor?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>There are obligations on both. The obligation on the main contractor is to give the information to the subcontractor, but the employee in question in this instance would be an employee of the subcontractor. In that circumstance, the obligation to give him or her the information lies with the latter, who is the direct employer. As the Bill stood, the middle person, the subcontractor, would have had no obligations regarding health and safety; the obligation would have been directly from the main contractor to all those working on the site. Under Senator Coghlan&rsquo;s amendment, the obligation is on the main contractor to pass information on health and safety requirements to the subcontractor, who in turn is obliged to ensure that his own employees on the site have the relevant information. That strikes me as considerably more workable. It also ensures that the subcontractor, as the direct employer, has the obligation towards his own employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State. While this is dealt with in another section, perhaps, regarding the amendment, he might spell out how it would affect the employees or those employed by recruitment agencies. Is the agency responsible for passing on the information to the individual subcontractor? Does the agency for whom the person is working have the primary responsibility?</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="869"/>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The primary obligation regarding health and safety requirements is on the main contractor. Assuming that the staff were taken on by the main contractor rather than a sub-contractor, that contractor has a clear obligation to pass on the health and safety requirements to the agency that employs the staff.

	<P>This amendment involves the deletion of section 17 and its replacement with a new section which is very similar. It arises from the directive on mobile sites which contains requirements that are better met with the new wording. It is also a result of HSA advice following consultation with its clients and the professional bodies. It will also have an impact on the new construction regulations which are to be updated.</P>
      <P>Section 17(1) refers to someone who commissions or procures a project. Section 17(2) refers to someone who designs a project and section 17(3) refers to someone who carries out construction work. Each of these groups has particular obligations under this section on health and safety.</P>

      <P LI="1">In page 29, lines 19 to 26, to delete subsection (3) and substitute the following new subsection:</P>
      <P LI="1">&rdquo;(3) The risk assessment shall be reviewed by the employer where&mdash;</P>
      <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) there has been a significant change in the matters to which it relates, or</P>

        <?oasys _ix?>and, following the review, the employer shall amend the risk assessment as appropriate.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0" el="5">The current text of the Bill obliges an employer to review the risk assessment annually, regardless of whether there had been any changes or not. This could be an unnecessary burden for employers with low risk workplaces. There is also a danger that employers running higher risk workplaces will focus on the annual requirement and neglect their obligation to be vigilant and to keep the situation under constant review. It is preferable, therefore, to tie the requirement for the review to actual changes in the workplace and not to some arbitrary period of time. Where there are alterations to the environment, the employer will need to review more regularly, even if the last review took place recently.</P>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 9, the content of the safety statement is based on the identification of hazards and the assessment of risk. If it is accepted that the review of the risk assessment would be required every time there is a significant change, rather than when a period of time is elapsed, then it follows that the safety statement <Col N="871"/>should also be reviewed in line with the changes. This amendment would delete the requirement for annual review regardless of whether there had been changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taken by the argument put forward in support of the amendment, but I am not convinced it makes things better. I was going to put this amendment forward on three occasions, but I held back each time. I am not sure if the amendment strengthens or weakens the situation. Using Senator Cummins&rsquo;s line of logic, it is clearly important. However, I like the regularity of an annual review come what may, which is currently required under legislation. That is probably why I did not put the amendment forward. However, I accept that there are times during the course of a year where a risk assessment has to be carried out. I just do not want to lose the baby with the bath water. Most people would want to have a risk assessment carried out each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am inclined to agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole. In ideal circumstances, there would be no need for a statutory provision for a risk assessment. As circumstances changed and a risk was created in the workplace, people would take account of it and make suitable provision. The purpose of legislation like this is to flash an amber light on a regular basis. There is merit in doing it on an annual basis as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>The assessment should be done on an annual basis. It is very easy for accidents to happen. Under pressure in business, people can overlook their obligations. Giving it a statutory basis is the thing to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill places considerable emphasis on prevention. The risk assessment statement and the safety statement are very important tools. I am taken by the point made by Senator Cummins on the annual review. There is some evidence to suggest that people hang their hats on that provision and feel it is the only requirement of them. There are workplaces where far more frequent reviews are required. On the other hand, it is fair to say that there are workplaces where the level of risk does not change much and the annual requirement for risk assessment contributes to an additional cost burden.</P>
      <P>I quite like the amendment, but there are number of areas where I would change the wording. I will come back with an amendment on Report Stage which goes along with the principle proposed by Senator Cummins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept what the Minister of State said. The amendment really deals with the principle of an annual review, especially in companies where items do not change from one year to another. I look forward to the Government amendment on Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 7 is a technical amendment which is consequential on amendment No. 8. The latter arises from a debate in the D&aacute;il and serves to clarify that employers must bring the safety statement to the attention of new employees upon commencement of employment. The existing provision only required an employer to bring the safety statement to the attention of employees once annually. These amendments mean employers will be required to bring it to the attention of new employees when they start work. There are circumstances in which people could be in employment for 11 months, for example, before the annual review would arise. These amendments ensure the risk assessment and safety statement is brought to the attention of all new employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I support these amendments. This is a provision one would assume was already in place. It is amazing none of us identified this omission previously. Accidents often take place involving workers employed on a temporary basis and who have not been made aware of the risks associated with the working environment. These amendments ensure newly recruited employees will be made aware of all such issues upon commencement of employment. This is probably the single most important provision in the Bill in terms of the implementation and application of health and safety measures because it ensures people commencing employment will be informed of the dangers of the workplace and the safety regulations that must be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>

      <P FLI="0">It seems unduly onerous that employers should be required to consult both with the safety representatives and all employees on all matters set out in this section. In some circumstances it will be appropriate to deal with the safety representatives only while in other cases it might be more fitting to consult with the entire workforce. Where there are alterations to the working environment, employers are obliged to have a safety review even if the last review took place only recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>As Senator Cummins says, this amendment will remove the obligation on employers to consult with both their employees and the safety representatives in every circumstance. I welcome the inclusion of the phrase &ldquo;as appropriate&rdquo; because there are circumstances in which it is entirely appropriate that an employer should consult with both. However, it has been pointed out to me that there are circumstances where it may not be possible to consult with both, particularly in construction situations, for example, where there are a number of sites and the safety representative is only present at one. This requirement was not only onerous but could not reasonably be met in particular situations. In this context, I accept the Senator&rsquo;s amendment.</P>

      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P FLI="0">I tabled these amendments after learning of the reservations of a number of people. I have discussed my worries with the Minister of State&rsquo;s advisers and understand the Government&rsquo;s different perspective on this matter. Under subsection (6), which reads &ldquo;where a person on whom an improvement notice has been served&rdquo;, an employer receives notice of a problem which must be remedied and is given a deadline by which to do so. The employer or workplace owner must then confirm in writing to the inspector that certain actions were taken and improvements made. The inspector, upon being satisfied that the problem has been ameliorated, must within one month give written notice of compliance to the original complainant. There would be no objections to these straightforward steps.</P><Col N="876"/>
      <?oasys _cl10.5-?>
      <P>It was brought to my attention that in some situations complex issues may arise. Examples include the chemical industry, which is of increasing significance to Ireland. Highly qualified people may be required to find solutions to such issues. An inspector might not have the qualification necessary to confirm that remedies have been put in place. The remedies may be found wanting, in terms of qualification, under the rigours of a court challenge.</P>
      <P>The wording of my amendment is intended to confirm to the original complainant that the inspector was informed by the employer or owner of the workplace that remedies have been put in place. I agree with the suggestion from the Minister of State&rsquo;s advisers that this might be a dilution of the original proposals contained in the Bill. I am not enthusiastic about a dilution but am worried that inspectors who feel inappropriately qualified for a certain task may hesitate or refuse to confirm that measures have been taken. Support structures might be put in place so that inspectors may make use of independent experts to confirm adequate remedies have been made. The legislation as it stands does not mention this matter. Under the current wording, the inspector, &ldquo;on being satisfied that the matters have been so remedied,&rdquo; appears to have discretion.</P>
      <P>If the Minister of State is contemplating that support from outside experts be available for inspectors, he did not mention this exists in the legislation as it stands. I am concerned about situations where an inspector lacks the qualifications or expertise to confirm a problem has been rectified. I am not committed to these amendments but wish to raise an issue which concerns the Bill&rsquo;s supporters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend Senator O&rsquo;Toole on raising this issue, which appears to require that a significant number of letters be written. There will be no evidence for the receipt of such communications. If letters are to be written, they should be registered in order to guarantee their receipt. It might be claimed that a letter has been sent but not received. New communications technologies, such as e-mail, should be recognised because they are traceable. The Minister of State might consider this in order to avoid the writing of an excessive number of letters. He is trying to ensure this Bill is watertight. Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s suggestions are helpful and might be included on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have a view, good, bad or indifferent, on Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s amendments. However, he touches on the important issue of the level of expertise available to the HSA. This is particularly relevant in the context of the chemicals industry, which is becoming significant in this country. A few years ago, I took part as a member of Dublin City Council in the consideration of an application for a fuel pipeline from the port to Dublin Airport. It quickly became clear that the local authority did not have the expertise to assess whether safety requirements would be met. It was difficult to find experts in this country who could make such an <Col N="877"/>assessment. As it was proposed that the pipeline would run under houses, people were concerned to ensure the requirements were met. I have heard nothing further on this issue and presume no action was taken. My question is whether the expertise to deal with important and sensitive cases involving dangerous industries will be available to inspectors within the HSA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I will start with the last point made by Senator McDowell. When provision is made for the registration, evaluation and authorisation of chemicals directive, the REACH directive, it is intended additional people with qualifications and expertise in this area will be employed. Where individual inspectors or the entire inspectorate do not have expertise in a particular case, it is the practice that consultants are employed to deliver that expertise. That is the practice currently and when the REACH directive is taken on board, additional specialised staff will be employed to deal with the requirements thereunder.</P>
      <P>On the point made by Deputy Leyden, the word &ldquo;written&rdquo; in the Bill covers letter, fax, e-mail and any of the other means he mentioned. I assure Senator O&rsquo;Toole that if an inspector needs access to additional expertise from other inspectors, from within the Health and Safety Authority or externally from consultant, it will be available.</P>
      <P>Like Senators and Deputies, I have heard the concerns of employers that there could be long delays before matters, which have been put right, are acknowledged by an inspector. That is the reason for the provision of one month. A month seems to be a reasonable period. In some of the complex cases mentioned by Senators McDowell and O&rsquo;Toole, particularly in the chemical industry, the ameliorating provisions put in place by the employer would really have to be looked at in some detail by the inspector and the Health and Safety Authority.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s two main concerns were that an inspector would feel he or she had full support in delivering his or her determination and that the employer, the chemical factory or otherwise, would not be out of commission for an unnecessarily long period. There is, however, a provision for one month. Senator O&rsquo;Toole and other Senators raised a number of interesting points. I will consider them before Report Stage but my advice is that they are fully dealt with in the section as it stands. I am satisfied the points raised by Senators are adequately dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Minister of State&rsquo;s response. He has made clear that in the event of an inspector feeling he or she did not have access to expertise, he or she would be entitled to acquire it. The point Senator McDowell made is important in that sometimes this expertise will not be available within the State and I ask the Minister of State to consider that issue.</P>
      <P>When I tabled this amendment I tried to get some background on what happens on site in these situations and I spoke to a well qualified young man in the chemical industry. He <Col N="878"/>explained the structure in his workplace from which I thought something could be learned. He said there are different levels of sign-off depending on one&rsquo;s level of qualification, which goes back to my original point. In other words, a person with a certain level of qualification or degree is entitled to state something has been done correctly, for example, the making of a medicine or tablets. A person with a higher level of qualification is required to sign off on the product and to state that from start to finish, it has complied with the strictest safety regulations and, therefore, the company is a position to sign off on it.</P>
      <P>I asked how it worked from his point of view. He gave an example of where he had to make a decision. I was stunned by it because he was quite a young man and it took a lot of guts and confidence to make such a decision. He had to pull the rug from under what would be the equivalent of a week&rsquo;s supply of drugs to Ireland because a particular fail-safe was not working in the safety system. He could not be sure it was right and did not know if it was wrong. As he could not be sure it was right, he had to make a decision and state the product could not go out. The whole thing had to be dumped and an entire clean-out of the system was required.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that people like me should recognise that when he signs off on something, he is not working for his employer but for his profession and that his reputation stands or falls on his ability to get things right. There are areas where when people sign off on something, they are putting their reputation on the line. There are times when the inspector could depend on that. The chemical industry is an easy example to prove my point and perhaps there are not too many places where one could do that. When people have a professional qualification that requires them to do things on which their professional reputation hinges, a somewhat different approach could be taken.</P>
      <P>I will withdraw my amendment on the basis of the Minister of State listening to these arguments and in the hope he will make a judgment on whether an amendment should be tabled on Report Stage to tie in some of these issues &mdash; in other words to recognise that the inspector can seek further advice or depend on the advice within the industry. I will go with the Minister of State&rsquo;s judgment on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>In response to Senator McDowell, I forgot to mention expertise from outside the country can be sought. This has happened in at least one situation of which I know. It seems considerably less complex than the chemical industry example about which Senator O&rsquo;Toole spoke but it is the practice to seek outside expertise. The inspector is legally indemnified, although that is not quite the point Senator O&rsquo;Toole made. He made the point about the professional standing of the inspector and the need for support. I will consider the arguments made before Report Stage and if I believe an amendment is warranted, I will table one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>This is also a technical amendment to insert a reference to the European Communities (Dangerous Substances and Preparations) (Marketing and Use) (Amendment) Regulations 2004. These regulations were made late in 2004 <Col N="880"/>and reference to them could not be included in the Bill because it had already been published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I must be missing something. I have no problem with what is being added, but we are removing things like the reference to the Dangerous Substances Acts 1972 to 1979, the safety Acts 1955 to 1980 as well as inserting the others. Why are these references being removed? Are they not still extant? We are removing lines 12 to 15, which include references to the Safety in Industry Acts, the Safety, Health and Welfare (Offshore Installations) Acts 1987 and 1995 and the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989, and we are inserting the European regulations. Why are we removing the references that are already present? I understand why we are inserting the new ones, but I do not fully understand the reason we are removing those Acts which appear to be relevant. Possibly, they have been overtaken by events in consolidated legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The correct procedure in this case is that the existing references under this section of Schedule 2 must be removed and replaced by the new ones. If one looks carefully, two of them are very similar, if not exactly the same. Three regulations are replacing two. The last one, SI 852 of 2004 had not been enacted before the Bill was published. It is just a procedural matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State and his staff for alerting the House to this particular situation regarding the new European directives. However, a provision could be included in the Bill so it would also comply with all European directives. So much comes out of the European institutions that it is difficult to ensure that Bills remain relevant all the time. I do not know if the Minister of State can do anything about this. It makes it more difficult for people to comply with Bills when there are also regulations.</P>

In any event, this Bill was in circulation for some time, these new regulations were introduced and they have now been included in the Bill itself, which I commend. However, other ones may arrive in the next weeks and it is difficult to keep the Bill up to date. That is my point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise to the Minister of State, as it was my intention to speak during the Second Stage debate and on Committee Stage today. Unfortunately, I was delayed coming to the House. I wanted to make some specific comments with general application that the Minister of State might consider before Report Stage. It might be valuable to introduce some amendments to deal with the issues. I know there were debates in both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad regarding the particular status and treatment of temporary agency workers. I run a recruitment agency and have a particular knowledge of how agency workers work and how the temporary work agency business operates. I welcome the inclusion of this issue in the legislation as well as the protection given to those working on temporary assignments.</P>
      <P>I also thank the Minister of State and his Department for having listened to the various positions put forward by the National Recruitment Federation pertaining to this issue. However, I have a concern. It is in the nature of the temporary worker business that a call might come at 8.30 a.m. from a client organisation which needs someone to start work on site and <i>in situ</i> at 9 a.m. The assignment may only be for one hour to three hours to cover an immediate requirement. I am not referring to longer assignments of one or two weeks or three or four days but to the particular case of a very short-term assignment lasting from an hour up to one full day.</P>
      <P>The documentation requirements appear to be too onerous as far as the transactions between both the employer and the agency and the agency and the temporary employee are concerned. Perhaps we need to examine this issue to ensure we do not enact something that will be ignored, although I do not know how to frame it. If the legislation is ignored in the extremely short-term cases of one hour up to one day, it will also be <Col N="882"/>ignored in the greater scheme of things, which would defeat the purpose of this important legislation which contains important protections for this sort of worker.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister of State will take cognisance of this issue. Previously, the House has discussed how legislation that we perceived to be protecting agency workers was put in place and it actually worked against agency workers because the protection level was too great for someone to bother with it, particularly when it came to women, pregnancy and similar matters. Such workers might actually feel discriminated against by virtue of the protection we are trying to enact.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State to consider the issue and I apologise again for not raising it during the Second Stage debate and for not being here for the debate on the relevant section on Committee Stage. Quite often, an agency might fill four or five bookings of this kind of short-term, immediate requirements in one day. This needs some sort of consideration.</P>

	<P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the D&aacute;il. In accord<Col N="883"/>ance with Standing Order 103, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage. On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the D&aacute;il. This is looked upon as the report of the D&aacute;il amendments to the Seanad. The only matters, therefore, which may be discussed are the amendments made by the D&aacute;il. For Senators&rsquo; convenience, I have arranged for the printing and circulation of the amendments. The Minister will deal separately with the subject matter of each related group of amendments. I have also circulated the proposed grouping. Senators may speak only once on Report Stage.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take amendments Nos. 1 and 8 together. These amendments relate to the expenses involved in administering the scheme. The effect of amendment No. 1 is to provide that expenses incurred by relevant administrators will be met out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas. Section 5 of the Dormant Accounts Act 2002 provides that the expenses incurred by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in the administration of the Act are met out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas. The enactment of this Bill will create responsibility for several other Ministers and this amendment provides that expenses incurred by such Ministers will also be met out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas. This was a technical amendment which I introduced on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il following advice from the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>The effect of amendment No. 8 is to provide that expenses incurred by public bodies through the engagement of service providers to process and assess applications will be met out of the dormant accounts disbursement fund. Decisions about applications will be made following the assessment of applications received and my subsequent submission to the Government of a list of recommendations for disbursement from the fund. Given the wide remit of the scheme, it is likely that funding programmes will be administered by several Departments. Such Departments may engage service providers to assist in the process of receiving and assessing applications for funding. The purpose of this amendment, which I introduced on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il, was to provide that the cost of engaging service providers to carry out such processing work would be recoverable from the fund.</P>
      <P>Senators will be aware that the existing board engaged Area Development Management Limited, ADM, as a service provider to administer the initial round of funding on its behalf. The board reimburses ADM all relevant costs <Col N="884"/>incurred in carrying out this work. Under the new arrangements, similar provisions may apply to Departments which engage service providers to assist in the process of receiving and assessing applications for funding. It was for this reason I introduced the amendment. We are maintaining the <i>status quo</i> but previously this merely related to the board engaging outside assessors and paying them out of the fund, while the Department paid for its own expenses out of funding provided by the Oireachtas. This set-up might now apply to several Departments so the same approach adopted in the principal Act is being maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendments represent a welcome change because, as the Minister has pointed out, the disbursement of money from the fund could involve a number of different Departments and different headings and the changes brought about by the amendments will speed up that process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>Could the Minister tell me when a new application for funding under the Act could be made in view of the current applications being processed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The answer to Senator White&rsquo;s question is that once we have enacted legislation, we must take all necessary steps to approve a plan, which will take a number of months. All existing applications have been assessed and will either be accepted or rejected. I would hope to have a very systematic way of looking for applications in a subsequent year rather than using an omnibus approach whereby all types of applications from all sectors are solicited. We will be doing this in a few months time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>When will the new applications go in?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister saying that a new application can be made in the autumn?</P>

	<P>Amendments Nos. 2 and 9 are Opposition amendments proposed in the D&aacute;il and accepted by the Government. The effect of these amendments is to provide for the board established under the legislation to be known as an bord um chuntais dh&iacute;omhaoine or, in English, the dormant accounts board. These amendments were introduced by Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il and were fully supported and accepted by all parties. I acknowledge Deputy O&rsquo;Shea&rsquo;s initiative in bringing forward this bilingual approach to naming the board.</P><Col N="885"/>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 3 to 7, inclusive, were Government amendments introduced in the D&aacute;il. The effect of these amendments is to provide for the board&rsquo;s disbursement plan to be approved by the Government, rather than by the Minister, for which the arrangement in the original legislation provides. The purposes for which funding from dormant accounts can be disbursed are sport programmes and projects tackling disadvantage and assisting people with disabilities. This very broad remit cuts across the activities of several Departments. These amendments, which I introduced on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il, ensure that the board&rsquo;s disbursement plan, which provides the overall framework within which funding proposals and decisions will be made, is considered and approved by the Government.</P>
      <P>When the current board submitted its dispersal plan to me for approval in June 2003 I ensured it was considered and approved by the Government before the board published it. I was not required to do this under the existing legislation as I could have approved the plan. However, my view then and now is that bringing this to Government is a better procedure. The Government is involved in the new Bill at other stages of the procedure and, for coherence, I believe the plan should be approved by Government. This gap in the legislation, which I addressed on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il, should be accepted here.</P>

I remember having a detailed debate when we commenced Committee Stage of the Bill but we ran out of time. Senator Ryan justly asked me if I would recommit the Bill after the summer and I agreed to do so. We had a good debate here and made some amendments that improve on the Bill&rsquo;s original form.

I compliment the Minister and his officials on the manner in which this matter has been handled. We had an excellent debate in the Seanad and what struck me clearly was the manner in which the Minister listened to the views of all Senators. He was a strong advocate of transparency in that regard and, in the long run, the whole area of dormant accounts and their productive use will be enhanced as a result of this. I do not doubt that the whole country will benefit from these funds in such a way that will help communities that cannot access funding for other matters. The Minister has an enviable record in community service and has once again demonstrated this in regard to this legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>

    <Title>Registration of Wills.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I raise the need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to review the procedures governing the making of wills and the desirability of providing a national registration system for wills. I am of the opinion there is an urgent need for legislation to provide for a national registration system for wills. We are faced with a situation in which many people&rsquo;s last wills are not being honoured. Many make wills not knowing that these may sometimes not be executed correctly, if at all. It is a unique situation where a purchaser of this service has no after-sales service or comeback, as it were.</P>
      <P>We have a responsibility to ensure citizens&rsquo; wishes are honoured and given their proper and deserved legal recognition. One person deprived of what is rightfully his or hers is one too many. All wills must be registered to combat this problem. I envisage a registration of wills Bill being introduced this year. The central registration would be provided for by the General Register Office, which is located in Roscommon town. All <Col N="887"/>births, deaths and marriages are legally required to be registered and it is only natural, therefore, that the central registration of wills would be situated in the same location.</P>
      <P>I propose that solicitors must lodge all wills with the national register within 21 days of the wills being executed. In the course of my research I have discovered a Council of Europe convention for the establishment for a scheme of registration of wills dating back to 1972. I understand this convention was never ratified by the State although countries such as Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg and Spain have done so. The convention&rsquo;s main aim was the provision of a registration scheme enabling a testator to register his or her will in order to reduce the risk of the will remaining unknown, or being found belatedly, and to facilitate the discovery of the will&rsquo;s existence after the death of the testator. This was on account of the situation wherein a growing number of persons made their wills in places that were not their homes or even in foreign countries.</P>
      <P>As most member states do not require wills to be deposited with a court of law, notary or other authority and there is no central register, heirs are often unaware of the existence and whereabouts of a last will and testament. We must establish a registration scheme for wills, which would make it possible to ascertain whether a deceased person has made a will and, if so, where it can be found. In 2004, some 5,400 wills were probated in Ireland but more than 28,000 people died. This significant shortfall demonstrates my point. Many people do not make wills. Many make private wills but these are normally held with their papers and documents.</P>
      <P>There is no requirement of the 3,000 plus solicitors registered in this country who execute and make these wills to provide lists that would be held in a central bona fide registry such as the General Register Office in Roscommon town. At present, a person makes a will with a solicitor, the solicitor records it in his or her book of wills and the document is held in the legal firm&rsquo;s safe deposit box. The <i>Law Society Gazette</i> has advertised in the past few weeks, as it does in every publication, requests for the whereabouts of wills that are mislaid, missing or cannot be found. Many people who would be entitled to inheritances from these wills have been deprived. There is a case to be made for this move and if the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is not in a position or is not prepared to introduce a Bill, I will introduce a Bill under Private Members&rsquo; business as I feel strongly about this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the advantage of being legislators. We have a responsibility, in co-operation with the Government, to introduce legislation but we have a right to introduce our own when we see a shortfall. This has been done in <Col N="888"/>the past by other Members of the House in connection with important Bills.</P>
      <P>The bones of this Bill are set out in the Council of Europe&rsquo;s convention but I have added other documentation and have received helpful advice and information from a Roscommon solicitor involved in this area. There is a general feeling in the legal profession that there should be a central registration office. The General Register Office is located in Roscommon and the Land Registry office will also be located there. Roscommon is the centre of Ireland and in this case it will be the centre of registration of people&rsquo;s last will and testament. I hope many people will benefit when the Bill is enacted by the Government or by way of a Private Members&rsquo; Bill, with the support of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my good friend and colleague, Senator Leyden, for raising this issue. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, may contact him to further discuss the matter, or I invite the Senator to contact the Minister. Some of my notes may be helpful to the Senator at this stage. I apologise on behalf of the Minister who would like to be in the House but is, unfortunately, tied up with other business.</P>
      <P>We are all aware that the procedures governing the making of wills are contained in the Succession Act 1965. The word &ldquo;will&rdquo; in this context normally means the document or documents in which a person sets out his or her wishes in regard to certain matters which are to take effect after the person&rsquo;s death. The contents of a will are not confined to matters relating to the disposal of the testator&rsquo;s property on death, but that is generally perceived to be the main purpose of a will.</P>
      <P>One of the principal features of a will is that it does not, and is not intended to, take effect until the death of the testator. This means, therefore, that a will may be revoked, or added to by means of a codicil, at any time before the person&rsquo;s death. A will is, therefore, a declaration of the testator&rsquo;s intent at a point in time before his or her death. It also means that any intended beneficiary of a will runs the risk that the will may be changed to his or her disadvantage during the testator&rsquo;s lifetime. In addition, there is always the risk that on the testator&rsquo;s death, his or her debts might exceed the value of the property and that it may have to be sold to clear the amounts owed.</P>
      <P>Normally a will consists of a single document which has been completed in compliance with the statutory requirements set out in Part 7 of the Succession Act 1965. This means that it must be in writing, signed by the testator, or by his or her direction, and must be witnessed. A testator is not, however, confined to a single document. A will may consist of a number of documents provided that each of them complies with the necessary requirements.</P>
      <P>Prior to the Succession Act 1965, the principle of freedom of testation applied here. This meant <Col N="889"/>that a competent testator was free to act in an arbitrary and erratic manner in disposing of his or her property on death. However, Part 9 of the 1965 Act introduced provisions which prevent a testator from disinheriting his or her spouse or family. Section 111 provides that if the testator leaves a spouse and no children, the spouse has a right to one-half of the estate. If there are children, the spouse has a right to one-third of the estate. Moreover, section 117 provides that where, following application by a child of a testator, the court considers that the testator has failed in his or her moral duty to make proper provision for the child, the court may order that such provision as it thinks just shall be made for the child out of the estate.</P>
      <P>It must be remembered that people still die without making a will, in which case they are said to have died intestate. In some cases, it may be assumed that the death was unexpected, especially in cases of accidents and the deaths of young people, and that the intestacy was not deliberate. In other cases, a conscious decision may have been made not to make a will, possibly because of a reluctance to choose between potential beneficiaries or because the person concerned was happy to have the estate divided under Part 6 of the Succession Act, which sets out clear and unambiguous rules for distribution on intestacy. All of us in this House can relate to issues of that nature.</P>
      <P>Section 67 of the 1965 Act provides that if an intestate leaves a spouse and no issue, the spouse takes the whole estate. If a spouse and issue are left, the spouse takes two-thirds and the remainder is distributed among the issue. If there is neither spouse nor issue, the estate will be distributed among the parents. The Succession Act 1965 is undoubtedly one of the legislative landmarks of the 1960s, which has served its purpose well over the intervening years. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform believes that its basic provisions, amended where necessary in the meantime to reflect developments in the family law field, remain relevant to the conditions and circumstances of today and that no fundamental review of the provisions governing the making of wills was called for prior to the Senator&rsquo;s contribution.</P>
      <P>The Senator referred to the desirability of providing a national registration system for wills. While I see merit in the suggestion, I would make some comments. The 1965 Act did not provide for such a system and the Minister is not convinced of the need to establish a registration system at this stage.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a registration system for wills would give rise to two sets of problems. First, in terms of the principle involved, it would risk encroaching on the privacy of individuals. At present, people can decide whether to make a will. People may consciously decide not to do so, for example, because they are satisfied that their wishes will be accommodated under the intestacy <Col N="890"/>provisions of the 1965 Act. A registration system might lead to undue pressure or influence on such a person to make a will, and also to dispose of property in the will in a particular manner. I hope these points are helpful to the Senator.</P>
      <P>The practical difficulties with operating a registration system would also be considerable. What statutory body would operate and maintain the system and what would be the powers and duties of such a registering authority? Apart from the structural questions, issues would arise in regard to the status of wills that had been made but not registered, or where the testator had died between the making of the will and the completion of the registration formalities. Revoking a will, or altering the terms of a will, would inevitably become more difficult and inflexible. The position in regard to wills that consist of a number of documents would almost certainly lead to complications.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, is not convinced that the introduction of a national registration system for wills is justified at present. Apart from the administrative costs involved, the operation of any such system would inevitably encounter legal and practical difficulties. Moreover, the establishment of a registration system, without a clear need having been identified, would run counter to the better regulation principles to which the Government has committed itself in the White Paper, &ldquo;Regulating Better&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I hope the points put forward tonight are helpful to Senator Leyden in considering his position. I have no doubt the Minister, Deputy McDowell, will be glad to hear from him.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for coming here on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. This is one of the most comprehensive replies ever given in the Seanad. Prior to raising this matter, the Minister was not aware of the issues I have brought to his attention, particularly in regard to the Council of Europe documentation. I have solved the registration problem by proposing Roscommon as the central registry location. The information would not be made available until a person died; that a will was made would only be made known on the production of a death certificate.</P>
      <P>As a Member of the Seanad, I should probably bring forward a Private Member&rsquo;s Bill, which would allow issues to be teased out. I will discuss the matter with the Minister.</P>

	<P>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for selecting this matter and the Minister of State for his attendance.</P>
      <P>An Agreed Programme for Government between Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats states its aim for an inclusive society but some remain excluded. It also states that it is committed to building service provisions and legislative frameworks which will enable people with disabilities to fulfil their potential and make a full contribution to the economic and social life of the country. Every proposal in the Disability Bill 2004 now before the D&aacute;il is qualified by reference to availability of resources. Most people with disabilities are concerned about access to the services they require to lead fulfilling lives, as promised in the programme for Government. The Minister of State is a member of that Government.</P>
      <P>According to a 2003 pre-budget submission from the Disability Federation of Ireland &ldquo;to participate as full and equal citizens in Irish society people with disabilities require services and supports that are available to them in their own communities&rdquo;. The submission notes that the previous Government mainstreamed some of those services which disability groups around the country welcomed but added: &ldquo;However, mainstreaming does not begin and end with policy developments, for mainstreaming to succeed it must be resourced.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The National Disability Authority commissioned a survey to examine aspects of the social inclusion and well-being of people with disabilities last November. The survey looked at the &ldquo;use and accessibility of transport, at social participation and social life&rdquo; for people with disabilities:</P>
      <P LI="1">Overall, the results of this survey show that people with disabilities are significantly more restricted in terms of getting out and about and in their social lives than non-disabled people. The survey results point to accessibility problems rather than health issues as important factors in restricting full social participation &mdash; in other words the barriers we put in front of people and the lack of accessible services are often more disabling to them than any impairment they may have.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The survey covered 500 disabled persons and 809 people with no disability. The results showed that twice as many disabled persons as non-disabled persons do not drive a car regularly; over 40% of disabled persons could not use public transport compared with less than 30% of the non-disabled group; and 30% of disabled persons who could not use public transport said it was because they could not get from their homes to the bus stops.</P>
      <P>While Bus &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus and Irish Rail have improved their services and provided greater access it is often forgotten that the bus stops and access points for other services are not <Col N="892"/>always accessible to disabled persons. That is the responsibility of the local authorities. I hope the Minister of State will turn his attention to the local authorities throughout the country and insist they make bus stops and other access points for public transport more accessible to people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>One quarter of disabled respondents said they neither had access to public transport nor drive a car regularly. This compares with only 5% of the non-disabled respondents. For those who can neither drive nor use public transport it is difficult to get out of the house and travel any distance unless they get a lift or a taxi.</P>
      <P>Taxis and hackneys are generally inaccessible to many disabled persons. When the Disability Bill is enacted will the resources be available to guarantee access to services to the disabled population? This is important as groups representing people with disabilities around the country say the Bill guarantees no rights because everything depends on available resources. Many agencies are outside the realm of Government but surely the resources should be put in place for people with disabilities to have access to State-run services.</P>
      <P>I do not refer to Bus &Eacute;ireann or Dublin Bus alone. Access in rural areas to bus services, whether inter-city or local is negligible. People with disabilities in those areas do not have access to public transport. Why is there a two-tier society within the disability sector for access to transport, between Dublin where access is reasonably good and rural areas where it is absent?</P>
      <P>A total of 620 people appealed the decision of Department of Finance to deny them the benefit of the disabled drivers and passengers tax concession scheme. The Government has failed to put in place adequate personnel to process these appeals against a harsh decision. In a previous Adjournment debate I asked for the conditions and requirements of those applications to be somewhat relaxed. In that way, in the absence of any other form of accessible transport, these people can pass on a small tax concession to a friend, neighbour or family member who could provide transport for them.</P>
      <P>We have waited four months for the appointment of a consultant to work on these appeals. That is a poor response from a Government whose programme includes the statement I quoted at the beginning of my speech. Will the Minister of State indicate whether the resources will be put in place to provide access to transport for people with disabilities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>Accessible public transport for people with mobility and sensory impairments is of crucial relevance to the lives of many. As Minister of State with responsibility for this area, I am committed to the comprehensive development of accessible public transport services for people with mobility and sensory impairments, as soon <Col N="893"/>as possible, having regard to resources and technical and other constraints.</P>
      <P>Issues concerning access to public transport go beyond the needs of people with disabilities and involve the accessibility needs of all people with mobility or sensory impairments, for example, people with small children or those carrying luggage etc. This position accords with the transport for all concept, which is accepted within the EU and the European Council of Transport Ministers.</P>
      <P>My Department is fully engaged in planning for a comprehensive programme of accessible public transport improvements over the coming years. We have already accomplished a great deal of work in this area. As part of the national disability strategy, launched by the Taoiseach, my Department published its outline sectoral plan under the Disability Bill 2004 last September. This is a draft consultation document outlining the proposals of my Department and the agencies under its aegis for progressive development of accessible public transport. It covers public transport accessibility issues relating to bus and rail public transport, taxi services and airport facilities. The document summarises the progress achieved to date in developing public transport accessibility and outlines proposals for further improvements. I met the round table group working on the sectoral plans representing the various stakeholders among those with mobility impairments or sensory disabilities. I will meet with them several times to advance these plans, in so far as possible, in consultation and by agreement.</P>
      <P>Much progress has been made recently in providing access to public transport. Since 2000 all major refurbishment programmes at bus and rail stations, together with the construction of new stations and the purchase of trains and buses take account of the needs of people with mobility and sensory impairment. It is right to build new stations and buy new trains and buses but that is the soft option. The more difficult option is to convert the Victorian railway stations and bus stations to which all Members can easily relate. That is what I am endeavouring to do. It should be a given that any new station and vehicle, whether bus or rail, takes account of the needs of those with mobility and sensory impairment, including a mother with a pushchair.</P>
      <P>All new buses purchased for the urban services of the State-owned public transport operators are low-floor and wheelchair accessible. Dublin Bus operates 486 low-floor buses which represent approximately 45% of the fleet. Some 50 routes have been converted to low-floor bus operation. The entire regular urban bus fleets in Waterford, Galway, Limerick and Cork are fully low-floored and wheelchair accessible. In the rail sector all new rail carriages are specific to full accessibility standards and the Luas light rail system has been designed from the outset to be a fully accessible system. All suburban rail services are wheelchair accessible over most of the network. All appro<Col N="894"/>priate staff in the State-owned bus and rail companies and in Luas undergo disability awareness training. While many accessibility improvements have been made in transport services and in infrastructure in recent years, much remains to be done. I would be delighted to be in a position to get it all done in a short period but we have to keep the services running and carry out the required works at the same time. The national development plan provides a strong foundation for building up accessible transport services over time and this may be extended so that we can look forward to a fully accessible transport service.</P>
      <P>The following are key proposals of my Department&rsquo;s outline sectoral plans for the short to medium term. The policy of purchasing only low-floor wheelchair accessible vehicles by Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath will continue until the fleet has been fully converted to low-floor vehicles. That policy will be maintained also by Bus &Eacute;ireann in respect of its urban services in Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford. An accelerated investment programme is being undertaken by Bus &Eacute;ireann to make all bus stations fully accessible by the end of 2006 for people with mobility and sensory impairments. Senator Burke may be aware that Ballina bus station which was opened by my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, is fully accessible.</P>
      <P>Bus &Eacute;ireann will commence the process of replacing its inter-city coach fleet with wheelchair accessible coaches as soon as such vehicles become available. Basic access to all inter-city train services will be available for people with mobility and sensory impairment by the end of 2006. Approximately 50% of the rolling stock of inter-city rail services will be fully accessible by 2007. The remainder will be brought up to fully accessible standard as the fleet is replaced and expanded. We intend to meet those targets.</P>
      <P>A railway station accessibility refurbishment project covering all stations on the rail network is being rolled out. The Commission for Taxi Regulation will have responsibility for developing the greater availability of taxis for people with mobility and sensory impairments. The representative bodies are having an input in that regard.</P>
      <P>The accessibility policies put in place by Aer Rianta will continue at Cork, Dublin and Shannon airports by the relevant airport authorities. Future Exchequer funding for regional airports will be made contingent on these airports demonstrating compliance with best practice on accessibility for people with mobility and sensory impairments. The plan also covers matters relating to the formation by State agencies of disability user advisory groups, disability awareness training, integrated ticketing and real time passenger information.</P>
      <P>While many of the proposals in the sectoral plan have been determined by provisions of the Disability Bill there is still an opportunity for interested parties to make their views known. I <Col N="895"/>congratulate Senator Ulick Burke on raising this matter on the Adjournment and, hopefully, we can encourage more people to be aware of the work being done and also that discussions on the sectoral plan are under way and interested parties can make their views known.</P>
      <P>As Minister of State with responsibility in this area I encourage all interested parties to study the plan&rsquo;s proposals carefully and to forward any views they may have to my Department. I also encourage Members to do likewise.</P>
      <P>The National Disability Authority, together with my Department and five other Departments, is engaged in a series of regional meetings throughout the country publicising and explaining the sectoral plans. The regional meetings are intended for people with disabilities, carers, advocates, family, friends, service providers and the general public. The purpose of these meetings is to publicise the contents of the sectoral plan and to seek an informed debate and discussion on the proposals therein. I have already met the round table group. When the roll-out has been undertaken nationally I intend to meet the group again to ensure all the issues raised are accommodated.</P>
      <P>I am pleased the Government is honouring its commitment in the programme for Government in regard to accessible transport issues with great determination. Senator Burke raised a number of issues, including the importance of bus stops. There is no point in having terminal buildings and vehicles in order unless it is a seamless system. I concur with his views on bus stops. There is no point in providing the transformation required at the bus terminal and the low-floor bus if one cannot mount or dismount at the bus stop. The Senator raised a valid point. Kassel kerbing is being rolled out in certain areas. What I want is a seamless system where people will be able to use whatever mode of transport they choose and travel A to Z on it.</P>
      <P>The Senator raised also the taxi-hackney issue which is difficult to determine. I put it to the House and to the public that if somebody can come up with the appropriate vehicle that would be helpful but there is a difference of views by users and the various interested stakeholders as to the most appropriate vehicle.</P>
      <P>On the issue of the disabled persons and passengers tax concessions, I am surprised to learn there is a big issue on the Revenue side. I was aware that some people were concerned in regard to obtaining the primary medical certificate. If people meet the criteria and are denied the tax concessions by the Revenue Commissioners I would welcome any information Senator Burke may be able to forward.</P>
      <P>My objective is that all public transport operators should provide the highest possible degree of accessible transport having regard to what would be understood and accepted as normal constraints. I am aware that improving the accessibility of public transport brings benefits to <Col N="896"/>all users, including the most able bodied. It is a policy that has a clear impact on the population at large.</P>
      <P>The sectoral plan will provide the means for rolling out a comprehensive programme of accessible public transport during the next few years. All submissions received, together with the relevant inputs arising from the National Disability Association regional meetings will be taken into account in the finalisation of the plan. It is hoped to complete work on my Department&rsquo;s sectoral plan, following enactment of the Disability Bill and within the timeframe of one year thereafter, as provided for in the Bill. I hope that information is helpful to the House and, in particular, to Senator Burke.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, for coming to the House and for his interest in the western rail corridor.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State is aware, the western rail corridor was closed down in 1975, more than 30 years ago. Sadly, successive Governments have not reopened any part of this line. I was very happy to be nominated to a western inter-county railway committee in 1979, 26 years ago. Fr. Miche&aacute;l Mac Gr&eacute;il was then and still is secretary to the committee. We received great help from the West-On-Track group. There is strong support in the west for the reopening of this rail corridor.</P>
      <P>We were very disappointed when the strategic rail review did not issue a recommendation that this rail corridor should be reopened. The then Minister, Deputy Brennan, appointed a working group under Mr. Pat McCann, which recently produced a report. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, attended a conference in Breaffy House, Castlebar, to discuss this report. Mr. McCann has produced a very readable document. He does not beat around the bush. He examined <Col N="897"/>the rail corridor and considered whether the project should be commenced as a total job or in phases. I hope the total line will be reopened for both passenger and freight traffic.</P>
      <P>Mr. McCann commented that the line could be looked at in five stages: Ennis to Athenry, Athenry to Tuam, Tuam to Claremorris, Claremorris to Collooney. He proposed the addition of another section from Athenry to Galway which is technically not part of the western rail corridor but which would be a very useful commuter rail service. It would be necessary to restore the north-south crossover at Athenry and this issue was discussed when the crossover was taken away. I am pleased Mr. McCann recommends its restoration along with the improvement of Athenry station and new stations at Oranmore and Renmore with a potential for commuter services into Galway.</P>
      <P>Mr. McCann came out in favour of the Ennis to Athenry line where the average cost would be &euro;2.1 million per mile. He recommends this line could link up with other services including services to Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Cork. He also makes it clear he is impressed with the success of the Ennis to Limerick line which is in operation with a good number of trains.</P>
      <P>Mr. McCann states clearly he regards the section of line from Claremorris to Collooney as requiring a capital cost of &euro;197 million. This was a light rail service when first constructed and would require to be brought up to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann standard of heavy rail. It would cost &euro;24 million to create separations between two crossings on that section of line. I have an interest in this line which is in the CL&Aacute;R area. I suggest CL&Aacute;R funding should be requested for the most expensive and longest part of the line.</P>
      <P>The Athenry to Tuam and Tuam to Claremorris stages of the line could be treated as one stage with a link to Galway because it is shorter in distance than the Claremorris to Collooney stage and would cost approximately &euro;93 million. A commuter service should not be confined to servicing Galway and Claremorris; County Mayo would be an obvious starting point for a commuter service. These issues could be examined if the Minister were to provide the funding for the five stages as outlined in the McCann report.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State will be aware of the traffic congestion on the roads leading to Galway city as I have raised the matter many times. The village of Claregalway is always mentioned regarding morning traffic jams. The N17 has the heaviest traffic in the whole country and a morning commuter service would be very welcome. The morning service from Athlone, through Ballinasloe and Athenry and on to Galway is a good example of how an early morning service could be of benefit. Those who take the 7 a.m. train from Athlone are in Galway by 8.15 a.m. I make the same case in respect of Sligo and the northern end of the line where a commuter service would be much appreciated and welcomed.</P><Col N="898"/>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House. I look forward to positive news now that the McCann report has been published. I look forward to a debate in the House to discuss other issues related to the line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>He did not do too badly and I have much to thank him for.</P>
      <P>Last June the then Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, set up the western rail corridor working group under the chairmanship of Mr. Pat McCann. The establishment of the working group was primarily intended to provide a forum where those individuals and organisations who had long been promoting the idea of the western rail corridor, such as Senator Kitt, could put their arguments directly to the chairman and debate the issues with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, CIE, the Department of Transport and all other interested parties.</P>
      <P>Within the past week the Minister for Transport has received Mr. McCann&rsquo;s report. I join with the Minister in thanking him and all the other members of the group for all the work they have put into this process. The Minister has not had the opportunity to study the report in detail, but it is clear it displays a positive disposition towards the restoration of the western rail corridor, in line with Senator Kitt&rsquo;s view which he has expressed to me over the past years.</P>
      <P>The report is timely as it affords the Minister and his officials the opportunity to consider its proposals in the context of the preparation of the multi-annual capital investment framework for transport currently under way within the Department. My officials are urgently examining Mr. McCann&rsquo;s report to ensure a complete appraisal in advance of the finalisation of the framework. Decisions relating to the future of the western rail corridor will be made within that process.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The concept of balanced regional development is integral to the national spatial strategy. The Government is fully committed to achieving such development in the west through record capital investment in all sectors, particularly the transport sector. This is particularly the case with regard to investment in public transport infrastructure and services. Some of the more significant rail projects carried out in the west in recent times, or committed for the near future, clearly demonstrate this. The rail infrastructure improvements carried out under the rail safety programme 2000-04 have upgraded all key rail lines into the west to continuous welded rail on concrete sleepers. In the region of &euro;600 million was invested in the programme.</P><Col N="899"/>
      <P>A new rail safety programme is currently being rolled out which will include improvements to level crossings, bridges and other track work on all lines. The rail resignalling project, known as the Mini-CTC, on the Dublin-Galway line was completed in June 2003 with the immediate effect of significant journey time reductions on services. The Sligo line is on target for completion of its resignalling project later this year and similar time savings will benefit users of that line. Resignalling work on the Westport and Ballina lines will begin in early 2006 with a completion date of 2007.</P>
      <P>Due to the infrastructure upgrading, Irish Rail is now in a position to concentrate on introducing better timetabling and more frequent services with new improved rolling stock. With the arrival this year of new rolling stock to replace old stock and to expand the fleet &mdash; the Government has instigated the biggest ever purchase of rolling stock in the history of the State &mdash; rail passengers in the west can expect to see additional improvements in services.</P>
      <P>This year Irish Rail expects to take delivery of 36 DMU railcars and most of these are due to be allocated to the Sligo route to replace life-expired rolling stock and to increase frequency and capacity. An order for a fleet of 120 new inter-city <Col N="900"/>railcars has been placed by Irish Rail. These will enter service from 2007 onwards and will operate on the Galway, Westport and Ballina routes. At that point Irish Rail will be able to provide two hourly services on the Galway line and increased frequencies on the Westport and Ballina lines.</P>
      <P>All of these investments testify to the Government&rsquo;s commitment to balanced regional development in the west and to delivering the infrastructure that will make such development a reality. Mr. McCann&rsquo;s report will be examined in the context of the Government&rsquo;s record on delivering balanced regional development in the west and as part of the process of finalising the multi-annual investment framework for transport.</P>
      <P>I fully appreciate and accept the points raised by Senator Kitt and his Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues in the west whom I have met on a number of occasions regarding the western rail corridor. They have certainly convinced me of the need to proceed with this project. As I said earlier, in the process of the multi-annual investment framework for transport, decisions will be made on the future of the western rail corridor. I hope to be in a position within a couple of weeks to return with favourable news on this to Senator Kitt and his Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues who have pursued this issue for a number of months.</P>
