	<P>I have notice from Senator Morrissey that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport, in light of the appalling conditions experienced daily by commuters, to indicate when the Irish Rail plan, which includes the Spencer Dock station, inter-connector, and spur to Dunboyne, will be funded and commenced.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Terry of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to report on the possibility of widening the homemakers scheme to include homemakers who spent time out of the workforce on caring duties.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Bannon of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to clarify the position on funding of genealogical projects by the Irish Genealogical Project, as funding of projects, other than its own, seems not to be within the remit of the IGP, precluding all other projects and effecting a situation which is adverse to the advancement of Irish genealogy as a whole.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Dooley of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to make available the necessary funding to allow Clare County Council to ensure uncontaminated water is available free of charge to the people of Ennis and surrounding areas.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Finucane of the following matter:</P>
<Col N="738"/>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to restore the grant of 90% of the cost under the scheme of community support for older people as the reduction of the grant to &euro;300 is causing an undue financial burden on old age pensioners; and if he would create an emergency fund to be made available for security alarms to be fitted when the urgent need arises.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matters raised by Senators Morrissey, Terry and Bannon and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Dooley and Finucane may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, statements on the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Brazil and the discovery of avian influenza H5N1 in Romania and Turkey, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude no later than 1.30 p.m., with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of other Senators not to exceed seven minutes &mdash; Senators may share time and the Minister will be called on to reply no later than five minutes before the conclusion of the statements; and No. 2, statements on acute hospital services provided in Cavan, Monaghan and the north-eastern region, to be taken at 1.30 p.m. and to conclude no later than 2.35 p.m., with contributions of spokespersons or group leaders not to exceed ten minutes and the Minister to be called on to reply no later than five minutes before the conclusion of the statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to pre-empt the report that will be published next week concerning the sexual abuse of children in the Ferns diocese over a period of 20 or 30 years. However, I ask the Deputy Leader why there has been no inquiry into clerical abuse in the Dublin diocese given that a firm commitment was given to the victims in questions more than three years to establish such an inquiry, following revelations concerning a significant number of priests in the Dublin diocese, dating from the late 1950s. At the time, the Government, correctly, said a tribunal was out of the question, and the mechanism proposed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was the Commissions of Investigation Bill which subsequently passed into law.</P>
      <P>I say this in the context of next week&rsquo;s report on events in Ferns. There are implications for the Catholic Church on the question of celibacy. There also serious questions for the State and Garda authorities arising from the way in which evidence from children was not adequately processed. We need an explanation from the <Col N="739"/>Government as to why there has been no inquiry in the Dublin diocese, and possibly other dioceses.</P>
      <P>We learned yesterday of the abduction of Mr. Rory Carroll in Iraq. I am sure everything is being done by the Government and all authorities to ensure his safety and release. Mr. Carroll is known to us through his father, Mr. Joe Carroll, a distinguished parliamentary correspondent of <i>The Irish Times</i> who reported from this House for many years. This abduction highlights the danger for journalists in the Iraqi war zone and the bravery that a small, dedicated group of international journalists has shown in ensuring the truth is reported from that area. We hope for Mr. Carroll&rsquo;s safety and speedy return to his family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure all Members echo Senator Brian Hayes&rsquo;s words in regard to Mr. Rory Carroll. It is not appropriate to go any further than to express our solidarity and support for his family, particularly Mr. Joe Carroll who reported from this House on many occasions. Perhaps we should convey Members&rsquo; collective support for the family and urge that all possible is done politically to secure his safe release.</P>
      <P>The Ferns report is an issue deserving of discussion in this House. I was sickened by some of the information reported at the weekend. I do not want to trawl through this but aspects of it bothered me. One issue in particular stands out, that of the investigation into one of the most heinous aspects of this case, involving the abuse of eight girls on a church altar. The local garda&iacute; who investigated the priest allegedly responsible believed there was a case to answer and drew up a full report. That report has never been seen since and this raises some questions. Is there a relationship at some level between the Garda and church authorities? The chief officer in question was rewarded by the Pope on his retirement. I do not want to examine the entrails of these matters but I would like a debate to be held with regard to the process that was involved.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, I raised the issue of regulation of the Law Society and lawyers. Professional bodies may organise themselves through self or outside regulation or by means of an overarching organisation within which bodies, while maintaining the majority of responsibility for regulation, are answerable for their actions, must meet certain conditions and are subject to constant oversight. I would like to meet with the Law Society to learn of its views on this issue and invite other Members to join me in doing so.</P>
      <P>I call for a debate on this matter because over the past four or five days, I have been contacted by a number of solicitors. As vice-chairman of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, I have had many arguments with solicitors over the past two years. Despite that and recent events, I hold their <Col N="740"/>profession in the highest regard. Many people told me they were ashamed that their profession was being dragged down by what they described as a small number of people. Solicitors on the ground want action to be taken. They are locally well regarded and want a proper supervisory authority. We need to get the view of various lawyers to determine how the issued may be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with my colleagues in expressing horror at the kidnap of Rory Carroll. I do not want to say more, other than that I hope the situation is safely resolved. It is a terrifying time for him and is family.</P>
      <P>In terms of how we will deal with the reports of child sex abuse, particularly abuse within the Roman Catholic Church, let us not be sidetracked by issues of celibacy. Child abuse is an abuse of power by the perpetrator. The failure to properly investigate an incident is also an abuse of power, whether by church or State. This issue arises from the abuse and misuse of power and is ultimately a secular issue. Regardless of whether the church or State may claim jurisdiction, the abuse of power is a matter of concern to the State wherever it occurs.</P>
      <P>Over the past six months, I have been checking the speed of juggernauts I encounter while driving between Cork and Dublin. I then write to the companies concerned, without identifying individual drivers, to ask whether governors are fitted on the trucks I encountered. I have received a succession of categorical assurances that governors were fitted, even though the vehicles in question travelled at speeds of between 60 and 65 mph, which is almost ten miles above the limit supposedly imposed by these devices. It is clear to me that something is wrong. NRA surveys show that up to 80% of heavy goods vehicles breach speed limits. The fact that 80% of vehicles can breach speed limits despite being fitted with governors raises a question in terms of road traffic policy.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, this issue was summed up by Eddie Shaw of the National Safety Council, when he told an Oireachtas committee that no-one joins up the thinking or is responsible and accountable, there is no will or management and that no process is in place. It is time that we had a serious review of our road safety policy, which should not merely consist of a statement by the Government that is filled with bells and whistles and sets targets for the future. Progress and enforcement should be reported quarterly to this House because the country is experiencing a road safety crisis but no action is being taken. According to Eddie Shaw, nearly 200 people die needlessly each year because we do not have a policy. May we hold quarterly debates in this House on the situation with regard to our roads? The ongoing <Col N="741"/>level of slaughter should cause a permanent state of agitation within us.</P>
      <P Just="Left">This month, the European Ombudsman recommended that the EU Council of Ministers should meet in public when it acts in a legislative capacity, which is the case for every other legislative body in the European Union. The Union does not have secret parliaments, yet the Council of Ministers, which I suspect is larger than the European Parliament in terms of membership, insists on meeting in private. I want clarification on the Government&rsquo;s current position, not on what will happen if and when the EU constitution enters force. Does the Government believe that the Council of Ministers should meet in public when it acts in a legislative capacity? The answer is a simple &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We still do not know whether some of the aircraft which land in this country are exempted from the legal requirement to provide a manifest of goods and passengers. Last week, the Leader of the House failed to get an answer to an Adjournment matter concerning this issue. It is a simple question. Are some aircraft not asked to meet their legal obligations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with other speakers on the kidnapping of Rory Carroll. We should send our support to him, an appeal to his kidnappers to release him safely forthwith and express our concerns to his family. We should be proactive in this regard. We have a public relations officer for the Houses of the Oireachtas, who should convey to al-Jazeera an appeal from this House to Mr. Carroll&rsquo;s kidnappers and the authorities in Baghdad to release him. That would be worthwhile and helpful in the context of this gloomy period for him and his family.</P>
      <P>I recommend that the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources does not increase the television licence fee, which is currently &euro;155 per year. RTE, which this year made a profit of approximately &euro;8.5 million, does not deserve such an increase. No subsidies are paid to TV3, Today FM or the many excellent local radio stations, yet RTE, with its overpaid broadcasters and staff, is seeking a further increase. The ordinary people highlighted issues in terms of rip-off Ireland but it is rip-off television to demand this increase. It should be rejected forthwith.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The fees paid to RTE should be reduced because it does not deserve the amounts it receives. It is time that we take a stand in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Rubbish.</P>
    </Speaker>
<Col N="742"/>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>It is all right for wealthy academics and Senators to pay their fees but is difficult for hard-pressed housewives to find &euro;155.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Leyden gets a pension although he is still active in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad Senator Leyden expressed concern for the hard-pressed taxpayer but I would like him to express concern to the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs regarding a change in a scheme. An imaginative scheme, the scheme of community support for older people, was introduced in 1997. It assured elderly people, particularly pensioners and many people living alone in rural locations, that they would be entitled to security alarms and pendants. When the scheme was introduced 90% funding of the overall cost was provided. If one applied for the security alarm in May, one could have to wait until October or November before it would be fitted. If, for example, an older person living in rural Ireland who has lost a loved one requests this type of security service, it will now be a year before that person will receive the security alarm and pendant. Furthermore, the 90% funding of the scheme has been reduced to &euro;300. A hard-pressed pensioner who has to pay increased ESB and gas charges as well as increases for coal and other expenses now must find &euro;150 to pay for this service. That is a disgrace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator seeking a debate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>It was sneaky to reduce to &euro;300 the funding for that scheme. The Minister responsible has an abundance of funding available through the dormant accounts fund etc. I want him to increase the funding for this scheme to 90% and to put in place an emergency-type fund whereby if a person applies for this service, satisfies the criteria and is eligible for it, the security alarm can be fitted straight away. If Senator Leyden wants to do something to help hard-pressed taxpayers and pensioners, he should talk to the Minister responsible for that scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for bringing it to our attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator would not have brought it to his own attention or to that of the Minister responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>Let peace reign in this valley.</P>
      <P>Much has been said today about rural services, but the attitude of the NRA is not contributing to their sustainability. In a small area not far from Mullingar two local, well established businesses have been denied permission by the NRA to <Col N="743"/>erect signs to indicate the location of their businesses. One is a local shop &mdash; the only shop in the parish &mdash; and the other is a car body shop which has been operating for a number of years. If we are to have rural development and rural services, the attitude of the NRA must change. I ask the Deputy Leader to convey my concerns and, I am sure, those of other Members to the Minister responsible to exhort the NRA to relent on its approach in regard to these businesses. I will give the Deputy Leader the names of the people concerned at the end of the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I deplore the return to the neurotic obsession of certain sections of Fianna F&aacute;il with RTE. In the old days it was said it was full of communists and stickies and now it is said they are all capitalists. We would be foolish to undermine our national broadcaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is perfectly reasonable from time to time for there to be criticism of it, but we should not destroy public service broadcasting here, as has happened in other countries. We need only look next door to Britain and the way the Government there tried to undermine the BBC. We should not let that happen here. We get a very good service from the national broadcaster. When we want to highlight issues, such as the referendum on Europe, we rely on RTE. If we did not have it and only had the commercial stations, we would never get a message across. We also need to generate employment in our own local programming, script writing and acting. We should not weaken what is a great national institution simply because of some momentary irritation. That would be fatal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has his own show on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>No, but the Senator practically has. He is on it every bloody night. I do not know what he is squawking about, he is just looking for another headline.</P>
      <P>A meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges is scheduled. Will the Deputy Leader confirm that the question I have repeatedly raised &mdash; and in respect of which I would say that there is support across this House, although for obvious reasons everybody cannot be upfront about it &mdash; about extending the time allocated for the Order of Business will be raised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the most vital element of our business, the one that is covered by the media <Col N="744"/>and the one in which people are most interested. Why do we not go with the flow, as they say, and accept the reality, instead of impotently trying to curtail it? We say that a half an hour is allocated for it but I suggest the time allocated should be extended to 45 minutes or an hour. Every sitting day the Order of Business continues for 45 minutes and that includes the introduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>That is 45 minutes that the Senator wants for himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Let us be realistic and honest about this. Can the Leas-Chathaoirleach give me a guarantee that this matter will be on the&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is an issue the Senator can take up with the leader of his group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not have a leader. We appear to have a new leader in Senator Coonan; that is one up for us. Can we have an extra chair?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has a representative on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges with whom he can raise this matter. I believe it is Senator O&rsquo;Toole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>My representative will raise it. It is a matter that would add to the strength and visibility of the business of the House.</P>
      <P>With regard to road safety, I agree with Senator Ryan. We should have a review of it but it is unnecessary to have a debate on the issue four times a year because the Joint Committee on Transport can examine the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Senator another point to make?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, I am speaking about the debate that has been called for by Senator Ryan. I support it but it is unnecessary to debate the issue four times a year.I have just come from the Joint Committee on Transport which was dealing with the issue of safety. Mr. Shaw appeared before it. There are serious issues that need to be addressed in this area that are not always addressed on the Order of Business. We have had several recent tragedies. People start talking about heavy goods vehicles in this context but they have nothing to do with these situations. There is a recurring situation that we need to address. It is that of young people in the early hours of a Sunday morning, perhaps intoxicated with drink or drugs, driving high powered cars possibly on roads that are in a bad state of repair&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is debating the issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator seeking a debate on this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am supporting Senator Ryan&rsquo;s request for one.</P>
      <P>I had intended to seek a debate on Iraq but at the moment this is not a good idea because we have a muddied situation that needs to be explored. I cannot say that I extend sympathy to Mr. Carroll, for whom I have high respect as I do for his father, because one hopes and believes that because he appears to have been taken by the militia of Moqtada al-Sadr he has a good chance of surviving and coming back home. I very much hope this happens. However, it is tragic and ironic that he should be taken on the anniversary of the kidnapping of Margaret Hassan who was a noble, decent and good woman, as Mr. Carroll is a decent, good and efficient reporter. I wish for his safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I raised the issue I am about to raise now on the Order of Business yesterday. It concerns a four year old, Great Agbonlahor, and this is a picture of him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the Chair&rsquo;s ruling. This four year old boy is autistic and is now in foster care. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is to be commended on ordering a reprieve of one week in regard to the deportation of his family. This boy is receiving one-to-one tuition, he has a classroom assistant and is being cared for. If he goes back to Nigeria he will not get that assistance. The rudimentary health care system there would not offer him the basics let alone what a person with his special needs requires. Ministerial discretion in regard to the implementation of deportation legislation needs be exercised. I ask that the Minister immediately extend to one month the reprieve granted in order that Great can be properly assessed and thereafter allowed to remain in this country. This State must extend its support to this autistic boy of four years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have requested a debate on decentralisation on a few occasions recently. It might sound like an old chestnut but it is almost two years since the initial announcement of the decentralisation programme and there has been a total lack of progress in that regard. For instance, last week in Mallow the chairperson of F&aacute;ilte Ireland indicated that the proposed decentralis<Col N="746"/>ation project to Mallow could take at least ten years to transpire. If that is symptomatic of the delivery of the decentralisation project announced two years ago, it proves that it is not just derailed but a joke. We need to introduce some realism into the debate on this issue. We need to have a debate to ascertain what exactly the Government is planning. Notwithstanding that the announcement of the project two years ago was in advance of a local election, I am sure there was probably a genuine intention to introduce decentralisation, but it is simply is not happening. We need to hear directly from the senior Minister concerned or from the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, and learn what their plans are. We need to ascertain if the Government is still committed to decentralisation because the announcement of December 2003 is now seen as little more than electoral window dressing. I ask the Deputy Leader to arrange a debate on decentralisation in advance of the Budget Statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with Senator McCarthy in seeking a debate on immigration policy. It would serve the House well if the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform came here to discuss this issue and progress in policy on asylum seekers. We all acknowledge the emotional side of the case referred to by Senator McCarthy. However, we should be fair and present the facts of this case as they are. The child in question is Italian and was born in Italy. His mother fled Italy with him and sought asylum in Ireland. Both mother and child are free to leave this country and return to Italy, where the child&rsquo;s father and woman&rsquo;s husband resides, at any stage. There is an onus on everyone to present the facts of such cases. Otherwise, we may have an open door policy which would undermine the integrity of the independent system of assessment currently in place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>After I spoke on the Order of Business on Wednesday last week, I received a text message a few minutes later commenting on the tie I was wearing rather than what I spoke about. What struck me about the message was the fact that it came from Melbourne, Australia. I had not realised that broadband technology was so effective that it allowed someone to watch the Order of Business or other business in the Seanad on the Internet. The reason I mention this anecdote is because I was stunned to discover that Ireland is ranked 19th out of 22 countries with broadband technology according to OECD figures published this week. Discussions took place in this House approximately ten years ago about what happened in Singapore and South Korea when those two countries decided they would become the hub of information technology in Asia. Members stated that Ireland should attempt to do so as well. Today, 5% of Irish homes are now connected to broadband, while the figure is 92% in <Col N="747"/>South Korea. Broadband technology presents opportunities for Irish businesses but somebody in Government needs to ensure that it is made a priority.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I wish to comment on Senator Ryan&rsquo;s comments about road safety and the comments made yesterday by the chairman of the National Safety Council, Eddie Shaw. Approximately five years ago, the President of France put road safety high on his agenda when he took office. French road safety figures have improved dramatically because road safety was made a priority by somebody at the top. We can do the same in Ireland if road safety is placed high on the Taoiseach&rsquo;s agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator McCarthy raised an interesting point regarding the facilities and services for children with autism in Nigeria. I suggest to the Deputy Leader that we have a debate on services and facilities for children with autism in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>The situation in the Loop Head peninsula in west Clare is particularly difficult. Senator Daly and I have been working to ensure that the kind of services and facilities that are needed for children on the autism spectrum are put in place. Occupational therapists and speech and language therapists are not readily available in this area and parents are expected to travel 50 to 60 miles to locations where these services are available. Some movements have been made on the education front but more needs to be done by the Department of Health and Children to put in place these kinds of facilities and services. We cannot simply accept that personnel are not available because they are available in the private sector. There must be greater movement on this issue and this is why I would welcome a debate on policy in this House.</P>

	<P>Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is getting out of the freight business and is reported to be selling off &euro;4.5 million worth of freight carriages that were only purchased in 2002 and have scarcely been used. This is a hugely short-sighted and deranged State policy and the Minister for Transport needs to come to the House to discuss it. Freight services are crying out for competition. If Iarnr&oacute;d Eireann will not operate in the freight business, private sector operators, who are prepared to run freight traffic on railways, should be allowed in. The abandonment of rail freight travel is the last thing we need given the condition of our roads. We do not need more heavy goods vehicles on our roads, with all the attendant pollution and road safety implications. The Deputy Leader should comment on this issue this <Col N="748"/>morning and ask the Minister to come to the House to discuss State policy on freight because it is mad.</P>

	<P>Senator Morrissey has been consistent in his criticism of Government transport policy. The Deputy Leader should invite the Minister for Transport to come to the House to debate this issue. Last week, the Government allowed CIE to increase its fares to something in the region of 10%, which is shameful.

	<P>One of the last items of legislation dealt with in the Seanad and D&aacute;il was the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill 2004. The establishment of an ombudsman commission to replace the discredited Garda Complaints Board is an integral part of this Bill. The ombudsman commission has <Col N="749"/>still not been established. I received a letter from a constituent during the week in which he complained that his case has now been referred to the discredited Garda Complaints Board. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should come to the House to explain his tardiness in setting up the ombudsman commission, which is extremely important. We need an assurance from him that all current or pending complaints against the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be put on hold until such time as the new commission has been established. I am seeking a debate on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with Senator Finucane in calling for the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to examine the way in which additional charges are placed on personal alarms. This scheme now penalises rather than benefits the elderly. I have received numerous complaints in my own constituency in Roscommon about the number of people who cannot afford to pay the additional charge of &euro;165, which is double the amount of a pension.</P>
      <P>Despite the investment it has made, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is not taking care of its pensioners and the Minister should intercede immediately in this affair. A pensioner with 40 years service with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann receives a pension of &euro;127 a week. How can anybody survive on this amount? Members of the Defence Forces, local authority members and Bord na M&oacute;na workers receive more than &euro;80 per week extra. I ask the Minister to intercede immediately to ensure Irish Rail workers who have worked tremendously hard and have turned around Irish Rail are recognised and get a pension on which they can live.</P>

	<P>Partial decentralisation, a limited version, is going ahead. I support the call for a debate on decentralisation because in this House, some months ago, during the passage of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said he was not in favour of decentralising the Garda inspectorate to <Col N="750"/>Roscrea, in north Tipperary, as promised. A high profile announcement was made to that effect. These comments were welcomed by Senator Hayes. It is obvious that decentralisation as announced is not going ahead and I would welcome a debate on the issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senators Brian Hayes, O&rsquo;Toole, Ryan, Leyden, Mansergh and even Senator Norris spoke about the kidnapping of Rory Carroll. Joe Carroll was a person many of us would have known very well and an excellent journalist. Obviously the kidnapping is a matter of serious concern and I know the Government and the Department of Foreign Affairs are doing all they can to try to resolve the situation. I was encouraged, as I am sure others were this morning, by the correspondent from the <i>Christian Science Monitor</i> who was on radio and indicated that because of the place where we was kidnapped and the probable captors there was a good chance Rory would be released. Obviously we hope that will happen. I undertake to convey to the family the good wishes of Members. I agree with Senator Norris that we should wait for some time to discuss the matter of Iraq.</P>
      <P>Senators Brian Hayes, O&rsquo;Toole and Ryan raised the matter of the abuse in the diocese of Ferns. I appreciate Senator Brian Hayes made a slightly different inquiry as to the commitment to the victims of abuse in Dublin. I do not know the position in regard to that issue but I will endeavour to find it out. These matters are worthy of debate here. We should not shy away from them because they are difficult issues or because they involve the church. It is unfortunate that in the past there may have been a sense of immunity in certain sections of society, including the churches, where some of these events took place. Those of us of a certain generation can imagine what the reaction would have been had we told our parents we had been abused by a member of the clergy; there would certainly have been a defence of the clergy. What happened is outrageous. That the ecclesiastical authorities did not seem to deal with it effectively is bad. The House should be able to discuss these issues, not the specifics or the difficult individual details but the broader issue because it has serious implications for society. Any matter such as that should be debated here.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole raised the issue of the Law Society and the regulation of the legal profession. I heard the Master of the High Court say this morning there was a need for the profession of solicitors to act in a better way. The wider issue is the whole question of regulation. It is unfortu<Col N="751"/>nate that increasingly across the professions there is a need to introduce statutory regulation. Obviously it would be better if we had self-regulation. However, history teaches us that we are not good at that and certainly it is the case that some solicitors have their hands in their clients&rsquo; pockets. I accept there are many good solicitors who do their job well but there are some who do not and they must be rooted out and regulated. If the Law Society is not prepared to do the rooting out the Legislature has to do the job.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senators Ryan, Norris and Quinn raised transport matters and some of the statements made yesterday by Mr. Shaw. I heard what he had to say last night and he was quite vigorous in his statements. I noticed that Deputy Howlin was one of those who rebutted what he had to say; he suggested that everybody in politics was culpable. Deputy Howlin made the point that there was a broader culpability than that. I share that view. It is matter we should try to debate. There should be a general review of the road safety policy and I am sure the Minister would be happy to do that. With regard to the matter of HGVs, I agree with Senator Ryan. When travelling on the Naas dual carriageway last night in the rain I noticed many of them travelling at excessive speeds. Even though the road is restricted at present, it is very dangerous. In all of this there is a matter of individual responsibility. People have to be responsible for their own conduct. It cannot always be done by regulation. I appreciate that the traffic corps is being strengthened and I welcome the development taking place in Donegal. There is also a commitment from the Garda to have more garda&iacute; on the roads. That is helpful but there must also be a degree of personal responsibility. I do not know the answer to Senator Ryan&rsquo;s question about the aircraft but I will certainly try to find out.</P>
      <P>On the matter of the European Council acting in public when it is legislating, I agree this should be done and I have made that known to my own party. Hopefully it will happen. It is provided for in the constitution and, when that is adopted, it will happen, but it should happen in advance.</P>
      <P>Senators Leyden and Norris raised the issue of television licences, which are a serious burden for the elderly and those of limited means. In general the national broadcaster provides a good service. It is useful that there is a tension between Government, politics and the broadcaster. I do not see anything wrong with that. It is the regulator who will decide whether the fee is increased. If the other channels are required to fulfil a public service remit, I do not see why all the money should go to RTE. I made this point when the legislation was passing through the House. <Col N="752"/>They have an entitlement if they are required to have a public service remit.</P>
      <P>To return to the Rory Carroll matter, there is an important point about the press which relates to RTE. It is essential that we know what is going on in Iraq and these people provide a valuable service. Even some of those who are active in their kidnapping realise that. That is one of the reasons I am hopeful Mr. Carroll will be released.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>We received a valued and valuable service from the RTE journalists who bravely reported from Baghdad during the worst of the war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Norris. Senators Finucane and Feighan raised the matter of community support for older people. I agree it was a good scheme and I know of many who availed of it. Some of the rural organisations were involved in ensuring people got these devices. I have personal experience in my own family of their success. I do not know the detail but I will endeavour to find out. It is a matter that can be discussed at a later date.</P>
      <P>Senator Glynn raised the issue of the National Roads Authority not contributing to the signage for local services. He has a good point. I was in France at the weekend and I noticed that at the top of each road there are signs for virtually every business on the road. The signs are small and uniform and do not intrude. People should know where these services are and it should be possible to erect signs. We will try to progress that issue.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris raised the issue of extending the time allocated for the Order of Business. This matter was discussed in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges before the present session; it confirmed that we would have this order. While I am sure it can be reviewed in the future, that is the way it is at the moment. It is not for me to say whether the time allocated should be increased or reduced; the House resolved it is a matter for the committee and the House to decide. I agree with Senator Mansergh that structured debate is the correct approach. Sometimes I wonder about the matters raised on the Order of Business. Of course they are all very appropriate, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, and if they were not you would rule them out of order.</P>
      <P>Senators McCarty, Dooley and Minihan spoke about a particular autistic child. While I do not know the full details, I know that more issues are involved than might appear, as mentioned by Senator Minihan. Senator Dooley made a good point about autism. All of us would have experience of difficulties families with an autistic child have had not only with central Government services but also with local planning authorities. In some cases people need to change their houses and have difficulty with the relevant planning <Col N="753"/>authority. We should debate the issue of autism and disability.</P>
      <P>Senators Bradford, Mansergh and Coonan spoke about decentralisation. While it is patchy in its rollout, as far as I am aware it is still the Government&rsquo;s commitment to proceed with decentralisation. I look forward to the Department of Defence and the Army headquarters coming to County Kildare. I will ask the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, to come to the House to discuss these issues in detail.</P>
      <P>I am glad that Senator Quinn can be seen in Melbourne. We may reach the point in the House where we will be like Miche&aacute;l O&rsquo;Hehir at an all-Ireland final welcoming everybody from Melbourne, Chicago, Los Angeles, Canada etc. I know the Internet is being watched and I take the Senator&rsquo;s point about broadband. I know the determination exists to roll it out. I have seen it successfully installed in small places in the west of Ireland. While I do not dispute what he said, I am surprised the figure is as mentioned. It is the determination of those involved to roll it out properly and to have it implemented.</P>
      <P>Senators Coghlan, Bannon and Feighan spoke about Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann. It sounds like bad business planning if it bought carriages which it now needs to scrap. It is a market reality that the rail network in Ireland from the point of view of those transporting goods seems inadequate, which is why the freight goes on the roads even though they are congested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Are private operators prepared to operate rail freight?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>The point is that on the Continent, the railhead would go into the factory, which is the way to do it. However, the factory would pay for that; I do not know how many manufacturers here would be prepared to do so. It is purely an economic issue and it seems like bad business planning.</P>
      <P>I believe Senator Feighan raised the wider issue of pensions, of which I was not aware and it is certainly a serious issue. Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as a semi-State body, is slightly different from some of the other bodies and probably had its own pension scheme. We all know that some of those schemes in both the private sector and the public sector may not have been as well funded as they should have been. Perhaps some of the investments were not as prudent as they should have been.</P>
      <P>Senator Higgins spoke about the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill and the establishment of an ombudsman. As far as I am aware there is determination to have the Bill completed quickly. I will certainly speak to the Minister on the Senator&rsquo;s behalf and <Col N="754"/>will ask him to communicate with him if it is in order.</P>

	<P>I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to address the House about the issue of avian influenza, or &ldquo;bird &rsquo;flu&rdquo;, to which it is often referred. The issue has generated a tremendous amount of publicity in recent months, particularly since the confirmation of the presence of the high pathogenic H5N1 virus in Russia and Kazakhstan during the summer and, in the past week or so, in Turkey and Romania. The House will also be aware of the reported outbreak on the Greek island of Chios. If this latter suspect case is confirmed, it will represent the first outbreak of high pathogenic avian influenza in the European Union since an outbreak in the Netherlands in 2003.</P>
      <P>We have had previous experience of high pathogenic avian influenza, most recently in 1983 and several outbreaks of the low pathogenic virus since. In all cases, the outbreaks were eradicated quickly. The apparent western drift of the disease is, of course, a matter for concern and we share the opinion expressed by the European Commissioner for Health and Consumer Affairs that the most recent developments are &ldquo;worrying&rdquo;. Our consistent approach has been to be measured in our response to the risk and to initiate such precautionary measures as we consider proportionate, based on an assessment of that risk. My Department has been constantly reviewing its contingency arrangements in the light of any emerging information and on the basis of the most up-to-date veterinary, scientific and ornithological information available.</P>
      <P>Before advising the House of the measures taken in response to the risk of the disease being introduced into Ireland, I will make a few points about avian influenza. It is a highly infectious disease of birds that rarely infects humans and, only then, through very close contact with infected birds. The World Health Organisation has reported that, since December 2003 in south-east Asia, 117 people have contracted the disease of whom 60 have died. Notwithstanding these 60 unfortunate deaths, the WHO takes the view that the experience in that region &ldquo;indicates that human cases of infection are rare&rdquo;. It is also worth saying that there are no confirmed cases of human-to-human transmissions of the disease.</P>
      <P>On Friday last, the EU Standing Committee on Animal Health and the Food Chain expressed the opinion that &ldquo;the public is far less likely to be exposed in Europe than in Central Asia and the Far East because of the generally greater separation of humans and commercially kept birds in Europe.&rdquo; These points are worth making to illus<Col N="755"/>trate that, at a time when over 150 million birds have died or been destroyed in the region, a relatively small number of human cases &mdash; 117 in all &mdash; have been recorded in four countries with a combined population of more than 400 million people. Furthermore, those cases occurred in quite different circumstances from those which apply, not alone in Ireland, but throughout Europe.</P>
      <P>The principal threat to public health is of a possible mutation or a genetic change in the avian virus that could lead to the virus transforming into a new strain of influenza capable of human-to-human transmission. Responsibility for preparing for and dealing with any human pandemic that might follow such an eventuality rests with the Department of Health and Children and its agencies.</P>
      <P>The Department of Agriculture and Food is focused on implementing measures aimed at minimising the risk of introduction of avian influenza into Ireland and, in the event of any outbreak, ensuring that it is detected early and eradicated quickly. Early detection is a central part of our contingency arrangements and I want to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the national parks and wildlife service, the National Association of Regional Game Councils and<?oasys _jy?>BirdWatch Ireland, all of which have been enthusiastic partners of the Department of Agriculture and Food in ensuring the effectiveness of our early warning system. Through this arrangement, unusual or increased patterns of wild bird mortality are notified and will, where appropriate, be fully investigated. This important measure is complemented by Ireland&rsquo;s annual avian influenza surveillance plan, as part of which 20,000 samples are serologically screened annually from clinically sick birds as well as commercial layer flocks prior to export.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Department of Agriculture and Food is working very closely with the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland. Representatives of the two Departments have met twice in the past month to consider their respective approaches to the risk of disease introduction and have undertaken to exchange the results of their respective wild bird surveillance programmes. Steps have also been taken to increase awareness of the disease and the measures which poultry flockowners and travellers can take to minimise the risk of introducing disease into the country. The Department has updated its advice on the bio-security measures which should be taken by flock owners as well as publishing the clinical symptoms to watch out for. In addition, advice to those travelling to and from affected areas has been updated and published in the national newspapers. The Department intends to step up its awareness campaign over the coming weeks and months using a variety of <Col N="756"/>media, including its website and the national newspapers as well as posters at points of entry and exit to and from the country.</P>
      <P>Apart from the domestic measures which my Department has introduced, the EU has also been responding swiftly to the increased risk of the disease being introduced into the Union. In January 2004, by way of response to the December 2003 outbreaks in south-east Asia, the EU introduced a series of safeguard measures that effectively banned the importation into the EU of live poultry, poultry products other than heat-treated poultry meat, and treated feathers. These measures have now been extended until September 2006 and have since been applied to the more recently affected countries of Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkey and Romania. The ban is being implemented at Irish border inspection posts and my Department&rsquo;s inspectors are being supported in this regard by the customs and excise service which has assured the Department of its full co-operation and assistance.</P>
      <P>Last Friday, the EU Standing Committee on Animal Health and the Food Chain, unanimously agreed a Commission decision requiring member states to assess the risk of H5N1 being introduced into poultry holdings. The various measures to be taken by individual member states are to be taken on the basis of a risk assessment, taking account of the criteria and risk factors set out in the decision. Senators can be assured that Ireland will fully meet its obligations under the decision and will implement such measures as are appropriate in an Irish context.</P>
      <P>I assure the House that my Department has been very proactive in stepping up its level of preparedness over the past number of months and has consistently adopted a measured approach to the threat based on an assessment of the risk of an outbreak. The Department is an active participant at EU level and is constantly reviewing the adequacy of its contingency arrangements. It has introduced a series of measures which it considers appropriate to the current level of risk and will not hesitate to introduce any such further measures as considered proportionate.</P>
      <P>On the subject of imports of meat from third countries, as a member of the European Union and the World Trade Organisation, Ireland is in a position to avail of trade opportunities and is obliged to respect the obligations membership of such organisations may bring. To minimise any risks that might be associated with trade with third countries there are harmonised rules governing the importation of animal products such as meat. It is a general requirement that animal products imported into the EU from third countries meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between, EU member states. All meat imports must therefore come from third countries or areas of third countries approved for export to the EU.</P>
<Col N="757"/>
      <P>The EU Food and Veterinary Office, FVO, carries out audits of the controls in place in third countries. In order to become an approved third country a country must appear on a list drawn up and updated on the basis of EU audits and guarantees given by the competent authority of the exporting country; have veterinary controls equivalent to those applicable in the EU, particularly in terms of legislation, hygiene conditions, animal health status, zoonosis controls and other food law; and submit a residues monitoring plan that demonstrates that controls regarding prohibited substances and veterinary medicines generally are equivalent to those in the member states of the EU. In some countries, so called split production systems exist whereby animals reared for export and for slaughter for export to the EU come from herds that have not been given substances that have been banned in the EU.</P>
      <P>The FVO carries out inspections to ensure that only establishments that meet hygiene and health standards equivalent to those operating within the EU are approved. Exporting establishments must have standards equivalent to the requirements for EU export establishments; effective control systems and supervision by the competent authorities; and traceability labelling in accordance with systems approved by the FVO.</P>
      <P>Following the confirmation of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in cattle and pigs on a farm in the Eldorado district of Mato Grosso do Sui in the southern part of Brazil on 8 October 2005, the EU Commission presented a proposal on Wednesday 12 October to suspend imports of deboned and matured beef from the regions of Mato Grosso do Sui, Parana, and also S&atilde;o Paulo. The Commission extended the scope of this proposed measure to include the region of S&atilde;o Paulo on the basis of concerns in relation to the possible movement of animals from the area where the outbreak has been reported. The proposal was adopted that day at the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, SCoFCAH, at which my Department is represented. Accordingly, beef produced in the affected regions from cattle slaughtered since 29 September 2005 may not now be traded. The measures have immediate effect throughout the EU and are being applied to direct imports of beef by my Department&rsquo;s approved border inspection posts. The implementation of this decision will have a very significant impact on exports of beef from Brazil to the EU.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that in respect of trade in agricultural products, the EU generally applies the so-called regionalisation principle, which allows trade to continue from non-affected regions in an approved country. In practice, this means that where there is a disease outbreak, restrictions on trade are applied to products from the affected region or regions while trade can continue from other unaffected parts of the country or regions. It will be recalled that this prin<Col N="758"/>ciple was applied to trade in animal products in this country during the foot and mouth disease outbreak in 2001.</P>
      <P>Consignments from third countries must first be landed at a border inspection post that has been approved by the Food and Veterinary Office of the EU and must undergo documentary, identity and physical checks. These checks are carried out at frequencies laid down in EU law. In Ireland, border inspection posts approved for the processing of imports of animal products are located at Dublin Port and Shannon Airport. Imported meat must be accompanied by the appropriate commercial documentation showing country and approval number of the establishment of production and a health certificate conforming to the models set down in EU legislation. The meat must also be clearly labelled that it is of non-EU origin.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied the action taken by the EU is the appropriate response to the recent outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Brazil. I will be keeping the position under close review in conjunction with the EU Commission and other member states.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. T&aacute; f&aacute;ilte romhat go dt&iacute; an Teach. These two issues are likely to have a serious impact on Irish citizens, both producers and consumers. Recent newspaper headlines have stated that 10,000 are to die in a flu epidemic and 50,000 will perish in a pandemic. It is known that bird flu, avian flu, can have catastrophic consequences but those figures are startling. I will return to the subject of avian flu later.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State to consider that 100,000 predicted to die by slow strangulation would be a very frightening statistic to see in a newspaper headline but this is the threat facing Irish farmers and particularly beef-producing farmers posed by imports from third world countries, particularly from Brazil. The Irish farmer produces a top quality green product from a clean environment which is traceable from fork to farm and is accepted throughout the world. This has been endangered by exports from South America. Neither I nor my party are against free trade and nor are Irish farmers but we want fair trading conditions.</P>
      <P>The standards of the Irish production system are very different to those in Brazil. The Minister of State has assured the House that the beef from these regions of Brazil is traceable but this is not the case. There is no tagging of cattle in Brazil. Of a population of approximately 200 million head of steer in Brazil, the 2004 FVO report on health controls and traceability in Brazil estimates that only 16 million are tagged and they are only tagged 45 days before slaughter. This is not a level playing pitch by an stretch of the imagination.</P>

      <P>Brazil has huge ranches probably owned by very wealthy people from Europe or wealthy corporations who are farming and producing this beef on the backs of slave labour. This is another inequality in trade that should not be allowed in Europe and should not be accepted in Brazil either. I join with the farming organisations and my colleagues, who have called for a total ban on Brazilian beef. This is a very serious issue for the consumer, from a health and safety perspective. The beef that comes in from Brazil is riddled with hormones. The use of clenbuterol is permitted and extensive in Brazil. There are no sanctions against its use. In this country, on the other hand, farmers have been imprisoned for using hormones. Again, the playing pitch is not level.</P>
      <P>When there was an outbreak of foot and mouth disease here, every section of the community rallied, under the leadership of the then Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh. A tremendous effort was made to hold the disease at bay. People were concerned about the possible impact on the economy and the country and put their shoulders to the wheel in an effort to prevent the disease spreading. In Brazil there are now over 150 confirmed cases of foot and mouth disease but we are allowing the importation of Brazilian beef to continue. This is very serious. We need urgent action and answers to these questions.</P>
      <P>The FBO, on the issue of farm registration in Brazil, concluded that there is no link between the data recorded at local level and that recorded in central databases. Brazilian cattle are not tagged, can roam freely, can be transported from one part of the country to another with no restrictions and can mix with other herds. Despite this, we allow Brazilian meat to come into this country. The only answer is a total ban. Why do countries like China, Korea and Japan take the issue so seriously? They have imposed a total ban on imports while we have only banned them from certain regions of Brazil. I have already described our ban as a Mickey Mouse one &mdash; it is neither one thing nor the other.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State referred to the issue of labelling, which is another disaster and fiasco. Brazilian beef can come into this country, be processed with a mere sprinkling of breadcrumbs, for example, and then become an Irish product. It can then be distributed throughout this country and Europe as Irish beef. This is not good enough for today&rsquo;s consumer is concerned. These beef products present a high risk to human health and consumer well being. We should not allow this to happen. We have beef in this country, masquerading as Irish, that has come from Brazil. We have chicken, masquerading as Irish, that has come from Thailand and we have pork from the United States that is masquerading as Irish pork. We have vegetables from South Africa masquerading as Irish. The same conditions, regulations <Col N="760"/>and intensive scrutiny that Irish producers are subject to, do not apply in Brazil. I call on the Minister of State to impose an outright ban on these products.</P>
      <P>If people do not believe my assertion that beef from Brazil is masquerading as Irish beef, they only have to speak to the Irish Farmers Association. The IFA did a survey on beef. It had DNA tests done on beef samples which proved conclusively that Brazilian beef was being served in restaurants and hotels in Dublin but was labelled as Irish beef. This is not good enough nor is it acceptable.</P>
      <P>Irish farmers are very concerned about the environment and health. The same concern does not exist in Brazil. There are no restrictions on the diet of cattle, which can be fed anything. Nitrates directives do not apply in Brazil and there are no proposals to introduce prescription-only medicines for cattle. If an Irish calf has ring worm, a farmer cannot go into a chemist to buy an antibiotic to treat the animal. If I have ringworm myself, I can walk into a pharmacy, pay &euro;5 and use the treatment purchased. However, we take our beef production so seriously that over-the-counter purchase of antibiotics is not allowed and I do not have a problem with that. I have a problem, however, when it is allowed in Brazil and other countries in South America. We need to improve upon that situation.</P>
      <P>We also need to improve upon our bio-security arrangements. We need security of supply. If we continue to strangle Irish beef production, as we are doing, we will not have a quality product in this country. We will end up depending on cheap, high-risk imports from Brazil. What happens to our supply if Irish agriculture is killed off or if dockers go on strike in France or Britain? Where would we get our food from then? We must ensure that there is a safe supply of food here.</P>
      <P>We must take immediate action on imports of beef from Brazil. We must stand by our farmers, who were misled by the EU Commissioner, Mr. Franz Fischler, who reformed the Common Agricultural Policy. One of the main selling points for the single farm payment was that it would lead to a cut in production, which, in turn, would lead to an increase in prices. In fact, the direct opposite has happened. There has been a cut in production, but the vacuum has been filled with imports from Brazil, resulting in a drop in prices. Imports of beef from Brazil in 2002 amounted to approximately 350,000 tonnes. This year, so far, 550,000 tonnes of Brazilian beef have flooded the Irish market, with a resulting drop in prices of over &euro;100 per head in the critical months of August and September, when most Irish farmers dispose of their cattle. This situation is very serious. I am calling for an outright ban on beef imports from Brazil and look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.</P>

      <P>On the issue of the avian or bird flu &mdash; I have a touch of the flu myself and I hope it is not of the feathered kind&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope it is not contagious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I think the Chair is safe. Avian flu can have catastrophic consequences, especially when combined with human flu. We must be careful in our approach to this problem. I welcome some of the announcements made by the Minister of State in that regard.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State must address the public fear surrounding the availability of the antibiotic needed to treat an epidemic, or indeed, a pandemic. It was reported in newspapers recently that 600,000 units of Tamilflu will be available to treat the public by the end of this year. A further 400,000 units will be available in the new year. Clearly we are not stockpiling sufficient antibiotics to deal with an epidemic if, or when, it hits our shores. The slow spread of the avian flu has been reported. It started in south-east Asia and now we believe that it is in Ireland. Perhaps the Minister of State can confirm that. It has been reported that birds on one of the Greek or Cypriot islands have proven to be affected by the harmful virus.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that over 6,000 people work in our poultry industry, avian flu could have devastating consequences if Irish poultry has to be slaughtered. I hope that this does not happen but whatever needs to be done should be contemplated immediately. Some precautionary measures include housing poultry stocks indoors or placing netting around them so that wild birds cannot get in among them.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State to address the allegations that there has been major bureaucratic bungling, particularly by the British and European authorities, with regard to taking samples for analysis. Such analysis is designed to identify the deadly strain of the virus and, if identified, allow us to take all necessary precautions. The Irish people deserve to know what is going on. If this type of bungling is taking place, it should be eliminated immediately and people should be held responsible for their actions.</P>
      <P>While we must all exercise a degree of responsibility and not panic, we must take action. The Minister of State should reassure the public that the necessary stockpiles of drugs are being ordered to deal with the pandemic. Professor Luke Clancy, consultant respiratory physician in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, said he hopes anti-viral drugs will not be needed. He warned that if they were, there would not be sufficient numbers of them to halt the spread of the flu. The Minister of State will have the public on his side as he fights this problem, and we wish him well.</P>
<Col N="762"/>
      <P>On imports from Brazil, will the Minister of State confirm whether he believes the independence of the food and veterinary office has been damaged because it is alleged that the Brazilian authorities delayed until now the inspection and report on the traceability of Brazilian imports which should have taken place in October 2003? In the meantime, it has allowed a huge volume of beef to come into this country unchecked. I urge the Minister of State to take action on both fronts on which he will have the support of all parties present here and the public in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan"><NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In welcoming the Minister of State to the House, I want to express my pleasure at seeing Senator Feeney in the Chair. It is my first time seeing her there and I wish her well.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister, Ministers of State and the Department of Agriculture and Food on a very successful 12 months management of agricultural and related matters. I congratulate the Minister of State on the role he played. I did not think we would be back here debating foot and mouth disease so soon after dealing with the serious case that arose in this country and the Six Counties and which ravaged Great Britain and parts of Europe. However, we are back here debating a disease which spreads quickly. I listened with great care to Senator Coonan, who is a man of great intellect and common sense, but I must disagree with some aspects of his contribution.</P>
      <P>We enjoy the privilege of regionalisation in this country. When a few parishes in the Cooley peninsula were prohibited from trading, we had great appreciation of this throughout the country and for our farmers generally. If we did not have regionalisation, the whole economy would have closed down because tourism and agriculture would have been wiped out. We must have sympathy for the country and people who bear the brunt of the dreaded foot and mouth disease. There are issues relating to that country and beef production&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Callanan, without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan"><NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the support of the Acting Chairman. I will need it because the interruptions are coming very soon, which I did not expect. Approximately 75% of the region in Brazil which produces beef is now prohibited from exporting to Europe. While I will not labour that point, I want to deal with controls in Brazil published by the food and veterinary office. I cannot be sure, for example, that the inspection and monitoring which takes place is as tight as it ought to be. I am not satisfied because of the dis<Col N="763"/>tance involved and the monitoring that takes place. We must depend largely on the word of the people in the region. I can go back to the mid-1970s and the kosher contract, for example, a Jewish contract, which involved a plant in Midleton. They came over with their own veterinary surgeons and did their own killing. The same applies today to any meat we export to countries outside of the EU, including Egypt and Russia. There is close monitoring of the process. I am sure Europe does not conduct this close monitoring, hence my concern. There is a difficulty about openness and transparency.</P>
      <P>Given our beef industry, and recognising the importance of it not just to the agricultural sector, but to the whole economy, including workers and so on, we must examine the way in which Senator Coonan and others who have been talking down agriculture, which is wrong. Agriculture will prosper in this country, but making negative comments could hinder people from going into the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan"><NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week, when the Taoiseach came into the Chamber, we all welcomed him. During his contribution on European matters, he dealt extensively with globalisation, CAP, the protection of farming interests, both here and in Europe, which we should welcome. He stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">Over the past weeks I have set out a clear and cogent argument in defence of the CAP. Simplistic and negative statements about the CAP, many of which are driven by self-interest, are continually being made.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This is happening out there, and I cannot understand why there is this pessimism and an attempt to talk down agriculture and agricultural pro<Col N="764"/>duction in this country, because it is a great way forward.</P>
      <P>We still have time to streamline the beef industry. We should get the industry, including producers, processors, consumers and the Department together to develop the beef industry. We did not have a beef industry with a production base in this country, we had a cattle production base. Four legs, a tail and a head does not give one a beef animal. There must be proper breeding and management and, the sooner this happens, the sooner we will be able to ensure that we can contain our markets.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The role of Commissioner Mandelson and the plans he has outlined at the world trade talks are even more scaryr. He is a twice failed British politician who may be out to rebuild his reputation by adopting the old British motto, &ldquo;Cheap food at any cost&rdquo;, and the exportation of commercial goods such as cars made by BMW and Mercedes-Benz. Trade with Europe is important but the EU is also involved in the production and export of munitions, the outcome of which can be witnessed on our televisions screens on many nights. It is sad to witness the misery of people killing each other and children dying. As a food producer, it is heart-rending to see the plight of children and adults who are starving but the EU continues to export munitions for the killings and to sustain policies that restrict food production, the lifeblood of our existence. People in developing countries are given weapons but not food. However, we are capable of producing the necessary food.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach&rsquo;s statement last week was extraordinary. He stated: &ldquo;The EU is by far the largest importer of agricultural products from developing countries and absorbs approximately 85% of<?oasys _jy?>Africa&rsquo;s agricultural exports and 45% of those from Latin America.&rdquo; Is it right that African countries should export food given the horror of starvation experienced by their peoples? Should we not be helping them to do the opposite to overcome famines, which run rife in their lands?</P>
      <P>However, the recent proposal by Peter Mandelson will undermine absolutely and totally food production in Europe and the Minister for Agriculture and Food objected to it at the Agriculture Council. It is time for Mr. Mandelson to throw in the towel and withdraw from the scene. He should be replaced by somebody who will represent Europe seriously and who will reflect what world affairs are about and what is good for globalisation and all the peoples of the world, not the few cartels to which Senator Coonan referred. Let us have equality for all people and help the poor to improve their lot. We should not be farmed down to their level; they should be brought up to our level. They should be helped to achieve proper standards by which they can live.</P>

	<P>I outlined what can be done to streamline and develop the beef industry. We ought to do that, otherwise we will not have a marketplace or a market share. We can talk as much as we like but we have approximately ten years to streamline the industry. I appeal for that to be done.</P>
      <P>An all-Ireland approach to control of diseases on the island is needed. The Administrations, North and South, were proactive in working together to control the outbreak of foot and mouth disease a few years ago. A similar challenge, about which we do not know much, could be on the way. We must be conscious of how FMD made it onto the island in recent years. I urge the Minister of State to strengthen this all-Ireland approach. We are an island off the coast of another island and we take action together that cannot be taken separately.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The same approach should apply to the outbreak of avian flu. I am aware of what the Departments of Agriculture and Food and Health and Children and the EU are doing in this regard but I did not have an understanding of the medical implications of the disease. We do not know how bad the outbreak could be but I am glad the Department of Agriculture and Food has put in place an early warning system in co-operation with the national parks and wildlife service, the National Association of Regional Game Councils and Birdwatch Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I also welcome the Acting Chairman, whom I have not seen in the Chair previously. I asked for the debate last week because I had read an article about the avian flu and I was jolted by the statistics reported in it. I visited Thailand in February 2004 to speak at a food business conference. The issue of avian flu was high on the agenda but we were talking about its effect on business and not about a pandemic. If the virus mutates from birds to humans, its effect could be huge, but it has mutated ineffectively in a number of cases thus far. The Minister of State said the Department &ldquo;has introduced a series of measures which it considers appropriate to the <Col N="766"/>current level of risk and will not hesitate to introduce any such further measures as considered proportionate&rdquo;. I am concerned that perhaps I am crying wolf and shouting too loud, but the Minister of State should be careful that the Department is not underplaying the potentially significant effect of this virus on humans as opposed to birds.</P>
      <P>The article I read stated:</P>
      <P LI="1" Just="Left">How many could lose their lives if this happens? The World Health Organisation estimates that in a best case scenario between 2 million and 7.4 million people could die worldwide but the death toll could be considerably higher if the next pandemic virus turns out to be more virulent. In the great &lsquo;flu pandemic at the end of World War 1, up to 100 million people lost their lives and there is unnerving evidence that H5N1 has the potential to be just as deadly. Two landmark studies published last week by US scientists show that unlike most other new &lsquo;flus, the 1918 virus jumped directly from birds to humans just as H5N1 has. Should the avian virus develop the ability to spread easily among people, a worldwide influenza pandemic could ensue potentially rivalling the impact of the 1918 epidemic.</P>
      <P FLI="0" Just="Left">Having read this, I then looked up a number of studies to learn more about the current outbreak. On 4 May 2005 a ranger on the Qinghai nature reserve in China, noticed geese staggering, something he had not seen previously. He took an immediate interest in this. It was brought to the attention of Guan Yi of the University of Hong Kong, who has also taken an interest in this. He identified H5N1 and published an article on 5 July on the danger of what was happening. At this point, birds previously thought to be immune were succumbing to this influenza virus.</P>
      <P>When the World Health Organisation identified and drew attention to this problem it had difficulty in getting information from China. It stated that Beijing is traditionally reluctant to share information. Hong Kong sought information as it wanted to trace the virus to know more about the vaccines required. China was very reluctant to divulge information and even local officials treat epidemic data as state secrets unless Beijing orders it to do otherwise. In using this vocabulary, I fear I am scaremongering but one must consider the transfer of the virus from birds to humans and the effect that could have. We do not have the required vaccine.</P>
      <P>This week is the anniversary of the arrival of the Brent geese from Canada. It is a fascinating time. They usually arrive on 23 October and leave on 23 April but sometimes arrive a few days earlier. These birds are coming from north to south so the danger of them carrying this virus is less than that presented by birds travelling from south <Col N="767"/>to north. That this disease is in Romania and Cyprus poses a danger to us.</P>
      <P>Last Monday was the anniversary of the first detection of potato blight in Ireland in 1845. We can identify with the danger posed by avian influenza. Around the world we have not recognised the importance and the major pandemic influence of this influenza. I am pleased the Minister of State has come to the House today. I am also pleased by what he has said and the action he appears to be taking. I worry that I am acting as a scaremonger in this case but when one considers the potential impact of this, in the context of the Famine, we have a major responsibility.</P>
      <P>Last week the World Health Organisation criticised the steps taken, stating that global responsibility was not being met and the matter was not being prioritised. The Minister of State&rsquo;s participation in this debate on avian influenza, and the report on it, is placing the virus on the agenda but a considerable amount remains to be done to ensure we do not take things easy. There is a danger that ostrich-like we might bury our heads in the sand and hope avian influenza goes away. The Minister of State&rsquo;s words reassure me but unless we draw attention to the issue others may adopt the position of the ostrich.</P>
      <P>Senator Callanan referred to assisting Africa and I fundamentally disagree with his thinking. He stated that African people were hungry and should use the food they produce rather than exporting it, as well as receiving aid from first world countries. I disagree and refer to the old adage used by Oxfam, &ldquo;Give a man a fish and you will feed him for a day, teach a man to fish and you feed him for life&rdquo;. This will be difficult for the agriculture community in Europe but we must open our doors to the developing world. If we send aid to the developing world we are giving it a fish rather than teaching it to fish.</P>
      <P>As Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Browne will recognise this as something for which we in Europe must take responsibility. I recognise that this will be bad news for the agricultural community in Europe as developing Africa and Asia means opening European barriers. Europe must not become a fortress, otherwise we are open to the same criticism we made of the British in the 1840s, namely, that they did nothing to assist us at the time. The assistance we can provide to the developing world is to remove barriers, thus enabling it to compete in the market place, particularly in respect of food. This also refers to Central America and unless we battle against the mentality in favour of a fortress Europe, we will have the responsibility for this in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate Senator Feeney on her role as Acting Chairman. I welcome the Minister of State to the House and support the <Col N="768"/>measures taken by the EU Commission and member states to address the threat posed by avian influenza. I agree with the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, who underlined the importance Ireland attaches to effectively addressing avian influenza from the public health and veterinary standpoints. The EU is correct to prioritise this issue but while continuing a vigilant approach we must ensure steps taken are appropriate to the level of risk.</P>
      <P>Avian influenza is a disease of birds and while people can become infected, they rarely do. There is no evidence the virus can be transmitted from poultry to humans other than direct contact with infected birds. Resources must be focused on early detection and speedy eradication to minimise any risk to public health. The measures put in place are designed to ensure any suspect outbreaks are investigated quickly and evidence of the virus confirmed or denied. I am pleased the Department has ensured appropriate technical and veterinary staff are properly equipped to deal with confirmed or suspected outbreaks. We have examined all aspects of destruction of infected flocks and subsequent disposal of carcasses.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, on the steps taken to ban the importation of beef from those areas of Brazil where cases of foot and mouth disease have recently been confirmed. That action was necessary to ensure that the national herd and the livelihood of farmers involved in livestock farming were not exposed to the risk presented by imports from affected areas of Brazil for as long as the foot and mouth disease problem exists. This country has experienced foot and mouth disease and we do not want to experience it again, nor do we want to experience the effects of avian influenza. I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, the Ministers of State, Deputies John Browne and Brendan Smith, and the Department on the measures they have taken to date to ensure this country is free of both foot and mouth disease and avian influenza.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Senator Ryan who has 15 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I rarely say that I will not use the full time available to me. Even when I do so, I rarely keep my promise but on this occasion I may not need the full 15 minutes.</P>
      <P>One wonders on occasion if anybody is listening. In his contribution the Minister of State dealt well with the incidence of the H5N1 virus as far as it represented a threat to the health of the bird population and, presumably, commercially. At the end of that part of his contribution, however, he said that the responsibility for preparing for and dealing with any human pandemic that might follow an eventuality rests with the Department <Col N="769"/>of Health and Children and its agencies. Technically, that might be correct but the responsibility lies with the Government.</P>
      <P>What many of us in this House wanted to hear was not just the recitation of the altogether correct and justifiable precautions to deal with minimising the risk of the introduction of avian influenza into Ireland, and we would all support the Government in that. It is not the risk of the introduction of avian influenza that is worrying a large section of the public. It is the frightening headlines quoting people who may or may not be experts. We are entitled to expect an assurance or a reassurance from our Government of the validity of some of the forecasts and the competence of the people making them.</P>
      <P>Is it true, as some people say, that a possible mutation of this virus could produce a form of influenza that would spread from human to human, which the current virus has not been demonstrated to do? I am not an expert on epidemiology; it is an achievement to be able to pronounce the word but this appears to be the case. I had hoped to hear from the Minister of State, that in the nature of the way viruses develop and mutate it is far more likely than not that at some stage in the immediate future this current virus will mutate into a virus that will be virulent and capable of being transmitted from human to human.</P>
      <P>I have learned to have a certain scepticism of experts. Like much of the population, I spent a large part of 1999 being inundated by expert opinions telling me that the world would grind to a halt at midnight in 2000. It turned out to be a wonderful scam by some people in the computer industry to persuade the entire world to renew their computer systems. It made an enormous amount of money for the computer industry, unnecessarily, it now emerges.</P>
      <P>What the public needs to know about avian influenza are the real risks. People are extraordinarily able to deal with real threats. Anybody who has observed a community during war, for instance, will talk about the way ordinary people learn to live with a problem once they have come to realise there is one and their capacity to act in a patriotic fashion.</P>
      <P>An extraordinary aspect of the outbreak of foot and mouth disease here was the level of patriotism shown by members of the public. My colleague in the Labour Party, Deputy Joe Costello, often talks about a group of old age pensioners in his constituency who traditionally spent a week in the country. It was the highlight of their social life every year. The year of the foot and mouth disease outbreak, however, they decided it would not be right to travel because of the slight risk that they would contribute to spreading the disease. That happened on that scale throughout the country without any external sanction.</P>
<Col N="770"/>
      <P>What is disappointing about the way this issue is being approached in this House at least is that while what the Minister described is reasonable and commendable, he did not address &mdash; I am not aware if anybody has &mdash; whether it is possible, probable, likely or certain that this virus will mutate into something that will be more virulent in terms of the way it impacts on humans and will be transmissible among humans in the way common influenza viruses are transmissible. If that is the more likely outcome, and from my causal reading that appears to be the case, what are we doing about that likely outcome in terms of vaccine distribution?</P>
      <P Just="Left">I read in a British newspaper that a strain of influenza has now evolved which is resistant to the vaccine people are relying on. This is layman&rsquo;s stuff. I am scientifically numerate but I am not an epidemiologist or a microbiologist, nor am I a doctor. I have to rely on a reasonable degree of scientific literacy but if the members of the public are to handle this in the way they can handle crises, the one way to create real panic in a country is to give people the impression that they are not being given all the information. It is vital that the best information available to Government is made available to the public now, not in six months time when it is discovered that the Government was aware of certain possibilities but were not disclosed for reasons to do with wanting to avoid panic.</P>
      <P>It is not good enough for the Minister &mdash; I do not blame him because it is a Government response &mdash; to say that the question of preparing for and dealing with any human pandemic that might follow any such possible mutation or genetic change rests with the Department of Health and Children. I do not dispute that but the Department of Health and Children should have given the Minister of State something to say about that. Expecting coherence from the Department of Health and Children is probably being excessively optimistic. That is not the way that Department does its business, regardless of the Minister or senior civil servant in charge. We need coherence but do not have it, which is disappointing.</P>
      <P>What is the evaluation of the Government and Department of Health and Children of the likelihood of this disease spreading? What is their evaluation of what can be done, either to prevent it or in response? It must be said truthfully that in comparison with that risk, the unfortunate possible consequences for our bird population, commercial or wild, are trivial. In saying that I do not minimise the importance of wildlife, ecologically or in any other context.</P>
      <P>With regard to foot and mouth disease, I am no great enthusiast for the Common Agricultural Policy. Its aspiration is to provide a stable food supply, but we have ended up with gluts and enormous waste. It is supposed to stabilise the <Col N="771"/>living standards of people working in farming, but it is still failing to do that. It did not sustain large numbers of people in rural Ireland. I am very interested in this, since one can never get precise numbers. How many full-time farmers are there in the country in comparison with ten years ago? I speak not of those who have some income from farming, even if it is substantial. What is the number of full-time farmers with no other income from agri-tourism or any of a host of other things, such as a part-time teaching job? How many people make a decent living out of agriculture alone? On that index, the CAP has been of dubious benefit in doing what it is supposed to do. The resources could be used in a variety of other ways to achieve the same objectives without subjecting Irish consumers to excessively high food prices. However, that is only a marginal observation.</P>
      <P>The outbreak of foot and mouth disease in a country thousands of miles away and the question of the EU&rsquo;s capacity to respond is a wonderfully apposite example of globalisation, both good and bad. The idea of global free trade was to generate economic growth in countries that had been impoverished and that remained so. There is no doubt that in some ways it has worked like that. However, whether the sort of slash-and-burn agriculture widespread in Brazil is what we want to encourage in the name of global free trade is a serious question.</P>
      <P>I have previously raised the issue of the sugar industry and asked whether the sacrifice that would have to be made in this country in opening up our sugar markets would be made simply to make ostentatious Brazilian millionaires even richer or whether it should be linked to some attempt to ensure not only fairness in world trade but fairness in the countries participating in it. There is a long-standing argument regarding a global minimum wage and minimum labour standards, and the same is true of agriculture. There should be minimum standards in all countries from which agricultural products are exported.</P>
      <P>I am very sceptical regarding our capacity to monitor matters. I have read the Minister of State&rsquo;s script, in which he states that the EU Food and Veterinary Office can do it. I have not been impressed by the EU&rsquo;s efficiency. It is perhaps the only supranational organisation that has found itself unable to spend its own overseas development aid budget. For several years, the ODA part of the EU&rsquo;s expenditure was unused because officials could not figure out an efficient way to use their own budget. There were reports in successive years of waste and inefficiency.</P>
      <P>What has happened in Brazil is not a huge scare story. However, I note from the Minister of State&rsquo;s script that all non-EU beef is supposed to be labelled as such. There seems to be a considerable amount of <i>prima facie</i> evidence assembled <Col N="772"/>by the IFA and other farming organisations that many retail and hospitality outlets are advertising what is termed &ldquo;Irish beef&rdquo; and telling people lies, since they are using imported stocks. That is fraud and a breach of EU law. I would like to hear just how vigilantly and through what mechanism our authorities and those of the EU are ensuring that the law is adhered to. If we cannot tell people that we guarantee that we are enforcing the law at home, how can we reassure them that we are doing so thousands of miles away in Brazil? How can we ensure that neither additives nor diseased meat are imported into this country if we cannot convince people that what they are buying is genuinely Irish?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonScanlon"><NameTxt>Mr. Scanlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I am glad of the opportunity to address this important issue. With regard to avian influenza, the Minister of State has stated that 150 million chickens and turkeys have been destroyed. If it came into this country it would have a devastating impact. We must be exceptionally vigilant. The Minister is very much aware and has set up an early warning system supported by the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in the North, as well as the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the regional game councils, and Birdwatch Ireland. It is very important that we remain this vigilant in case a problem arises. If that happens, we must be aware of it from an early stage. If the virus entered the country it would devastate the poultry industry for a generation to come. The industry employs 6,000 people and it is important that we stay aware.</P>
      <P Just="Left">With regard to foot and mouth disease, I concur with some of Senator Coonan&rsquo;s remarks. There are 200 million animals in Brazil, yet only 16.5 million of those are traceable. There are three regions in Brazil where foot and mouth disease has been diagnosed. The EU has stated that no beef from any of those regions should be imported into the Union. S&atilde;o Paulo is one of the regions that affects the Brazilian economy most, since approximately 75% of the meat processed in the country is slaughtered in that area, which is also among the restricted regions. However, when one does not have traceability, what is to stop animals from any Brazilian region from being taken there, slaughtered and exported? We must be very vigilant in that regard.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Ireland supports regionalisation; when there was an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the Cooley peninsula it was important that we did not take the entire country as a single region. Had that happened, all our exports would have had to cease. That would have had serious consequences, including for the tourism industry. Regionalisation is fine when there is traceability but that is not the case in Brazil.</P>
<Col N="773"/>
      <P>The IFA is not against the importation of Brazilian beef but is opposed to the sale of such beef, within the State, as Irish beef. This is a serious problem that must be addressed. I am aware the Minister intends to introduce compulsory labelling for beef early in the new year. It is important that anybody caught trying to sell Brazilian beef or other product should face severe penalties. We have the highest quality of beef, lamb and poultry products. However, we must compete against other countries in which producers may employ slave labour. Irish farmers are compliant in every way, whether in respect of hygiene or other regulations. It is unfair that they must compete in a marketplace where others do not adhere to the same standards.</P>
      <P>The EU regulation on substantial transformation sets out the conditions under which Irish companies can label imported products as of Irish origin. However, it seems merely putting breadcrumbs on chicken fillets can make a product Irish. Severe penalties should pertain where this regulation is abused, as seems frequently to be the case.</P>
      <P>The number of small abattoirs has declined significantly in the last 20 years. The 18 originally in operation in my own county have been reduced to only two, struggling to survive because of over-regulation. Many such operators, supplying the domestic market, were refused grants to upgrade their premises, while multinational companies were given grants in the region of 60% to build new plants which would produce beef for export. The small abattoirs who supply to the home market must compete against these major, heavily subsidised plants.</P>
      <P>This is not a level playing field. Support should be given to small abattoirs, which have been badly treated by the State in recent years. Many such operators have suffered hardship. I am aware of a person in Monaghan who spent &euro;430,000 on a plant to slaughter pigs, cattle and sheep but had difficulty securing a licence for it. This was a modern plant built with full planning permission, the purpose of which was to supply the domestic market.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister of State well. The Minister, Deputy Coughlan, will do everything to ensure we protect the beef and poultry industries for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for his speech. It is always important, particularly when many scares as well as justified fears abound, that the full facts be set out carefully to allow people judge the current and potential difficulties with a proper sense of proportion. I have great confidence in the Department of Agriculture and Food which has dealt successfully with similar threats in the past. I will always remember the chaos across the water during the last outbreak of foot and mouth dis<Col N="774"/>ease compared with the way it was kept under tight control here.</P>
      <P>There is both a human and animal dimension to this latest issue. Our poultry industry is important and we should avoid a situation, if possible, where large numbers of flocks must be destroyed. Pan-European co-operation is essential to keep the situation under tight control. We must take the appropriate emergency measures if any problem emerges in our immediate vicinity.</P>
      <P>In terms of the implications for humans, we have been treated to many headlines about pandemics and references to the millions who died in the flu outbreak of 1918. The Minister of State noted in his speech that the number of deaths to date in the highly populous south-east Asia regions is 60. However, a headline proclaiming that millions may die is more interesting that one avowing that there is no cause for alarm. The price of freedom, including the freedom from disease, is eternal vigilance. Both the Government and the EU are to be commended on the measures they are taking. It is far better to nip this problem in the bud rather than wait until it expands to critical proportions.</P>
      <P>The correct action has been taking in preventing beef exports from the affected regions in Brazil. It is a vast country. Earlier speakers alluded to the serious difficulty of policing health regulations. The report of the beef tribunal showed we have some difficulty in doing so. How much more difficult it is when one is dealing with a country thousands of miles away. It is important that people know the origin of what they eat.</P>
      <P>We have been treated once more to Senator Quinn&rsquo;s hostility to the Common Agricultural Policy, the CAP. It should be noted that the countries pressing most strongly for reform are not poor countries in Africa but competitor countries, including Brazil, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. None of these, with the exception to some degree of Brazil, is part of the developing world. The example of the sugar industry is indicative. When stringent cuts were proposed, the first up in arms against the proposals were the African, Caribbean and Pacific, ACP, countries. We are subjected to much propaganda, principally from our nearest neighbour, which has always hated the CAP, and some of the agencies based there, among which I must number Oxfam. We are made to feel guilty for looking after our interests while they use the Third World to look after their own. I take those arguments with a pinch of salt.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister for Agriculture and Food is alert to ongoing developments in the negotiations. From my experience of negotiations on Northern Ireland, I have some familiarity with the negotiating style of the Commissioner for Trade, Mr. Peter Mandelson, whose former close colleague, Mr. Tony Blair, has called for the radical reform or dismantling of the Common Agri<Col N="775"/>cultural Policy. Mr. Mandelson largely gutted the Patten report recommendations on police reform, even while maintaining that legislation would conform to them. When he claims that he is negotiating within the mandate given by the Council of Ministers, people should verify that this is so.</P>
      <P>His arts of spin and media manipulation were partly or mainly responsible for the ascent of the British Labour Party. I remember an unfortunate incident in which a leaked report appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> purporting to present a scurrilous version by the British Embassy of the remarks from the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen. Vigilance on the media front is required. While I do not want my comments to be regarded as a judgment on the conduct of the negotiations, we have important interests to protect and need to be vigilant and to recognise that the Commissioner is one of the grand masters of the political arts.</P>
      <P>Some of the other matters under discussion also fall partly within the area of WTO negotiations, the outcome of which will be important. We cannot adopt an entirely one-sided approach but must protect a range of interests. It is a question of finding the right balance, which will not be done by sacrificing agricultural interests. I challenge the notion that by making such sacrifices we would do service to the Third World rather than to our main developed country competitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, for coming to the House today to discuss the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Brazil and the discovery of avian influenza in Romania and Turkey. The former Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Joe Walsh, displayed exemplary leadership when he protected our country from the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the UK. His actions provide a model for university students on the essential nature of leadership. He was able to get the support of the people of Ireland.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, and the Minister of State on their prompt action in banning the importation of beef from the Brazilian regions of S&atilde;o Paulo, Mato Grosso do Sol and Parana, all of which have experienced foot and mouth disease. This ban is necessary and completely justified for human and animal health reasons. No chances should be taken. The outbreak of the disease in Brazil is significant. Not only is Brazil the largest exporter of beef but the outbreak of foot and mouth disease has occurred in one of the main regions from which exports to the EU are approved, accounting for two thirds of last year&rsquo;s import volumes from Brazil. The EU has also banned imports from the three Brazilian regions and I commend the Minister and her European counterparts for the manner in <Col N="776"/>which they have worked in unison to protect the health of European citizens and animals.</P>
      <P>The president of the Irish Farmers Association, Mr. John Dillon, has called for a total ban on the import of Brazilian beef and he raised practical concerns about the risks associated with Brazilian beef in terms of unknown origin and lack of traceability. During my tenure as a board member of Bord Bia, the traceability of ready made meals was the subject of regular discussions.</P>
      <P>The Brazilian authorities are examining the possibility that its current outbreak of foot and mouth disease originated in Paraguay. Russia has implemented a temporary ban on Paraguayan beef imports. It is interesting to note that the United States, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and South Korea have imposed a complete ban on beef imports from Brazil.</P>
      <P>With regard to avian influenza, people feel a sense of danger, given that it is a highly contagious viral infection and can affect all species of birds, which by their nature do not respect national borders. Since 2003, this particularly virulent strain has caused more than 125 million birds to die or be destroyed in south east Asia. Eradication is proving extremely difficult. Outbreaks have also occurred in 2004 in the USA, Canada and South Africa and in this year in Russia and Kazakhstan. Recent cases have been confirmed in Romania, Turkey, Russia, China and, within EU borders, in Greece. Since 1999, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany have all experienced incidents of the disease.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The avian influenza does not affect humans and is only spread through contact with infected birds. However, during the recent outbreak in Asia, 60 people died from such contacts. Scientists are concerned that the virus may mutate and spread to other animals and humans. This is a situation that we must do everything possible to avoid. The EU has worked promptly to ban the import of live birds, fresh poultry meat and untreated feathers from several countries in south east Asia and I commend the Minister and the Minister of State on their commitment to implement such measures as are appropriate to an Irish context. Similarly, the introduction of the early warning system is a reassurance. No risk should be taken with human or animal health.</P>
      <P>As someone who has been involved in the food industry, I have empathy for suppliers and shop owners who have stocks of poultry and fish on their shelves. They must be terrified that something will go wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. J. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senators for their contributions and recognise their concern and the seriousness with which they are treating the risk of an outbreak of avian influenza. We are all conscious of the impact such an <Col N="777"/>outbreak would have, particularly on our poultry industry. As the Acting Chairman and other Senators are aware, the poultry industry here employs 6,000 people and there are 2,000 flock owners. The value of the industry is estimated at &euro;360 million, of which a little over half is exported. It is important that we would keep our minds focused on that. The Department of Agriculture and Food is continually focused on the importance of the poultry industry here and those involved in it expect the Department to seriously examine and deal effectively with any issues that might arise that would affect it.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Coonan for his support for what we are doing and for some of the issues he raised. I appreciate the support from the Senators opposite for the Government and the Department of Agriculture and Food, in particular, in dealing with some of the issues that have arisen. It is incumbent on all of us to work together to minimise the risk of an introduction of the disease and, in the event of an outbreak, to ensure its early detection and speedy eradication.</P>
      <P>Many Senators spoke about how we dealt with the outbreak of foot and mouth disease. That is an example of when co-operation and partnership were engaged in by those on all sides of the political divide and by communities. Senator Ryan and other Senators referred to a great level of local patriotism, support and partnership at that time to ensure we dealt effectively with the outbreak of foot and mouth disease; extraordinary efforts were made. I compliment all Senators on the support they have shown for what we are trying to achieve.</P>
      <P>Senator Coonan raised the matter of imports and the total banning of Brazilian beef. I point out that we are bound by the European rules governing imports. The rules for imports into the EU are set down at EU level. Controls are monitored by the EU Food and Veterinary Office to ensure an equivalence of measures and controls apply. Following the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Brazil, we must operate in line with policy applying to trade matters. We benefited from regionalisation when there was an outbreak of foot and mouth disease here in 2001 and when a ban on exports applied only to the areas affected. We cannot unilaterally ban imports. We are part of the EU and must be governed by its rules. The Minister has taken a strong line in dealing with the regions in Brazil affected. Nonetheless, I note the concerns expressed by Senator Coonan and other Senators and will report them to the Minister. Brazilian beef imports into Ireland in 2004 amounted to 6,588 tonnes and such imports into the EU amounted to 170,000 tonnes. Irish beef exports amounted to 500,000 tonnes. There is no legal basis for imposing an Irish ban on such imports. We must operate within the ambit of EU rules.</P>
<Col N="778"/>
      <P>Senators referred to adopting an all-Ireland approach to disease eradication in dealing with issues such as this one. I am pleased to inform the House that my Department is working closely with the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland and officials from two Departments have met on a number of occasions in the past month to consider the respective approaches of each to the risk of disease introduction and have undertaken to exchange results of respective wild bird surveillance programmes. Such co-operation between the North and South will continue. The Minister is anxious that such co-operation continues and that we would have an all-Ireland approach to dealing with this serious situation.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Reference was made to food labelling, which has been a cause of major concern to farm organisations and those on all sides of the political divide. When the Minister took up office in the Department of Agriculture and Food, food labelling was one of the first issues she decided to address. Concern has been expressed that products, particularly meat products, imported from another country can be re-labelled as Irish products simply as a result of the scattering of a few crumbs of bread on top of such products. This practice is of major concern to the Department and to the farm organisations. The Minister, in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children, has managed to introduce a Bill that will deal with that issue. We expect the new regulation to be in place by the end of the year and it should deal effectively with the concerns raised by a number of Senators.</P>
      <P>The Minister recently negotiated with restaurant owners, vintners and other organisations involved in the food area a voluntary code of conduct in terms of advising consumers of the origin and type of meat served in restaurants and pubs. Many of these establishments have signed up to this code. We will see a move in that direction in the future, but we need to enact legislation in this area. The Minister will introduce such legislation by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>On the issue of Brazilian beef imports, Brazilian veterinary documentation must state clearly the region from which the beef comes and the meat factory where the animals were slaughtered. Therefore, there are strict regulations in place but I appreciate the concern expressed.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan referred to Government policy in this area. Anyone who has been following this story would realise that for the past number of weeks the Departments of Agriculture and Food and Health and Children have been very involved in dealing with the threat posed by an outbreak of avian influenza. The Government has had meetings and discussions on it and it has been on the Cabinet agenda on a regular basis. The Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy <Col N="779"/>Dermot Ahern, attended a meeting in Luxembourg this week at which the issue was debated and a number of initiatives were taken. While we read reports to the effect that 50,000 or 100,000 people could die from an outbreak of this disease in Ireland &mdash; to a certain extent, some people would say that is scaremongering &mdash; it is important that the Government, particularly the Departments of Agriculture and Food and Health and Children, continues to monitor and seriously deal with what is presented to it and takes cognisance of the importance of safeguarding both human and animal health. That is what is happening. Dialogue is taking place between those two Departments and it will continue until such time as closure is brought to this threat. No one knows when that might happen. There is much discussion and scaremongering, but we can only deal with what is before us and the two Ministers are effectively doing that.</P>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their support. It is good to have a debate on an issue such as this one. This discussion allows Senators to put forward the views and concerns of members of the public on this issue. It is important also that our Department, the Department of Health and Children and the Government continues to monitor the situation and deal with the issues in a calm and reflective way. I thank the officials present. They have probably borne the brunt of work emanating from the meetings and discussions in recent weeks. It proves once again that when it comes to dealing with issues such as this one Department of Agriculture and Food officials are very much on top of their brief, aware of the significance of the threat posed by avian influenza and dealing with it accordingly. I thank all Senators for their contributions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>At the outset, I would like to take this opportunity to offer my sincere sympathies and those of the T&aacute;naiste to the family of the late Mr. Patrick Walsh, who died tragically at Monaghan General Hospital on Friday, 14 October 2005. Like everyone in this House, I was shocked and saddened to learn of Mr. Walsh&rsquo;s death. No words from anyone in either House will be of any great comfort to the Walsh family as they mourn their relative but the onus is on us to have a full inquiry into his death. There will be no cover up, the facts will disclosed <Col N="780"/>and we will ensure there is no repetition of what happened to Mr. Walsh.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that the Health Service Executive has commissioned Mr. Declan Carey, a consultant surgeon at Belfast City Hospital and an honorary senior lecturer at Queen&rsquo;s University Belfast, to carry out an independent and external review of these circumstances. The review will be completed and a report issued within a timeframe of eight weeks. I hope the review succeeds in answering all the questions which have arisen following Mr. Walsh&rsquo;s untimely passing.</P>
      <P>There are clearly many questions to be answered regarding the care provided to Mr. Walsh. Everyone wants answers regarding this tragedy, the political system, the Health Service Executive and the general public. Most important, we need to seek answers on behalf of Mr. Walsh&rsquo;s family whose distress is uppermost in our minds at this time.</P>
      <P>It was particularly disturbing to learn, even in advance of the review, that beds were in fact available in the north-eastern region both at Cavan General Hospital and at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, to treat Mr. Walsh in the event that he required to be transferred from Monaghan General Hospital last Thursday night or Friday morning. It is now for Mr. Carey to establish all of the circumstances surrounding Mr. Walsh&rsquo;s death and in undertaking this task, I trust he will receive the full co-operation of everyone involved.</P>
      <P>There has been much debate in both Houses in recent years about the configuration of medical and surgical services in the north east. Members will have taken particular note of the views expressed yesterday by Professor Brendan Drumm regarding the provision of acute medical and surgical services in the north east, having regard to best international practice. The north-eastern region operates five acute hospitals serving a catchment population of some 350,000 people. The policy basis for the provision and development of acute hospital services in the north east has been developed in recent years on foot of various studies, including a health strategy for the people of the north east and proposed development of specialist services 2001-06. This policy networks the five hospital sites in the region into two hospital groups &mdash; Cavan-Monaghan and Louth-Meath, which covers Drogheda, Dundalk and Navan &mdash; with clearly defined roles for each group and hospital.</P>
      <P>The debate in recent days has centred on the provision of surgical services across the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group. The policy approach to the issue was set out in the 2004 report of a steering group established by the former North Eastern Health Board. This group was representative of all the key professional stakeholders and included consultant representation from both <Col N="781"/>hospital sites in the disciplines of surgery, medicine and radiology. Members of the group unanimously approved the recommendations of the steering group. The executive board of the former North Eastern Health Board accepted the steering group&rsquo;s recommendations in late 2004.</P>
      <P>The steering group recommended in its report that major and emergency surgery should be carried out in Cavan General Hospital and that Monaghan General Hospital should provide selective elective surgery. In making the recommendation, the group took account of expert advice received from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. In accordance with the recommendations of the steering group and the expert advice from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, a full surgical team based in Cavan will provide services at Monaghan General Hospital in the form of selective elective surgery on a Monday to Friday basis.</P>
      <P>The Health Service Executive has also recently appointed a non-practising lead consultant surgeon at the Cavan-Monaghan department of surgery whose remit is to oversee an implementation plan arising from the advice of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland on the future configuration of surgical services in Cavan and Monaghan. With regard to medical services and in accordance with the steering group&rsquo;s recommendations, Monaghan General Hospital returned to 24-hour, seven-day medical cover in January 2005. A third consultant physician has been in post since November 2004 and five new anaesthetic non-consultant hospital doctors have been recruited to facilitate the return of the hospital to medical on-call.</P>
      <P>Surgical services within the Louth-Meath hospital group were reorganised in 2004 to create a joint department of surgery across both the Drogheda and Dundalk hospital sites. Under these arrangements, all consultant surgeons provide services across both sites. A Drogheda-based consultant surgeon, with 24-hour, on-call non-consultant hospital doctor support, provides emergency on-call cover for the joint department. I understand that, as in Cavan-Monaghan, the service arrangements for the joint surgical department at Drogheda and Dundalk are supported by the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. The reorganisation of surgical services in both groups is designed, <i>inter alia</i>, to facilitate a more appropriate training system in that junior doctors will rotate between the hospitals during their employment, thus ensuring exposure to many different clinical experiences.</P>
      <P>The arrangements for the north-eastern region that are being put in place by the Health Service Executive were developed in order to enhance the overall level of medical and surgical services. However, no matter how much careful preparation is put into formulating arrangements such as I have described, we must also work collec<Col N="782"/>tively to ensure their delivery and avoid a repeat of the tragedy which occurred at Monaghan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I extend my sympathy and that of my party and colleagues in the House to the Walsh family following the tragedy which took place in Monaghan General Hospital last week. It is very important that this matter is debated in the House, which is why I sought a debate on the Order of Business yesterday. I am glad that the Minister for State is with us today and thank him for putting his remarks on the record of the House.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has not given us additional information but it is important that colleagues at least raise the issue, put questions and have the matter recorded. There is a very dangerous assumption abroad that, with the advent of the brave new world of the Health Service Executive, politicians cannot comment on issues such as these. This assumption must be knocked on the head. Politicians decide the broad parameters of policy through the Department of Health and Children. Politicians also fund the Department of Health and Children and the various State agencies responsible for delivering policy. It is absolutely right and appropriate that politicians debate issues such as this when tragedies occur and seek accountability from the Government as to the exact scale and nature of the operations of such a crucial health service. I make no apologies for ensuring such a debate takes place in this House.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I heard the comments made by Professor Drumm yesterday morning. I agree largely with him that we cannot have a health policy directed by the local considerations of one group of politicians over another group of politicians. Let us also be clear that in the past there have been gigantic political manoeuvrings within the medical world, irrespective of party politics, where medics have sought to look after their own geographical area against other areas and one hospital pitted against another. One has to look at the decisions that come from An Bord Altranais at times in terms of trying to ascertain the rationale for them. Ultimately, the only people who are accountable are those who are elected to this or the other House. Consequently, we should make no apologies in asserting the right and the primacy of the Oireachtas in terms of getting answers to these questions.</P>
      <P>From my discussions with people in the area and my colleagues in the other House, the people of the north eastern region are not looking for five acute hospitals that will deliver every surgical procedure that will look after every circumstance in the Irish medical health care system. What they are seeking is a guarantee that what happened to Mr. Walsh, and the tragic events that will always affect his family, will not happen again. That is the reason we have to put on the record a number <Col N="783"/>of basic questions that must be answered. While I fully accept the need for the inquiry, which will be of eight weeks duration, these questions can be readily answered because the information is to hand.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The issue is whether there is a directive in place which states that a person who presents with a life threatening medical problem in this hospital cannot be dealt with. The Taoiseach told the D&aacute;il yesterday that no such direction came from him, the T&aacute;naiste or anyone else. It is clear from Dr. Duffy&rsquo;s comments on national radio yesterday and the experience on the ground that there is a clear directive that life threatening cases cannot be dealt with in this hospital. That is bizarre. It is bizarre that the HSE or any other group would dictate such a policy. Will the Minister of State confirm a matter to which Dr. Duffy alluded yesterday, namely, if it is the case that in January 2005 in Monaghan General Hospital where an urgent case developed requiring immediate surgical intervention to protect a person who needed emergency surgery, the doctor who carried out the surgery was later chastised and criticised by hospital management for doing so? Dr. Duffy and others have referred to this but the Government has not commented. If that is the case it is astonishing that a senior surgeon would be openly criticised by hospital management for a medical intervention that saved a person&rsquo;s life. It gets worse.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Another issue on which I would like the Minister of State to comment is the two further cases since Mr. Walsh&rsquo;s untimely death last week where patients were shunted around the region at the last minute because they were told in Monaghan General Hospital that it could not deal with the circumstances of their case. Is that a fact or is it not?</P>
      <P>Why did it take four days for the Department of Health and Children to confirm that beds were available in Cavan and Drogheda hospitals? We know from this morning&rsquo;s newspapers that a bed was available in Beaumont Hospital. The manager in Beaumont Hospital stated categorically to the authorities in Monaghan General Hospital, as I understand it, that the acute bed was available and it was encouraged to come back and state whether this facility would be needed in respect of Mr. Walsh. Why did it take four days for that information to be revealed? That is an open and shut case that should have been brought to the attention of the Minister and the House much earlier.</P>
      <P>It is a disgrace that skilled surgeons and medics had to look on as a man lost his life last Friday and could not intervene because of some bureaucratic ruling which the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste say does not exist, but clearly does exist. That is an issue on which clarity is needed.</P>
      <P>We speak regularly of joined-up Government. If ever there was an example of how the medical <Col N="784"/>services are getting it wrong in their treatment of the north-eastern region &mdash; an issue my other colleagues are more adept at discussing in that they live there &mdash; a region of 350,000 people, it is surely this. Why are we getting it so wrong? The Government has known about this problem. Last year in the other House my colleagues tabled a detailed motion on the problems in the North Eastern Health Board region but no action was taken to knock heads together to get a solution and work on a protocol to which everyone could agree.</P>
      <P>If we are serious about delivering a world class service for everyone in the country, not just those who live in big cities, such as myself and others, there has got to be a strong political involvement that signs up to whatever arrangements are agreed. Clearly, the tragedy of Mr. Walsh and the ongoing problem in Monaghan General Hospital is an issue that has to be resolved sooner rather than later. I wish the investigator every success. The three issues I have raised can be confirmed if the Minister of State can reply to the debate by way of a short statement.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, to the House to discuss this sad event. I thank the Leader of the House, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State for arranging to have this debate, which was called for yesterday, at such short notice. I express my sincere sympathy to Mr. Walsh&rsquo;s family and his extended family. His family has suffered much grief since Mr. Walsh passed away. We know at this stage that this man&rsquo;s life could have been saved if the restrictions which did not allow the medical profession to perform the operation on him had not been in place at Monaghan General Hospital. That is bad enough for the family members in these tragic circumstances but the revelation that beds were available must add to the family&rsquo;s grief at this sad time.</P>
      <P>I welcome the announcement by the T&aacute;naiste that an inquiry will take place into the incident and I hope answers can be given to the Walsh family. I was instrumental in organising a meeting with the Taoiseach and the hospital alliance group last Friday night to hear their concerns. It was stressed to the Taoiseach that surgical procedures should be dealt with as people present to the hospital. I hope this can be agreed without delay.</P>
      <P>The problems with Monaghan General Hospital stem from it being taken off call for surgical cases. Had the hospital been on call for surgical cases, the personnel would have been available to treat Pat Joe Walsh when he presented. <Col N="785"/>Certainly his death would not have taken place when it did. Unfortunately the hospital has had ongoing problems for some considerable time. It is the view of the people of Monaghan that they should be entitled to acute surgical services when they need it. Unfortunately this is not the case at present.</P>
      <P>In addition to the death of Pat Joe Walsh, numerous other unfortunate incidents have occurred in the past two or three years. Nothing has been done and we need something to be done immediately. This cannot continue. Following the last death and the previous one we made the same case that Monaghan General Hospital should be on call for full medical and surgical services for the people of County Monaghan. They are entitled to nothing less. Where the necessary skills are not available an arrangement must be reached with the other hospitals in the region and, if necessary, outside the region to ensure no patient is denied a bed when needed. Now that the Health Service Executive is in place I hope it will ensure the necessary arrangements and services are put in place in Monaghan General Hospital to cater for the needs of the people of Monaghan.</P>
      <P>I again sympathise with the Walsh family. This was a tragic and untimely death in the circumstances. Unfortunately nothing we say in this House will bring back the life of Pat Joe Walsh. At this late stage I beg the Minister of State to ensure that the services that Monaghan General Hospital requires are provided for the people of Monaghan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Brien in complimenting the House and its political staff on getting this debate scheduled so quickly. It does a public service that this matter be so ventilated. It is very useful and I am glad we are having the debate. I wonder whether the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Harney, now regrets so courageously taking on the poisoned chalice of the Health and Children Ministry. It certainly was a courageous decision and confronting this task provides many headaches. She is right in saying that the whole system of health delivery needs to be reviewed.</P>
      <P>The specific tragic case of Mr. Walsh is an appalling event. One would first of all have to send one&rsquo;s sympathy to his relatives. First they had the incidence of his illness and then they had to stand impotently by while he was locked into a kind of lunatic bureaucracy. I understand Mr. Walsh was already known to suffer from a peptic ulcer, which creates certain indications. I would have thought he should have been put into intensive care immediately. This kind of bleeding is amenable to fairly simple treatment through endoscopy whereby a tube is inserted and the bleeding is cauterised, which is successful in 80% of cases. Without this procedure it is almost always fatal. It is not a major, sophisticated, com<Col N="786"/>plicated or difficult operation to undertake. It astonishes me that people stood idly by while this man apparently bled to death.</P>
      <P>We need to get all the facts &mdash; I understand a report is due and we must await judgment. It would be quite wrong to judge specific individuals or name anybody at this point. While I do not always agree with Senator Mansergh, he was very wise in what he said on the Order of Business when he brought to mind the simple parable of the good samaritan and asked whether in these kinds of conditions someone who found a man bleeding to death on the side of the road would, as they used to say about the American health service, first feel his wallet to see if it was still beating and then just look around and decide if there was an inhibition here to prevent him being helped for various reasons. Senator Brian Hayes asked a very pertinent question in wondering where this inhibition came from. It seems clear it did not come from a political source. It may have come from within the hospital. It is appalling and astonishing that a surgeon who intervened courageously to save life on a previous occasion was reprimanded and chastised. This is not a good indicator for the health service and these matters need to be clarified.</P>
      <P>We also need to consider the insurance situation. We need to ensure that not only are those medical staff, who courageously intervene, covered and given political protection by being supported when they take such action in the line of their work, but also that they are not subject of the threat of enormous financial loss. For example, a surgeon might intervene in the case of a person who was already beyond saving. Then, as happens frequently in other jurisdictions, the well-intentioned surgeon is slapped on the wrists and taken to court. A few years ago in America a woman collapsed beside a swimming pool with a ruptured appendix. A doctor operated with an ordinary domestic knife and saved her life. Her grateful response was to sue him and receive $750,000. We must protect medical personnel against this kind of risk.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>We should not use these matters to excoriate particular politicians, to hold them directly or personally responsible, or to score political points. We should have in mind the general welfare of the community. I welcome that the Taoiseach in the other House made it clear he would stand against these kinds of personal accusations by saying: &ldquo;I will not accept that there should be political accountability every time a person dies anywhere in our health service.&rdquo; He is right and we, as politicians, on all sides should support him in this matter.</P>
      <P>I remind the House that we are perishable goods. Death is inevitable. One hopes to accomplish it with the minimum of trauma or suffering. I am not referring to the situation of Mr. <Col N="787"/>Walsh which is a separate business. Sometimes the impression is given in this country that people believe they are entitled to live forever; that if they get a cold the local TD is responsible; if they have an operation the Minister is responsible; and, if they die the Government should fall. This is not realistic. Our health service is not as bad as we make out. There are difficulties in delivery, there is appalling bureaucracy, there are too many managers and the Hanly report should be implemented.</P>
      <P>On this I disagree completely with Senator Leyden who spoke from the Government side of the House and who attacked Professor Drumm. I say, thank God for Professor Drumm and his clarity, forthrightness, decency and honesty in addressing a situation. We should leave it to him and not attempt to interfere politically in the interests of our own little backyard. I am sickened by what I see on all sides of this House. Every party is involved. Every party wants to save its own hospitals but what they mean is they want to save their own seats. This is not about a hospital but is a popular voting issue that calls for people of courage. If the political leadership is not forthcoming from the political parties, then I urge Members not to attack people like Professor Drumm who know what they are talking about and have the experience. The Government should not waste its time appointing somebody with expertise if it will not listen to it. I agree it is a situation which needs discussion. Professor Drumm is perfectly correct in his view that one cannot have five hospitals with a huge range of expertise and duplication within a small area.</P>
      <P>I remember the situation 30 years ago when the Minister for Education was giving lessons about the proposed university merger involving Trinity College. The argument was that duplication was not desirable and in some ways that was valid; it is certainly valid in terms of the delivery of hospital services. However it must be ensured that people can be brought rapidly from one hospital to another and that beds are available. There should be a computerised system to show where beds are available. There should be correct ambulance transport and properly trained personnel to ensure people do not die in ambulances. I urge the Government Members not to go against Professor Drumm and his courageous involvement and intervention in this matter.</P>
      <P>There is clearly something wrong in the hospital system within this localised area. It is astonishing that this man was denied treatment in a hospital; it would be a different matter if he could not get to the hospital. Senator Brian Hayes referred to another situation where a person was denied admission to a local hospital. The staff of the referring hospital decided they could not bear the repetition of having to stand by and watch a patient bleed to death so they took it <Col N="788"/>upon themselves to telephone the senior administrator of Cavan General Hospital who was in bed in the early hours of the morning. He instructed the staff to admit this man. Why did that have to happen? What is the ethos and where is the notion of the hippocratic oath?</P>
      <P>I do not know if the oath was ever administered to doctors but it is something in the popular imagination, like the 1916 declaration about cherishing all the children of the nation equally. The public has the idea in its head that a medically qualified and trained doctor will do everything possible to keep people alive. It could be that this oath no longer exists but the ethos should. We should feel confident that if we are in distress or at death&rsquo;s door, at least a proper, civilised effort will be made to spare our lives.</P>
      <P>We are all perishable goods, our time is short and we might as well get used to it. The best we can hope for is reasonable treatment and an easy passage out of this world because that day will come. We must be realistic. Our demands on the health service are increasing every day to totally unrealistic dimensions, particularly in the view of people of my generation. I remember when people would die of an inward pain and nobody quite knew what it was. People accepted the realities of life.</P>
      <P>Realistic plans must be implemented. The Hanly report will improve the situation. If Professor Drumm states a modified form of the Hanly report is required then he should not be attacked politically but should be congratulated on telling people the truth. It may be difficult for politicians in their own constituencies to tell the truth but Professor Drumm should not be attacked for doing so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power and his officials to the House and thank them for attending at short notice. Along with Senator Brian Hayes and my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Brien, I raised this matter on the Order of Business yesterday and I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to hear the contributions today.</P>
      <P>I regret that time is limited but I am pleased to have time to comment on the ongoing difficulties in respect of Monaghan General Hospital. I offer my sincere sympathies to the family of the late Mr. Patrick Walsh. No words of mine or of anyone else will bring that poor man back to life.</P>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste has employed the services of an eminent consultant surgeon from Northern Ireland to investigate this sad saga. The Minister of State has clearly stated to the House that answers will be given and will be made public, that there will be no cover-up and no opportunity for anyone to pass the buck. I welcome these initiatives.</P>
      <P>As I stated on the Order of Business yesterday, none of us is a medical expert. I was not present <Col N="789"/>in the hospital when this sad event occurred nor was I speaking to anybody who was present. I regret the investigation by the eminent consultant will take eight weeks to conclude but I am willing to wait for eight weeks in the knowledge that action will be taken on foot of his conclusions.</P>
      <P>I want answers to questions such as the reason it was necessary to move the late Mr. Walsh from the hospital in Drogheda so soon after his hip operation. Why was his ailment not diagnosed and, when diagnosed, why was the fact that beds were available in Cavan General Hospital, in Drogheda and in Beaumont Hospital not known? Both the general public and I want answers to those questions.</P>
      <P>On a number of occasions in this House, Senator O&rsquo;Brien and I have raised the matter of the need to expand the surgical services at Monaghan General Hospital. The people serviced by Cavan General Hospital and Monaghan General Hospital deserve to have adequate and efficient facilities provided for them.</P>
      <P>Both hospitals have been under sustained pressure in the past number of years. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the staff in both hospitals who work under very difficult circumstances. I welcome the recent announcement by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith, of 25 additional beds to be provided in Cavan General Hospital. I welcome the announcement that an additional operating theatre and additional beds will be provided in Monaghan General Hospital along with the refurbishment of some wards.</P>
      <P>However, Senator O&rsquo;Brien and I and the people of Cavan and Monaghan want a clear statement on the future of Monaghan General Hospital. I do not expect the Minister of State to provide such a statement today at such short notice, but we will be seeking a general debate in the near future on hospital services in the north eastern region, particularly in Cavan and Monaghan.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Brien was instrumental in organising a meeting last Friday between the Monaghan Hospital Alliance and the Taoiseach. I understand from some representatives of the alliance that they were happy with the meeting. It is tragic that before the Taoiseach left Monaghan Mr. Patrick Joseph Walsh passed away.</P>
      <P>I am willing to wait eight weeks before I start passing judgment or making remarks. However, after the eight week period, I want answers. I express my sincere sympathy to the family of the late Mr. Walsh. None of us can bring him back but hopefully his death will not be in vain and we will be able to get this situation sorted out. I also want to thank my colleagues in the House for their balanced comments on this sad episode.</P>
    </Speaker>
<Col N="790"/>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I hate occasions such as this. These are not circumstances in which it is appropriate to beat the Government over the head. A man died and there is a need for a certain amount of restraint. I know that if anyone in Government could wave a magic wand, this type of incident would not happen. Therefore, if I use strong language, it is not because I believe people care less than I do about this situation. What troubles me every time something like this happens is the fact that there is no sign of a learning process taking place. There is no sign that we are advancing because we continue to have tragedies like this one in areas of public service provision.</P>
      <P>As an engineering student I did a small amount of management studies as part of my course. I was taught that the function of management is to plan, organise, staff and control. That is standard business studies teaching. It is extraordinary that we do not know what, precisely, were the rules under which Monaghan General Hospital was working. I do not want to point the finger. There has been a tendency in some quarters to point the finger at the people who were working in the hospital, but they are not the managers of the health service in the north eastern region. They are the people who work on the ground and it is not their responsibility to plan for the service. It is also not their responsibility to organise and staff the service, nor to control how the service operates. That is the function of management.</P>
      <P>The fundamental flaw in our health service is the absence of a clear and transparent line of management authority. Ideally Senator Wilson or Senator O&rsquo;Brien, for example, should be able to say that the person who knows precisely what is supposed to happen is X. This is not the case in reality. Let us suppose there was a fatal accident in a pharmaceutical plant in Cork and the Health and Safety Authority arrived on the scene to be told by the management that it was conducting an independent inquiry and would be able to tell the authority in eight weeks time precisely why a person was killed. In such a scenario, the HSA would have the management in court the following day. I do not understand why we cannot find out the precise operating instructions for the staff of Monaghan General Hospital who are there after 5 p.m.</P>
      <P>People are now talking about exceptions, emergencies and so forth but we do not know how the hospital staff operate. Nor do we know the precise instructions given to the staff in Cavan General Hospital. The services are either being run on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis or they are being managed. Many senior public officials have told me that the gap in salaries between the top and bottom levels in the public service has expanded dramatically in the last 20 years because of the major increase in responsibility taken on by managers.</P>
      <P>However, when we have a problem like this one, management goes missing &mdash; although in this <Col N="791"/>instance, Professor Drumm was an honourable exception to that norm. In this instance, the managers have gone missing because there is an eight week inquiry taking place and, therefore, they cannot comment on the matter. Why should it take eight weeks to find out why a fundamental systems failure happened? If one wants to include a plan to ensure that such a failure never happens again, then perhaps eight weeks is a reasonable length of time. We want to know on whose authority it was decided that Mr. Walsh could not be transferred to another hospital. Whose rules were in operation, what precisely did those rules say and are they written down? If so, they should be published now. If there are unwritten rules, let us hear them now.</P>
      <P>In eight weeks time we will receive a report which, I am willing to bet, will identify a systems failure. I have heard of so many systems failures in Ireland in recent times. Another part of the report will contain a statement from the HSE asserting that the problems are all in the past and that it has devised new procedures to guarantee that such a systems failure will never happen again. Another likely finding in the report is that no senior member of management in the HSE is accountable or culpable in this case. Perhaps no one is culpable and such things can happen. However, if a gap in planning for service provision is identified, then it follows that somebody who was paid to manage the service allowed that gap to open up. As has happened in similar situations, it will probably be the nurses, doctors or some junior official who will be blamed for not doing what they were supposed to do or for exceeding their authority. It will emerge that such people were supposed to know what to do but that the service provision was not planned properly.</P>
      <P>If we are to have a proper health service in this country we must get to a point where those who are called managers actually manage the service, where they are not merely administrators. Managers should not be people who simply transmit orders from above to those below or transmit information from below to those above them. Managers must take responsibility and if they do not, they should not be in managerial roles. That is the fundamental point and we do not need an eminent medical professional from Belfast to examine our management system. In fact, he is possibly not the best person to examine the management system, but it is with that system that the fundamental problem appears to lie.</P>
      <P>If one decides that a particular hospital cannot provide certain services between 5 p.m. and 9 a.m., then one is duty bound to plan for what happens if an emergency arises during those hours. One must go through all the eventualities, deal with all the possibilities and have a procedure which is tested and works. It cannot always be the <Col N="792"/>case that some kind of tragedy is necessary for health service management to realise there is a fault in its planning or management. It cannot be changed by tragedy, which is awful. It is a bit like saying that the safety of the chemical industry would only be examined after someone is killed. The fundamental way the best parts of our industries work is by pre-emptive planning to avoid anything going wrong.</P>
      <P>Related to this are some of the comments of the chief executive of the HSE. I refer to it as the HSE, because I presume when he speaks, he speaks for the HSE. The presumption is that big hospitals are better, which is the basic argument of the Hanly report. The statistical evidence used in the Hanly report has been challenged and demonstrated to be dubious. First, there is not a convincing study of the statistical evidence which could convince any objective person that, in 80% of cases, a small number of big hospitals produce no improved outcomes. Second, while I do not claim to be an authority on it, what happened this week in the north-eastern region did not happen under the old regime. No matter what anyone said about the inadequacies of the service, the inadequacies of the training or the inadequacies of the cover, what happened this week did not happen under the old regime. It is, therefore, the responsibility of the advocates of the new regime to explain how their regime is better, instead of asking people to trust them because they know what they are doing.</P>
      <P>Fundamentally, after an incident such as this, the issue for most people is trusting the HSE and believing its management is really in charge. What sort of system is it whereby a manager must be telephoned at 3 a.m. to persuade a hospital to take a patient? I admire the manager for taking responsibility and directing this be done. However, the real job of a manager is to organise matters in such a way that people will not have to telephone him to get something done that he or she believes should be done and has the authority to make happen. Managers do not need to be on the premises 24 hours a day. They should put together systems that work. One must have enormous sympathy for Mr. Walsh and his family who suffered, not just because of his death, but because of the way he died, which was awful.</P>
      <P>For once in this country, we must identify lines of authority, lines of responsibility and lines of accountability based on real managers who are now paid managers&rsquo; salaries, operating as managers and not as administrators, passing around other people&rsquo;s responsibilities. This is the fundamental issue that arises here and all over the health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>At the outset, this is a difficult debate in which to participate. However, I thank Members for their contri<Col N="793"/>butions and the dignified way in which they made them.</P>
      <P>I would like to repeat something I said earlier in regard to the report of a steering group, which was established in 2004. That group was representative of all the key professionals and stakeholders. It included consultant representations from both hospitals, including the disciplines of surgery, medicine and radiology. The steering group recommended that major and emergency surgery should be carried out in Cavan General Hospital and that Monaghan General Hospital should provide selective elective surgery. It is important to note that in making the recommendation, the group took account of the expert advice received from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. I am aware that all Members who participated were not present when I said this.</P>
      <P>Monaghan General Hospital is on medical call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and medical emergencies can call to the hospital. Surgical emergencies must go to Cavan or Drogheda, and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland supported these arrangements. These decisions were not taken lightly. Much thought and consideration went into them and they were supported by the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.</P>
      <P>A number of questions have been raised, not just by Members of this House, but by people throughout the country. I am sure the Walsh family, in particular, will be anxious to have answers to many of the questions asked here today. Some of them would be best left to Mr. Carey in his inquiry. Senator Hayes asked when did the T&aacute;naiste become aware of the availability of a bed. She learned from the HSE on Tuesday that a bed was available in Cavan General Hospital on the night in question. She informed the House at the first opportunity, which was during Question Time on Tuesday afternoon.</P>
      <P>The big question is who was in charge of Mr. Walsh&rsquo;s care and the responsibilities surrounding it. I have no doubt that the answer will be provided in the report. Senator Norris referred to the interview with Professor Drumm, who indicated his disquiet at what happened and his determination that the HSE should take responsibility for trying to ensure that such a tragic event would not happen again.</P>
      <P>A number of questions were raised in regard to Mr. Walsh&rsquo;s medical condition and the appropriate treatment. These matters will be examined by Mr. Carey. While people would like answers soon, it has been agreed that the report will not take longer than eight weeks. I wish to make it clear that the only reason for setting up the inquiry is to uncover the full facts behind this very sad story. It is the least the family of Mr. Walsh deserve, and we will ensure it happens. Given that they live so close to the hospital, I appreciate that it is a great tragedy for my colleagues, Senator O&rsquo;Brien and Senator Wilson, <Col N="794"/>and for the people in the locality who are saddened at what happened. I appreciate their need to have a number of answers as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan appeared to be second guessing what may be contained in the report. If he wants to make these judgments, he should feel free to do so but, in fairness, we should wait for the report to emerge. In order to guarantee the independence of the report, we have gone outside to appoint a consultant surgeon from Belfast, Mr. Carey. I hope the full facts will emerge from the inquiry.</P>
      <P>With regard to the terms of reference, Mr. Carey has been asked to examine all the circumstances covering the period commencing with the admission of Mr. Walsh to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, which took place on 21 September, until his sad death in Monaghan General Hospital on 14 October. The T&aacute;naiste is as anxious as everyone else to have answers to the questions raised both inside and outside the House. I thank Members again for their contributions and the manner in which they dealt with this very difficult issue.</P>

	<P>I tabled this matter because last week on the Order of Business I stated that as a member of a Government party, I was no longer prepared to stand over what is happening on rail services to and from Dublin. I will relate a short story to indicate my annoyance. This morning I had to decide whether to catch an overcrowded train provided by the State three minutes from my doorstep in Castleknock or drive my car into Dublin city centre and park it in a space provided by the taxpayer until the day I die. I had no choice but to take the train because the traffic is gridlocked. When the train arrives in Castleknock from Maynooth, having stopped at Coolmine, Clonsilla and Leixlip, it is so overcrowded that between 60 and 70 people stand in an area of less than 9 sq. m. Cr&egrave;ches operate under a charter and guidelines under which children must be provided with a certain area. However, what charter is in place for commuters?</P>
      <P>An additional 400,000 people have joined the workforce since 1997, which is positive. We boast that 77,000 housing units were built last year and a lower figure will be built this year, primarily in the eastern region, which the commuter rail lines <Col N="795"/>from Drogheda, Arklow, Maynooth-Longford and Carlow are trying to service. It is no longer good enough to have to wait for additional services as thousands of extra people join an overcrowded system every year. Ministers are delighted to partake in photocalls on the Luas and the DTO boasts about the fantastic QBC system between Stillorgan and the city centre. However, no Minister has travelled on the suburban rail lines, which transport people to and from work. The conditions are so bad that men are bringing extra shirts with them on the train so that they can change when they get to work. That is not acceptable in a country that is so flush.</P>
      <P>I demand that the Government&rsquo;s ten-year plan should be launched immediately and that the Irish Rail five-year strategic plan, which was approved 12 months ago, should see the light of day with an interconnector provided in Dublin so that a decent service can be provided. Every year these plans are delayed, the situation worsens. A scheme comprising 2,000 houses is being built in the Phoenix Park. As part of the planning permission, a train station must be provided. The developer is providing it but how will trains service this station? Irish Rail&rsquo;s strategic plan should not be held up by the Government&rsquo;s ten-year investment plan. The suburban rail system could be linked through an interconnector. People in the regions have been forced out of Dublin to buy houses and they could get to work more easily if it was built.</P>
      <P>I travel a mere 20 minutes into the city on the train. However, commuters from as far away as Carlow experience these overcrowded conditions and we hear nothing about it. As a public representative, I cannot stand on a platform and say nothing about what is happening. I intend raising this issue non-stop until I achieve positive action. The Government established a Department with special responsibility for transport. What is happening? Debates in this House are not adequate to address the issue and I have been forced to table an Adjournment debate. However, my anger is nothing compared with the anger of those who commute daily. I only travel by train two or three days a week but many people travel five days a week, 48 to 50 weeks a year. I cannot accept these conditions any longer.</P>

	<P>Following a number of years of underinvestment, the Government has provided significant funding for public transport since 1999. The role the railway plays in moving large numbers of people in an efficient manner has been particularly recognised. More than &euro;1 billion has been spent in recent years in bringing the rail network up to an acceptable level to cater for the increasing demands made on it. Almost all the trackwork has been <Col N="796"/>renewed and is now continuous welded, the signalling system across the network is undergoing renewal and a phased introduction of new rolling sock is taking place. By the end of 2007, larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann will have the most modern rolling stock in Europe.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In the case of the Maynooth line, which is the basis for the Senator&rsquo;s matter, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann doubled the trackwork from Connolly Station to Maynooth in 2000. The company purchased 20 railcars specifically to operate on the line, thereby doubling its capacity as well. Subsequently, under the national development plan, and with EU assistance, the company purchased a further 80 diesel railcars, many of which were assigned to that route. This allowed Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to increase peak hour trains to eight-car length, the maximum possible on the route. Additional frequencies were also added over time so that the line is now at capacity. Since June 2005, Irish Rail has accepted into service a further 36 diesel railcars. These railcars will be used to replace older rolling stock on the Sligo-Dublin route. In December this year, frequencies on that service will increase from three to five each way per day and will benefit both longer distance commuter and Intercity passengers.</P>
      <P>The DART upgrade project will be completed by year end and one of the benefits of this work is that it has allowed Iarnr&oacute;d Eireann to operate additional trains through the Pearse Station-Connolly Stationbottleneck in the morning and evening peaks. The additional train paths are to be assigned to the Dundalk and Maynooth services exclusively. These additional services, similar to the Intercity services I mentioned, will come into effect with the timetable change in mid-December 2005.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In the longer term, the issue of continued growth and demand for rail services must be addressed in an integrated and planned way. A feasibility study into the reinstating of a railway line between Clonsilla and Dunboyne M3 has been completed by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, and was presented to a steering group comprising the rail company, Meath and Fingal County Councils, and the Dublin Transportation Office earlier this year. The study examined the line from Clonsilla to the M3 interchange at Pace, which is 7.5 km in length. Three stations are considered at Hansfield, Dunboyne and a major park and ride facility at the proposed M3 interchange. Service frequency would be about every 15 minutes at peak, and every 30 minutes off-peak. larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is examining the feasibility study at present and will make specific proposals to the Department if it wishes to proceed with this project.</P>
      <P>A complicating factor in the provision of additional services on the Maynooth line and the construction of the spur to Dunboyne is the fact that the central corridor between Pearse station <Col N="797"/>and Connolly station is at full capacity in the peak hours. In view of this, any further capacity increases along the Maynooth line are dependent on the construction of a new city centre railway station. Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is currently examining suitable locations in the Docklands for a new station.</P>
      <P>The Dunboyne line would, at best, cover its direct operating costs, and would not generate profits to fund financing or depreciation costs. However, when wider economic social benefits are taken into account such as time savings, accident savings, environmental benefits and decongestion, the project yields a positive rate of return and is economically viable. Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has submitted a greater Dublin integrated rail network plan, which proposes the enhancement of all suburban and outer suburban services into Dublin and not just those of the Maynooth line to cater for demand into the future. The proposals are being examined by the Department at present in the context of the multi-annual investment framework for transport and a decision is due soon.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the frustration of the Senator and it is shared by people in Dublin, the west and the south. The major economic growth of recent years has left us with a deficit but this is something with which we must put up. The comprehensive reply given highlights the time it takes to make these improvements. Many complications are involved and it is not simply a matter of providing additional rolling stock. Significant infrastructural improvements are needed and significant funding has been directed toward this in the past few years and this will continue. The Minister for Transport and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann are determined to improve the standard of services as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Title>Homemakers Scheme.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, to the House. I raised this matter on the Adjournment as I believe there is a group of women being discriminated against in our society. Some of them were discriminated against in the past when forced to give up their jobs in the late 1960s and early 1970s because of the marriage ban. Subsequently, other women chose to give up their jobs, remain at home and rear children or care for a sick child or relative. They are discriminated against because they are not included in the present homemakers scheme, which is only applicable from 1994. That scheme recognises women who choose to leave the workforce for a period not greater than 20 years to care for children or a sick child or relative. I urge the Minister to apply the same scheme retrospectively from 1970.</P>
<Col N="798"/>
      <P>It should be a parent&rsquo;s choice to remain at home for a number of years and the State should recognise this and support the parents. Currently there is no support but hopefully this will change when we address the child care issue and the State will recognise the work of parents who choose to stay at home for a number of years. However, a group of women is in limbo and has been actively discriminated against by the introduction of the homemakers scheme. It is wrong that the Minister introduces legislation to address a certain group yet discriminates against another group. Perhaps this could be challenged by the Equality Authority.</P>
      <P>I urge the Government to address this anomaly in the forthcoming budget. At present there are 110,000 home carers receiving the tax allowance who are raising children up to the age of 18 years. In the year 1970 and before, women chose to remain at home to raise children or care for elderly parents. We know the contribution made to the community and I want that to be recognised. This could be done simply without huge cost to the State by recognising the years out of work and by granting the women eligibility to a pension in retirement. In this society we recognise equality, attempt to gender-proof legislation and avoid situations giving rise to discrimination but this is one area that must be addressed. I ask the Government to examine this matter and address it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">On behalf of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Seamus Brennan, I wish to reply to the matter raised by Senator Terry whom I thank for raising the matter.</P>
      <P>The social welfare pension rights of those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties are protected by the homemakers scheme. The scheme was introduced from 1994 and allows up to 20 years spent on caring duties to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s insurance record is being averaged to assess entitlement for contributory pension purposes. However, it must be borne in mind that the scheme will not of itself qualify a person for a pension. The standard qualifying conditions for pensions, which require a person to enter insurance ten years before pension age, pay a minimum of 260 contributions at the current rate and achieve a yearly average of at least ten contributions on their record from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age must also be satisfied. The homemakers scheme is designed to mitigate the effect of periods spent on caring duties when a persons insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.</P>
      <P>The Government is anxious to ensure that as many people as possible can qualify for pensions in their own right. A number of measures have been introduced over the years to which make it <Col N="799"/>easier for people to qualify for pensions. In 1997 the yearly average number of contributions required for pension purposes was reduced from 20 to ten and in 2000 a special half rate pension was introduced based on pre-1953 insurance contributions. Pro-rata pensions are also available to allow people with mixed rate insurance records to receive a payment and this is of benefit to people who may have worked in both the public and private sectors. This set of measures is of particular benefit to women who may have less than complete social insurance records due to working in the home. It is estimated that approximately 87% of women aged 65 years are at present receiving social welfare support, either in their own right or as qualified adults on the pension of their spouse or partner.</P>
      <P>There are, of course, those who will not benefit from the homemakers scheme and who cannot qualify for a pension in their own right. In this regard, the Government is committed to increasing the payment for qualified adults, age 66 years or over, to the same level as the personal rate of the old age non-contributory pension and to facilitate the direct payment of the allowance to spouses and partners. A number of special increases have been given over several budgets in pursuit of this target, totalling &euro;56.47 per week since April 2000. Qualified adult allowance rates for those over 66 are now between 66% and 77% of maximum personal rates, which were between 60% and 67% in 2000. Also, since 2002, new pension claimants can opt to have the qualified adult allowance paid directly to their spouse or partner. The administrative and legislative implications of enhancing these provisions are being examined to ensure that more qualified adults can receive a personal payment.</P>
      <P>In August 2000, the Department of Social and Family Affairs published a review of the qualifying conditions for old age contributory and retirement pensions. This review also included a general examination of the homemakers scheme and the report suggested a number of reforms for further consideration. These included the possibility of changing the operative date of the scheme and replacing the disregard system with one based on actual credited contributions.</P>
      <P>In general, changes to insurability of employment, etc., are not back-dated, and the same principle was applied to the homemakers scheme in 1994. Apart from that, there would be practical difficulties in certifying periods of caring and very significant costs involved. As I already indicated, the scheme will not of itself qualify a person for a pension and, consequently, a significant proportion of any cost will involve improvements for those already in receipt of a social welfare pension.</P>
      <P>As Senator Terry may be aware, the Minister is currently reviewing the operation of the social <Col N="800"/>welfare pension system, including the relationship between contributory and non-contributory schemes, and the operation of means testing in the context of old age pensions. The needs of people who are outside the social welfare pensions system, including those excluded by virtue of time spent on caring duties, can best be addressed in the context of that review.</P>

    <Title>Genealogical Projects.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for taking this matter on the Adjournment, which I am sure he will agree is important to people providing a service in genealogy. Genealogy is the key that unlocks the mysteries of our past and in doing so makes sense of our present. As Aristotle said, if you would understand anything, observe its beginnings and its developments.</P>
      <P>With an estimated 60 million people worldwide claiming Irish ancestry, there is no shortage of quests to find Irish roots, allied with a natural curiosity about the role of Irish families and a deep-rooted wish to know what a particular family has contributed to our history or the reason ancestors left their original birthplaces. We are not on opposite sides here in saying that such projects provide an invaluable service and open pathways to our past but a difference of opinion may arise in the way the service is assisted and the provision of funding opportunities, which are not equitably distributed.</P>
      <P>I have been contacted by a constituent of mine in County Longford, Noel Farrell, who approached the Irish Genealogical Project last summer assuming it would promote and encourage all valid genealogical projects. This man, whose project entails months of data entry and indexation similar to the work undertaken by the IGP, expected that his proposal would be met with a clear affirmative or rejection. However, he was informed that it was not in the remit of the IGP to help genealogical projects other than its own. Appeals for funding to the Heritage Council, the Leader programme and the Arts Council, as well as the IGP, met with rejection.</P>
      <P>My concern is that if all other genealogical projects are ignored in favour of the Irish Genealogical Project, the promotion of Irish genealogy as a whole suffers. That leads to an indifference or distorted competition in the genealogy market and also raises questions about the main objective of the IGP and its role in promoting Irish genealogy. How many other projects have met with refusal and been required to compete in an imbalanced market? This question is perhaps answered in part by the lack of other genealogical projects such as that of my constituent because they could not survive in a market where one project is granted annual funding and has the added advantage of using F&Aacute;S subsidised workers to help with <Col N="801"/>its data entry work while others must struggle to survive.</P>
      <P>The local project being undertaken by a Longford man, Noel Farrell, entails helping people in Ireland search their family tree without a cost to the taxpayer. Mr. Farrell has already published 27 books covering 30 towns in Ireland and plans to publish 25 more covering a further 25 towns but with a small return and no funding to provide for essential day to day living expenses that work becomes increasingly difficult. Funding for my constituent&rsquo;s project should be sourced from the national development plan and Tourism Ireland or F&Aacute;S, which finances the Irish Genealogical Project. The amount of funding required would be performance related. For coverage of an additional 20 towns, the total requirement would be &euro;40,000, averaging &euro;2,000 per town, which would cover the time needed to complete all research for the individual areas.</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister to provide the necessary funding for the project I have highlighted and also for other similar undertakings in this specified field to allow genealogical projects to survive and to maintain competition in an increasingly expensive market. The funding of the IGP at the expense of other valid projects will inevitably breed an ESB style monopoly where the people of Ireland will have no option but to pay a large fee to the State&rsquo;s genealogical centres while every other genealogical project collapses. I have two or three copies with me today. I gave one to the Cathaoirleach earlier. Mr. Farrell is doing an exceptional job and for a small amount of money he would do a great deal for Irish society.</P>

	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue. I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, who is unavoidably absent due to departmental business.</P>
      <P>The position in regard to the Irish Genealogical Project providing funds to genealogical projects is simple. The Irish Genealogy Project is a genealogical project funded by the State. It has no funds for, and was not established to, fund genealogical projects. It is a project in its own right that is funded through Irish Genealogy Limited, which is itself funded through the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism. The project evolved from the task force on roots, genealogy and tourism in the late 1980s.</P>
      <P>The primary goal of the project is to generate economic activity and employment throughout the island of Ireland by boosting roots tourism. The assumption underlying the strategy is that the availability of a world class, country-wide genealogy service, with the potential of pin-pointing <Col N="802"/>the exact point of origin of emigrant families and supplying on-the-ground orientation in Ireland, will represent a powerful attraction for ethnically Irish visitors from America, Argentina, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Britain. The intention is to attract these visitors to the various genealogical centres, which will provide a marketing or sales opportunity. The centres could provide an opportunity for individual genealogical researchers or authors to market their wares. The diaspora is variously estimated at between 50 million and 70 million people; however, the ties between the diaspora and Ireland may well be weakening.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The business plan for the project envisaged the establishment of a central agency that would be responsible for market research, marketing and the development of a range of common products and prices across the network of genealogical centres. It was also expected to create and operate a central computerised index of the records held in local centres, which could be used to direct potential customers to the specific local centre or to a professional genealogist. In 1993 a company, Irish Genealogy Limited, was incorporated to act as the required central agency. The company represents diverse interests in genealogy, including the Association of Professional Genealogists in Ireland, the Association of Ulster Genealogists and Record Agents, and the Irish Family History Foundation. In 1996, after some delay, a chief executive and administrator were appointed. IGL is the umbrella organisation for genealogy in Ireland and is charged with completing the Irish genealogy project. The company&rsquo;s primary aim, as set out in its mission statement, is &ldquo;to promote and foster quality local genealogical research services in Ireland to enable those of Irish descent and those at home to research their family histories with the objective of boosting tourism and cultural and economic activity in the local communities.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Following a value-for-money report from the Comptroller and Auditor General and the project&rsquo;s transfer to the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, a full review was undertaken by an officer of the Department. That review was completed in early 1999. Copies of the report were given to the Committee of Public Accounts and the Department of Finance and placed in the Oireachtas Library. The recommendations were accepted by the Minister and the board of IGL. The project called for the recording of 29 million records, drawn from church and civil records, the 1901 and 1911 censuses, Griffith&rsquo;s valuation and the tithe applotment books. A central signposting system would be established utilising data fields drawn from the database records. IGL has now decided to limit itself to working on church records only since the Ulster Historical Foundation has placed all the data from the tithe <Col N="803"/>applotment books onto compact discs available to the general public; Griffith&rsquo;s valuation is available from the National Library of Ireland and over the Internet; access to the census data from the 1901 and 1911 censuses is available from the National Archives, with a joint Canadian-National Archives project digitising those data; and access to the civil records of births, deaths and marriages is available through the General Register Office. Some 76% of the 13.7 million church records have been indexed and inputted into the computerised databases while some 2.7 million records in 11 counties may be accessed through the central signposting system.</P>
      <P>The Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism has supported the project, with funding of &euro;2.5 million from 1998 to 2005. In addition, F&Aacute;S contributed &euro;32.2 million in the period to 31 December 2004 through the payment of wages to staff inputting records into the databases. The countrywide genealogical centres, in co-operation with F&Aacute;S, have delivered a most successful training programme for that funding, of which thousands of citizens have availed and which has achieved placement success rates of up to 90%.</P>
<Col N="804"/>
      <P>While there have recently been difficulties between the Irish Family History Foundation and Irish Genealogy Limited, the two sides have entered into discussions to resolve them. It is also true that the attachment of the Irish diaspora to Ireland appears to be weakening. Accordingly, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, has arranged for the project to be examined to determine its future.</P>

The man to whom I have referred provides a very important service, and the Cathaoirleach has been given one of his books. He does so at very low cost, and perhaps the Minister might consider forcing funding through the aegis of the national development plan, the tourism budget, the Leader programme, F&Aacute;S or the Heritage Council. There may be an area where funding could be provided for him to continue his very valuable project.</P>
