    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Order of Business is Nos. 1 to 7, inclusive. Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, are motions which were referred to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights, which has completed its deliberations on them. The motions relate to agreements between the Government and the governments of the Republic of Bulgaria, the Republic of Cyprus and the Republic of Poland, providing for co-operation in combatting crime. The motions, which have been considered by the committee, will be taken without debate. No. 4 is a motion that was referred to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights, which has completed its deliberations on it. The motion relates to a proposal to establish a web-based mutual information procedure, or network function, through which member states will be required to communicate to other member states and the Commission any measures they intend to take in the area of asylum and immigration. The motion, which has been considered by the committee, will be taken without debate. No. 5 is the Social Welfare Bill 2005 &mdash; Second Stage, to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 1.30 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons to last 12 minutes and the contributions of other Senators to last eight minutes, and the Minister to be called on to reply not later than five minutes before the conclusion of Second Stage. No. 6 is a motion re the draft Commission of Investigation (Child Sexual Abuse) Order 2005, to be taken at 2 p.m. and to conclude not later than 3 p.m., with the contributions of each group spokesperson not to exceed ten minutes and the Minister to be called on to reply not later than five minutes before the conclusion of the debate on the motion. No. 7 is the Coroners (Amendment) Bill 2005 &mdash; all Stages, to be taken at 3 p.m. and to conclude not later than 6 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons to last 15 minutes and the contributions of other Senators to last ten minutes, and the Minister to be called on to reply not later than <Col N="586"/>five minutes before the conclusion of Second Stage. There will be a sos from 1.30 p.m. to 2 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Government&rsquo;s acceptance of the Coroners (Amendment) Bill 2005 in the other House. I am glad the Bill is to be taken in this House today. I expressed my approval of the Bill, which will amend the Coroners Act 1962, last week, following its publication by Deputy Rabbitte. It is good that the Government accepted a Private Members&rsquo; Bill in the other House. I welcome its decision to ensure that the legislation will be passed swiftly before the Christmas recess.</P>
      <P>Can I ask the Government what action it proposes to take following yesterday&rsquo;s description by the President of Iran of the Holocaust as a &ldquo;myth&rdquo;? The gentleman in question said some months ago that Israel should be &ldquo;wiped off the map&rdquo;. Regardless of the difficulties between Iran and Israel and the clear differences of opinion in the Middle East, we all have a responsibility to ensure that the memory of the victims of the Holocaust is not forgotten.</P>
      <P>I ask the Government and its EU colleagues to lodge the strongest possible objections and comments on foot of the recent remarks by the President of Iran. It was particularly insensitive of him to make such comments this year, when we are commemorating the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the concentration camps at Belsen and Auschwitz. The Government and its EU counterparts need to take a very firm view of the latest outburst by the President of Iran.</P>
      <P>I welcome the significant comments made last week by the former Taoiseach, Mr. Albert Reynolds, about the aid relief programme in Pakistan. The Leader of the House is aware that when we worked on the Seanad reform document I made a proposal, which was accepted by all Members, that former taoisigh be <i>ex officio</i> members, or non-voting members, of the House. There is vast experience among former taoisigh of all political parties and a platform should be provided for them as they have important things to say because of their connections in the world and their reputation as Leaders of Government over a whole generation. A way has to be found where that experience can be tapped into and used. I believe this House is the appropriate means by which that can be done. This is an important issue that I know our group on Seanad reform will take forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>On that latter point, I am sure the Leader will be happy to confirm that the Seanad reform group is writing to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of both Houses on that issue this week with the idea of moving it on.</P>
      <P>On the Iran issue, it is crucial that there is an international response to his comments for the second time in two months. We should be aware that, perhaps, unlike other similar states, the President of Iran is playing national politics on <Col N="587"/>the international stage. Clearly, he is losing the battle in terms of fundamentalism within his own bailiwick. Recent reports from Tehran show clearly that there are two societies in Iran and that many people are taking a much more progressive view. It is nice to see young women and young men walk down the streets in parts of Tehran holding hands and so on, something which was unheard of years ago. It is important that those people hear our voices in response and to that extent I fully agree with the point made by Senator Brian Hayes.</P>
      <P>In the past week we had another appalling situation where seven people from the Middle East, in particular, working in this country were paid a paltry &euro;2 per hour by a company called A1 Plastering which was doing work for a huge construction company, JJ Rattigan. That has been reported. I want people to recognise again that we have a serious problem in convincing those in the business community who are exploiting migrant workers, those who come into the State, that this is utterly wrong.</P>
      <P>This is particularly important if we are looking at a new social partnership. I ask Members when speaking with people who run medium-sized enterprises whose spokespersons shout off at the mouth on radio and television, week after week, to be aware that if we pay workers lower wages we collect lower taxes, if we collect lower taxes, we cannot put money into health and education. If we pay lower wages to people it means they have less marginal income and the first people to lose will be the business community. It is in their interests, if they want to be selfish about it, but if we do not collect tax from one place it has to come from another.</P>
      <P>We are creating a wealthy society in order to ensure the standards of living of all people in society, whether one is running a business or working for a business person, or whether one is in the public or private sector. That is what we are trying to achieve and that is what we need to ensure we deliver. It is pure practical simple politics. If we do not pay people more we pay the price at the end.</P>
      <P>Agus m&eacute; ag caint anseo inn&eacute;, d&uacute;ras c&uacute;pla rud mar gheall ar an Acht teangan, agus go m&oacute;rmh&oacute;r the difficulties to which the Taoiseach referred in the other House about the significant costs for the publication of annual reports. I said we should be careful about that and, perhaps, the Act needs to be reviewed. The Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga, Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Cuirre&aacute;in, was good enough to contact me during the course of the past 24 hours. I made the point here yesterday that we could have the report properly translated but it need not necessarily be published in hard copy but could be published on the web. He said he is happy with that suggestion. His interpretation is that it will suffice if a report is published on the web. However, he wanted the publication to be simultaneous and I agree.</P><Col N="588"/>
      <P Just="Left">The Taoiseach got incorrect information when he spoke in the D&aacute;il last week &mdash; which he has since corrected &mdash; about the costs of the English and Irish versions. It means we do not need to produce large numbers of publications in hard copy in the Irish language. If they are translated properly and available on the Internet that will be satisfactory. That is an important issue.</P>

	<P>T&aacute;imid ag dul ar aghaidh. N&iacute;l scoilt eadrainn faoi sin, p&eacute; sc&eacute;al &eacute;. D&eacute;arfainn, d&aacute; mbeadh acmhainn&iacute; ar f&aacute;il, gur ch&oacute;ir iad a dh&iacute;ri&uacute; i dtreo t&eacute;acsleabhar do na me&aacute;nscoileanna l&aacute;n-Ghaelacha nach bhfuil ar f&aacute;il faoi l&aacute;thair. I gc&aacute;s mo mhic f&eacute;in, leis an chuid is m&oacute; de na h&aacute;bhair theicni&uacute;la a bh&iacute; idir l&aacute;mha aige, bh&iacute; ar na p&aacute;ist&iacute; t&eacute;acsleabhair B&eacute;arla a &uacute;s&aacute;id agus focl&oacute;ir Gaeilge ag an am c&eacute;anna chun na focail theicnici&uacute;la a aistri&uacute; go Gaoluinn. Ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh t&eacute;acsleabhair ar f&aacute;il, agus sin an sprioc is t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; ar cheart don Rialtas a bheith aige. Ruda&iacute; a fhoilsi&uacute; i nGaoluinn would be to make sure that ever single second level school teaching through Irish would have available to it high quality text books in Irish. That is the most immediate problem.</P>
      <P>Senator Brian Hayes is right about Iran. The situation there is becoming extremely worrying. Let us not forget that until comparatively recently the state of Israel pretended there was no such place as Palestine and said there were no such people as Palestinians, they were Jordanians and Egyptians and other people and that what they moved into in 1948 was essentially an empty space. I do not subscribe to that view but we genuinely have to worry about what is happening in Iran. It is an extraordinary country and is not by any means the most repressive country. It is a freer country than Saudia Arabia. It has used the greater freedom to elect a President and that is disturbing.</P>
      <P>After Christmas may we have a solid debate on the Government&rsquo;s proposals on what it has described as, and I do not disagree, fourth level education, linked into which is the large capital funding the Minister announced last Sunday for the third level sector? A number of issues arise that deserve to be watched. One is the fact that in two years&rsquo; time one of our biggest universities will turn virtually all of its engineering degrees into five-year degrees, with a three-year BSc, followed by two years in which to get a masters. This means that in the last two of the five years students will pay fees. Therefore, three years of the course will be fee free and students will pay fees for the other two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Does one get a degree at the end of the three years?</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="589"/>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">One will get a BSc in engineering in UCD. That is the plan and I think it will be followed in the whole third level sector. Therefore, people will have three years of free fees followed by two years in which to get a properly recognised degree in engineering where fees will be re-introduced for two out of the five years, in other words, 40% of the student&rsquo;s time. This is fees by the back door. If the Government has a policy of agreeing with this plan it ought to be a policy and not slipped in by universities operating with a nod and a wink from the Department of Education and Science. I ask the Leader to arrange for a long debate on that whole area of funding and third level education and all the changes taking place, Bologna and so on, in the new year because I know the Minister would be glad of an opportunity to elaborate on it. This is an appropriate Chamber for it to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan"><NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to provide time for a substantial debate after Christmas on alternative land use. It is appropriate to have such a debate at this time. There are conflicting statements issuing from people who should know better and this is upsetting to rural people and farmers in general.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for Finance on the lead he has taken in the budget in which he has provided &euro;20 million, &euro;35 million and &euro;50 million in aid towards biofuel production. There is a need to have people living in rural Ireland doing productive work.</P>
      <P>If there is some difficulty with food production, then the alternative is biofuels. We should go down that road, examine it and give leadership to the people rather than issuing confusing statements on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I also read of the case of the plastering sub-contractor working for a very prominent building contractor. Many building contractors are members of the Construction Industry Federation and most new immigrants work in the construction industry. In that context, it is imperative, if social partnership talks go ahead, that it be emphasised that immigrant workers are at least entitled to basic, proper wages.</P>
      <P>I have said on numerous occasions in the House that it is not satisfactory to have only 13 inspectors in the labour inspectorate when there is a need for at least 30. We should increase the number of inspectors to reflect the times we live in because I am sure what has been exposed in the newspapers is only the tip of the iceberg in terms of exploitation. Our treatment of immigrants here will be reported in newspapers in Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and so forth and the image it projects of Ireland will be a wrong one. It behoves us to tackle exploitation because it is commonplace.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="590"/>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the outrage of Senators on the other side of the House at the remarks of the Iranian President but I would also suggest that Middle East politics is a murky stew of hatreds, prejudices and ignorance. In fact, the Iranian President is fuelling this ignorance. Of course the remarks should be condemned and I hope the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, will protest at official level, as he did on a previous occasion over a similar outburst about the state of Israel, to the Iranian ambassador. The protest could be more practical than that, however. People such as the Iranian President are happy in their own prejudices and, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole said, the President is playing to a particular domestic political agenda. He is obviously losing and I am very happy that is the case.</P>
      <P>It should be remembered that the President was elected primarily by those on the margins of Iranian society, to whom he promised a better life. That was the domestic political agenda. I have a more practical suggestion for a protest. As it is Christmas time, although that might not be acknowledged in a religious context by the Iranian President, people tend to do a lot of reading and watching of television. The civilised world, through its embassies based in Iran, should overwhelm the presidential office with Holocaust literature, including the hundreds of testimonies of victims. There are two particular movies that he should watch over Christmas, &ldquo;Schindler&rsquo;s List&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Pianist&rdquo;. Then perhaps he might have some understanding of why there is such outrage and disgust in this part of the world at remarks denying the Holocaust ever happened. The president should also remember that Iran, Iraq and other countries were created as a consequence of the First World War, while the state of Israel was created as a consequence of what the allies saw in Belsen, Auschwitz, Mauthausen and Dachau.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with my colleagues in calling for a protest to be made about the statement of President Ahmadinejad but if the protest is to be made to the ambassador, we will have a difficulty because he has disappeared. President Ahmadinejad is somebody who is in touch with a different reality to that with which most of us are in contact. I saw him being interviewed recently and he spoke about how, when he made a speech to the United Nations &mdash; which, in fact, was in some ways a very fine and interesting speech &mdash; he felt that he was in the grip of some kind of holy emotion, that a light came around his head and that all the other ambassadors were frozen in their seats. This is not the kind of reality that most of us encounter, but it is what the President said.</P>
      <P>I hesitate to come into conflict with my distinguished colleague and friend, Senator Ryan, but when he said the Iranian people used their freedom to elect this man, he is incorrect. They did not really do so because 98% of those who <Col N="591"/>put themselves forward for election were ruled out by an unelected group of clerics. Therefore, it was not really an exercise of freedom at all. If an individual within Europe denies the Holocaust, he or she will face criminal sanctions. We should protest very strongly.</P>
      <P>I strongly support Senator Brian Hayes&rsquo;s suggestion that we invite former taoisigh to the House. There are five of them, Mr. Charlie Haughey, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, Mr. Liam Cosgrave, Mr. Albert Reynolds and Mr. John Bruton. Furthermore, there are spaces for them here on the Independent benches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>There are what?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>If they came to the House, I would welcome them and think it would be splendid if they sat&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I think Senator Brian Hayes meant that they would address the House, not stay for the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I genuinely think it is a good idea. This was what the Senate was about in the Roman period &mdash; wise old heads bringing their experience to bear on politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P Italics="Y">(Interruptions).</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has made his point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform when he proposes to examine the laws relating to consent. He indicated that he was troubled, particularly about a case which came before the courts recently where a 17 year old boy and a 15 year old girl engaged in consensual sexual activity and the 17 year old was convicted of statutory rape. The judge expressed surprise that the consenting 15 year old girl was not also before the court. Now it transpires that their parents support the two young people in their relationship. They have now moved in together and have had a child.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>That suggests to me that what I said a long time ago should be re-examined. An age of consent is always arbitrary and perhaps it might be possible to examine the question of a principle of consent in troubled cases such as these, to be decided by a judge. It is plainly a nonsense to ask why we did not send the 15 year old girl to prison for having sex with a man she eventually moved in with, and whose child she is having. There were similar cases in the United States. The Minister was right to isolate this point and I ask the Leader to ascertain when his proposals will be brought before the House.</P>

      <P>I am appalled by the number of glossy reports we receive every year from statutory bodies and the more they deal with matters like poverty, the more glossy the reports seem to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the poverty industry, as Mr. McCreevy called it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an appalling waste of money and most reports end up in the waste paper basket. I do not know why they cannot publish them on the Internet and advertise that fact. That would save a lot of money.</P>
      <P>I also support the call for a debate on higher education. The additional money for that sector, which is to be welcomed, should be used strategically to ensure that Irish universities can compete on the world stage. I thank the Minister for Finance for including in the budget a little-noticed change which allows charitable people to contribute in the form of shares as well as money. This could have great potential for bringing funds into Irish universities.</P>

I agree with what Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Maurice Hayes have said with regard to glossy reports. Enormous savings would be made if it could be agreed that such reports be published on the Internet, rather than being sent to people and largely going straight into the waste paper basket.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We all read in the newspapers this morning about the unfortunate case of the diagnosis of bowel cancer in a woman, the results of which she was not given until she went for a routine check-up a year later. Yesterday the hospital in question agreed a settlement with her and apologised, saying the error was due to a systems failure. Last week we had a lengthy and good debate on oncology services. We on the Government side remarked on how good our services were, but good services are no use if the hospital system fails to support them. I ask the Leader for a debate after Christmas to review systems in all our hospitals because I sat on inquiries during my five years on medical councils where hospital failures resulted in fatalities and it is not good enough. We owe it to patients to do something about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I share Senator O&rsquo;Toole and Senator Finucane&rsquo;s concerns about businesses which pay very low wages to their workers. It is worth remembering Henry Ford&rsquo;s statement that while he did not want to pay his workers high wages he wanted them to be able to buy his cars.</P>
      <P>I join with Senator Ryan and Senator Maurice Hayes in asking for a debate on third level education. I am concerned by the fact that graduate entry may become a requisite for medicine. Is the enthusiasm for this the fact that students would have to pay fees? It could undermine the free fees system by the back door.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>In the past couple of days during the debate on the Competition (Amendment) Bill 2005 I drew attention to the fact that in the past ten years there has been practically no growth in the food and drink industry in Ireland. I share Senator Callanan&rsquo;s concerns for the erosion of rural life and am worried about the resulting retraction in the numbers of people farming. I call for an urgent debate on indigenous Irish industry, particularly the food and drink industry, to examine its relationship with farming and the potential for business in the farming sector. We must remember that every large business started as a small one and we need another success like<?oasys _jy ?>Baileys. The success stories such as Google that we hear of every day are tremendous but we must develop our indigenous industry.</P>

Not a day passes without our reading about a serious failure in the health system which points to a fundamental problem in the management of health services in this country. I ask the Leader of the House to schedule a debate as early as possible in the new year on the management of our health services. There have been numerous reports and reforms, the Health Service Executive has been established and there are promises of improvements yet we still have horrendous waiting lists and dreadful stories such as the one in Tallaght Hospital to which Senator Feeney referred.</P>

	<P>Senator Brian Hayes welcomed the Coroners (Amendment) Bill 2005. I reported last week that I had met Deputy Rabbitte and I am glad it is to be debated here today. I wish to correct something I said earlier on the Bill. I said the Minister was to be called to reply not later than five minutes before the conclusion of Second Stage but I should have said the proposer of the Bill, Senator Tuffy, will be called upon five minutes before the end to conclude.</P>
      <P>This is a great use of Private Members&rsquo; time and instructive for all of us. We have had Senator Leyden&rsquo;s Bill and I understand Senator White has prepared a Bill. Senator Norris is returning with a revamped Bill on civil partnerships and now Senator Tuffy is proposing the Coroners (Amendment) Bill 2005. I look forward to debating it.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senator Brian Hayes also raised the matter of the Iranian President describing the Holocaust as a myth. He will turn into an urban myth if he continues like that. The memory of the Holocaust should not be forgotten. The Senator asked that we register our disgust through diplomatic channels and I will put that to the Minister for Foreign Affairs when I meet him.</P>
      <P>The Senator also mentioned Albert Reynolds&rsquo;s call for further aid for Pakistan. We discussed that last Monday at the reform meeting. He also suggested that former taoisigh come to the House to share their wisdom on particular matters, without voting as Members. That must be considered <Col N="595"/>by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and I will be glad to forward the proposal to it. They have valuable experience which should be tapped into. Former Taoiseach John Bruton&rsquo;s experience from his role in America would be particularly valuable but we could ask all of them.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole raised the issue of seven workers in A1 Plastering who are paid &euro;2 per hour. It happens all the time and I agree with Senator Finucane that the instances reported in the newspapers are only the tip of the iceberg. If somebody comes to a country where they know nobody and have very little money they must go to an employer to gain work. That employer then pays what they want and it is nauseating to hear business people say the minimum wage is too high. Businesses can manage.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Irish Ferries dispute has worked out reasonably satisfactorily and that partnership talks can get moving again. Low wages demean those who pay them and those who receive them and are not acceptable.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole also said he was contacted by the Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga who told him there was no need for hard copies because they can be accessed on the web. That is good because it is much cheaper. I am glad to know peace has broken out between Senator Ryan and Senator O&rsquo;Toole on the language issue.</P>

	<P>It is Christmas and I think the baby Jesus will speak Irish, judging by the amount of Irish being spoken these days. Senator Ryan made the point that textbooks in the meanscoileanna or Irish second level schools are not available and students have to read the English textbooks with an Irish dictionary, which is daft in such a context. That is a fair point.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan also raised an interesting issue which requires debating. He spoke of &ldquo;fourth level&rdquo;, which it is, because one enters that level after one&rsquo;s degree. I do not call it &ldquo;post-degree&rdquo;. It is just a consolidation of one&rsquo;s degree, taking another two years. One will not get the job if one has not done those two years. It is a sort of mean-spirited, back door method. At present one does not get funding to study for a higher diploma in education and one cannot teach without it in many secondary schools. That is something we should consider. We will probably have a debate on third level funding and where we are going in that area.</P>
      <P>Senator Callanan raised an interesting topic, calling for a debate on alternative land use. He made his point well. Senator Finucane was in agreement with Senator O&rsquo;Toole on the issue of low wages being offered by some employers. There are still many people in domestic situations being offered and paid very low wages. I have always felt that a labourer is worthy of his or her hire and should get decent wages.</P><Col N="596"/>
      <P Just="Left"><?oasys _dc14- ?>Senator Mooney noted the interrace hatred so evident in Iran and suggested we should overwhelm the Iranian President's office with Holocaust literature. Senator Norris said the Iranian President lives on another planet and also supported the suggestion of Senator Brian Hayes that former taoisigh be invited to attend the Seanad. He also urged the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to attend the House and discuss his embryonic proposals regarding the age of consent. I think we all followed the case in question.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
      <P>Senator Maurice Hayes noted the glossiness of certain reports by statutory bodies, particularly when dealing with poverty, and of other glossy reports. When I read or take a cursory look at such reports and possibly dump them a month later, I think of how much money was spent on them. They contain some very good material but there is surely no need for such a manifestation of money in these poverty reports and other well-printed and assembled reports. Senator Coghlan agreed with the views expressed on these reports, and also mentioned Dinis cottage. Poor Dina has not had her cottage fixed up yet. I thought the Board of Works had made arrangements.</P>

      <P>Senator Henry called for a debate on third level funding. Senator White called for indigenous industry to be backed and discussed. She also spoke of rural life and development and, accordingly, is in tune with Senator Callanan on that, as she is on other matters. That is our own private party joke.

    <Title>Social Welfare Bill 2005: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very pleased to introduce this, the first of two Bills intended to implement the &euro;1.12 billion social welfare package announced in the budget. This substantial investment represents an almost 28% increase on the 2005 package of &euro;874 million. It brings the projected level of social welfare expenditure in 2006 to more than &euro;13.5 billion, which is double what was spent in 2000. Behind the expenditure statistics are the men, women and children for whom the welfare benefits and supports can be a financial lifeline during vulnerable and difficult times. Around 1.5 million people will benefit from the significant increases and improvements in the budget that will protect and improve the living standards of social welfare recipients.</P>
      <P>The Department of Social and Family Affairs has a pivotal role to play in ensuring that the fruits of our economic growth benefit all, especially those who are most vulnerable. I am happy to have secured a substantial increase in the social welfare budget this year, which underlines the Government&rsquo;s commitment to those for whom the support of the State is vital. By any standard this is a ground-breaking budget, which is reflected in the Bill.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The facts speak for themselves. Some &euro;800 million is allotted to substantial increases in allowances, pensions and entitlements and a further &euro;300 million specifically for a range of social policy reform measures. Social welfare payments have been increased by almost four times the expected rate of inflation; the lowest rate of social welfare has been increased by an unprecedented &euro;17 a week, to a new level of &euro;165.80, with proportionate increases in the qualified adult allowance. Means-tested old age pensions have been increased by &euro;16 a week to &euro;182 and contributory pensions by &euro;14 to more than &euro;193 a week. A wide ranging reform programme will boost the entitlements of older people, alleviate poverty, support activation and recognise carers. Fuel allowances are being increased by &euro;5 a week as part of a major fuel poverty relief package costing more than &euro;42 million. The carer&rsquo;s allowance is being increased by more than &euro;26 a week with the result that the top rate will now stand at &euro;200 a week. In addition, a range of measures costing &euro;28 million will promote activation by improving <Col N="599"/>income disregards and tapered payments for people with disabilities. Maternity benefit is being increased to 80% of reckonable weekly earnings and the duration of both maternity and adoptive benefit is being extended by four weeks in 2006 and a further four weeks in 2007.</P>
      <P>In the past year I have been laying out, with the support of the Government, a strong new social reform agenda and now major funding of more than &euro;300 million is available to underpin and give tangible effect to these important, and necessary, reforms. The reforms, which I have discussed in the Seanad before, while protecting the disadvantaged amongst us, will also strive to get behind the welfare payments and tackle the social issues involved.</P>
      <P>It is a well established fact that the best route out of poverty is through employment. That is why, through these reforms, I want to create the changes and opportunities that will bring people from welfare dependency to financial independence by providing the stepping stones to a better standard of living and income.</P>
      <P>Overall, the budget and this Bill are a clear demonstration of the commitment to vigorously addressing, in particular, the needs of older people, making further progress towards alleviating poverty, especially child poverty and pensioner poverty, the development of a range of supports and opportunities for lone parents and recognising and enhancing supports for carers.</P>
      <P>I will outline briefly the key benefits of budget 2006 for each of these customer groups. We have a booming economy and it is only right that the people who helped lay the foundations for our current prosperity should be able to enjoy the fruits of the tremendous strides which the country has made over the past decade or so. The Government has delivered record increases in pensions since taking office in 1997. In fact, pensions have increased by over 80% since then which is well ahead of the increase in the consumer price index and gross earnings over the same period.</P>
      <P>In addition to the significant weekly increases, this budget makes provision for a number of very important measures which are designed to target resources at particular groups of older people including: combining all non-contributory payments for people over 66 years of age, other than the carer&rsquo;s allowance, into one standard enhanced non-contributory pension scheme with a greatly improved means test that will lift some 34,000 pensioners onto higher or full pensions; increasing the amount of means disregarded from &euro;7.60 to &euro;20 per week for this standard pension; providing a special earnings disregard of &euro;100 per week; and increasing the additional allowance paid to those over 80 years of age by &euro;3.60 to &euro;10 per week which will help 100,000 pensioners, including 33,000 receiving widow&rsquo;s and widower&rsquo;s pensions.</P><Col N="600"/>
      <P>As I have said a number of times, I am determined that everyone in this country should be entitled to a decent pension and to security and dignity in their later years. Central to achieving this aspiration is the need to bring about widespread increases in occupational and private pensions coverage. I have received a very comprehensive report from the Pensions Board on the current situation and proposals for measures we might take in the future. This report is currently before the Cabinet for consideration and when this is completed, it will be published which I hope to do in January. I want to see this report engender a national debate on the future of our pensions system when published.</P>
      <P>On many occasions, I have identified child poverty as one of the key challenges for this Government and society in general. The long-term cost of poverty in childhood for individual children, their families and communities and, indeed, for society at large, demands that we address this issue as a priority. In the context of budget 2006, I have taken a number of measures to alleviate child poverty, in addition to substantially increasing the lower income weekly rates by &euro;17. The investment of over &euro;100 million in increases in child benefit will lift payment rates to &euro;150 for the first two children and &euro;185 for the third and each subsequent child. These increases will benefit over 540,000 families in respect of over 1 million children and fully honour the Government&rsquo;s commitment on child benefit.</P>
      <P>When taken together with the Government&rsquo;s child care package where all families with children under six years will benefit from the new child care payment, this brings the total annual cash support for children to at least &euro;2,800 per annum. When it comes to practical, targeted and concentrated measures to tackle poverty, then the family income supplement, FIS, has an increasingly important role to play. That is why this year I have made major changes to the support scheme, making it particularly beneficial to larger families, and increased funding by a further &euro;25 million.</P>
      <P>As Senators will be aware, the FIS is paid to parents in low-income employment with the objective of directing more resources to larger families. Under the changes that are now being introduced, FIS payments will make further significant contributions to incomes in thousands of low-income homes. As a result of the improvements, it is estimated that over 5,000 additional families will become eligible for the payment next year. From FIS alone, depending on the size of the family, weekly increases will range from over &euro;11 to &euro;169 a week. For example, a family with four children could see its FIS payment rise by up to &euro;64.80 a week while the increase for a family of six children could rise by nearly &euro;117 a week.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The family income supplement can contribute significantly to boosting child support incomes. For example, a family with earnings from employment of &euro;20,000 and with two children under six <Col N="601"/>years, would qualify for &euro;3,900 in family income supplement payment annually. When one adds to that the &euro;2,000 in child care payment and &euro;3,600 in child benefit then that family has an annual tax free child welfare income support of &euro;9,500. A family with an income of &euro;20,000 will get an extra &euro;9,500 in child support. For a family on the same income of &euro;20,000 but with four children, two of whom are aged under six years, the annual FIS support payment amounts to &euro;7,644, giving the family a total child support package of &euro;17,684 a year. That is &euro;17,684 on top of the income of &euro;20,000. At &euro;30,000 income from employment, the same family would still qualify for total child support income of &euro;11,694 annually.</P>
      <P>For thousands of families on low incomes, another important support is the back to school clothing and footwear payment. This payment is being substantially increased this year by &euro;40 per child and entitlement to it is being extended. I am making a further &euro;2 million available to the school meals programme which makes a valuable contribution to the quality of life and the educational opportunities of children in low-income families. Over &euro;10 million is now earmarked for the various school meals initiatives next year.</P>
      <P>We are increasing the fuel allowance by &euro;5 bringing it to &euro;14 per week payable with effect from January 2006. I am also availing of the opportunity to remove the current anomaly whereby residents in some local authority flat complexes with communal heating systems were ineligible for the fuel allowance. Such residents will now be able to qualify for the allowance if they meet the other conditions of the scheme. In all, over &euro;125 million will be spent on fuel allowances next year benefiting nearly 275,000 households.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Most Senators will be aware that the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, has been analysing the issues and developing proposals on child income support and, in particular, the possibility of merging the FIS and child dependant allowance into a second tier child income support, which would avoid the disincentives inherent in the child dependant allowance. My priorities for 2006 will include how best we can pursue the proposals arising from the NESC report.</P>
      <P>Central to effectively tackling and alleviating child poverty are improvements in incomes and supports for lone parents. As research released earlier this week by the Central Statistics Office clearly demonstrates, the social category deemed to be at the highest risk of consistent poverty were lone parent households. The Department provides income support to about 80,000 lone parents through the one-parent family payment at a total cost this year of over &euro;760 million. I have repeatedly stressed the importance of reforms in this area and of the need to deliver a better standard of living for lone parents and their children with policies that are directed at the breaking down of existing obstacles to employment, increasing access to career enhanc<Col N="602"/>ing education and training opportunities and the transforming of lives through targeted supports and enlightened social policies.</P>
      <P>As many in this House may know, there has been no change to the income limits applying to the one-parent family payment since the scheme was introduced in 1997. I want to give lone parents an opportunity to continue to increase their earnings without raising their fears about losing their entitlement to the payment. In recognition of this, we propose to increase the upper income limit for the one-parent family payment from &euro;293 to &euro;375 per week. This substantial increase will encourage employment. Lone parents working over 19 hours per week can also claim the family income supplement, about which I spoke.</P>
      <P>In addition, I am providing additional funding in the budget to the Family Support Agency and Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, so they too can further develop the services they provide to vulnerable families. The additional funding of &euro;3 million to the Family Support Agency will enable the establishment of 12 new family resource centres around the country and increase the level of grant assistance that the agency provides to marriage and family counselling agencies, among other initiatives. The additional funding of &euro;1.5 million I am providing for MABS includes provision for the further development of the service as well as specific funding for the establishment of a national helpline.</P>
      <P>As Senators will know, I have initiated a major review of the one-parent family payment in order to assess how best we can support lone parents in their efforts to improve their own lives and those of their children. That review is now being finalised and I will be bringing it to Cabinet in January with a view to publication and wide consultation.</P>
      <P>As Senators will be aware, the provision of recognition and supports to carers is one of my principal priorities and I am happy to announce that this budget provides for a range of measures which will benefit carers including increasing the rate of carer&rsquo;s benefit by &euro;17.00 to &euro;180.70 per week, the rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance will increase by &euro;26.40 to &euro;180 per week for a carer under age 66, and the rate for carers over age 66 will increase by &euro;30.20 to &euro;200 per week, making it the single largest welfare entitlement apart from over 80s pensioners which is significant. These represent increases of 17% for recipients of the carer&rsquo;s allowance and will serve to acknowledge and support the invaluable work of our family carers.</P>
      <P>I am also increasing the rate of the respite care grant by 25%, from &euro;1,000 to &euro;1,200, from June next year. The number of hours which a person can work and still receive a carer&rsquo;s allowance will be increased, carer&rsquo;s benefit or respite care grant will increase from ten to 15 hours per week and there will be an increase in the income disregards <Col N="603"/>for the means test for carer&rsquo;s allowance to &euro;290 for a single person and &euro;580 for a couple. This fulfils the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government to enable all those earning up to average industrial earnings to qualify for carer&rsquo;s allowance. There will be an extension in the duration of the carer&rsquo;s benefit scheme to two years per care recipient from May 2006.</P>
      <P>This is the most significant budget for carers ever introduced, not only in terms of expenditure on income supports from my Department but also in the realisation of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the proper recognition of carers and the delivery of the necessary structures and supports for carers and the people for whom they care.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Resources in this budget will be targeted on helping those most in need, not alone to raise their level of income and standard of living, but to ensure everyone is a valued citizen who can make an individual contribution to society regardless of his or her circumstances.</P>
      <P>I will now outline the main provisions of the Bill. Sections 2 and 3 reaffirm the commitment to supporting pensioners and together with the Schedules to the Bill provide for increases in the rates of social welfare payments, including an increase of &euro;14 per week for persons in receipt of the old age contributory pension and for recipients of the widow&rsquo;s or widower&rsquo;s contributory pension and deserted wife&rsquo;s benefit who are over age 66 and for recipients of a retirement or invalidity pension aged 65 and over, bringing the weekly payment to &euro;193.30. Provision is also made for an increase of &euro;16 in the weekly personal rate of the old age non-contributory pension, and this increase also applies to the blind pension, widow&rsquo;s and widower&rsquo;s non-contributory pension and one-parent family payment where the recipient is aged over 66 years.</P>
      <P>In line with my particular focus on supporting carers, I have made provision for a special increase of &euro;30.20 per week for persons in receipt of the carer&rsquo;s allowance who are over age 66. A special increase of &euro;26.40 is provided for recipients of the carer&rsquo;s allowance who are under 66 years.</P>
      <P>An increase of &euro;17 per week is provided for in all other social insurance and social assistance payments where the recipient is under 66 and for recipients of an invalidity pension for those under 66. Section 2 provides for increases in the social insurance-based payments and for increases in respect of qualified adults of recipients of those payments. An increase of &euro;10.80 per week is being provided in respect of qualified adults of recipients of an invalidity pension, where the qualified adult is aged 66 years or over. An increase of &euro;10.80 per week is also being provided for qualified adults aged 66 years and over where their spouse or partner is receiving an old age contributory pension or is receiving a retirement <Col N="604"/>pension, with <i>pro rata</i> increases for those on certain reduced rates.</P>
      <P>In addition to providing for the increases in social assistance payments, section 3 provides for increases in respect of the qualified adults of those payments. For example, the weekly over 66 qualified adult allowance rate is increased by &euro;10.60 in the case of old age non-contributory pensioners and by &euro;11.30 for the qualified adults aged under 66 of blind pensioners. Proportionate increases will be applied where persons are in receipt of reduced rate qualified adult allowance payments.</P>
      <P>As I have stated, I am also conscious of the needs of other vulnerable groups in society. Accordingly, by providing for a weekly increase of &euro;17 in the personal rates of a range of payments, those in receipt of unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, one-parent family payment, supplementary welfare allowance and farm assist will receive a maximum personal weekly rate of &euro;165.80.</P>
      <P>The social welfare budget increases included in this Bill will become payable from the first pay day in January 2006. Increases for recipients of the short-term payments such as unemployment benefit assistance, disability-maternity benefit, family income supplement, farm assist and supplementary welfare allowance will be paid from the first pay day in January 2006.</P>
      <P>Recipients, both long and short term, who are paid by means of electronic funds transfer, will receive their increases from the first pay day in January 2006. Due to the lead-in times involved in the production of personal payable orders for certain long-term payments such as pensions, it will not be possible for budgetary increases to be paid immediately, in such cases, from January next. Some 211,000 recipients of, for example, widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s, one-parent family and invalidity payments, will receive their new order books in mid-February 2006. This group will receive six weeks&rsquo; arrears of their budget increase which will be included in the first order of the new book and the weekly increase will be incorporated in their normal weekly payment thereafter.</P>
      <P>Certain other long-term recipients such as old age pensioners and disability allowance recipients &mdash; some 256,000 people &mdash; will receive new pension order books at the beginning of April 2006. This group will receive a special once-off payment in mid-February representing 12 weeks of their budgetary increase. This will cover retrospection of the increase to January plus an advance payment of the increase to the end of March 2006. From the book renewal date at the end of March, the increase will be incorporated in the normal weekly payment.</P>
      <P>Section 4 provides for increases in the weekly income thresholds applied in determining entitlement to family income supplement, with effect from 5 January 2006. The new thresholds will range from &euro;465 to &euro;905 with the weekly FIS payments increasing by varying amounts from &euro;11.40 <Col N="605"/>in the case of a family with one child, to &euro;169.20 for families with eight or more children. For example, the FIS payment to a family with four children will increase by &euro;64.80 per week.</P>
      <P>Sections 5 and 6 provide for changes in PRSI. The earnings ceiling for employee&rsquo;s social insurance contributions is being increased, in section 5, by &euro;2,420 from &euro;44,180 to &euro;46,600 per annum with effect from 1 January 2006. In addition, this section provides for an increase in the limit of weekly earnings, below which PRSI is not payable, from &euro;287 to &euro;300. Section 6 provides for an increase in the income ceiling, from &euro;44,180 to &euro;46,600 for optional social insurance contributions. This section also comes into operation on 1 January 2006.</P>
      <P>Section 7 provides for an increase in the percentage of reckonable weekly earnings referred to in calculating the rate of payment under the maternity benefit scheme. This provision increases the rate from 75% to 80% and fulfils the commitment under Sustaining Progress to raise the limit to 80% of average weekly earnings during the life of the agreement. The measure will benefit the majority of recipients of the scheme and will take effect from January 2006. In addition, the section provides for the necessary amendments to extend the duration of maternity benefit, from 18 to 22 weeks, consequential on the extension of paid and unpaid maternity leave as announced in the budget last week. This measure takes effect from next March.</P>
      <P>With regard to the increases in the duration of the maternity and adoptive leave periods, my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has transmitted the heads of draft orders implementing the increases to the Attorney General for formal early drafting. Section 7 also allows for the extension of the period after birth, by two weeks to 24 weeks, within which a father can claim maternity benefit following the death of the mother, provided that he satisfies the contribution conditions of the scheme.</P>
      <P>Section 8 provides for improvements to the adoptive benefit scheme by providing that, subject to certain conditions which will be prescribed in regulations, in the event of the hospitalisation of a child in respect of whom adoptive benefit is payable, the continuous payment of benefit may be postponed. This mirrors the current provisions of the maternity benefit scheme. The section also provides for the necessary amendments to adoptive benefit consequential on the extension of paid adoptive leave by four weeks, due to take effect from March 2006. The section further provides for an increase from 75% to 80% in the percentage of reckonable weekly earnings referred to in calculating the rate of adoptive benefit. This measure will come into effect from 1 January 2006.</P>
      <P>Section 9 provides for the making of regulations to determine the manner in which gross weekly earnings are calculated for the purposes of the one-parent family payment scheme. The <Col N="606"/>introduction of the one-parent family payment in 1997 provided for payments to be made to parents rearing children alone, and subsumed the various schemes which had until then provided for families in these circumstances. Special provision was made for recipients of deserted wife&rsquo;s benefit to ensure they continued to receive payment for the duration of their continuous entitlement to the scheme, provided that the person&rsquo;s income was below a specified limit. Section 10 contains a technical amendment to the scheme to provide for the making of regulations previously associated with the scheme.</P>
      <P>Section 11 provides for the payment of the over age 80 allowance to recipients of the carer&rsquo;s allowance from January 2006. At present, for the purposes of the rent or mortgage interest supplement payable in accordance with the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, an amount of up to &euro;60 of gross income from earnings from employment may be disregarded. Section 12 contains an improvement to the scheme by providing for the disregard of up to &euro;60, together with half the gross weekly earnings between &euro;60 and &euro;90.</P>
      <P>Section 13 provides for an increase in the health levy exemption thresholds from &euro;400 to &euro;440 per week and from &euro;20,800 to &euro;22,880 per annum. This measure will take effect from 1 January 2006.</P>
      <P>This Social Welfare Bill, the first of two instalments, builds further on the progression of social inclusion measures adopted by this Government in recent years. It safeguards the living standards of those who rely on social welfare income and other supports, prioritises the allocation of resources in favour of those most in need and progresses the reform package which I have already discussed in this House. I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to a constructive debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome many of the provisions in this Bill and compliment the Minister on providing the necessary increases. It is a good budget which, I hope, will address many of the inequalities in our society that force people to live in poverty. We will have to wait to determine the impact, if any, of these increases. Before addressing specific provisions, I want to discuss the extent to which social expenditure is eliminating poverty in this country and whether this Government&rsquo;s policies are enhancing people&rsquo;s living standards and social participation. Are the policies reducing inequality in our society?</P>
      <P>To date, Ireland has had a very low rate of social expenditure, which comprises spending on health and education as well as social welfare payments because these areas also impact on people living in poverty. We have spoken in this House of studies which revealed that, out of 15 OECD countries, Ireland had the lowest net total social expenditure in 1997, after Japan, South Korea and New Zealand. I will await the opinion <Col N="607"/>of economists on how this budget can influence and, hopefully, change that situation.</P>
      <P>Given our economic growth over past years, the Government&rsquo;s low level of social expenditure is unacceptable. The gap between rich and poor has continued to grow. Income poverty particularly affects the elderly, people with disabilities, lone parents and households with no one in employment.</P>
      <P>Studies show a strong correlation between social expenditure and income inequality and that countries with higher levels of social spending tend to have lower levels of inequality. It has often been argued here that Ireland&rsquo;s good economic growth and low unemployment occurred because it has neither invested excessively in social protection nor prioritised income equality. However, competitiveness and high employment levels are not irreconcilable with higher social expenditure and greater income equality. Many high spending countries in the EU have also achieved very healthy economic indicators, such as, low unemployment, high economic growth rates, low levels of debt and strong competitiveness. That demonstrates that other countries can do it.</P>
      <P>Social expenditure benefits not only the less well-off but also impacts on the wider society and economy. Lessons are to be learned, for example, from recent events in France because we do not want to repeat the mistakes made there, which arose from the isolation of people and communities. Low levels of expenditure in one area can result in higher spending in areas such as prisons and law enforcement.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The high levels of income inequality in Ireland are first and foremost the result of an increase in the gap between the incomes of those in employment and those on benefits and pensions. In order to reduce inequality in Ireland, this gap will have to be narrowed. It is questionable whether relative poverty can be successfully and consistently prevented in systems which rely strongly on means-tested and non-indexed flat rate payments, such as Ireland&rsquo;s social security benefits.</P>
      <P>A basic prerequisite for preventing relative poverty among those outside the labour force is a linkage between benefits and payments on the one hand, and prices and wages. This would ensure that those deriving their incomes from benefits can keep up with wage earners, rather than fall behind in terms of income distribution, as has happened in Ireland. While all benefit incomes should be adjusted to ensure they keep up with increases in incomes from work, the incomes of lone parents and older people are particularly urgent priorities as these groups suffer disproportionately from income poverty. I accept that the Minister has taken steps to address that gap.</P>
      <P>Money will be required if greater equity is to be achieved. I welcome the provisions made by the Minister for Finance in the budget to deal <Col N="608"/>with tax exemptions. We need to see an assessment of the extent and impact of tax exemptions in the tax and welfare system. A value for money audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General is urgently required so we can determine what is happening. We must change the way we manage tax exemptions because some people are benefitting to an unacceptable extent. Any savings made from tax exemptions should be directed to the less well-off.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that officials from his Department and the Department of Finance and members of the Pensions Board attended a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs. Many of the questions put by committee members at that meeting were left unanswered by the officials, which is not acceptable. I have forwarded the Minister some of these questions and he has acknowledged his receipt of them. If we, as parliamentarians, cannot get answers to questions but can read the relevant information in newspapers, something is wrong. How can newspapers get information when we cannot? That issue needs to be addressed because it is not right.</P>
      <P>I welcome all the provisions of the Bill, although some could be improved upon. We always want and need more but, by addressing these issues, we will reduce the gap between rich and poor. I welcome the &euro;14 per week for people receiving old-age contributory pensions and for recipients of widow&rsquo;s or widower&rsquo;s contributory pensions or deserted wife&rsquo;s benefits who are over the age of 66. I also welcome the &euro;16 increase in the weekly personal rate of the old age non-contributory pension, blind pension, widow&rsquo;s and widower&rsquo;s non-contributory pension and the one-parent family payment.</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister to make the relevant payments directly to the qualified adult on a mandatory basis and I am disappointed he has not done so. To make it optional does not provide for independence for many women. Older women suffer particularly from poverty and that could have been dealt with. I will table an amendment to the Bill on Committee Stage and hope the Minister will be able to take it on board. It arose as an amendment in the D&aacute;il and I am not sure whether the Minister accepted it there. The National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland also requested it and sees it as a help to women in that situation.</P>
      <P>On the carer&rsquo;s allowance, 150,000 carers will receive the same amount of money &mdash;&euro;27 million &mdash; as was conceded in a betting tax cut. As we depend on carers, without whom it would cost the State much more to provide the necessary care, that figure should have been greater. While I welcome the increase in the respite grant, for many carers, particularly in Dublin and the eastern region, this would cover only one week of respite care. The budget did not address the shortage of respite beds, which must be tackled if we want to help the carers, a wonderful group of people who <Col N="609"/>must be supported in every way possible. I realise this is not in the Minister&rsquo;s remit.</P>
      <P>The family income supplement is important and I welcome the increase. I am concerned that not more people than mentioned will achieve it and that people are not aware of the supplement. We have received information that the take-up is low because people do not have the information. We have spoken on this before. Whatever the Minister can do to tell people the supplement is available is important.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I welcome the one-parent family payment, the carer&rsquo;s allowance, the supplementary welfare allowance and the child benefit changes. It is dreadful to hear, as we did in many of the pre-budget submissions and meetings, of so many children still living in poverty, not having one hot meal a day and not having a new pair of shoes or a warm coat. That is unacceptable. The benefits in this budget should help these families but, as the Minister has said, while a lot has been done there is a lot more to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and am delighted to speak on the Social Welfare Bill. I draw the Minister&rsquo;s mind back to 15 December 2004 when we discussed social welfare here and I suggested that if a person is caring for three of four children in his or her home perhaps a disregard could be introduced. I welcome that provision in the budget.</P>
      <P>We also discussed social welfare in March this year. I spoke to the Minister about child benefit, highlighting that child benefit was not recognised as something that addressed child care costs and the importance of introducing something different that would be recognised as a payment towards child care. I think the Minister agreed with this view. I compliment the Government on the introduction of the child care payment of &euro;1,000 for children under six years. It was an innovative and smart measure that will make a significant difference to the lives of many people, regardless of whether both or only one parent is working. It is a sizeable amount of money that is made payable in every quarter, and for which people can make plans. It is very welcome. This House has commented on child benefit and child care costs going back to at least the year 2000 and I am pleased they have now been heeded.</P>
      <P>The House recently discussed the phased extension of maternity leave with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, and I welcome the extension of maternity leave by four weeks. As the measure is not to be implemented until March, pregnant women whose babies are due before that may feel aggrieved that their due dates do not fit into the Minister&rsquo;s schedule. Increases in tax on petrol and alcohol used to be implemented at midnight on the night of the budget. Changes such as the extension to maternity benefit should be introduced from the day of the budget so that any<?oasys _jy ?><Col N="610"/><?oasys _fc ?>woman who goes on maternity leave from the day the budget is announced gets the benefit of those extra four weeks. Not many families are affected but it would have a substantial impact on those parents and children. They cannot change their due dates.</P>
      <P>The purpose of a child care policy is to focus on the child and the family. Anybody who has started maternity leave since the budget has another 12 or 14 weeks to go, so it would not be too difficult to extend it. Perhaps this is not possible but we should examine it. No matter how difficult it is for employers to deal with vacancies as a result of maternity leave, they would recognise the benefit of the extension to the family and the child.</P>
      <P>I will never support calls for child benefit to be taxed or means tested but given that the additional payment of &euro;1,000 for every child under the age of six years of age is a separate payment, I suggest that we look at whether it is important to means test or tax it, or the annual increases that will accrue. We could examine net pay involving situations where both people are working, one person is very well paid, child care is not the household&rsquo;s biggest cost or where child care costs can be afforded. It is easy to develop a means-testing system that recognises net pay less mortgage repayments, child care costs, transport costs and a measure of necessary disposable income as a percentage of income that reflects the differing needs and lifestyles of people with different income levels. When young families need this payment so much, it should not be eaten up because it is given to people without any measurement of need, particularly when the amount is so significant.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The child care issue we have not dealt with appropriately is support for employers. As we move into partnership discussions, we must examine supports for companies to introduce family friendly initiatives. We have committed a substantial sum over the next five years for the supply of child care places. We should take some of that money and put it into a separate grant support scheme to support organisations to put structures in place to introduce flexible hours and part-time work. A small company may not find it financially feasible to pay for a broadband connection to a worker&rsquo;s home and install a computer if all the structures are in place in their own business. By supporting such companies, however, we could eliminate the need for a place in a cr&egrave;che and a parent could work at home while caring for the child. We are using the same money, it does not cost any more, we are just looking at it differently. The Minister may not be aware of the fine reports in the <i>The Irish Times</i>, <i>Irish Examiner</i> and on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; on differing child care needs. The conclusion to all of these reports was that there is no single solution, it is a complex issue that requires joined-up thinking.</P><Col N="611"/>
      <P>No one has recognised the change in structure where the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has been given a much wider-ranging portfolio for children, with responsibility being removed from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which makes sense. The &euro;1,000 grant for children under six should form part of the Minister of State&rsquo;s budget. I also compliment the Minister for maintaining our commitment on child benefit &mdash;&euro;670 for four children per month from March will make a significant difference.</P>
      <P>Paid parental leave must form part of the partnership discussions. We are fooling ourselves if we do not recognise that parental leave at present is for those who have plenty of money who can afford to take a 14 week break from work. It is unfair on those who do not earn enough. We must introduce paid parental leave on a staggered basis, with an initial period of perhaps four weeks.</P>
      <P>This is a great budget for social welfare and the Minister should be proud of it. An increase of &euro;1.5 billion in spending on social welfare on top of a budget of &euro;12 billion is a significant contribution to the less well off and will provide the social structures we want. I welcome the increase in the income disregard for carers. I apologise for annoying the Minister by saying this repeatedly but widows and widowers, particularly widows, who are in receipt of a widow&rsquo;s pension and who are caring for someone, because of the rule about not receiving two payments from the Department of Social and Family Affairs, are losing out because the spouse is dead. There is no equity in that system. I plead with the Minister to make this a priority.</P>
      <P>Could the Minister reflect on the rent allowance system in the course of the next year? It is a scandal that we spend so much taxpayers&rsquo; money to pay private landlords in rent allowance while they make huge profits. If we took on a pilot basis 25% of the rent allowance budget and gave it to local authorities to buy houses at the best possible price, the rent paid would pay the mortgages on those houses which would then be State assets and not assets for developers and landlords making money from them. Everyone is entitled to make money but we must stop the continuing payment of vast sums of money until social housing is addressed.</P>
      <P>People said that the Minister was not happy when he was given this portfolio but he has demonstrated his commitment to it. He has introduced tremendous changes and fought hard for the increases we are giving to people. I am proud of the changes in the social welfare budget and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I have failed to find the ubiquitous Fr. Healy during the week to explain to him one of the basics of negotiation &mdash; the day a person gets <Col N="612"/>what he asks for is the day he should resign. For those of us who have dealt with Fr. Se&aacute;n this is a moment to be treasured. Much as I love him dearly, he called it wrong this time.</P>
      <P>I have spoken many times about the need to extend maternity leave and I welcomed that provision on the night of the budget. It is an important decision that has been universally greeted. We must now look at the issue of paid paternity leave. It is seldom recognised in commentary that the State requires a high birth rate so there must be pro-natal policies, even if only for self-preservation. If this will encourage people to have more children, it is good for society.</P>
      <P>From a selfish perspective, it means that if the Minister and I live long enough, there will be somebody to pay our pensions. It is for these reasons we must ensure these measures are developed.</P>
      <P>I wrote to the Minister for Finance before the budget on the question of support for blind persons and those with sight disabilities. I do not refer to the blind pension but to the fact that such persons do not have access to certain areas of support. One of these relates to car ownership. Before the introduction of the carer&rsquo;s allowance, no consideration was given, for obvious reasons, to a blind person owning a car. Now, however, blind people may have carers to drive their cars for them, but there is no support in this regard. The numbers involved are small and it would not be subject to abuse.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister give careful consideration to providing a level of support to blind persons with cars driven by their carers, similar to the support given to those with other disabilities who are able to drive themselves? This would be a helpful measure. From my discussions with concerned parties, I understand the demand would not be very high and it is only fair that it should be provided.</P>
      <P>This issue has only come onto the radar because people have more money as a consequence of the Celtic tiger. We now live in a more enlightened society where people with disabilities can contribute more and, thankfully, earn more. The only way to deal with the additional cost burden endured by blind persons who wish to use their cars is the provision of support via either carers, reductions in duty and excise or similar measures. I do not expect the Minister to get back to me on this today but I hope he is positive about developing such a system.</P>
      <P>The Minister called again, as he does every time he comes to this House, for a national debate on the future of our pensions system. On the last occasion we discussed this matter in the House, I told the Minister of my consistent support for his views on pensions for everyone. I argued that for every year worked, there should be a year&rsquo;s pension contributions. Will the Minister include this issue in next week&rsquo;s partnership discussions? Representatives of all sides will be <Col N="613"/>as difficult as each other in this regard. Nobody will be jumping up and down but the Minister should challenge everybody on this issue. There is no ethical argument that can undermine the idea of a year&rsquo;s pension contributions for a year&rsquo;s pay.</P>
      <P>A major complexity is engendered by moving in this direction, however. I have observed the Minister&rsquo;s struggles to bring people along on this issue. After we last spoke on this, I considered whether there is an easy way of approaching it. I am not sure there is but I will offer a simplistic view. One of the great difficulties is in attaining some level of complementarity between different types of pensions, including considerations of whether particular types fit in snugly with others. In this context, I considered the situation that arose in Chile after the assassination of Salvador Allende. The entire pensions system effectively collapsed through the Pinochet years and there was no fund for state pensions. As a result, a private pension scheme was developed under the aegis of the state but administered by private pension funds. Under this system, workers&rsquo; contributions are deducted on a weekly or monthly basis and placed in their personal funds. This is a concept we understand.</P>
      <P>Chilean workers are informed on an annual basis of how much their fund has increased in the preceding year and are given the names of the company and the individual fund managers looking after their pensions. Moreover, information is also given on the other six companies that manage pension funds and how they have performed in the past 12 months. Workers need only tick a box to indicate their desire to change to a different fund manager. This works very well in so far as I have described it. I do not contend that it creates a huge pension for the individual; we are all aware that pension growth is very slow. However, the Chilean authorities have at least ensured that people contribute to their own pension funds under the aegis of the state. There is a certain level of regulation and people are given, on an annual basis, the opportunity to switch to a different fund manager.</P>
      <P>How might such a system work here? If we were to start from scratch and have people make contributions on that basis, we would immediately encounter difficulties in regard to arrangements on maturity and how this scheme would relate to other pensions, PRSI and so on. The only way such a system could be implemented successfully is as some type of standalone operation with a significant disregard in the outcome of it. Workers would be attracted to such a scheme, which would grow during their years of work and in respect of which there would be a significant disregard of the earning, yield or capital arising from the pension fund.</P>
      <P>It is a system worthy of consideration. I fully support what the Minister is trying to achieve and it is all the better if he can do it internally. However, the difficulty will arise from the com<Col N="614"/>plexities it creates. Is it possible to devise a simple approach to this matter? I am interested in the Minister&rsquo;s views on this. It is a challenge he has thrown out on at least three occasions. I ask him to target the social partners one at a time in this regard. I presume he will have an opportunity to make his case when the partnership talks begin. He should put this proposal to all the parties. IBEC will have immediate objections and the ICTU, my own group, will not be far behind. I have fought within the unions to move this issue forward. Furthermore, the Government will be slow to support the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister should, however, begin by at least lobbing in the ball. If other parties choose to ignore the penalty spot and do something mad with the ball, there is nothing more to do. However, people will at least be challenged to respond and organise their arguments. Even if they ultimately decide they cannot support such measures, the Minister will have started at the leading edge to wear away some of the opposition. All parties, including the Government, employers, farmers, business, trade unions and voluntary organisations, will be forced to listen to each other. This is one of the great values of social partnership. There will be many on all sides who oppose new developments in this area and the chances are they will be rejected. However, a debate will be facilitated that has not yet taken place. It is only happening within the groups; there is no engagement between them. The time is right for such an engagement.</P>
      <P>If the social partnership process is to continue, something new must come out of the latest discussions. Some issues must be tackled, including legislative measures regarding union recognition, about which I am aware the Minister is not keen. They must be dealt with, however. The strong words the Minister used on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; during the week was a reassurance to many people who are unsure of the Government&rsquo;s objectives. We must ensure our dearly won conditions of service &mdash; at all levels, not only in regard to workers &mdash; are not eroded. Earlier in the week, I raised the idea of workers being paid &euro;2 per hour due to a &ldquo;miscommunication&rdquo;. We can deal with all these matters as we go along. I compliment the Minister on what he has done. It has been a very good budget in his area and I ask him to put some energy into the pensions debate yet again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator O&rsquo;Toole for sharing time with me. I very much welcome the changes the Minister has managed to achieve for those in his charge. The increases are very welcome. Having been obliged to deal with the Department of Social and Family Affairs and its predecessors for many years, I welcome the attitude of those officials who have worked there in recent years. There is a total change in how the people who must live on social welfare pensions are now treated. This is welcome.</P><Col N="615"/>
      <P>The increase in the income disregards is an extremely good idea. This means not only that older people can earn some more money but can also maintain an interest in something. This is extraordinarily important in allowing them to maintain some level of independent existence.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that I have been involved with lone parents for many years. I always hoped they would not have to be dependent on social welfare. Increasing the amount they can earn before they lose their benefits is an extremely good idea because it will give them a taste of independence. A great number of lone parents are very demoralised, therefore, it is important to give them independence and show them what they can do.</P>
      <P>The carer&rsquo;s allowance must also be welcomed because carers are doing a magnificent job, often to the detriment of their health, economic situation and the possibility of going back into whatever employment they had. The &euro;1,200 for respite care should have been further increased. This amount will only pay for approximately one week in a nursing home, which is not a great deal of respite for someone who is looking after a person for the whole year. It would be wonderful if this amount was doubled next year.</P>
      <P>On child poverty, the Minister was correct to address the under six age group, which is the most important grouping. All the research indicates that this is the most important time to address child poverty. Of course, much more is needed which I hope will happen next year. There has been criticism that the child benefit scheme is not means tested. I would not criticise this because one never knows how much money a mother is receiving to bring up her children. If there is a problem about means testing in the future, the Minister can decide to tax it. However, I would prefer he left it alone.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The extension in maternity leave is to be welcomed. I often cite in the House my experience of having children when there was no maternity leave. One could easily lose one&rsquo;s job if one did not get back to work after having a baby. Going back to work two days after I had my second child was not a good idea.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Toole said that we should encourage people to have more children. I agree that we should do so, not because we need them to pay tax in future but because we need someone to look after us. It will be pretty miserable if there is no one to look after us. This country now has a fertility rate of 2.1 and Italy is down to 1.6, even though it has a lot of immigrants and taking into account that Italians have large families. Italy is now starting to pay low-income women with a crisis pregnancy a considerable amount of money to encourage them to maintain the pregnancy. It reckons that at least 10% to 15% of abortions take place for economic reasons. If one examines the Crisis Pregnancy Agency reports, one will see that women who had abortions often did so for <Col N="616"/>economic reasons. This is an area the Minister might examine in the future. It could be called a fertility allowance or something like that.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to see the increases in family income support but I would like it to be publicised more. The Family Support Agency also received an increase in funding. When I worked in the Rotunda Hospital, I frequently found that people were not aware of family income support. I do not know how this happened, but social workers were constantly pointing it out to people who were more than eligible for it. It would be a help if there was more publicity about this scheme.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to reply to two matters at the end of the debate. At present an adult child can only give a parent &euro;3,000 a year as a gift, which could be extraordinarily useful, without the parent having to pay tax. I have written to the Minister for Finance on several occasions proposing an increase in this amount of money, because the child has already paid tax on it. Why could this not be done if it would help the parent to stay at home? Perhaps the parent could employ someone to help him or her. Will the Minister raise with the Minister for Finance the fact that a child can only give an elderly parent &euro;3,000 tax free, even though this money is already taxed?</P>
      <P>I spoke recently to a woman who was very annoyed. Her husband who died recently had paid PRSI. While she is currently working and paying PRSI, she thought that she would get a widow&rsquo;s pension and a pension of her own. Both of them paid PRSI, however, I am repeatedly told that people cannot receive two State pensions. As they both paid PRSI, could the Minister explain the rationale behind this? I congratulate him on all he managed to do in the budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and his officials to the House. I congratulate him warmly on his part in the budget. Like last year, he, together with the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach and the rest of the Government contributed to a significant gear shift since 1997, when the concentration was on having an efficient, dynamic economy. The accent in the past couple of years, in particular, has been on ensuring that the benefits are shared and that there is social equity and inclusion. For example, there was an article on 12 December from Mr. Tim Callan of the ESRI stating that the budget should prove to be the fairest in years.</P>
      <P>The organisation CORI used to be extraordinarily critical at budget time. After Deputy Quinn&rsquo;s last budget, CORI issued a fairly excoriating critique of it, which I felt went beyond the party line. I asked Fr. Healy if he approved of any budget in the past ten years to which he replied, &ldquo;I would need notice of that question&rdquo;. It is good that we are now in a situation where the critique refers to major progress on inclusion and significant developments on the fairness <Col N="617"/>agenda. Obviously, there is always more to be done.</P>
      <P>However, if one thinks back to 15 or 20 years ago, unemployment assistance increased by 2% or 3% and if one was lucky, these increases were paid in July. The child benefit increase announced in the budget might be paid in November. The full benefit would be paid in the following calendar year. We have moved on enormously, which is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P Just="Left">There are one or two changes which I especially like. On pensions, we have gone far beyond whether the changes reflect the rate of inflation in the past 12 months or in the 12 months to come, which was a topic of discussion under the Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition of the 1980s. Given what the Minister said, the changes are well ahead of the increase in the CPI and gross earnings over the same period. A particularly welcome measure is the special earnings disregard of &euro;100 a week for people on non-contributory pensions. It would be very difficult if it were just old people who had no means of supplementing their income without loss. For many people, the opportunity to earn something, be active and contribute to the community means a great deal. This is a most humane and enlightened measure on which I congratulate the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister dealt with the EU survey on income and living conditions in Ireland. I did not like the line carried in Independent Newspapers a few mornings ago which tried to rubbish the social side of the budget by saying that it was increasing poverty traps. It is a wonderful way of making out that the writers or the newspaper organ are concerned about those on social welfare but actually believe the Government is being too generous and that a rigorous and Spartan approach would be better if it did not increase the level of poverty.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I am not denying the reality of poverty traps. I had a debate with Deputy Healy on local radio about the question of child dependant allowance and why it had not been increased. There are two points to that question, one of principle and one of pragmatism. The pragmatic money aspect of the matter is that if a woman gets &euro;1,000 into her hand she will not worry too much about whether it is called child dependant allowance, child benefit or a supplementary allowance.</P>
      <P>The reason there ceased to be an increase in the allowance goes back to the time of an interdepartmental group established under the rainbow coalition when Proinsias De Rossa, MEP, was Minister for Social Welfare. That group was of the view that increasing child dependant allowance as opposed to other child payments contribute to poverty traps. It is not a good idea to have payments that will be promptly taken away the moment a recipient takes up work. I calculated that the &euro;1,000 payment for children under the age of six is the equivalent of a 140% increase in child dependant allowance. Those measures are <Col N="618"/>bound to have a significant impact on child poverty.</P>
      <P>I have reservations about means testing in regard to payments. Apart from anything else, means testing involves bureaucracy, it has been related to tax and was reviewed when Albert Reynolds was Minister for Finance when there was some furore about it. There is considerable merit in the making of universal payments, particularly in regard to children.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is constantly on the look-out for small anomalies where the money factor is not a significant consideration. I had representations on behalf of priests temporarily back on holidays from the missions. An administrative decision was taken they should no longer receive the old age pension when they are back here. I have been in correspondence with the Minister about that and he might consider it.</P>
      <P>A long-term unemployed young person will not receive the back to work allowance if he or she decides to improve his or her skills and go into an apprenticeship. That is an anomaly that should be addressed. It is a disincentive that should not be there and is not socially useful. Overall, however, I warmly congratulate the Minister on an excellent budget. It contains an excellent social dimension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Brennan, and his officials to the House and commend them on the effort they put into preparing this Bill. We often raise issues on this side of the House which might not be perceived to be at the level at which they are. As I have said during many debates, it is important when there is an opportunity to praise a Bill as we pass it that we should do so. I will not found wanting in that regard.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It is important that we acknowledge the increases for what they are. We need to be mindful that the country can afford to make these changes. The Minister effected real increases in a number of areas, on a number of which I will touch. Such changes mean a great deal to many people, particularly those on the margins of society who are dependent on such payments. This issue is close to the heart of the Labour Party and has been very much part of our philosophy. Various representatives of the party have been in the Department and we have always intended to effect change there. We have been endeared to this Department as a caring Department. We have always strove to ensure that people on the margins are properly looked after by the State. It is important to make that point, and I believe the Minister, Deputy Brennan, takes the same line.</P>
      <P>I wish to deal with the one-parent family payment for people who take up holiday or occasional work. The Minister made a change in this respect. The income disregard meant that people would lose their benefits if they took up occasional or holiday work. That resulted in such <Col N="619"/>people losing out and Department officials had to spend time dealing with re-applications for such benefit. That was bureaucratic, involved further administration and a cost. The Minister rightly examined this measure, weighed up the pros and cons and recognised the benefit in terms of the change he introduced is more worthwhile than allowing the <i>status quo</i> to remain. It is important to make that point.</P>
      <P>If a strict interpretative line had been taken on this measure, it would not have been helpful to the Department from a cost of point of view in terms of dealing with re-applications. Nor would it have been helpful to the applicant who would lose out on his or her payment, suffer distress because of it and bear the unnecessary burden of re-applying for the benefit. It is welcome that the Minister has dealt with this measure and I commend him on it.</P>
      <P>The duration of the carer&rsquo;s benefit is being extended by nine months. We must understand there is resistance to that from some quarters. The Minister and the Department have rightly resisted that opposition and have taken a brave decision. A recipient of the carer&rsquo;s allowance being able to work 15 hours a week may not seem significant to many people but it is important to those who can avail of such care. When one considers the vested interests in the sector which would be affected by this change, the strong lobbying power some people have and that some employers will be unhappy about the change, it must be recognised as an innovative and welcome measure taken in the face of some resistance and opposition. Such resistance might not be visible on the surface but it exists.</P>
      <P>We have a buoyant economy. In recent times we have heard the term that the country is awash with money. Once upon a time Ministers in Departments did not have money to make the changes or increases they wished to make and that led to difficulties. We had a high unemployment rate, a high level of emigration and interest rates were sky high. It was a very different economy from today. It is important to make the point that the fact that money is available means we can at least introduce real meaningful changes. Not so many budgets ago money was not available to do what needed to be done.</P>
      <P>However, we need to be mindful that the proportion of national income we spend on social protection ranks as one of the lowest in European terms. EUROSTAT 2004 data show that the EU average spend on social protection is approximately 25%. Sweden is at the top end of the scale with a spend of 31% while we, unfortunately, languish at the bottom end with a spend of 15% to 18%. While numerically that is a considerable amount, we need to be mindful that other member states rank higher than us on that scale.</P>
      <P>Equality and anti-poverty measures form the hallmark of our philosophy in this area. Reflecting on the level of Exchequer returns and <Col N="620"/>the huge economic success we have experienced, we should not forget that many people have not been brought along with the rising tide and, therefore, have not benefited in the same way as others. For example, extremely rich people benefited from tax breaks in recent times but we need to be clear about the fact that many people on the margins did not share in our economic prosperity. Such people have every right to share in it. We should not allow just one section of the community to benefit from tax incentive schemes which are designed to advance projects like hotels and nursing homes. Other members of the community &mdash; I refer to the ordinary customers of the Department of Social and Family Affairs &mdash; should be assisted too.</P>
      <P>A great deal of change continues to be required in the administration of social welfare schemes. Women are sometimes not treated equally by the Department of Social and Family Affairs. The mindset of departmental officials, who tend to assume that the main breadwinner in a family unit is always male, needs to change dramatically. Gender equality demands that women should have equal access to opportunities not only in the jobs market, but also in this area. It is very important that the point I have made should be taken on board. The participation of women in employment is a key factor in eliminating child poverty. We need to bear in mind that of all household types, households with lone parents are at the highest risk of falling into the poverty trap. The social welfare code needs to be changed to reflect greater equality. We need equality for everyone, rather than just for people in one sector of the community.</P>
      <P>I would like to conclude by raising two issues. A man in his mid-20s in my locality who recently applied for an allowance under the important and innovative back to education scheme when he was starting a postgraduate course in UCC found that he was disqualified, in administrative terms, after the course title was changed. He was trying to better himself and promote himself by returning to university to acquire another skill. The Exchequer receives a return from such people when they return to the workforce and pay tax at the higher rate. The man in question was distressed to learn that the change in the course title meant he did not qualify for the back to education scheme. It made the difference between him being able to take the course and him not being able to do so. I communicated the details of the case to the Department of Social and Family Affairs, which made the necessary changes, thankfully, to ensure that the man now qualifies for the scheme. The Department&rsquo;s intervention has made a huge difference to the individual in question. I thank the departmental officials for the interest they showed in the case. It is right that the application was dealt with by the Department in such a manner because it was beyond the control of the student.</P><Col N="621"/>
      <P>I spoke about disability benefit and disability allowance the last time the Minister, Deputy Brennan, was in the House. I do not think the case I wish to raise is unique or rare because it is likely there are many other such cases throughout the country. The case in question involves an individual who suffers from chronic depression, to the extent that he cannot leave his home. He is receiving good care and protection from his family, he is on good medication and he has a good general practitioner. When he was ready to come back out and beat the illness in question, he applied for disability allowance and disability benefit, only to find that he qualified for neither. He appealed that decision, by which time he had recovered sufficiently from his medical condition.</P>
      <P>In the course of the appeal the man in question was seen by a doctor from the Department who could have been more Christian in dealing with the applicant, who felt aggrieved about the manner in which he was treated. It is important to remember every now and then that it does not cost anything to be nice. The doctor in question should have used some sensitivity and discretion, which are required in some circumstances in dealing with applicants. The doctor rejected the man&rsquo;s appeal on the basis that he had recovered because he looked well and seemed fine. The matter is now being dealt with at a further level. I have raised this case with the Department of Social and Family Affairs, with the appeals office and in the House.</P>
      <P>We need to be very careful in instances like the one I have raised. The man in question was genuinely ill. He was certified as suffering from a horrible illness and he had medical documentation to support that. The manner in which the rules and regulations of the Department of Social and Family Affairs were applied as he made his case within the system ensured that he was kept out of the loop, which is not ideal.</P>
      <P>We need to be very careful about the nature of the dreadful illness in question. The man had to be helped to apply for the schemes, but he now feels vilified as he deals with rejection. It was not very nice for him to have such an experience after he had beaten an illness of this nature. I appreciate that there is an issue in terms of contributions &mdash; the man in question might qualify in January. If the Department is to be caring in its dealings with people who are suffering from an illness or left out of the loop, changes need to be made so that people like the man in question are provided for.</P>
      <P>I accept there is a need for checks and balances to ensure that the system is not abused, but we need to be more humane in how we deal with certain cases. The Department&rsquo;s doctor did not treat the applicant in this instance in a very good manner. I hope something can be done to ensure that people who suffer from an illness like depression are not rejected by an arm of the State when they try to avail of the system. The manner <Col N="622"/>in which the man in question was dealt with was not ideal.</P>
      <P>I welcome the increases which are provided for in this Bill. It is important, in a parliamentary democracy, that we meet our duty to admit that a good deal is being offered and that the increases are meaningful. I would like to see much more, however. There is an ongoing political debate about the other areas in which change can be effected. Many people will be better off as a result of this legislation.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and his officials for the time and effort they have put into the compilation of this Bill. It is worthwhile to note that the Minister has taken on board some of the points which were made in previous debates in this House, the result of which is reflected in this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Every budget belongs to the people, but this budget can particularly be described as the people&rsquo;s budget because it provides for substantial social policy reforms, which are being enacted in the Social Welfare Bill 2005. It can be described as a family budget because it offers significant increases to the elderly, people on benefit and people in receipt of child care payments. As a result of this budget, a family with three children, one of whom is under the age of six, will receive approximately &euro;6,000 in child benefit each year. By contrast, the average income in Poland is approximately &euro;5,500, or just &euro;3,700 after tax. It is natural that one cannot compare the levels of purchasing power in Poland and Ireland, but this country is a beacon for countries like Poland. I am not surprised that these measures have been introduced by a Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government.</P>
      <P>I am proud of the significant changes which have been made in the area of child care, such as the decision to make an annual payment of &euro;1,000 in respect of each child under the age of six. Child benefit payments have been increased and an additional 50,000 child care places will be provided. The parents of this country&rsquo;s 350,000 children under the age of six will benefit from direct financial support of over &euro;50 per week. The delivery of quality child care will be boosted by improved training arrangements. Some 17,000 child care workers will be trained every five years. When I finished second level education in the late 1970s and started to work in the 1980s, I never thought this country would ever be in a position to provide such benefits. It is said that the past is a different country, but in this instance it is a different world.</P>
      <P>A new package of measures worth &euro;150 million is being introduced to improve the care of the elderly. Under the new home care packages which are being put in place, the provision of home help support, day care assistance and palliative care will increase substantially. The weekly rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance in respect of people aged 66 or over will be increased from &euro;169.80 to &euro;200. <Col N="623"/>The weekly rate in respect of those under the age of 66 will be increased by &euro;27 to &euro;180. The respite care grant payment will be increased by &euro;200 to &euro;1,200. The changes made in the budget are so significant that every party in the House should lay claim to them as a national achievement. I am particularly proud of them. The weekly old age pension rate will increase by &euro;14 in 2006, to over &euro;193. The contributory old age pension has increased by 93% since 1997.</P>
      <P>Also of benefit to older people is the increase in the rate of fuel allowance from &euro;9 to &euro;14 per week. The fuel allowance has been supplemented by the reduction in the rate of tax payable on kerosene and gas, again assisting people in conjunction with the reduction in prices at the pumps. These are three whammies for those depending on fuel. It will be a significant and ongoing benefit.</P>
      <P>The non-contributory pension has been increased by &euro;16 bringing the rate to &euro;182. As many non-contributory pensioners want to work beyond retirement age but are prevented from doing so because of the means test, the non-contributory pension is being changed in order that earnings from employment of up to &euro;100 per week will be disregarded for means test purposes.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In addition to increases in pensions, fuel allowance, child benefit, and carer's allowance there is a package for child poverty. The earnings threshold for family income supplement, which provides cash support for workers on low earnings, has been significantly increased by amounts ranging from &euro;19, bringing the rate to &euro;282 per week and targeted, in particular, at larger families. There is a new drive to increase opportunities for lone parents. The upper earning limit income for the one-parent family payment has been substantially increased by &euro;82 per week to a new limit of &euro;375. Of the 80,000 lone parents in receipt of the payment, it is estimated that 60% are in full or part-time employment. I have a particular interest here because when so much is given it is important to look at the few areas we need to improve on.</P>
      <P>Education is the key at all times. We need to ensure that lone parents, through the child care system and the welfare system, can upskill and play an even greater role in society. On top of the generous increases there are new enhanced support schemes that promote activation and opportunities and choices to welfare recipients, in particular the unemployed, so as to ensure that the potential contribution of each and every individual is recognised and not neglected.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his efforts. The changes introduced make this an excellent budget. As I said earlier, it is the people&rsquo;s budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and welcome in broad terms his budgetary proposals. In the Budget Statement in the other House last week the Minister for Finance, Deputy <Col N="624"/>Cowen, indicated that in future years he would like to set down some formula whereby, well in advance of the budget, there would be a broad debate across and between the parties on the various options open to Government. If that transpires to be the case it would be a positive move.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Department of Social and Family Affairs and its planning for annual changes by way of budgetary increases, it would be helpful if there was a debate at the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs and a debate between the Minister and the various Opposition spokespersons on social and family affairs on the many issues addressed each year in the budget from the point of view of social welfare entitlements. On most of these issues there is no difference of opinion between the parties but there are many anomalies that require to be resolved year in year out and sometimes we do not get around to them. More dialogue between the parties in advance of the Minister&rsquo;s annual statement each year would help resolve some of the issues.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Minister&rsquo;s earlier statement and the budget announcements on social welfare, obviously the increases have to be welcomed. We are speaking of social welfare expenditure of almost &euro;14 billion but in the context of the national budgetary situation those who depend on social welfare entitlements and, in particular, the elderly, on whose labours this country was built, deserve every euro awarded to them. We welcome the increases but as one would expect there are areas where we had hoped for further provision.</P>
      <P>Down the years there was always a debate on the timing of payment of increases. Admittedly, the Budget Statement was in January and some increases were paid in June and July and sometimes later. I note that the payment of increases is more streamlined. However, I read in the documentation received last week that some of the increases take effect in January, which is welcome, while the increased payments for other schemes will run from February to June in some cases. In the course of the next few years we should aspire to streamline the increases and ensure that whatever increases are granted on the social welfare front would be paid simultaneously, if only from the point of view of avoiding confusion. In the long run most of these increases taking effect in March, April, May or June will be backdated. It would be a positive move if they could be introduced in a more streamlined fashion.</P>
      <P>The main topic of conversation arising from the budget was the improvements provided to child benefit and child care and at the other end of the age spectrum the elderly. I have spoken here, on many occasions, and elsewhere on the issue of the carer&rsquo;s allowance. I welcome the recognition the Minister has given it by ensuring that from an individual perspective the carer&rsquo;s allowance is the social welfare scheme that provides the largest rate of payment. That is as it should be. I appeal <Col N="625"/>to the Minister to give serious consideration to examining the means testing of the carer&rsquo;s allowance payment. I concede the income disregard has increased substantially and that will allow the carer&rsquo;s allowance to be paid to a greater number of people.</P>
      <P>However, the care of thousands of elderly could be transformed if the means test was abolished for carer&rsquo;s allowance. As a society we should aspire, from a public policy perspective, to have the maximum possible number of people looked after for as long as possible in their own home. The carer&rsquo;s allowance plays a key role in that regard and I welcome the improvements wholeheartedly. Nevertheless, while the means test continues to exist there will be many who will not qualify.</P>
      <P>We could have the same debate about child benefit and whether it should have been means tested when it was introduced 40, 50 or 80 years ago. Thankfully, it was not and will not be means tested. At the other end of the age spectrum we recognise the importance of helping the elderly to remain in their own community. If the Minister was to abolish the means test for carer&rsquo;s allowance he would leave a marvellous legacy in terms of his period as Minister. During the course of the next few months I ask him to set up a task force or review group to look at that issue. The cost benefit analysis shows that removal of the means test would lead to a dramatic increase in the numbers obtaining carer&rsquo;s allowance. That would be an excellent move for the elderly in our society.</P>
      <P>Senator McCarthy spoke about a particular care in his constituency on disability allowance and the difficulties arising with the application procedure. I wish to raise a similar type case but in a sense it is unfair to draw individual cases to the Minister&rsquo;s attention. I have one particular case in my constituency of a man in his early 20s who, because of a phobia or some type of depression, is unwilling to leave his own house. He is so fearful of leaving his own house that he physically will not do so. He cannot be considered for a disability allowance because he cannot turn up for the medical examination.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>It is clear that on medical grounds the young man in question is unable to work and will possibly remain so for the rest of his life. That is tragic. From the point of view of the family&rsquo;s finances a disability allowance should be awarded and would certainly be awarded on means grounds. On the basis that he is unable to turn up for the medical examination he is being refused the allowance. I would be grateful if the Minister should look at cases such as this where a person cannot physically attend at a medical centre for a medical examination or consider putting some other system in place. Perhaps I might be permitted to bring the individual case to the Minister&rsquo;s attention for his consideration in the next day or so.</P><Col N="626"/>
      <P>Sometimes daft suggestions are made in this House and perhaps the Minister will include the one I am about to make on his list of strange ideas. However, quite a few elderly people have told me that they dislike the term &ldquo;old age pension&rdquo; and believe it is something that should be reviewed.</P>
      <P>When the old age pension was introduced in the early part of the last century we had a very different concept of what it meant to be elderly and of the constraints on older people. Old age meant something very different 100 years ago. People at 65 or 66 are described as old age contributory or non-contributory pensioners but in many cases they are beginning a new phase of life. They are very active, fit and involved in their communities and they certainly would not classify themselves as being old. Perhaps the Minister might reflect on a new title for that pension, although it has served the country well for over 100 years. We have a so-called retirement pension for a certain category of people but perhaps we could have a &ldquo;senior citizen&rsquo;s pension&rdquo; or some other term, which would be a variation on the original theme. The term &ldquo;old age&rdquo; is one that should be reviewed, as it is a little outdated.</P>
      <P>However, notwithstanding the title, I welcome the increase in the old age pension and the other increases for the elderly contained in the budget. Those increases are deserved because the elderly are the people who made this country. We speak of the Celtic tiger and of how the world has changed since 1987 but were it not for the contribution made by those who now qualify for social welfare pensions, our country would be a much poorer place, economically and socially. Every cent and euro spent on the elderly in our community through the budget is a way of returning to them what they have given us, tenfold, over the generations. We need more of the same recipe from all future Ministers for Social and Family Affairs. I am thankful for what the current Minister has been able to do and hope he will take on board some of the suggestions he has heard from this side of the House and work on them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KateWalsh"><NameTxt>Ms K. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I also add my voice to the welcome. I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the Second Stage debate on the Social Welfare Bill.</P>
      <P>As we all know, money is not everything but for some families, particularly at this time of the year, it can dominate their thoughts and wishes. That is a great source of worry for me. In last week&rsquo;s budget, we received details of a &euro;1.12 billion social welfare package. This is a tremendous amount of money and the Government must <Col N="627"/>be commended for holding firm to its commitment to help the most vulnerable. It has long been argued by the Progressive Democrats that we do not want economic progress for its own sake. We want to use the fruits of progress to help those in need and in trouble and we are working in Government to do just that. It is hard to believe that social welfare expenditure in 2006 is expected to be more than &euro;13.5 billion. That is double what was spent in 2002 and is proof that our policies are working and are correct.</P>
      <P>The Bill before us is the first of two legislative instruments needed to implement the impressive social welfare package to which I referred earlier. Sections 2 and 3 are of particular interest to me as they deal with support for pensioners. Along with the Schedule to the Bill, these sections provide for increases in the rates of social welfare payments, including the &euro;14 per week increase for those in receipt of old age contributory pensions, increases for recipients of widow&rsquo;s or widower&rsquo;s contributory pensions, deserted wives&rsquo; benefits for those aged over 66 and retirement and invalidity pensions for those aged 65 and over. These pension increases will bring weekly payments to &euro;193.30 and I commend the Government for these developments.</P>
      <P>Much debate on carers followed the publication of the budget. The Bill reflects the determination of the Government, and the T&aacute;naiste in particular, to support carers. The legislation provides for a special increase of &euro;30.20 per week for those in receipt of the carer&rsquo;s allowance aged 66 or over, while an increase of &euro;26.40 is provided for those under 66. I welcome this section and commend the Bill to this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonLydon"><NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House. He always makes an impact when he comes here and on a previous occasion, he gained the everlasting admiration of 99.9% of Senators present.</P>
      <P>The projected figure for spending on social welfare next year of &euro;13.5 billion is one which I cannot even imagine. It is a phenomenal amount of money. Some have said that money would be available no matter who was in Government but I do not believe that for a second. As Senator Walsh has just said, good planning and good government contributes to the coffers, as do good taxation policies.</P>
      <P>The Minister has a lot of money to spend in his Department. Having read the budget, the Minister&rsquo;s speech and the Social Welfare Bill, I believe the Minister has managed to spend that money wisely. He has used the money at his disposal to help the greatest number of people possible. Anybody can pick a hole in a Bill such as this and ask why the Minister did not help person X more, but he has to divide the money as best he can. I am pleased the Minister has placed special emphasis on the elderly and made a point of doing so.</P><Col N="628"/>
      <P>As I said in last night&rsquo;s debate on the same subject, if one gets up in the morning to find a baby on one&rsquo;s doorstep, one will mind it, care for it or have it adopted. However, if it is an old person on one&rsquo;s doorstep, one is not so keen to help. Thousands of elderly people have been abandoned by their families and are living alone with nobody to mind them. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul does a great job in that regard, but these people need as much help from the State as they can get. These are people who have put their lives into this State, as the Minister said in his speech. It does not matter what job they had, they have all done something, whether it be caring in the home, raising a family or working here and abroad. All of them have given something for 60 or 65 years. They are entitled to something back and the Minister has done his best in that regard in this budget.</P>
      <P>The raising of the limits for the old age contributory and non-contributory pension is welcome. So too is the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to giving people a decent pension. Other aspects, including alleviating poverty, increasing fuel allowances and so forth, are very important. If one is not poor or old, one does not realise what such a life is like. However, I visit some of these people and every increase they get from the Minister is much appreciated. We would like to give everybody &euro;1,000 per week but that is not possible or practical. However, the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to increase the pension to &euro;200 per week is a laudable one and we are almost there. I believe the pension will reach that figure under the Minister&rsquo;s tenure.</P>
      <P>The Minister has often spoken of his commitment to decent pensions. However, people should not have to retire at 65 and the Government is coming around to this point of view. I have seen many people who have had to retire at 65, policemen have to do so at 57, despite their enormous talent and a lifetime of experience and expertise. They turn 65 and the following day they have no job. They get a pension, retire, travel around and so forth but their expertise is lost to the State.</P>
      <P>There is so much talent that could be tapped into. People who were engineers, teachers and so on, have learned something and their expertise does not disappear just because they have reached a certain age. The idea, introduced by a German emperor some time ago when life expectancy was very poor, that we should retire at a certain age has been pooh-poohed. If one looks at the number of people who have got on in life and succeeded, one will find that as they grew older, their faculties did not diminish. Judges do not have to retire until they are 75 though some seem to have retired earlier. The Minister should consider availing of the talent that people have even as they pass the age of 65 years.</P>
      <P>I do not want to speak for very long for two reasons. First, the Bill is flawless and I compli<Col N="629"/>ment the Minister on it. Second, I have a good lunch waiting and it would be wrong to delay it further. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I will not detain the Senators for too long. I thank Senators for responding to my request for a constructive debate and I value being in Seanad &Eacute;ireann to listen to the discussions. I formed the view when I started this job that if I wanted experts in social welfare I needed not look much further than Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, Seanad &Eacute;ireann and councillors, because public representatives have a special knowledge of this area. With all due respect to my experts and my own experience the amount of expertise they offer is staggering.</P>
      <P>The budget the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, and I announced last week reflects what was said in this House. During last year&rsquo;s debates here, in the D&aacute;il and in meetings of my parliamentary party I took copious notes. I read them this morning and found that we managed to include in the budget not all but most of what was raised. It is a cheap source of advice for me and I wish to acknowledge it because I take Senators&rsquo; contributions seriously. There are many research and study groups which are valuable and bring a professional overlay to the process but I enjoy hearing Senators and Deputies raise individual cases from their clinics from which I can extrapolate a policy position.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senator Terry asked about the percentage of GDP we spend on social services. I will not go into detail now but there are half a dozen reasons the gap between Ireland and the higher spenders is more apparent than real, when a number of factors are taken into account. We spend a third of all taxpayers&rsquo; funds on just one Department, my own. If the spend on the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science is included the total is 90% on just three Departments. We keep approximately 10% for everything else so anybody who says this country does not invest in social services is wrong. That money comes from the taxpayer. I have never regarded it as Government money, party money or the Cabinet&rsquo;s money so the taxpayer has made a significant investment in this area.</P>
      <P>Senator Terry also spoke about high relative poverty. I will not start a debate now but I am unimpressed by that measure. The finding that 20% of Irish people are in poverty is not reality. The consistent poverty measure, which is approximately 6.8%, is much more sensible. We need to be careful about somewhat academic measures of poverty, some of which are from the EU. They are valuable as a contribution to the <Col N="630"/>discussion but I must focus resources on 5% or 6% of people, not 20%.</P>
      <P>The Senator also referred to questions submitted to my Department but not dealt with. I will examine that because it should not be the case. She and Senator Henry, among others, complimented our officials for being more than helpful and supportive, which has always been the approach. All officials approach every case on the basis of trying to find a solution to a problem rather than bureaucratically saying something is not possible, as may have been the case some years ago. I will take the cases up if she gives me more information on them.</P>
      <P>Senator Terry also asked about qualified adult allowances being paid directly and expressed disappointment it was not in the budget. I deal with structural and financial issues in the budget so it does not have to be included. I am reviewing the situation and have had a number of meetings with the Department, from which a number of issues arose. For example, it would mean paying 70% of an allowance directly to the woman. It is voluntary at the moment and is available if people want to take it up but very few have done so. There may be different reasons for it but there is a good case for mandatorily paying it separately, which I will pursue once the budget and the social welfare Bills are completed.</P>
      <P>The Senator also called for a greater take-up of family income supplement, FIS, and she is right. The take-up last year was disappointing and a major campaign is planned to improve it. We have changed its criteria this year to benefit larger families, which will make a huge difference. A family with two children can receive up to &euro;3,900. A family with two children under six and earnings of &euro;20,000 would get a further &euro;3,900, bringing their total child support to &euro;9,500, which is significant and well-targeted. She also raised the question of carers, which I acknowledge.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go through what all the Senators mentioned but will reply to those still in the House. Senator Kate Walsh also talked about carers. The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children and I have been working hard on the care for the elderly package. We discussed the Mercer report and we will discuss further changes in Cabinet in January. The T&aacute;naiste introduced an excellent &euro;150 million package recently and we discussed on many occasions how the support for carers from my Department can be co-ordinated with support for the elderly from hers, to produce joined-up thinking. It is critical we work together.</P>
      <P>Senator Lydon also mentioned the elderly and complimented the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. I learn a lot from organisations like that. They knock on as many as 800,000 or 900,000 doors every year and when they tell me about problems that exist I must listen. I echo the Senator&rsquo;s compliments to that and similar organisations.</P><Col N="631"/>
      <P Just="Left">The budget makes good structural reforms for the benefit of the elderly. Senator Mansergh made a particularly relevant point and I wanted to make sure that when people reach 66 and qualify for a pension they should not be suddenly told they cannot work any more. Accordingly, I have introduced a large disregard which effectively allows them to take up employment, perhaps on a part-time basis, because it is daft to tell people over 66 years old they must stay at home on a pension or have the pension taken away from them if they earn more than &euro;7. That is not good social policy.</P>
      <P>I have listened carefully to what Senators have said. I am particularly excited about this budget and the changes in it, not so much with regard to the &euro;800 million for improving the cashflow of so many people, valuable as that is, as the &euro;300 million which has gone into structural reforms and activation to move people from welfare dependency to financial independence. It liberates lone parents to earn more money before we touch their income. It also allows pensioners earn more money before we touch their income, lets carers earn more money and makes the carer&rsquo;s payment the highest in the land. Those are the sorts of matters we are activating and the structural reforms we are creating. Similarly, we are allowing people to hold on to the disability allowance while being retrained and perhaps receiving additional education, and finding new ways of earning some funds.</P>
      <P>I am particularly excited about one aspect, on which most Senators commented. For that I thank them. At the core of this budget is something I have been working on all year, namely, getting behind the payments to tackle the social issue beyond them. It is not just a question of making the payment. We will make it, but more importantly we deal with the issue behind it. We move people to better places so that welfare is an active rather than a passive mechanism, locking people in poverty traps. I am thrilled that we have managed to get that philosophy into the heart of this social welfare budget and I thank all sides of the House for that.</P>
      <P>I have learned so much from listening to so many people on all sides of the House, and in the D&aacute;il, in the past year. The budget was nearly written for me when I looked through the notes I had taken from the debates. I thank the Senators and commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>At the outset I remind the House of the circumstances which give rise to the motion which is before it. In November 2002, an RTE &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; documentary reported on child sexual abuse by priests in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin. The programme made a number of disturbing assertions as to the inadequate way in which allegations and complaints of sexual abuse of children by priests of the archdiocese were handled, for example, that the priests in question were simply moved to another position without persons being informed of the reasons for the move.</P>
      <P>It is universally recognised that child sexual abuse is not only morally reprehensible but also a particularly serious crime. It is my duty, and that of the Government and the Oireachtas, to <Col N="633"/>protect the most vulnerable members of our community who cannot protect themselves and this applies with particular force to our children. Child sexual abuse is associated with a range of adverse long-term effects such as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and relationship problems. Characteristics of the abuse suffered, such as the type of abusive act, the duration of the abuse and the degree of physical or psychological force used, influence the severity of its effects. These effects extend well beyond the abused individual and can have a significant impact on secondary victims such as family members of the abused and the abuser. Furthermore, parents of sexually abused children also feel guilty because of a perceived failure to protect the child. It is also the case that where child sexual abuse is perpetrated by an authority figure such as a clergyman, its impact on the victim can have additional consequences such as alienation and a loss of faith, both faith in people and religious faith.</P>
      <P>In addition to the grave psychological damage which such abuse can cause, the criminal offences involved are of the utmost gravity. It is important to emphasise that complaints of sexual abuse are fully investigated by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that all efforts are made to bring the perpetrators to justice. A significant number of clerical perpetrators of sexual abuse have been convicted following Garda investigations and many of them have served, or are serving, custodial sentences. Irrespective of any form of investigation that might be undertaken, it is a priority that every effort is made to ensure that anyone who has engaged in criminal behaviour of this type is brought to justice.</P>
      <P Just="Left"><?oasys _dc14- ?>In light of the disclosures in the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme and elsewhere, I announced my intention to introduce legislation for a new procedure which would, among other issues, enable a detailed and focused investigation into how church and other authorities dealt with allegations of child sexual abuse by clergy and religious. I subsequently introduced the Commissions of Investigation Bill 2003 and the Commissions of Investigation Act was enacted by both Houses and signed into law by the President in July 2004.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
      <P Just="Left">A significant further development was the establishment in March 2003 of the non-statutory Ferns inquiry into the nature of the response to allegations of child sexual abuse by priests operating under the aegis of the Diocese of Ferns. The inquiry&rsquo;s report, which was presented to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children on 25 October 2005 by Mr. Justice Francis D. Murphy and his colleagues, contains a number of very valuable recommendations.</P>
      <P>Under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, a commission of investigation may be established by the Government, based on a proposal by a Minister, with the approval of the Minister for Finance, to investigate any matter considered by the Government to be of significant public <Col N="634"/>concern. An issue giving rise to significant public concern is one that is of more than mere interest to the public or the subject of vigorous political debate. It must be an issue which has profound implications for life in our society.</P>
      <P>Both the Government and myself are satisfied that an investigation into the handling of child sex abuse allegations against the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin comes within that category. The very sensitive nature of the subject and the need to ensure the fullest confidence in, and compliance with, the investigation means that a commission, backed up by the statutory powers available to it under the 2004 Act, is the appropriate vehicle for investigating the matter.</P>
      <P>It would not be appropriate for the Garda to investigate this matter as it is the handling of complaints or allegations of child sexual abuse, rather than allegations of abuse themselves, which are being investigated and this would involve matters which might not in themselves have been criminal offences. In addition, in investigating the handling of complaints or allegations, it may well be that the handling of complaints made to the Garda might itself require investigation. For all those reasons, the Government is of the view that the establishment of a commission is required.</P>
      <P><?oasys _dc14- ?>The report of the Ferns inquiry made a series of recommendations with regard to lessons which could usefully be learned from how such complaints or allegations were handled in the past, and which will result in improved child protection. The inquiry&rsquo;s view was that the recommendation of the 1996 report of the Irish Catholic bishops&rsquo; advisory committee on child sexual abuse by priests and religious entitled Child Sexual Abuse: Framework for a Church Response on the reporting of child sexual abuse is one of the most important and has had the most impact on the church&rsquo;s handling of this problem in the past nine years.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
      <P Just="Left">In regard to the procedure of holding regular high level meetings between the Diocese of Ferns, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Health Service Executive, the interagency review committee, the inquiry saw this as having considerable merits and was of the view that the procedure should and could be adopted in any case in which continuing problems in relation to child sexual abuse were found. On 25 October, the Government accepted in principle the recommendations in the Ferns Report and gave a commitment to their implementation by line Departments and relevant agencies. The Government also authorised the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to write to the Irish bishops&rsquo; conference to ask it to ensure individual and collective compliance with the inquiry&rsquo;s recommendations and to request the Health Service Executive to liaise with individual bishops to ensure implementation of the recommendations. The Minister of State consequently wrote to the president of the bishops&rsquo; conference and the <Col N="635"/>Health Service Executive on 26 October, with particular emphasis on the 1996 guidelines and the interagency review committee.</P>
      <P>By pursuing the position on implementation by the church of its guidelines, the State is not handing over responsibility in this matter. Members of the clergy, like all residents of the State, are subject to criminal law and answerable before the courts. Furthermore, the State has developed national guidelines for the protection and welfare of children, Children First, and monitors their implementation on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>As a further step in ensuring compliance with the inquiry&rsquo;s recommendations, the commission should undertake two further tasks in addition to investigating the Archdiocese of Dublin. First, following a notification by the Minister for Health and Children that a specific diocese may not have established the structures or may not be operating satisfactorily the procedures set out in church guidelines &mdash; whether the 1996 guidelines or any subsequent ones &mdash; the commission of investigation should examine the position in that diocese. Second, following a notification by the Minister for Health and Children that a specific diocese may not be implementing satisfactorily the recommendations of the Ferns Report, the commission should examine the position in that diocese.</P>
      <P>The motion before the House is a necessary prerequisite to the establishment of the commission. The motion seeks approval of the draft Government order providing for the establishment of a commission of investigation into two matters, first, the handling of allegations of child sexual abuse against clergy operating under the aegis of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin and, second, the examination of the implementation of church guidelines or the recommendations of the Ferns Report in a particular diocese, if the Minister for Health and Children requests the commission to do so. The draft order contains a schedule setting out a statement of reasons for establishing the commission, as required by the Commissions of Investigation Act. A similar motion has been brought and approved in the other House.</P>
      <P>The draft order sets out the terms of reference for the commission. I have circulated them to the Members of the House but I will not read them in detail as time is limited. I wish to draw the attention of Senators to a number of points about these terms of reference. They have been developed following a process of consultation with representatives of the victims and with the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin. In this context, I welcome the undertaking by Archbishop Martin that the archdiocese will fully co-operate with the investigation.</P>
      <P>The commission will investigate the handling of two categories of cases in the Archdiocese of Dublin. First, it will investigate the handling of cases where specific complaints or allegations <Col N="636"/>were made. Second, it will investigate the handling of cases where, while there were not complaints or allegations, there was knowledge or strong and clear suspicion or reasonable concern around sexual abuse.</P>
      <P>The commission will cover a specific period &mdash; from 1 January 1975 to 1 May 2004. While I am aware arguments exist for having a longer period of time specified, I believe it is a more productive use of the resources available to proceed in this way. It was suggested in the other House yesterday that perhaps the commission should look at cases from the 1930s up to the 1960s, in addition to the specified period. It was also urged that an inquiry should take place in every diocese in the country. If we were to do it that way, I estimate that it would take a century of investigation or else I would have to set up 20 commissions of inquiry that would have to sit for five years to achieve the same result. We must be practical in all of this. It would be possible to give the commission an open-ended remit &mdash; or to require it to look at every diocese in the State &mdash; but that would make it impossible for it to complete its work within a reasonable timeframe. In addition, the further back in time one goes, while it would be interesting from an historical point of view, the more fragmentary would be the records and recollections on the handling of cases by the archdiocese and consequently the more difficult the task of investigation. The most important task is to draw lessons from the mistakes of the past so as to ensure that nothing similar happens again.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference specify that a representative sample of cases will be examined. The important word here is &ldquo;representative&rdquo;. It will be incumbent on the commission to examine the cases which come to its attention, whether through an examination of documents and records it discovers or as a result of advertising for persons to approach it and, having examined these cases, choose a sample which is representative of that material. The terms of reference specify that where a case is among the representative sample, all complaints and allegations by that complainant are also examined. Nobody will find that only one aspect of what happened to them is being examined, the matter will be dealt with in the whole.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the terms of reference specify that all complaints and allegations against an alleged perpetrator named in a complaint or allegation being investigated will also be investigated. The situation will not arise whereby one will have a detailed report of one alleged action by a perpetrator and for some reason the rest of the person&rsquo;s history is excluded. Perpetrators will also be examined in the whole. How the commission will choose the representative sample will be a matter for it to decide, and it will do so on the basis of expert advice.</P>
      <P>With regard to the length of time the commission will take, the Government agreed that it would submit a final report to me in not more <Col N="637"/>than 18 months. However, I am mindful of the fact that the obligation on the commission under section 32(4) of the Act is to endeavour to submit its report within the specified time period. As the sponsoring Minister I have the right to extend the time if that were necessary. I place a high importance on the independence and expertise required of a member of the commission.</P>
      <P>The powers and duties vested in a commission include the duty to caution witnesses, to compel witnesses to answer questions, to establish rules and procedures in regard to evidence and submissions, to adjudicate in regard to matters of privilege and to conduct the investigation. All have the potential to intrude into well established legal rights. For this reason I propose that an eminent judge with considerable experience of the criminal law be appointed as the chair of the commission. I am pleased to inform the House that Judge Yvonne Murphy of the Circuit Court has indicated that she will accept the appointment. I have already discussed the proposed terms of reference with her, and she is happy to accept the position on that basis. In approving these terms of reference the Government was conscious of the obligation imposed by section 5 of the Act on those framing the terms of reference, namely, that they specify to the extent possible the events, activities, circumstances, systems, practices or procedures to be investigated.</P>
      <P>In addition, I am obliged as soon as possible after the terms of reference are set formally to prepare an accompanying statement containing an estimate of the costs of the commission and the length of time it will take. The costs of the commission will reflect the amount of work involved to fulfil the terms of reference, the number and levels of staff deployed, the duration of the commission and other administrative costs. This will be published as soon as possible after the terms of reference are set, in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i> and such other publications, as I as Minister consider appropriate.</P>
      <P>The draft order also specifies that I am responsible for overseeing the administrative matters relating to the establishment of the commission, for receiving its reports and performing any other functions accorded to the overseeing Minister by the Act. One such function is the obligation to prepare general guidelines. Once the commission has been formally established I am required, in consultation with the Minister for Finance and the commission itself, to prepare general guidelines concerning the payment by my Department of legal costs necessarily incurred by witnesses in connection with the investigation. The commission in turn is obliged to ensure that any direction it makes concerning the payment of legal costs by me comes within these guidelines.</P>
      <P>The guidelines will also make provision for payment to witnesses of non-legal costs. Each witness will be furnished with a copy of the guidelines in advance of his or her giving evidence. This ensures that witnesses who wish to do so can <Col N="638"/>arrange legal representation with full knowledge of the regime under which they may seek to have those costs recouped.</P>
      <P>At the conclusion of its work the commission will prepare for me a written report based on the evidence received which sets out the facts it has established on the matter referred to it. In accordance with the provisions of section 38 of the Act it is my firm intention to publish the report of the commission subject to the High Court powers to decide on the form and nature of publication.</P>
      <P>I conclude by urging Senators to support the Government&rsquo;s proposal for the establishment of a commission of investigation in this case by supporting the motion before the House today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister. Fine Gael welcomes the setting up of this commission. We have for a long time supported the right of the victims of abuse to tell their stories and for the fullness of their abuse and exploitation to be realised. We believe this issue is so important that it merits time and resource investment from the Government in order to ensure that it is properly treated.</P>
      <P>As we debate this issue, it is only right to remember that a lady, Marie Therese<?oasys _jy ?>O&rsquo;Loughlin, has been outside the gates of Leinster House for some time. She is continuing in her constant vigil outside, even sleeping there at night to draw attention to the fact that the Government has repeatedly refused to recognise its responsibilities in respect of the Morning Star home. It is no use playing to the gallery on certain issues, and showing apparent compassion and concern. This lady&rsquo;s plight needs to be addressed urgently because the way she is being treated at present is disgraceful.</P>
      <P>Any commission established by this House must be accountable and transparent and it is imperative that such bodies give people cause for confidence. The guidelines laid down by the Minister are good ones and will get to the bottom of the abuse that was allegedly perpetrated in the Dublin diocese, although many would say that an investigation is long overdue.</P>
      <P>There are important lessons to be learned from the Ferns Report and the manner in which it was compiled. It is an understatement to say that the contents of that document were scandalous and depraved and it goes without saying that they made difficult and distressing reading. Nonetheless, it is an extremely important document in so far as it published and publicised the horror that so many children had to endure in County Wexford. This commission must use the forthrightness and directness of the Ferns Report as its compass. There is no doubt that what is uncovered and exposed by successive commissions of this kind is unsavoury and sickening. The reason for revealing these dire events, however, is to learn from past mistakes. We must <Col N="639"/>ensure that these horrors are never again perpetrated in our society.</P>
      <P>Many of the victims of past abuse and neglect have had shocking and distressing experiences. It was right and proper that they were given the opportunity to tell their stories and to tell us all how society failed them in the past so that we can make sure these events are not repeated. With many of the victims of abuse approaching old age, the commission should hear their cases now. These people have much to tell us and future generations about the kind of barbarity that can exist in a society which fails to be vigilant or protect the vulnerable. We need to hear their stories so that we never forget this abuse.</P>
      <P>It is incumbent on us, as legislators, to put safeguards in place that will ensure the protection of children. The first step along this road is to hear the wrongs that have been committed and to air them to the satisfaction of all concerned, so that there can be no obfuscation on the facts. This commission, which people have been demanding for some time, is entirely necessary. We support its establishment and hope it will be able to bring a report to the Minister within the specified period of time because it is important to set time limits for such bodies. I hope the problems that arose for the Laffoy commission in terms of not providing the necessary finance and resources to bring forward its report will not arise in this instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I rehearsed my position when I formally moved this motion and the Minister, whom I welcome to the House, provided the background to the matter in terms of the serious allegations made by the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; reports in 2002 about sexual abuse in the Dublin archdiocese. Shortly afterwards, the Minister made a commitment that an investigation would be held into these matters and he has now established this commission of investigation.</P>
      <P>We held a debate on the Ferns Report about one month ago and it was salutary and sad to learn that these events took place in our society over a long period of time. While I presume that we are all aware of the effects of child abuse, I am reminded of the words of the retired rector, Norman Ruddock, who said that the rape of innocence is the most bestial of crimes. I have seen in the Diocese of Ferns cases where, as the Minister noted, trauma and difficulties in personal relationships arose from these matters and, unfortunately, people have committed suicide. The most abhorrent issue is that the consequences often last the lifetime of victims. It is appropriate, therefore, that every step is taken to ensure we put safeguards in place to protect children who are in the care of any authority.</P>
      <P>It is reasonable to assume that this commission of investigation will make recommendations and findings which accord with the Ferns Report. We will probably see that, prior to 1996, the <Col N="640"/>responses of church authorities were inadequate. Hopefully, the report of the Catholic bishops&rsquo; advisory committee on child sexual abuse and the framework for a church response was fully implemented since that date in every diocese. In that regard, the one bright spot in the Ferns Report was the reassurance that the bishop, the Most Reverend Eamonn Walsh, fully implemented the report. The interagency conferences he established on foot of allegations are models for other dioceses to follow.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I note from the terms of reference, which are specific and focused, that not only will the commission investigate cases in which complaints were made but it will also examine issues which came to the attention of the authorities through other means. It is good that the latter is also investigated because a significant amount of information will be revealed by doing so. The most important task is to learn lessons from the mistakes of the past so as to ensure similar events do not take place.</P>
      <P>Other dioceses will be examined if they are found to have failed to implement the recommendations of the bishops&rsquo; advisory committee of 1996. In the interim period while the commission is being established, I hope that the Health Service Executive will be proactive in identifying such dioceses and make them give full effect to the recommendations. That would be the ideal solution because it would obviate the need for commissions of investigation. I hope we do not sit back and wait on the commission to make recommendations but will be proactive in ensuring that happens. The bishops&rsquo; conference should also deal with that as a priority.</P>
      <P>I do not subscribe to the notion that we should have such a commission of investigation into every diocese. While I have misgivings about this one the commitments given should be honoured. I am not confident that it will bring forward any further recommendations or throw any more light on the problem than did the Ferns Report.</P>
      <P>The commission of investigation is a new innovation by the Minister because of the exorbitant costs of the tribunals and public inquiries we have had since 1997. Due to the duration of those inquiries the reports are often out of date when published and their value diminished, so I am glad this inquiry has an 18-month target. The Ferns inquiry, operating on a non-statutory basis, was positively received from the point of view of its efficiency by most Members of these Houses and we can make a comparison to see if the commission operates as efficiently and effectively and within similar cost structures. In terms of gauging the intent of the commission of investigation that comparison is good.</P>
      <P>We must not be side-tracked. Sexual abuse committed by clergy of any religion accounts for approximately 3% of all sexual abuse. It is important that in investigating we do not lose sight of other areas which have higher levels of sexual abuse. We must take an holistic approach <Col N="641"/>to it so the effective safeguards to be put in place will cover 100% of the areas which have given rise to child sexual abuse. This includes all sorts of authorities and people with responsibility for children including, unfortunately, members of the immediate and extended family.</P>
      <P>While the sexual abuse committed in the diocese is being highlighted, and rightly so, it is imperative that we do not overconcentrate on this to the detriment of the other 97%. This week the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Health and Children placed emphasis on a Ministry for children and this will be a positive step in bringing all the strands together and focussing all the agencies involved in a common direction. We will have further debates on that in the future in these Houses. The House will join with me in wishing the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, well in his responsibilities.</P>
      <P>While we have opted for the commission of investigation, I wonder why the Minister did not opt for a non-statutory approach like the Ferns inquiry together with the Garda pursuing allegations to bring them to court. People who committed serious crimes should be accountable before our courts. That should be the prime objective because it becomes a strong deterrent against this type of behaviour in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and, while it is unfortunate to be obliged to do so, I welcome the commission, which he has set up briskly. I am glad he appointed Judge Yvonne Murphy chairman of the commission. Unfortunately, she probably feels that she has too much experience in child sexual abuse having often been obliged to deal with it in the courts. I am also glad Archbishop Diarmuid Martin is so concerned and has been so proactive.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It is regrettable that the tribunal will hear only a sample of representative cases but the Minister makes a good point about how long this could go on and how we could have parallel tribunals. The Ferns inquiry began with approximately three cases and ended up with 30. In the Dublin diocese, there are approximately 67 cases. If an expansion similar to that which occurred in the case of the inquiry were experienced, there could be hundreds of cases. Many people will feel aggrieved and will protest outside Leinster House wondering why their cases were not heard. While the Minister has requested a report within 18 months, he said that the commission is open-ended. I am sure, therefore, that the commission will judge what comes before it carefully.</P>
      <P>The Ferns Report made shocking reading. It was one of the worst things I have ever read and I have read all the reports on child sexual abuse. As Senator Jim Walsh said, it is important that we examine the recommendations and that the health services should be more proactive but there is a problem. In the Monageer case, the laudable principal of the school reported the <Col N="642"/>situation to the South Eastern Health Board and a female GP examined seven of the ten children, listened to their stories about the sexual abuse they had suffered on the altar of the church and thought they were credible. The community care officer was then called in and he did the best he could. Unfortunately, it looked as though they had acted <i>ultra vires</i> because the legislation does not cover intervention where abuse occurs outside the family. For example, the report, at page 49, states:</P>
      <P LI="1">It is possible to identify clearly the scheme of the 1908 Act from the power which it conferred on the courts. That power was to remove a child from parents who had neglected him or her and to entrust the child to the care of a state agency or a fit person approved by the Court. The powers conferred by the 1908 Act afforded no protection to children who had been abused otherwise than through neglect or abuse by parents or carers. The Child Care Act 1991, had a more pro-active orientation and conferred a greater obligation on Health Boards in the following terms ... [It then quotes the terms.]</P>
      <P FLI="0">The report lists the terms involved and then, on page 50, states:</P>
      <P LI="1">Just as in the Act of 1908, the Child Care Act 1991, expressly recognised that it was the right and duty of parents to care for their children and that it was the right of children to be cared for by their parents. Intervention by any State agency could only be permitted and required where it was established that parents had failed in this duty to the serious detriment of their child.</P>
      <P FLI="0">On page 51 the report outlines that the Children Act &ldquo;reiterates the principle that the State should only intervene in the welfare of a child where the family fails to ensure it&rdquo; and on page 52 it states:</P>
      <P LI="1">The implication of an imposition of such a duty on the Health Board [this is to intervene when the abuse is outside the home] without any express legislative powers is an issue which the Inquiry believes should be carefully considered by the Legislature. Guidelines, either statutory or regulatory would appear necessary in order to clearly delimit the Health Boards&rsquo; obligations under Section 3 of the 1991 Act.</P>
      <P FLI="0">It is important that we bring forward legislation at once to ensure that community care officers are in a position to intervene in such situations. We introduced the Protection of Persons Reporting Child Abuse Act 1998, which provided immunity from civil liability to any person reporting child abuse, reasonably and in good faith, to designated officers of the health board or to a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. While this gives protection to the employees who report child sexual abuse, it is not sufficient according to Mr. Justice Murphy. In the recommendations on <Col N="643"/>page 257, regarding the South Eastern Health Board, when the areas were being examined, it is pointed out:</P>
      <P LI="1">[The] Health Board has no power of intervention except in places where sexual abuse is occurring in a family situation. As far as the Inquiry is aware, the South Eastern Health Board has not attempted to repeat the intervention which it made in the Monageer case and which in the view of the Inquiry was, although well intentioned, <i>ultra vires</i>.</P>
      <P FLI="0">It is unfortunate that it may not have been in a position to intervene in other cases although it knew it was going on. The report states further:</P>
      <P LI="1">It is the view of the Inquiry that the powers and duties of the Health Services Executive in this connection should be regulated by the express terms of primary or secondary legislation and not by inferences drawn from general obligations imposed on these bodies.</P>
      <P FLI="0">On page 267, the report states:</P>
      <P LI="1">The inquiry has identified in Chapter Six of the report the shortcomings in relation to the ability of the Health Services Executive to intervene properly in relation to child sexual abuse perpetrated by a non family member without the connivance of a child&rsquo;s parents. The Inquiry recommends that an in-depth study be conducted on the full remit of the Health Services Executive&rsquo;s powers in relation to this issue and that express statutory recognition is given to these powers.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I would be grateful if the Minister pushed those recommendations on because there may have been other situations where health board employees felt they should have intervened by could not do so. The faster we deal with this the better and I doubt it would be difficult to achieve in an amendment to either the Child Care Act or the Children Act. I commend the Minister for establishing the commission so quickly, although it is unfortunate that it will not have a pleasant time reporting.</P>
      <P>I heard the Minister comment on perhaps lowering the age of consent in certain cases. When the Sex Offenders Bill was before the House I was unenthusiastic about children having permission to have sex, even if their parents knew about it. Unfortunately, parents do not always work in the best interests of their child. This should be watched carefully. As I remember, if the other partner in sex is within two or three years of the child&rsquo;s age, it is not a crime.</P>

	<P>If a 14 year old boy has sex with a 16 year old girl, the boy commits an offence but the girl does not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a difficult area. Speaking as a doctor, it is important to remember that sexual intercourse frequently results in pregnancy. It is quite common. I have to deal with children as young as 11 who are pregnant and it is not a desirable situation. If we continue to lower the age of consent, young girls will become pregnant and will have problems. We have seen children as young as 12 being brought here for arranged marriages; certain ethnic groups allow that. It is not, however, a policy we should encourage. The Minister should look at this remembering the general outcome of sexual intercourse, particularly in view of the fact it is almost impossible to get adults to use protection, never mind telling children what they should do in such situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this motion. The only issue I will raise is that the Labour Party is unhappy with the 18-month timeframe. The Minister stated in his speech that the legislation allows for the commission to endeavour to submit its report within the specified time period. If, therefore, the commission found it could not submit a report within the 18 months, it could get an extension. That would deal with the issue, although it is still a concern. The Minister might confirm in his reply if such an extension is possible.</P>
      <P>I am also uneasy about any proposal to lower the age of consent. It is a good idea for consultation to take place on such issues but we must be wary of the fact that, irrespective of what happens where young people have sexual intercourse, they do not have the same physical and emotional maturity as adults. The age of consent is there to protect young people from adults who would exploit and take advantage of them. If the age of consent was lowered, some adults would see young people as fair game. In the case mentioned, the judge stated that the young person concerned is vulnerable and the law is there to protect her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their contributions and their welcoming sentiments.</P>
      <P>It is provided for in the statute that the Minister can extend the time for the commission without returning to the D&aacute;il so it is not set in stone. Without saying the 18-month period is an abstract ideal, everyone would support the Minister in being reasonable to ensure the work is done with a requisite timeframe and an extension, if necessary. The sooner it is done the better.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry was complimentary about the speed with which things have happened. It has taken a long time, however, to get from the original programme on RTE to the stage we are at today. The House will appreciate that I was not in a position to have an inquiry of any kind unless it was a public tribunal of inquiry which at that <Col N="645"/>time required evidence to be given in public. I was absolutely clear that it would be grotesque to force victims of abuse to give evidence in public.</P>
      <P>That brings me to Senator Walsh&rsquo;s question of why I did not go down the Ferns route. While I appreciate that Archbishop Martin has said there will be full co-operation with this inquiry, he cannot command co-operation from everyone. The victims&rsquo; groups were supportive of the idea of establishing a new method of inquiry and it would have been strange if one of the motives for the commission of inquiry was to deal precisely with this sort of case if I then abandoned that model. I have no doubt that Judge Yvonne Murphy will learn lessons from the practical experience of the Ferns inquiry. The mere fact that one possesses powers of a statutory nature does not mean they must always be employed. If it is possible to get from A to B without using statutory powers, that is the way forward.</P>
      <P>In regard to the points made by Senator Henry, the investigation by the commission does not preclude criminal investigations. It has been pointed out that many priests in Dublin have been convicted. In using that phrase, I point out that the great majority of priests in Dublin, as elsewhere, are wonderful, decent men who have devoted their lives to their faith and their community. When we generalise on these subjects, let us remember that the great generalisation we should always reiterate is that the clergy are, in general, wonderful people who have given up their lives, including career prospects and everything else, for others. Nothing I say should detract in any way from that fact.</P>
      <P>Victims&rsquo; representatives understand why the representative sample procedure is followed. All cases will be looked at by the commission to allow it determine what is representative. For example, if one is looking for the response of the archdiocese to three cases that are almost exactly the same, an in-depth examination of all three is not necessary. I do not believe that people whose cases are not selected for in-depth examination will feel left out if they believe, as they will have good reason to do, that by bringing their cases to the commission, or having them brought on their behalf, they will influence what cases will be dealt with and in what way. No cases will be wasted or ignored. The Department of Health and Children is looking at the implications of the Ferns Report, including what is needed to increase the powers of community care officers.</P>
      <P>I join Senator Jim Walsh in giving my best wishes and warm congratulations to the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, on his new appointment. It is very important that the Government&rsquo;s child policy be centralised in one person. It is also vital that this person has a function in each of the Departments with governmental responsibility in this area and is given adequate seniority and clout to make policy, rather than always deferring to others or trying to work out the agendas of persons sitting at the <Col N="646"/>Cabinet table. In the fullness of time, this particular portfolio may become a full Cabinet one. The Taoiseach has indicated that customarily when child issues come before Government, the Minister of State will come to Cabinet and present his policies as his own. It is an important position in this respect.</P>
      <P>I did not say I planned to reduce the age of consent. Anyone who reads the text of the interview in question will see I was very careful to say that the anomaly pointed out by the trial judge at the appeal in Galway was a significant one that pointed up important issues and apparent unfairness. I said the present law seemed to be somewhat crude but that it would be just as crude simply to solve it by reducing the age of consent. I fully agree with the points made by Senators Henry and Tuffy that simply removing an anomaly by removing protections for vulnerable people is not the way forward.</P>
      <P>Having said that, it is very strange that a 14 year old boy who has intercourse with a 16 year old girl is deemed to commit an offence but the latter is not, while a 19 year old girl who has intercourse with a 14 year old boy, by consent, commits no offence. In the latter case, if the genders are changed so it is a 19 year old male with a 14 year old girl, there is suddenly an offence. This is a difficult issue to handle. In the case in Galway, the parties involved were in a subsisting and enduring relationship. On the other hand, as I emphasised, reducing protections as a way of dealing with anomalies is not a very subtle way of going about it.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry queried whether people within a certain age range of each other commit an offence if they engage in consensual sexual activity. There is a popular view that this is the case but it is incorrect. There is no defence in law for a boy aged 15 years on the basis that his female sexual partner is roughly a contemporary. It is an anomalous situation. Such prosecutions are rarely taken but arise on occasion. As a practising barrister, I was somewhat surprised when a young fellow in the Dublin area was prosecuted at the age of 16 for having sexual relations with a girlfriend aged 15. The genesis of it was that they disappeared for some days together and when she got into trouble, it was the usual thing; she said it was non-consensual. After a time, she admitted that it had been consensual all along. In the meantime, however, the boy made admissions to the Garda that intercourse had taken place and he was prosecuted and given a suspended sentence.</P>
      <P>In situations like that, I agree with Senators Henry and Tuffy that removing the protections for younger people would be crude. Simply saying the logical answer to this is to select some age above which everybody is fair game for everybody is not the way forward. Is it fair, however, that if a 19 year old woman has sex with a 15 year old boy, there is no offence, but if a 15 year old boy has intercourse with a 16 year old girl, he <Col N="647"/>commits an offence? That offence goes down on his record and will come into play if, for example, he wants to go to the United States. He may be on a sexual offenders register for the rest of his life.</P>
      <P>I recall the exact detail of the case to which I referred because it struck me as so unfair in the circumstances that this young man now had a criminal record and had received a two-year suspended prison sentence. He will never under our present law &mdash; another issue I intend to deal with &mdash; be able to expunge that sentence. He can never go back to the court and argue that he has been an upright citizen ever since and ask for the offence to be removed from his record. If he wants to go the United States, apply for a job or partake of a wide range of other activities, it is always there. There is now the even more frightening prospect that people in these circumstances will be put on a sex offenders register, which has all types of implications for them. This is wrong.</P>
      <P>I do not know what is to be done about this. I was glad that the reporter, Eugene Masterson, asked me about this. I said to him that I know there is a problem but do not know the solution. I specifically said that the present law is crude but that reducing the age of consent would be a crude way of dealing with the situation. He quoted me to that effect in his article so I wish to be fair to him also. It is a genuine anomaly.</P>
      <P>I said it would have to be studied; there is no point in writing out a solution on the back of a cigarette packet. We must carefully consider whether what we would broadly call underage sexual activity is to be ignored, condoned or disapproved of in some way, without saying that a young boy, as distinct from a young woman, who engages in it should have his life ruined and blighted in circumstances where his consensual partner, even though she may be older than him, has no stain against her character for the rest of her life. In all our concern for gender equality, we should remember that the consequences of underage pregnancy are always unequal. That is the reality.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Lest I stray into political incorrectness, I will simply say that I am pleased Senator Henry raised the issue. I repeat what I said to Mr. Masterson in the <i>Sunday World</i>, namely, that a problem exists and it should be addressed. Lowering the age of consent would be a crude way to deal with the legal crudity that already exists. However, that does not mean we can leave the law exactly as it stands because these cases, although rare, occur. It is very unfair that a young man&rsquo;s career should be blighted for the rest of his life because of activity that no one would consider was morally criminal if the older or contemporary partner in the activity did not commit a crime.</P>

    <Title>Coroners (Amendment) Bill 2005: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill has a very specific focus, namely, to address certain deficiencies in the current law pertaining to the conduct of an inquest by a coroner. These deficiencies, including the restriction on the number of medical witnesses and the outdated sanction for non-attendance of a witness or juror, have, albeit in a limited number of cases, combined to inhibit the conduct of fair inquests in a manner sufficient to inform the family and relations of a deceased person and society at large. The Bill contains some amendments, which I proposed in the Lower House. These are largely of a technical nature and were agreed to. The Government agrees with the proposal to support the Bill as it now stands.</P>
      <P>In recent months, certain cases have helped to highlight the particular inadequacies of the current law as set out in the Coroners Act 1962, not least the case to which some publicity was given, namely, that of the Nowlan family and their child, Pierce. Since these pertinent cases are still current, the Seanad will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to discuss the details at this time but I know that they are very sad cases.</P>
      <P>The Seanad will be aware that the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme, announced at the beginning of the session, contained a commitment to replace the 1962 Act with a modern code of law, to establish a coroner service and to transform the organisation of coroners. My proposals for a Bill have been with Departments and the Attorney General for necessary observations and I expect to be in a position to bring them to Government before the end of the year. I do not wish to anticipate its decision. However, if there is agreement, I intend to publish the, more than 90, heads of a very large and comprehensive Bill for public consultation purposes during the drafting process.</P>
      <P><?oasys _ic14- ?>The coroner service is one of the oldest public offices of State in the common law system. Its origins date back many hundreds of years. Prior to the Act of 1962, a Coroners Act 1927 was introduced by the Free State. My predecessor as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, began the process of reform that is now coming to an end. He established an expert working group, the coroners review group, to examine all aspects of the coroner service with a view to bringing forward recommendations for reform. The report was published in December 2000. It contained 110 recommendations covering a wide range of issues. The work of the review group was added to by the subsequent report of the coroners rules committee, which was published in November 2003.<?oasys _ic0- ?></P><Col N="649"/>
      <P>The Coroners Society of Ireland, as the body which represents coroners, has been active in the process of reform, for which I thank it. I met the society on a number of occasions in recent years and there continues to be ongoing contact, as well as meetings with departmental officials, to advance the reform process. The key objectives of the comprehensive Bill that I intend to bring to Government, in accordance with the programme for Government, will be to provide for considerable updating and streamlining of the death investigation and of post mortem and inquest procedures to ensure a better and more proper service than is currently possible under the Coroners Act 1962.</P>
      <P Just="Left">To achieve these objectives, I am focussing on two critical elements in the reform of the coroner service. These include widening of scope of the inquest and developing optimum structures and administration for a modern coroner service. The central element of a modern death investigation service must be to allow sufficient scope to the coroner to carry out the best possible investigation. The 1962 Act, and a subsequent interpretation of its intention and scope by the Supreme Court in the cases of Greene <i>v.</i> McLoughin and the Eastern Health Board <i>v.</i> Farrell, provided for a restrictive approach to the examination of how people died. The examination is limited to establishing the proximate medical cause of death. Such a limitation is no longer appropriate in light of the developments in medical care and treatment since 1962 and it increasingly threatens to bring the inquest process into disrepute. We must now move to expand the scope of the coronial investigation. We must require that the coroner seek to establish, in so far as is practicable, the circumstances in which the deceased met his or her death.</P>
      <P>Widening the scope of the coroner&rsquo;s investigation was recommended by the review group, reflects the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights and is consistent with developments in other common law jurisdictions. A series of judgments in the European Court of Human Rights must, in any development of my Bill, be taken into account to ensure compliance with the convention. These judgments interpret Article 2 of the convention as providing for a more extensive investigation of the circumstances of death beyond the strict &ldquo;how in the particular circumstances&rdquo; question, which is the substance of an inquest under existing law. They indicate that a certain extension of the scope of an inquest is now required if Ireland is to meet the obligations of the convention. However, any proposed extension of the coroner&rsquo;s investigation would have to be balanced by maintaining the prohibition on explicit determination of questions of criminal liability at an inquest.</P>
      <P>From any widening of the scope of an inquiry, there would be knock-on developments. These would include no arbitrary restriction on the number and type of medical or other witnesses <Col N="650"/>who can be summoned to appear at an inquest, increased sanctions for those who refuse to co-operate with a coroner&rsquo;s investigation into a death, powers of compellability for the coroner similar to those of a tribunal of inquiry, expressly stated powers for a coroner in respect of control of the body of the deceased and other matters &mdash; including power of entry and seizure &mdash; greater involvement of the coroner on the movement of bodies in and out of the State and, in a case where the coroner is concerned, that a &ldquo;fact of death&rdquo; certificate be held by an undertaker before disposal of a body.</P>
      <P>The coroners review group envisaged certain powers for the coroner similar to those available to a tribunal of inquiry. It is suggested that procedures relating to evidence, access to documents, etc., will have to be developed in that regard in respect of the coroner&rsquo;s inquest. The right of access to documentation by all the parties concerned could become a critical point, particularly in regard to hospital, Garda or other State agency reports. There would be a need to respect the constitutional and legal rights of witnesses similar to the situation at a tribunal. We need to ensure consistent and efficient procedures in light of a new legal situation, which would have resource implications. It could not be assured under the current ramshackle coronial system.</P>
      <P>The primary concern of the coroners review group was to ensure that a high quality coroner service, with optimal resources and supports, be developed. To achieve that outcome, it recommended a comprehensive overhaul and modernisation of the service. As regards the number of coroners, the review group envisaged an evolution to a regionalised structure where there would be fewer than the current 48 coronial districts provided for in the 1962 Act. I am satisfied that the current organisation of coroners must be reformed. The proposed Bill that I have advanced for consideration by the Government will address all the policy issues, including best practice in the law on coroners, their organisation and support structures.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In regard to the Bill before us, as I said during the Second Stage debate in the D&aacute;il, I was, in effect, confronted by a choice. I could have chosen to table my own breakout Bill with this set of provisions in it along the lines being considered today, or I could have presented a full Bill of the type which is being finalised. My view was that neither the D&aacute;il nor the Seanad was likely to deal with two coroners Bills in the lifetime of either House. We are facing a general election in the next 14 to 18 months. I am doubtful whether a short Bill of this kind would have survived the predictable criticism that would be levied that I was not addressing the wider issues of radical reform which exist. Therefore, I very much welcome this Bill because it is an agreed remedial measure which allows the major reform project to advance in parallel with it. It solves the immediate injustices that would flow from leaving <Col N="651"/>the law as it stands while I proceed with the project of major reform.</P>
      <P>The short Bill has, I believe, benefited from the amendments I proposed, which are of a technical nature. The Bill, as originally introduced by Deputy Rabbitte in the other House, proposed to treat equally as regards penalty non-attending jurors and non-attending witnesses. As Senators will note from the Bill, that has been changed. Clearly, it is much more serious if a relevant witness says &ldquo;I will not attend&rdquo; than if a juror decides that a football match is more important than answering a summons. To deal with those two situations with the same penalties would be somewhat unfair. I agree with Deputy Rabbitte that the current derisory penalties meant, in effect, that the price of a taxi fare was the maximum fine that could be imposed, and that too was unfair.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the abolition on the restriction on the number of medical witnesses together with the updated level of sanctions for non-attendance and non-co-operation of a juror or witness will enhance the role of a coroner in his or her investigation in the interim number of months until this and the other House have an opportunity to deal with the major Bill that is approaching finality.</P>
      <P>I am happy to support the Bill as it now stands. I will not be proposing any amendments to it in this House. I congratulate Deputy Rabbitte for bringing forward the Bill in the D&aacute;il and Senator Tuffy for her party&rsquo;s role in getting this Bill before this House. I want to say to the Nowlan family that while this measure cannot undo the past I believe it can stand as an assistance to them, and to people in similar circumstances to those in which they have found themselves, that something can be done. It is useful on the last day of the legislative term&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators have another day to go in this House. It is useful in the last days of the legislative term and in the Christmas spirit that all parties should get together and engage in a good piece of non-adversarial law reform. I am grateful to the movers and drafters of this Bill for allowing me to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister, his staff, the Government and the Leader of the Seanad for facilitating the bringing forward of this legislation, its speedy passage through the two Houses and for the additions to the legislation made by the Minister and the Department.</P>
      <P>I understand the Minister was very courteous to the family involved in the case that lies behind this legislation. That family are from Saggart in my constituency. I express sympathy to the family at this stage for all they have gone through and for the circumstances underlying their case.</P><Col N="652"/>
      <P>As the Minister said, the Bill was promoted by the Labour Party leader, Deputy Rabbitte, in the D&aacute;il. It was brought forward by him to deal with problems in the Coroners Act 1962 in regard to the case of the Nowlan family but also in regard to an issue that has been identified in other cases. In general, issues need to be addressed. As the Minister said, it has been introduced in the context of a more comprehensive reform that is needed and planned by him, on which he has elaborated here today and yesterday in the other House. He outlined that he intends to publish heads of a Bill and have further consultation on the proposed legislation. He explained that it would be difficult to bring forward a comprehensive Bill as a matter of urgency to deal with the issue with which we are dealing in this Bill and agreed with my party that this is an issue of priority that needs to be addressed now.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke about his plans to reform the legislation and the need to widen the scope of the Coroner&rsquo;s Court and the coroner service. This is one of the main issues that need to be addressed. It arises from the recommendations of the expert working group on the coroner service. Even within the existing scope of the coroner service it is obvious that this type of amendment needs to be made. That is the reason there was this level of consensus around the legislation.</P>
      <P>As has been explained, the particular case involves a young child, Pierce Nowlan of Saggart, who was admitted to Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin last October to have a device fitted into a vein that would have allowed the regular injection into his blood of factor 8, a clotting agent. During the procedure, it seems an artery was inadvertently punctured as surgeons were attempting to access the vein where the device was to be fitted. Pierce bled from a hole in this artery into the left side of his chest. Subsequently, the oxygen flow to his brain was adversely impacted and he died as a result.</P>
      <P>The inquest into this case began in July of this year but the coroner had to adjourn it on a number of occasions, most recently in November. The coroner raised concerns at that stage about the Coroners Act 1962 and called on the Government to introduce an amendment to the legislation lifting the restriction as soon as possible. He raised general concerns which are also important in regard to this legislation. He said that present circumstances ran contrary to the rights of all involved under the Constitution for access to natural justice, fair procedures and due process. I will not go into the provisions of the Act, but a number of concerns about it have been raised during the years. That is one of the reasons the expert working group on the coroner service was set up.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In addition to the Dublin city coroner raising concerns about the legislation and this particular provision which restricted the number of medical witnesses to two, concerns were also raised by Mr. Justice Hardiman. In the case of the Eastern <Col N="653"/>Health Board <i>v.</i> Farrell, he said that section 26 of the Coroners Act was in his view &ldquo;a serious obstacle to the proper discharge of the statutory duty of a coroner in the more complex type of inquest&rdquo;. He continued, &ldquo;If a coroner feels that the question of how the death occurred cannot be answered without further evidence, it seems remarkable that he cannot obtain it&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that he had concerns about the provision and that he felt it might not be in compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights and so on.</P>
      <P>It is clear there is a need to introduce this provision. For example, a patient in a hospital could be treated by a number of different doctors with different specialties over time &mdash; one can imagine such a case. It is also clear there could be a need to call many medical witnesses to an inquest into a single case. It may not have been an urgent issue in the past, but now that there have been so many technological advances in medicine and hospital doctors have many specialties, it is obvious there is a need to broaden the ability of coroners to call many witnesses to inquests.</P>
      <P>I would like to speak briefly about some of the provisions of the Bill. The main purpose of the Bill is to repeal section 26(2) of the Coroners Act 1962, which provides that a maximum of two medical witnesses can be called to an inquest. As Deputy Rabbitte said in the D&aacute;il, it is &ldquo;universally accepted&rdquo; that the restriction in question is &ldquo;unwarranted and unfair&rdquo;. It is being removed so that an unlimited number of medical witnesses can be called. The Minister, Deputy Michael McDowell, has accepted the Labour Party&rsquo;s proposal to amend the section of the 1962 Act that makes it an offence to fail to attend an inquest at the specified time and date. Section 1 of the Bill will increase the fine imposed on a juror in such circumstances to &euro;500, which is more prohibitive. During last night&rsquo;s debate in the D&aacute;il, the Minister amended the Bill to provide that the fine that will be imposed on a witness in such circumstances will be &euro;3,000.</P>
      <P>The Minister also decided to delete the section of the original Bill, which was proposed by the Labour Party, that provided for the enforcement of a coroner&rsquo;s request to a person to attend an inquest. He said he intends to address that aspect of the matter in some future comprehensive legislation. The Labour Party has accepted the Minister&rsquo;s reasonable approach because it understands that a limited number of provisions can be put in place at this point. As the issue of enforcement is more complex, it may be more appropriate to deal with it following further consultation and examination. I understand the Minister&rsquo;s decision to amend the Bill by removing section 2 of the original Bill.</P>
      <P>I again thank the Minister. Members of the House often complain that our work is not covered by the media and it is possible that this legislation will not be the subject of much media coverage. The Bill is a prime example of the con<Col N="654"/>structive work that is done by those of us who take seriously our important role as legislators. A legislative gap that needs to be filled as speedily as possible has been identified. We are working together to that end, which demonstrates that constructive work is done by Members on all sides of the House. We do a great deal of legislative work that is separate to the cut and thrust of debates which take place along Government and Opposition lines. The Minister has often accepted amendments, which have been tabled by the Labour Party and other parties, during debates on other Bills. Such activity is not the subject of a great deal of media coverage. I take our role as legislators seriously because I feel it is important. The work being done today is very important as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I would also like to welcome the Coroners (Amendment) Bill 2005. The Minister has reminded the House that the coroners review group has produced 110 recommendations, which are being examined by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. This legislation has been produced with haste to meet the needs of the Nowlan family and other families which have found themselves in similarly unfortunate circumstances. I welcome the form of the Bill, on which I will comment shortly. I do not doubt that the more comprehensive Bill that will be produced in the future, like the legislation before the House today, will empower coroners to fulfil properly and adequately their roles and responsibilities. They deserve to be given powers to administer their jurisdictions and meet their responsibilities which are in parallel with the powers of those who administer courts.</P>
      <P>This technical Bill amends the Coroners Act 1962 in three significant ways. First, it removes the limit on the number of medical witnesses who can be called before a coroner&rsquo;s inquest. There will not be any such limit under this legislation. I understand the logic of the restriction in the 1962 Act of the number of medical witnesses who can be called to two. In fact, just one such witness was allowed to be called in most cases, unless there was a need for a further witness. What will happen if a coroner is faced with conflicting medical evidence at an inquest? It is always important for families to ascertain precisely what happened to their loved ones. Is there any scope for some difficulties in that regard? If I try to rationalise it, I presume that a coroner will call a third or fourth medical witness to get some clarification. This aspect of the matter needs to be monitored although it is clear that I subscribe to this provision. The existing restrictions under the 1962 Act mean that if a medical witness does not give adequate evidence to a coroner, for whatever reason, the conclusions reached at that inquest are insufficient.</P>
      <P>The second way in which the Coroners Act 1962 is amended involves the repeal of the outdated fine of just &pound;5, which is imposed on a per<Col N="655"/>son who fails to attend an inquest. When we are providing for monetary penalties in legislation, I often wonder whether we should link them to inflation so they increase automatically and the legislation does not have to be amended in the future. Similar provisions are in place in many other areas of activity. It strikes me that we should include a measure of that nature in the Bill before the House.</P>
      <P>The third significant amendment of the 1962 Act will empower coroners when they are issuing summonses to witnesses. The amendment to which the Minister alluded, which provides that a person can be summonsed by means of registered post, is eminently sensible. Our postal service is reasonably reliable&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>For the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and one hopes it is absolutely reliable when letters are registered. The provision in question is a good one because there can be difficulties in serving summonses by hand. For example, witnesses have to be sought out individually. It is necessary and sensible to provide that coroners can examine witnesses under oath. I wonder why such a provision has not always been part of the process. Similarly, it is right that coroners will be allowed to order the production of any document.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I welcome the increased penalties &mdash; larger fines and terms of imprisonment of up to six months &mdash; which will be applied under this legislation if witnesses or jurors fail to attend an inquest or refuse to take the oath. I specifically welcome the provision whereby a person who is called as a witness, but fails to co-operate properly with the coroner, can be found to be in contempt and have penalties imposed on him or her as a consequence. It will also be possible for a coroner to go to the High Court to seek an order to ensure that there is compliance. Stricter penalties can be imposed for contempt of the High Court. That is a good provision.</P>
      <P>The Minister has kept us busy during the past 12 months an I am sure the spokespersons on justice will concur. Sometimes he belies his reputation where he takes a Bill introduced by an Opposition party and it is testament to the manner in which he treats the House. He is accommodating to all sides of the House in regard to suggestions made or amendments tabled. He evaluates them and if he considers they are worthy of inclusion he is prepared to take them on board. His explanations to the House are expansive on all matters coming before us. He fully utilises the Houses of the Oireachtas in the manner for which they were intended as a forum for democracy. I wish to put that on the record because&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>We welcome the introduction of the Bill. We have long been supporters of reform in the area of coroners and compliment the leader of the Labour Party in initiating the Bill in the other House. Senator Brian Hayes has briefed me on the need for the Bill and how it affects the Nowlan family. The Nowlan family deserves credit for their campaign on this matter. I understand they are in the Visitors Gallery.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that the Coroners Act 1962 is in dire need of substantial reform. Certainly the working party that reported in October 2004 outlined more than 100 recommendations which are in need of attention. He said the Bill being adopted today is a remedial measure. Given that he said another coroners Bill may not be introduced in this session, can I take it that he has given up at this stage or that there will be a commitment in the new year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>It is welcome that we will have a full coroners Act before Easter because it is an area that needs attention, as the Minister&rsquo;s working group has alluded to already. I thank the Minister for accepting the Bill and his co-operation. It is necessary that we all co-operate in a case such as this to address the problem that has arisen. I commend the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for coming so expeditiously to deal with this matter that was first raised with him by Deputy Rabbitte. I single out Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s involvement in this more than anyone because he was the person who, when the case was first raised with us as constituency politicians, decided to take the legislative route. It is to his credit that he has managed to get the Bill through the other House so swiftly, with the Minister&rsquo;s full backing and support. Deputy Rabbitte needs to be commended for that, not only as the leader of his party but also as a constituency representative.</P>
      <P>When I raised the matter with the Leader of the House last week she kindly informed me that time would be provided for the Bill this week to ensure it was put through the House before Christmas. The Nowlan family need to hear that out of the tragedy concerning their son, Pierce, <Col N="657"/>hopefully some good will come in terms of the amended legislation going through the House today. They are to be commended for the bravery they have shown and their sense of public spirit in ensuring that their circumstance, tragic as it is and was, will lead to some positive reform of the law. As a relatively small group of citizens they have also shown an ability over a short period to affect a change in the law as a result of their participation in and initiation of a campaign. They are to be commended not only for dealing with their own issue, tragic as it is, but also the ramifications it will have for others. That it is coming at this time of the year is significant.</P>
      <P>This is a legislative assembly and it is not just here to discuss statements on lawn-mowers and bicycles every so often. As politicians it is our job to reform law that is outdated and needs to be amended and modernised. As my colleague, Senator Cummins, has said, the law in this area dates back to 1962. In his speech the Minister identified huge changes that are required within the Coroners Act 1962 to modernise it. I heard the Minister say in the other House that he hopes the heads of the Bill will go to Cabinet even before Christmas so that it can be published on his website early in the new year.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In regard to this case concerning Pierce Nowlan, the net issue highlighted by the coroner related to the number of medical witnesses that could be called to the inquest. This new change in the law will get rid of the existing bar on more than two medical witnesses. That is an important step forward and as Senator Jim Walsh has said there is also a much more modern up-dating of the law in terms of increasing penalties for those jurors and witnesses who refuse to co-operate or do not attend. On the issue of jurors for an inquest, does the existing age ban of 70 that applies in all other courts apply? As the Minister is aware a juror in the Irish criminal&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not. It is old-fashioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a good thing. I have raised this point previously. It is anachronistic and wrong that just because a person is 70 years of age he or she cannot serve on a jury. We need people of all ages, all experiences, all walks of life to take part in our jury system. The whole kernel of the criminal justice system is based on the notion that one is judged by one&rsquo;s peers and one&rsquo;s peers determine a result to courts. The age limit of 70 that exists in ordinary criminal cases should be amended. I am sure that in his reply the Minister will say it will be amended. I am pleased to hear it does not apply in this case. It is crazy that people who may have more free time than others would be debarred from taking party in a jury. I am glad it does not apply in this case because we need the widest possible group of people to be available.</P><Col N="658"/>
      <P>What I read about this case, and the other cases that have been mentioned, and specifically the lack of modernisation in the law concerning coroners and inquests, is that for far too long we have not taken this matter seriously enough. I welcome the fact that the Minister will bring forward the heads of a Bill to be debated soon as part of an ongoing consultation process. I assure him that if he brings forward a modernised Bill we will do our best on this side to bring it through the House swiftly when it comes before us.</P>
      <P>I reiterate my congratulations to the Labour Party, and particularly to Deputy Rabbitte, who single-handedly managed to bring the Bill to where it is today with Government support. It is a good day&rsquo;s work and those who are behind the campaign, specifically a family from my part of Dublin South-West, deserve all our credit for their public spiritedness and the way in which they have managed to change the law as a result of a tragedy that affected a member of their family.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Minister wants to get this Bill through before he even thinks about that.</P>
      <P>The Government, and especially the Minister, should be congratulated for facilitating this Bill and its swift passage through both Houses. The Minister could have decided to draft a Bill along the lines of the one before us but he rightly recognised that such legislation may not have endured the charge that it did not address the necessary reform. Alternatively, he could have presented a full Bill of the type currently being finalised but the likelihood of it being enacted before the taking of the highlighted case was very remote. The Government and all those associated must be congratulated for this initiative.</P>
      <P>As has been stated, the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme, announced at the beginning of the session, contained a commitment to replace the Coroners Act 1962 with a modern code of law which would establish a coroners service and transform the organisation. The Minister has confirmed that he intends to publish the heads of that Bill, which are quite comprehensive, and the consultation process will then take place. I welcome <Col N="659"/>that and believe it is the necessary and correct way to proceed.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding all of that, the Bill before us focuses on two specific deficiencies, namely, the restriction on the number of medical witnesses and the outdated sanctions for the non-attendance of a witness or juror. In a limited number of cases, these deficiencies have combined to hamper inquests. The Minister has met the Nowlan family and accepts that the current law could have created an injustice had it not been remedied. That is commendable and is the right way to proceed. Certain cases have helped to highlight the inadequacies of the current law and have proved the need for change. When a Government responds positively and political parties conspire to bring about that change, it is a good day for democracy.</P>
      <P>We recently debated the Statute Law Revision (Pre-1922) Bill in this House, which promotes the revision of statute law by repealing Acts passed before December 1922 that have ceased to be enforced or become unnecessary. In this case, the Coroners (Amendment) Bill seeks to abolish the outdated restriction that a coroner can only call two medical witnesses to give evidence at an inquest. This restriction could not be left in place because it had a detrimental impact on the conduct of inquests and I join with those, including many coroners, who have called for its removal.</P>
      <P>I join with previous speakers in congratulating the Nowlan family, who have highlighted their case. They need to be supported and commended for their bravery and civic spirit, as mentioned by Senator Brian Hayes. The Labour Party and Deputy Rabbitte, through Senator Tuffy, are to be congratulated for bringing the Bill to this stage, as are others who have been associated with highlighting the Nowlan case, notably Deputy O&rsquo;Connor and Senator Brian Hayes. The latter has spoken on this issue a number of times and has spoken to me about it in an effort to support the Minister in bringing this legislation through speedily. The Minister and the T&aacute;naiste, who also met the family, have shown an enormous interest in this case. The legislation will enable members of the Nowlan family to go to the coroner&rsquo;s court early next year and get the answers they seek. In that context, it is quite unusual that legislation enacted by us can have such a real impact in such a short space of time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and welcome his acceptance of this Bill, brought forward by Deputy Rabbitte. It is very important legislation and I am glad the Minister <Col N="660"/>did not wait until the bringing forward of the major Bill to which he referred. In that context, I hope the Leader will make sure that he brings that Bill to this House so we can deal comprehensively with it. It will be very satisfying legislation with which to deal.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary that it was 43 years before any attempt was made to change the provision regarding the number of medical witnesses. I assure the Minister that this change is welcomed by the coroners and the medical profession, with whom I have been in contact since this Bill came before the D&aacute;il. Medicine has changed enormously since 1962 and no one person can claim to be an expert on all of the medical facts that may come before an inquest. The very tragic case which was the catalyst for this legislation shows that clearly.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I would like to express my sympathy to the Nowlan family but also point out that something good has come out of the death of their young son. In this sad case, the child was a haemophiliac so not only would the doctor who was involved in the procedure which went wrong want to speak, but so too would those who had been treating the child up to that point and those who treated him after he became ill. A considerable number of people would want to give their facts to the inquest, facts which would be useful.</P>
      <P>One coroner told me that he recently spent seven hours going through medical evidence from one medical witness. He said it was hopeless because he was asking the witness about his knowledge on one area, then another and so on. Now coroners will be in a position to call in the experts in specific areas, which will be very worthwhile. After all, what we want to come out are the facts of what actually happened, not people&rsquo;s opinions.</P>
      <P>The Minister has removed the compellability section from the Bill. It is very much to be welcomed that the fines for non-attendance are much heavier, because as the Minister said, the previous fines would not even have covered a taxi fare to the inquest. There is now the threat of a substantial fine of &euro;3,000, six months in jail, or both. If a person refuses to attend an inquest, could the Attorney General take a case on behalf of the coroner? Would that be a possibility? One frequently reads of cases in the newspapers where people refuse to attend inquests, even though it is perfectly obvious that their attendance is of great importance. That is dreadful.</P>
      <P>I am always conscious of the fact that the legal profession is inclined to give the medical profession medical advice, so as a medical person I try to refrain from giving the legal profession legal advice. However, the Minister might look at this issue to determine if there is any way the Attorney General could take a case against people who do not co-operate. I know attempts have been made regarding compellability in the past and none has succeeded to date, but it is an important area.</P><Col N="661"/>
      <P>I look forward to seeing the heads of the aforementioned Bill before Easter 2006. I always think it is advisable to say to which Easter or which Christmas one is referring. I hope we will have the substantive Bill in this House very shortly thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and while it is true contrary views were expressed about him here, it was nothing like in the other House.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill but, of course, for the parents and family, nothing will bring back baby Pierce or remove their great sadness. I was thinking, as others were speaking, about how their hearts must have been sorely tried but they did not sit back. They could have been overwhelmed by their sadness and not seen a road ahead that they could take. It is a principle of democracy that if improvements can be made through the enactment of legislation in a proper way to remedy a deficient situation, it should be done. That is the way the Nowlan family approached this issue and Deputy Rabbitte is to be greatly admired for his involvement. He told me two weeks ago that this Bill would be coming to the Seanad and I told him that no matter when that was, we would fit it into the legislative agenda. I am glad that we did so and that Senator Tuffy is here, on behalf of her party, to deal with the Bill. It reflects well on the D&aacute;il and the Seanad because we are often criticised for &ldquo;Tom and Jerry&rdquo; politics. In this instance, a deficiency was noted and somebody, namely, Deputy Rabbitte, had the wit to see that it could be remedied and took action. He met the Minister and the Government and they chose to prepare legislation rather than make placards, go on marches and complain. They found a way to deal with the problem by amending part of an old Act so that differing facets of medical opinion could be given in the course of the inquest into the death of this child.</P>
      <P>It will alleviate many burdens on the family and allow them a serenity they would not otherwise have enjoyed. It is a triumph for democracy that various strands of political opinion were able to confront and deal successfully with a heart-rending situation. Many Ministers attempting to perform an act of legislative mercy have been told by officials that they could not do so because it would require major legislation, which the Bill represents. I was never Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform but I often wanted to do something and was told that it was impossible. As often as not, however, I had my way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Clearly, kindred spirits met in an intellectual and sympathetic way to produce this Bill. I commend the Minister and hope the Christmas of the Nowlan family will be eased in the knowledge that they have contributed, in a meaningful and democratic way, to a change in <Col N="662"/>the law that will have an effect on other inquests until the main Bill is finally enacted. I ask the Minister to introduce that Bill in this House where Senator Henry, as is always the case, and others such as Senator Jim Walsh will subject it to a forensic examination. This is a legislative Chamber and if we can do good, we will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank everybody for their kind comments about the Labour Party and its leader Deputy Rabbitte. In addition to raising the issue with the Minister and the Leader of the House, Deputy Rabbitte also impressed on me and colleagues in the Seanad the importance of the legislation and the need for it to have speedy passage through the House. Deputy Rabbitte clearly felt strongly that there was an anomaly that caused hardship and that could and must be addressed. Accordingly, he persuaded all sides of the House and we are now in a position to enact the necessary legislation into law.</P>
      <P>A few people made the important point that this legislation will assist many other cases, to a number of which the Minister referred. It is a major problem and needs to be addressed in a general sense, not just with particular reference to the Nowlan family. I support the comments of Senator Brian Hayes and others on the courage of Pierce&rsquo;s parents and family in raising this issue.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The comprehensive legislation will be welcome but if the Minister introduced it early next year, for example, at Easter, it would involve substantial consultation and scrutiny in joint and select committees and would have amendments proposed to it. It would be a substantial item of legislation containing many sections and would, therefore, be impossible to enact for a further year. That is why it is so important to bring it in now. I thank the Minister and his staff for taking that fact on board and I thank other Members of the House, including those on the Government benches, for their support.</P>

	<P>I will clarify. The Senator cannot speak to an amendment but he can speak to a section during the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
      <P Just="Left">
        Amendment No. 1 not moved.
      </P>

    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 3, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">&ldquo;<i>(b) </i>by the insertion of the following new section after section 32:</P>
      <P LI="3">32A&mdash;There shall be a duty on a coroner to include any notifiable diseases, as provided for under the Infectious Diseases (Amendment) (No. 3) Regulations 2003, on the verdict of any inquest he shall sign under section 32 of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P FLI="0">This point has arisen on a regular basis. There seems to be a lack of sharing of data, whether on the part of the Revenue Commissioners or other parties. Patients are dying from MRSA and the message in this regard is not necessarily relayed to the necessary State agencies. There is no pooling of information and it is difficult to ascertain the true figure as regards deaths arising from MRSA. I hope that if the amendment is not accepted, a follow-up Bill might be introduced by the next Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>

	<P>The Senators&rsquo; optimism is to be admired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought the Minister was about to give us the election date.</P>
      <P>Different agencies should pool information. We have seen examples of where the Department of Social and Family Affairs does not inform the Revenue Commissioners of information it holds and, as a result, people get caught out. People <Col N="664"/>need to be given the full picture about MRSA, which is a serious problem in our hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Bill, I am putting forward, for consideration by Government in the near future, all the policy and legal issues, including best practice for coroners, involved. Under the Infectious Diseases (Amendment) (No. 3) Regulations 2003, as soon as a medical practitioner becomes aware of or suspects that a person on whom he or she is in professional attendance is suffering from or is the carrier of a notifiable infectious disease or a clinical director of a diagnostic laboratory becomes aware that an infectious disease has been identified in that laboratory, he or she is required to transmit an electronic notification to a medical officer of health. Therefore, a provision of this kind exists. I do not think a notifiable disease will come to light in the course of a coroner&rsquo;s inquest if it had escaped the attention of everybody who had dealt with the death during the inquest.</P>
      <P>I accept the Senator&rsquo;s point that MRSA is very serious and that we should have proper statistics in respect of it. Where deaths occur as a result of it, they should be properly recorded. I am not sure whether MRSA is a notifiable disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>It is, since 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>That is interesting, because notifiable infectious diseases are much broader in their spread. Tuberculosis and other diseases are also involved.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>On a practical point, if I accepted this amendment I would have to bring the Bill back to the D&aacute;il and it would then have to wait until late January, so that its whole purpose would be frustrated. For that practical reason, regardless of the merits of the Senator&rsquo;s technical amendment, it would frustrate the purpose of expediting the Bill if I were to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>In light of the D&aacute;il rising today, I did not expect these amendments to be accepted, but felt there was an opportunity to put them on the record. We had a very good meeting recently with the Minister&rsquo;s colleague, the T&aacute;naiste, along with Deputies Breen and McGuinness, on the MRSA issue. It is shocking to think that people are swabbed when they go into hospital and are proven to have MRSA. It might not necessarily be contracted in the hospital but the hospital authorities would know people have MRSA, and people are not being informed. One might be told officially that they are, but they are not.</P>
      <P>I mentioned a case previously, involving a lady in a ward with four people. She discovered she had MRSA when the contract cleaner roared <Col N="665"/>across to a colleague to ask what mop he was using and told him not to use one particular mop because the lady had MRSA. Another lady found out by being told by a junior nurse, months after her husband had gone into hospital and was not making a recovery, and whose condition could not be diagnosed by those in charge.</P>
      <P>It is a very piecemeal approach. The T&aacute;naiste was shocked when she heard about it. I am not a medical expert but it makes common sense that a patient who has some disease should be told straightaway. A person who gives blood to the blood transfusion service in the morning has his or her blood screened. If anything shows up, such as hepatitis A, or even AIDS, God forbid, the person is notified straightaway by the Irish Blood Transfusion Service and counselling is provided.</P>
      <P Just="Left">That does not happen in hospitals. The amendment which I had hoped to insert today involves an issue at which the Minister should look when bringing forward the full coroners Bill in the new year. There should be an onus on a hospital authority to inform families or relatives of those who have passed away in hospitals while suffering from MRSA that they have the option of a coroner&rsquo;s inquest. If a person dies a so-called natural death there is no need for a coroner&rsquo;s inquest, but if one dies a so-called unnatural death, the right to a coroner&rsquo;s inquest is there. MRSA was listed as a notifiable and an infectious disease in 1994 and 2003, or so I understand &mdash; those were the key dates involved.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I recently sympathised with a person in Carlow whose father had been in St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital in Kilkenny and had been transferred back to St. Dympna&rsquo;s Hospital. When the man died, it was discovered that he had contracted MRSA in St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital, a fact to which the staff in St. Dympna&rsquo;s were never alerted, so that the man was put into a ward with other patients. There was a clear lack of information relay. I do not know if that is because of snobbery in the medical profession, that it feels patients would not understand the long words involved.</P>
      <P>There is an onus on hospitals in this area. People should be given information, and what they do with it afterwards is up to themselves. Many families are horrified when they discover, after a person has been buried, that they had the option of a coroner&rsquo;s inquest. Many people might not want an inquest, and that is fine, which is why I inserted the word &ldquo;option&rdquo; in the amendment. The amendment has not been accepted today but the Minister might consider drafting another such amendment to the Bill in the new year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I support much of what Senator Browne has said on this section. During the recent tragedy we had in Wexford, when people were lost off the south coast, members of one of the families, as they waited each day in Kilmore for news of their lost brother, told me that their father had taken ill because of the trauma and ended up in Waterford Regional Hospital, where <Col N="666"/>he was suffering from MRSA. There is a need to address the issues. In that regard, the audit recently undertaken by the T&aacute;naiste is a step in the right direction but we must get to the stage where people are held accountable. That is the thrust of a coroner&rsquo;s inquest in situations where people should perhaps have taken action, or where their inaction has led to serious outcomes.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I do not know how this issue can be related to or brought into the impending revised coroners Bill but it should be considered and beefed up so that everyone treats it as the priority it is. The situation is not good enough. I mentioned one circumstance but there are many similar ones to which people could allude. The circumstances in which the family members I spoke of found themselves compounded their trauma and tragedy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with the sentiments expressed by Senator Cummins. I pay tribute to Deputy Rabbitte for his initiative and to the Minister and his staff for accommodating and facilitating the passage of the Bill so quickly. Hopefully it will be of some small comfort to the Nowlan family. There will also be other beneficiaries of the changes in legislation and we look forward to the more comprehensive Bill which will be before us in the next session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>

	<P>I concur with the previous speakers and again extend my congratulations to everyone associated, including the Labour Party and the speakers and those who have contributed to the debate in both Houses and brought along the legislation to where it now is. I hope that legislation such as this will have an immediate impact and will help bring about a certain justice to the Nowlan family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank everyone for facilitating the bringing forward of this legislation and for their <Col N="667"/>kind words with regard to the Labour Party. In particular I thank the Minister and his Department for accepting the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I join in the genuine thanks to the proposers of this Bill. What a pleasure it has been to participate among Deputies in the other House and Members of this House in a process whereby the legislation was passed so speedily.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to bring the new Bill into law in the lifetime of this Government. I will take heed of what the Leader has said and will propose to my colleagues in Government that the new Bill be initiated in this House because I know it would get the kind of debate it needs. There will be plenty of pressure on the other House in the next 14 months so it is a good idea to have a good deal of legislation first considered in this House, where it can get the time it deserves.</P>
      <P Just="Left">One of the points I discussed with the Nowlan family when they came to visit me in my Department was the interpretation of that section because, as I pointed out, if one fell down the stairs at a medical convention, is the mere fact all the witnesses were doctors a reason for limiting the number of witnesses at the inquest or is it purely related on a narrow point to the actual medical cause of death and debate on that issue?</P>
      <P>Members might be interested to know that the case of the Eastern Health Board <i>v.</i> Farrell was one in which the health board and the coroner tested in court whether the three-in-one vaccine could be a proximate cause of death. The reason I know the case is that I participated in the coroner&rsquo;s inquest, although not in the court proceedings. To go back to what Senator Jim Walsh said, we must be fair in mind. Do we want corners&rsquo; inquests to turn into huge debates on whether the three-in-one vaccine does or does not have adverse medical consequences or whatever? That is the type of issue which must be dealt with. When one says one wants to widen the scope of a coroner&rsquo;s inquest, it cannot turn into a vast tribunal of inquiry to which witnesses are flown in from around the world to state what surveys have proved internationally.</P><Col N="668"/>
      <P>On what the Leader said, I have to admit this is not a case where I had to persuade my officials to adopt this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>That is nice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It was quite the reverse. They tried to persuade me that instead of going ahead with the big project, I might be wiser to go ahead with the smaller one. This was a case where I said &ldquo;No&rdquo;, that I wanted to go ahead with the big project. In effect, Deputy Rabbitte and the Nowlan family came to my aid by creating a situation in which we could do both. In case it is thought that hard-hearted officials were prevailed on by a mean-minded Minister, that was not so &mdash; in fact, it was the reverse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The Labour Party and the Progressive Democrats can work together after all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">When the Nowlan family visited me to explain their particular position that unless the law was changed soon their inquest would effectively be aborted, the situation was one in which, in effect, one could not make a decision other than the one I chose to make. I do not claim to have any special powers of generosity. Pierce&rsquo;s parents explained to me all the circumstances surrounding his death and the fact he ran away from them down the corridor to have this operation done and that was the last they saw of him alive. We must bear in mind that we could not deny them justice. It has been said hard cases make bad law but I do not believe that on this occasion. I believe hard cases are making good law.</P>
      <P>I thank Members for their ongoing kindness and I wish them a happy and holy Christmas.</P>
