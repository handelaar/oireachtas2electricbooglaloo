	<P>I have received notice from Senator Tuffy that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to intervene under the relevant industrial relations legislation to ensure as a prerequisite and in the context of any settlement with An Post and SDS workers that a commitment would be made to paying the Sustaining Progress increases and that arrears would be paid as a matter of urgency, including to pensioners.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, statements on food safety, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 1 p.m, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes, those of other Senators not to exceed eight minutes and the Minister to be called on to reply not later than five minutes before the end of the statements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday I raised the issue of the helpline set up in respect of nursing homes charges with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs when he was in the House. If the Government wanted to set up a fair and efficient system, it could not have gone about it in a worse way. Ten people are staffing the helpline and, according to the Minister for Health and Children, 37,000 telephone calls were logged in one day by those ten people. She has also said she does not have the resources to provide additional staff.</P>
      <P>The Health Service Executive comprises various regions, including the south and the mid-west. Surely, it would have been possible to leave <Col N="1106"/>it up to these regions with the Health Service Executive providing a co-ordinating influence. The people staffing the helpline in Tullamore are only logging the queries and are concentrating on people who were in public nursing homes. There will be chaos.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, on behalf of a constituent and out of curiosity, I stayed on the line for 28 minutes before somebody answered my call. The person could not answer my question about whether people who were in private nursing homes should submit applications at this stage. I was told they were concentrating on people who were in public nursing homes, although many of the queries we are getting relate to people who were in private nursing homes. The reason we are getting queries from such people is that the 2001 Act, which introduced medical cards for people aged over 70 years, stated that they were entitled to care and services. Many of those people believe they are entitled to refunds.</P>
      <P>We must wait for the Travers report. The T&aacute;naiste said she could probably get an international agency involved to determine the pay out structure, etc., and how we approach this issue. There has been much furore about and apportioning of blame politically in respect of this saga, which we must rectify. Will the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children seriously consider the approach that has been adopted? The fact that 37,000 calls were logged in one day by ten people does not mean 37,000 people were attended to because I assure the House that people will not wait 28 minutes for their call to be answered and will hang up out of frustration. There is no point someone in the Limerick area with a query telephoning a helpline in Tullamore, County Offaly &mdash; I mean no disrespect to that area. This issue has been handled badly. The way I have suggested is the way to go about it.</P>
      <P>I raise the implications of the decision to withdraw funding for Intel which was in excess of &euro;50 million. The only competition for Intel business comes from Singapore and China. I wish to discuss the implications of the Government&rsquo;s decision to withdraw the request it made to the EU to be allowed to grant State aid to Intel. The application encountered difficulties because the amount of funding the Government proposed to grant was more than &euro;50 million. Although the European Union has grown, the only competition Ireland faces for Intel&rsquo;s business comes from countries like Singapore and China. If we are in Europe, we are in Europe. It is regrettable that the funding cannot be provided. Intel will proceed with the project at its plant, fortunately, but it has expressed some reservations about future investment in Ireland. Yesterday&rsquo;s developments do not send out a positive signal.</P>
      <P>I will not discuss the unemployment problems in my local area in County Limerick because they have been mentioned. If the Government were to refer to locations which are affected by high <Col N="1107"/>unemployment in its future attempts to convince the EU to allow it to support inward investment projects, perhaps the Commission would take a different attitude. Fortunately, the Commission has not needed to examine many projects in this country which require investment of more than &euro;50 million. Intel, the IDA and the Government should note recent developments and take remedial action accordingly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the House to welcome the Government&rsquo;s indication yesterday that it intends to support what it calls the &ldquo;western rail corridor&rdquo;, which is referred to by Senators as the &ldquo;Sligo-Waterford-Rosslare line&rdquo;. I have raised this issue in the House at least three times a year for the past 15 years. The House would appreciate an opportunity to discuss the matter with the Minister for Transport, or another representative of the Government. I would like to know how the project will proceed. For example, what timeframe will it have? The last time the matter was raised in the House, Senators were told that the McCann report would be ready by early February of this year, but it now seems that it will not be ready until the middle of April.</P>
      <P>I would like the relevant authorities to produce a plan that indicates clearly that the project will be pursued almost immediately. Plans should be put in place to start working on the railway line in three or four areas and not just at the top or bottom of it. I would like this House to propose to the Government that the project should begin in three or four places &mdash; south of Sligo, between Tuam and Galway and between Ennis and Galway, for example.</P>
      <P>The proposed link from the Limerick-Ennis line to Shannon Airport was not mentioned by the Government yesterday. The reopening of the western rail corridor is the single most significant prospect in the BMW region. There will be a working north-south infrastructural link of quality in that area for the first time. We should ensure that we keep our foot on the pedal in this regard by giving the project every encouragement and continuing the discussion in this House. I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the matter as soon as the McCann report is presented and available. I think the proposal will receive wide support on both sides of the House.</P>
      <P>A throwaway comment made by the Taoiseach yesterday about the future of the national pensions reserve fund warrants further examination because it was extraordinarily interesting. He said demographic factors might mean it will no longer be necessary, within a short number of years, for us to continue to pay 1% of GNP into the national pensions reserve fund each year. The Taoiseach&rsquo;s statement coincided with the news yesterday that three quarters of the new jobs created in this country last year were taken by immigrant workers. Both factors indicate clearly <Col N="1108"/>that change is coming. The Taoiseach is probably right. The national pensions reserve fund was established some years ago on the basis that within 20 years, two or three people would be depending on every working person. As a consequence of the influx of workers from other countries, it no longer looks like that ratio will be accurate.</P>
      <P>I would like the Government to outline the current position in this regard. The basis on which the Government makes its plans is never properly explained to this House. We often discuss health, education and housing, but I would like a Minister to come to the House to discuss related matters such as demographics, the birth rate and our dependency ratio. Decisions are made on the basis of a logical extrapolation of information that is available. It is simply a statistical exercise. We need to hear from somebody who makes judgments on the likely position in 15 or 20 years.</P>
      <P>The release of moneys from the national pensions reserve fund would have a significant impact on infrastructural projects. It would be the most significant thing we could do. I have supported the national pensions reserve fund from the beginning, when it needed to be established. That does not mean it has to be continued, however. We need to consider how the moneys can be released. I would like the Minister for Finance to indicate how he thinks this matter will develop.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>Last Christmas, the Department of Social and Family Affairs gave two payments, instead of one, to recipients of certain social welfare allowances such as invalidity payment, carer&rsquo;s allowance and retirement pensions. The double payments received a great deal of attention in the media at that time. Various people, including representatives of sectoral groups, called on the Government to allow those who received an extra payment to keep it, on the basis that the error originated in the Department and was not the fault of the recipients. The Department decided to claw back the additional payments in the first week of January. However, there was a difference between the remuneration that was overpaid in December and the level that was clawed back in January. I refer to the increase of &euro;10 that would have applied in some cases in the first week of January. Given that 40,000 people were affected by this move, one can work out that a considerable amount of money was involved.</P>
      <P>I have asked the Department to give me details of the number of people who were affected by this event, but I have not received an official response. I asked how many overpayments were made, for example. If payments were withheld because an increase of &euro;10 was involved in the first week of January by virtue of the increase in social welfare payments, when will the moneys be repaid to those from whom it has been withheld? <Col N="1109"/>I ask the Leader to seek clarification from the relevant Minister in this regard.</P>
      <P>There have been media reports in recent days about the conditions in which the killers of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe are being held. A newspaper referred to an official report that suggested the killers have a major say in the running of the bungalows which form part of Castlerea Prison. The reports are disturbing for the family of Detective Garda McCabe and all others who were affected by the appalling tragedy of his death. The reports will damage public confidence in this country&rsquo;s prison system. I ask the Leader to seek clarification from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in respect of this issue.</P>
      <P>I would like to discuss an airline, other than Aer Lingus, which has origins in this country. The airline, of which the Leader has had previous experience, was fined in the UK this week for violating that country&rsquo;s consumer protection laws and misleading customers about prices. The airline&rsquo;s reputation was built on low fares. It has sold most of its flights on the basis that it provides a low-cost service. In this case, the airline was fined because it did not make clear the full cost of seats.</P>
      <P>Many Senators have called in recent times for debates on over-pricing and other issues which affect consumers financially. We should ensure that the problems which have been encountered in respect of this airline in the UK do not recur in this country. We need to be aware that an airline that operates in this country has been fined in another jurisdiction. We should ensure that it complies with the law of the land and does not take advantage of consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader consider arranging a debate on substance abuse, with particular emphasis on under-age drinking? Perhaps such a discussion could take place in the context of a motion that would allow for contributions from all sides, in the presence of the relevant Minister. I am calling for the debate following reports today in the media of comments made by Bishop Forristal about the confirmation pledge. I am sure many Senators are used to the pledge being given publicly, but the church has recently adopted what it calls a &ldquo;silent pledge&rdquo;. I confess that I cannot understand the logic behind the change. As David Quinn wrote in today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Independent</i>, when the promise was made publicly, there was a greater emphasis on ensuring it was kept.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Leader agrees we should commend the compassion of Fr. Miche&aacute;l MacGr&eacute;il and the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association and encourage an initiative taken by the association. I confess that I was not aware of the existence of the special under-age pledge that has been introduced in schools, even though approximately 15,000 people between the ages of eight and 12 have taken it. That there is a need for people of such a young age to have a special pioneer pin is a sad reflection on our society. My <Col N="1110"/>speech is not intended in any way as an apologia for the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association, of which I am a member. I know that many Senators on all sides of the House are involved in the organisation. Our society has reached a crisis point due to the prevalence of under-age drinking and the abuse of drugs, including alcohol.</P>
      <P>I learned yesterday that one of the reasons many young Irish people are not applying for J1 visas to travel to the United States for the summer does not relate to economics. That they have decided not to go there because a law in that country ensures that one cannot purchase alcohol until one is 21 years of age is a sad reflection on Irish society. It is past time for a debate in the House on the matter. Such a debate would be valued and all sides of the House could contribute to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>In early 2002 the Government withdrew the disability Bill and promised it would reintroduce a Bill that would be meaningful and helpful and which would respond to the needs of many people with disabilities. In the meantime, a new version of the Bill has been produced but it has not satisfied the various organisations dealing with people with disabilities and their parents. The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Bill has been introduced under the aegis of the Minister for Education and Science. Like the other Bills, it also promised much.</P>
      <P>All of us read with horror a story in today&rsquo;s newspaper about a family in Kells in County Meath with four children suffering from autism. Both parents had to give up their jobs and are now full-time carers. They have about two hours&rsquo; rest per day in which to sleep. Both the Department of Health and Children, through the aegis of the Health Service Executive, and the Department of Education and Science have failed this family miserably. The needs of the family were assessed over a year ago and the parents have been at loggerheads in every way with the Health Service Executive regarding their efforts to be granted the supports they need. The executive has failed. The family has been on a waiting list for education places for two years. Every day, Ministers criss-cross the constituency of Meath. I ask that one of them, be she responsible for health or education, call to this family and guarantee it, once and for all, that there is somebody willing to help.</P>
      <P>In a letter in yesterday&rsquo;s <i>Irish Times</i>, a homeless person is quoted as having said: &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t see you now, they examine you on the computer and give you a piece of paper, then you leave.&rdquo; If this represents the stage we have reached in this country, it is very bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonScanlon"><NameTxt>Mr. Scanlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s comments on the western rail corridor. I welcome the comments made in this regard by the <Col N="1111"/>Taoiseach in the D&aacute;il yesterday and also the Government&rsquo;s support for rail infrastructure. The West on Track committee, the McCann committee, had a meeting last Friday. It has produced a report, which is to be forwarded to the Minister early next week. I hope it will lead to further developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Toole, in asking for a debate on the national pensions reserve fund which would be very useful. In the debate, we should consider the wider aspects of pension provision, particularly the disgraceful anomalies that exist. I refer in particular to the case of an Army pensioner who wrote to me. He was a contributor to the contributory pension scheme but he has had one subtracted from the other. This is an anomaly because younger Army personnel do not suffer from this and given the enormous sums of money in the national pensions reserve fund, the decent approach is to pay the victims of this type of mean-minded anomaly.</P>
      <P>When we have looked after pensioners, perhaps we could build a metro with the rest of the pension fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>In Roscommon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no doubt that we could put one into Roscommon eventually. I have no problem using the money on infrastructural projects if we do not need it.</P>
      <P>On the matter raised by Senator Finucane, namely, the Intel investment, the position is slightly different from that which he outlined. There were four competitor areas which included China, as identified correctly by the Senator, Singapore, Israel and North America. There was a very useful radio programme on the subject this morning. It would be useful to debate the issue in the House. I would like to hear from Senator O&rsquo;Toole and Senator Ross, who has very clear knowledge of this area and expertise therein. It seems extraordinary that the European Union would cut off its nose to spite its face. There was no internal competition within Europe for this investment. We were not competing against France or Germany or some such country. Why should the Union not compete against Singapore, China and Israel?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Unless there is something I have not spotted, I believe it should do so. The only argument that the representative of the Union came up with was that the type of grants in question could spark off a kind of auction in which countries with deeper pockets, such as France, would outbid us. I do not find that argument very convincing. The RTE economics correspondent, George Lee, was absolutely fascinating, very clear and determined. As politicians, we should <Col N="1112"/>be equally determined in following up the interests of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the calls by Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Scanlon for a debate, to be held as soon as possible, on the western rail corridor and the development of the rail infrastructure. It is of vital importance to the development of the entire west. Those of us who are now canvassing daily realise the pressures associated with travelling from Meath and Kildare to the city centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the result of seven years of bad Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should stick to the sales.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator knows well that there is good management by a good Government. This will be reinforced when we go to the polls next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Dooley, on the Order of Business please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I digressed for a moment to put Senator Bannon in his box.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not in order on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Bannon was also out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Cathaoirleach will agree that it would be useful to have a debate at the earliest opportunity to ensure that as much momentum as possible is given to the report on the rail corridor. This would ensure a counterbalance along the western seaboard so that people living there will have the same type of service as people on the eastern seaboard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with our deputy Leader on the public disquiet over the shabby handling of the helplines set up by the Health Service Executive to provide information on securing for the elderly those moneys that were taken illegally from them by various health boards. Many constituents have contacted me about the lengthy periods they have had to wait on the helplines. Will the Leader ask the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, who has taken full responsibility for health, to address the problem before the public lose confidence in the system?</P>
      <P>Will the Leader invite the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the House to debate the establishment of an audit commission to assess the performance of local authorities? As we all know, the public assesses the performance of elected members, but elected <Col N="1113"/>members sometimes adopt policies that are not implemented by the executives, thus resulting in a very serious problem. The public deserves an audit commission. It is important and would warrant a debate in the House. Such a debate might go some way towards addressing the fact that the policies of the elected members are not being implemented. I gleaned evidence of this from several counties. We should grade those councils that perform extremely well. Many councils have performed extremely well in the areas of housing, environmental services and roads, for example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has his point made adequately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Other executives are quite negligent and are not implementing council policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Other Senators wish to contribute. I call Senator Leyden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the former distinguished Member, Maureen Quill, and her sister.</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>That is out of order.</P>

	<P>Is it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should speak on the Order of Business. I know that Senators used to welcome former Members but it is out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Nonetheless, she is welcome. Senator Finucane has mentioned the 1800 telephone line. I called that line twice this morning and received replies within minutes.</P>

	<P>That is the &ldquo;Terry line&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>Maybe Senator Finucane should try again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should confine himself to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>This is on the Order of Business because Senator Finucane has given a false impression of the Health Service Executive.</P>

	<P>Does Senator Leyden have a question under the Order of Business? He should speak through the Chair.</P>

	<P>I made no reference to Senator Leyden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Leyden should speak on the Order of Business. He has given an idea of what Senator Finucane said which is not in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Leyden gets away with that all the time.</P>

	<P>It would be helpful&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should withdraw his comment. I did not make an incorrect statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the Leader&rsquo;s duty to comment on what Senator Finucane said, not Senator Leyden&rsquo;s. The Senator should speak on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Order of Business, I am referring to the long-stay care repayments information helpline and the response I received this morning to two calls to that line. I also logged on to <i>www.hse.ie</i> and I received the national&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Will the Leader arrange for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children to come into the House after the by-elections to consider this matter further? The forms have been sent out but they refer to people claiming on behalf of the person named. Fifty people voted in the Sacred Heart Hospital in Roscommon to the effect that they are quite capable of submitting a claim themselves and do not need a solicitor or anybody else to make the claim on their behalf.</P>

	<P>I support the remarks of Senators Norris and Finucane on the issue of Intel and multinationals. It is appropriate that we have an early debate on what has happened there. Too often the House decides to have debates on matters which are irrelevant by the time we come to discuss them.</P>
      <P>We may generally be running riot with EU rules and I am not sure whether that is good or bad. Intel is not the only case of this kind which has given rise to concern at the Commission in the past week. It is about to intervene to say that RTE is abusing its position with its use of the licence fee in a non-competitive way. The Commission is concerned with the public sector as well as the private sector.</P>
      <P>We should have a serious debate on this issue and the Government&rsquo;s attitude to it, by inviting the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to the House. It is stunning to see that the Government appears surprised at the EU Commission&rsquo;s decision. It withdrew quickly in the face of this opposition which could have serious long-term consequences for inward investment. We might need to reconsider our economic direction. It would be useful to have a serious debate on this before the end of next week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s call for a debate on the national pensions reserve fund. The fund was an enlightened initiative which afforded no political advantage to the Minister at the time. It recognised the changing demographics which there will be a continuing need to address.</P>
      <P>I would be very concerned if funding for this were abandoned. It could be funded at a lower level. I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole that a debate might encompass how we could use the fund productively in much needed infrastructure, such as roads and public transport which would yield a payback.</P>
      <P>The example of National Toll Roads shows this would be a prudent investment because it is making at least high double figures in its internal rate of returns on the small sum invested in the Westlink toll bridge. We also need to consider the traffic congestion that bridge is causing. We asked before for a debate specifically on that bottleneck which is a cash cow for National Toll Roads.</P><Col N="1116"/>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate before Easter on the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights on the Dublin-Monaghan bombings? In particular, we need to discuss the failure of the British authorities to co-operate with the inquiry, highlighted in that report. This underlines the criticism made by Mr. Justice Barron, who chaired that inquiry. The Oireachtas committee&rsquo;s report illustrates that failure as a significant breach of the Good Friday Agreement. This House should address this urgently.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>Together with Senators Mooney and Leyden, I have asked that we debate the issue of Irish people living and working illegally in the United States. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs held a most productive meeting yesterday with the US ambassador. He gave strong indications of the Bush Administration&rsquo;s constructive proposals on immigration. It is important nationally, and at a European level, that we are seen to support and push these proposals forward. It would be helpful to debate the issue here.</P>
      <P>Reference was made this morning to an airline the name of which we dare not mention. The most noteworthy issue concerning that company this week is one the House should note with great satisfaction, namely, that early indications show the company has booked 200,000 passengers to fly out of Shannon Airport. We should comment on and praise that sort of enterprise and initiative. It will transform Shannon and the western region. I welcome the progress made in that regard.</P>

I welcome his commitment to the western rail corridor and look forward to funding being advanced as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney raised the issue of teenage drinking. Maybe we should debate this again. The problem has been debated many times and much has been done, for example, legislation has been introduced that results in the closure of many pubs and off-licence, sometimes for weeks, for serving drink to teenagers. No Name clubs have been reintroduced. Groups such as Barnardos asked politicians such as myself to sign a pledge <Col N="1117"/>not to be seen in public with an alcoholic drink, and I was proud and happy to oblige them. This has been a good stance. Perhaps there should be a debate in this House to try to ensure that under-age drinking is curbed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;was very positive this morning and gave a very instructive commentary on the whole matter.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole who asked for a debate on the western rail corridor when the report is published. He said the recommendations should be implemented quickly as it is in the BMW region and it has North-South implications. He also referred to the national pensions reserve fund and said that he listened to what the Taoiseach said. The fund, which has been up and running for a few years, is worthy of debate. We need to get an up-to-date picture of the fund and a likely estimate for the future.</P>
      <P>Senator McCarthy referred to the double social welfare payments. The sum of &euro;10 for 40,000 people is a fair amount of money. I got a letter yesterday on the issue. I will make inquiries on the matter and get back to the Senator. He also referred to the report on the McCabe murder and Castlerea Prison. The Taoiseach answered that query yesterday in the other House. He was adamant about the matter. The Senator also referred to a man and an airline about which we cannot speak.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator made the point that consumer law applies here as well as in the UK, and that any misdemeanours should be followed up here, which I hope will be the case.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney asked for a debate on the crisis point under-age drinking has reached. Senator Ulick Burke referred to the Disability Bill, about which he is correct. It was withdrawn almost three years ago and produced again. As it was being processed, it was worked through with <Col N="1118"/>a consultative group. It appeared to be progressing satisfactorily when suddenly the temperature changed. The Senator also spoke of the family in Meath, by which we were all touched. To have four offspring who suffer from autism is a huge burden for any family. The Senator said the family should be visited by someone who can give them direct help.</P>
      <P>Senator Scanlon referred to the western rail corridor, which is of great interest to him and his neighbourhood. Senator Norris referred to an Army pensioner whom I heard speaking very positively about the Senator on Joe Duffy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo;. He said the Senator is a wonderful person who replied to his letter and so on. The Senator raised the question of a pension anomaly of a long-serving Army man. He also referred to Intel. He said that the company is not competing against an accession country or any country already in Europe, but that it was competing with the wider world, which is a fair point. Intel has assured the public, particularly the public in Leixlip, that it will continue with its investment.</P>
      <P>Senator Dooley raised the issue of the western rail corridor. Senator Bannon raised the matter of the helpline. He called for the Minister for Health and Children to come to this House to debate the matter. He is seeking a league table on the behaviour of officials, not members, of local authorities. That is quite daring but it would be very good if it happened.</P>
      <P>Senator Leyden also spoke on this issue. He must have some great alchemy which allows him to get through, which he did. He laid his experience before us, which is fair enough. He called for the T&aacute;naiste to come to the House to debate the matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross asked for a debate on Intel and the RTE licence fee, which it is said has no competitive element. Senator Walsh asked for a debate on the national pensions reserve fund and the Barron report. It is alleged that the British Government has failed to come forward with evidence which would help the compilation of the report. The Taoiseach&rsquo;s office is to come back to me on the matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Bradford referred to the issue of illegal immigrants in the US and asked what can be done about it following the meeting yesterday. He also referred to a certain airline and said that we should become a cheer group for it. The Senator can count me out of the chorus line.</P>
      <P>Senator Tuffy raised the issue of the Labour Party proposal to take a percentage of the national pensions reserve fund for infrastructural projects. The fund was the idea of the former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy.</P>
      <P>Senator Feighan welcomed the Taoiseach&rsquo;s support for the western rail corridor. He also referred to under-age drinking and the Barnardos pledge. I did not sign that pledge because one could be attending a meeting in a pub and have a glass of water in one&rsquo;s hand. How can one say <Col N="1119"/>one would never be photographed in a pub with a glass in one&rsquo;s hand?</P>

    <Title>Food Safety: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The recent widely reported contamination of food products with an industrial dye &mdash; Sudan Red 1 &mdash; has given rise to legitimate concerns in the minds of consumers regarding the safety of food sold in our shops and served by restaurants and other catering<?oasys [jy?>outlets.</P>
      <P>As has been widely reported, Sudan Red 1 is a synthetically produced red dye normally used for colouring solvents, oils, waxes, petrol and shoe and floor polishes. The International Agency for Research on Cancer, which operates under the World Health Organisation, rates this dye as a &ldquo;class 3&rdquo; carcinogen, or cancer-causing agent. Needless to say, it has no place in the foodchain but has been illegally used to enhance the colour of chilli powder and to increase its commercial value.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to come before the Seanad to set out to Members and the public the position regarding this particular occurrence, the action taken by the responsible authorities within the State in response, the wider EU regulatory framework and, most importantly, the implications for the health of the public.</P>
      <P>I wish to put my remarks in context. The globalisation of the foodchain in recent years means that foodstuffs that not long ago were only available to most people as an occasional luxury or at certain times of the year are now available in a wide range of outlets at affordable prices. The potential downside is that there is increased vulnerability to contamination of a large number of food products by one rogue ingredient. In such a situation, the protection of consumers must take precedence over all other concerns. Therefore, it is vital that we have effective food safety controls in place. For member states of the European Union, almost all food controls now originate at EU rather than at national level.</P>
      <P>Equally important is the need for food business operators to discharge their responsibilities. Recent changes to European food safety legislation have moved the responsibility for food safety from enforcement agencies to producers. For example, the food industry must ensure it <Col N="1120"/>only sources and uses wholesome and safe raw materials. All food businesses must also have robust traceability systems in place which record the ingredients and food products received, and their origin. In addition, systems must record what products are dispatched to which customers, the only exception being direct supply to final consumers.</P>
      <P>However, responsibility does not rest solely with producers. Member states and the European Commission retain important responsibilities. For example, the European Commission operates a rapid alert system for food and feed. This e-mail based system connects EU member states with the Commission and with the European Food Safety Authority. The network is designed for the speedy communication of food problems originating or discovered in one member state which may pose threats to consumers in another. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, is our contact point for the network.</P>
      <P>With regard to Sudan Red 1, the sharing of information through the network first alerted food control authorities across the EU to the contamination of food products with this unapproved dye. Following the detection of the dye, which occurred in May 2003, a risk analysis was conducted and this led to the introduction of new EU rules in July 2003. These rules required that chilli powder imported into the European Union had to be tested and certified free of Sudan Red 1. At the same time, all member states were required to monitor and test products on the market for the illegal dye.</P>
      <P>As with all additives, the use of colours in foods is strictly regulated. Only those additives on an approved list may be used under restricted circumstances. As Sudan Red 1 is not on an approved list, its use in foodstuffs is banned. The developments at EU level from May to July 2003 had the effect of introducing a more rigorous monitoring system for a dye that was already banned.</P>
      <P>The current situation originated in the UK. While investigations by the UK authorities are continuing, it appears that the batch of contaminated chilli powder at the centre of the recent food recalls, five tonnes in total, was imported into the UK in 2002, prior to the introduction of the current import arrangements. The company involved used the batch to produce Crosse and Blackwell Worcester sauce. This sauce in turn was sold to almost 200 food businesses that used it as an ingredient in about 470 food products. Contaminated food products were then distributed to at least 15 countries around the world, including Ireland, leading to the recent series of product recalls.</P>
      <P>Recalls and withdrawals of food from the market for whatever reason can occur from time to time. However, contamination across such a wide range of products is unprecedented and has <Col N="1121"/>resulted in the largest food recall in Ireland to date.</P>
      <P>I wish to outline the sequence of recent events to put on record the response of the Irish food safety authorities. The appropriate official agency, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, was informed of the problem on 15 February. The notification came from the equivalent UK body, the Food Standards Agency. Based on the information received, the FSAI identified and contacted Irish food manufacturers and distributors on 16 February. Since then, the authority has continued to work with food business operators to identify the affected products on the market and remove them from sale. The FSAI also sought to inform consumers about the nature and extent of the problem through the media and its advice line and website.</P>
      <P>Thereafter, the authority took further action. On 17 February, all major retailers were contacted in writing and advised to ensure the removal of affected products from sale and to inform consumers at the point of sale of the recall to enable them to identify and return affected products. In addition, manufacturers based in Ireland were reminded of the need to notify the public if any of their products were implicated. On 18 February, the FSAI issued a press release containing the full list of identified products known at that time. The list was placed on the FSAI website and was published in the press. The operation of the advice line for consumer inquiries also commenced on 18 February.</P>
      <P>In a further response to the situation, on Monday, 20 February, an updated list of contaminated products was published on the FSAI website and was distributed to all retailers. Additional written advice issued to retailers to ensure that all operators, including small stores, were aware of the recall and had taken action to remove affected products from sale. On 21 February, further instructions were issued to retailers, wholesalers and caterers regarding the identification and removal of affected products from premises.</P>
      <P>In setting out the above sequence of events, I have gone into considerable detail but it is important to provide this level of factual information to reassure Senators and the wider public that effective and timely action was taken by the relevant authorities in response to a rapidly changing situation.</P>
      <P>The practical outcome of this series of actions was that, in all, approximately 60 products have been recalled from the Irish market. These include ready-made meals such as shepherd&rsquo;s pie, pasta bake, chicken wings, sausage casserole, pizza and chilli con carne. Some of the country&rsquo;s biggest domestic and multinational food businesses are involved. The food industry co-operated well with the FSAI in identifying and removing affected products from sale, as the public is entitled to expect.</P><Col N="1122"/>
      <P>The key concern for my Department is the potential risk to consumers&rsquo; health. The scientific evidence shows clearly that Sudan Red 1 is a carcinogen. While exposure to a carcinogen increases the risk of cancer, it does not automatically mean that an exposed person will develop cancer. By way of a parallel, we all know that smoking causes cancer but smoking one cigarette will not cause cancer. The issue of concern is exposure to a carcinogen over a period of time, while the level of exposure is also a factor. Nevertheless, consumers are entitled to demand that they are not exposed to such substances and the aim must be to ensure they are not. It is not possible to quantify precisely the risk posed by Sudan Red 1. The FSAI advises that at the levels found in the affected food products, the risk of anyone developing cancer specifically because of its presence is small or very small.</P>
      <P>There is also an issue in regard to the continuing monitoring for Sudan Red 1. Since 2003, when the new EU rules on the importation of chilli powders were introduced, member states have increased routine testing of products that might contain Sudan Red 1. This monitoring has been conducted in Ireland by the FSAI and by the official agencies which operate our national food surveillance programme. The surveillance programme was already in place but was adapted to check for the presence of Sudan Red 1 in response to the EU measure. During 2004, a total of 166 products were collected by environmental health officers and sent for laboratory testing. Of the 166 samples, four tested positive for Sudan 1 &mdash; three curry sauces and one sample of curry beans. The contaminated products were removed from the market and destroyed and the surveillance programme continues.</P>
      <P>In such circumstances it is entirely understandable that consumers are worried about potential health implications and steps were taken to provide this information. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland&rsquo;s helpline took 650 calls in one day, as much as it normally takes in a month. Similarly, the FSAI website was in big demand &mdash; receiving 22,000 hits in one day compared with normal levels of about 400. FSAI staff took part in 54 radio interviews and answered numerous other press queries. This effort was designed to ensure that the public received timely and factual information in response to their very genuine concerns.</P>
      <P>Situations such as these require careful judgment. If the authorities act too slowly while awaiting full information, they will be accused of complacency but if they act too hastily, without adequate knowledge, they are open to the accusation of scaremongering. When the FSAI was established it was given a clear remit to put the interest of consumers first. I am satisfied that the FSAI acted rapidly and responsibly in the interests of consumers by providing full information and by working with other agencies and <Col N="1123"/>the food industry to ensure that affected products were speedily removed from the market.</P>
      <P>Finally, I must turn to the food sector itself, which has the primary responsibility for food safety. Just as not every workplace can have an industrial inspector on site all the time, every food outlet cannot have an inspector on the premises all the time. No matter how vigilant the food control authorities are, the reality is that only the industry can make food safe.</P>
      <P>The systems in place take account of this fact. EU Regulation 178 of 2002 requires food business operators to withdraw from the market food which poses a threat to consumers. Operators are obliged to go further and inform the authorities and, where necessary, consumers of such recalls. While in the past responsible operators may have done so voluntarily, all food business operators are now legally obliged to provide this information. Furthermore, as I mentioned, all food business operators are also obliged to have traceability systems in place. Such systems are essential for dealing with situations such as the one in which we have found ourselves. The FSAI has published guidelines on traceability and recall. I recommend that all food business operators read and adopt them if they are to maintain the confidence of consumers who are growing rightfully more demanding and discerning.</P>
      <P>Again, I am grateful for this opportunity to address the Seanad on this important issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House because it is important that he put on record his response to the public&rsquo;s concern about this scare. The Sudan Red 1 scare has reminded the public that it cannot be fully confident that the food it eats possesses no health risk. Unfortunately, food scares are becoming increasingly the norm as larger retailers cut even more corners in order to increase their profits.</P>
      <P>Sudan Red 1 is an industrial dye and therefore should not be added to food. The dye is banned in Ireland and across the EU because, as the Minister of State says, it can contribute to an increased risk of cancer. The Minister of State said that all dried, crushed or ground chilli coming into EU member states must be accompanied by a certificate showing that it has been tested and found to be free of Sudan Red 1. Any consignment that does not have this certificate is detained for sampling and analysis. All consignments found to contain Sudan Red 1 must be destroyed. This is the alleged inspection process, however, in light of this recent scare, it is clear that there are questions to be answered by both the UK authorities and UK retailers as to how this batch of Sudan Red 1 managed to make its way into the foodchain.</P>
      <P>Other food scares over the years like dioxin in chicken, hormones in beef and foot and mouth disease are all recent food safety breaches which <Col N="1124"/>tend to undermine public confidence in the safety of food. This spate of food scares has made food health and safety a major issue and a concern for Irish consumers. More people are suffering from food allergies than before, which are caused by the artificial chemicals and preservatives in the foods eaten on a daily basis. People are also becoming increasingly sensitive to food and individual food ingredients. It is estimated that 2% of adults and 10% of children are affected by food allergies, with as much as 20% of the population reporting food intolerance. Correct food labelling is therefore vital. If food labels do not list all the ingredients and additives, allergy sufferers may have no way of knowing whether the food is safe.</P>
      <P>Better labelling and inspections are crucial to many aspects of food safety. Our current system needs a dramatic overhaul. Existing food labelling is confusing, is too diverse and difficult for most people to understand. If one buys a processed item of chicken in any of the major supermarkets and shops, it will claim to be 100% chicken. If one looks at the list of ingredients on the back of the item, the ingredients will consist of 49% chicken, with the remainder being made up of additives, salt and chemicals. People want to know what is in their food, where it is coming from and whether it is healthy.</P>
      <P>There are serious problems relating to the current country of origin labelling system. Current measures for the treatment, labelling and distribution of third-country beef coming into the EU are inadequate. Many firms are still reprocessing beef and other meats from Third World countries and selling them on as Irish goods in the Irish market. This practice continues to be a serious problem, particularly regarding meat sold by the catering industry.</P>
      <P>According to EU beef labelling regulations, imported beef from non-EU countries can still be sold if it is labelled as non-EU beef even if it does not meet all the requirements set out and has only an indication of where slaughtering took place. An EU Food and Veterinary Office report on Brazilian beef, carried out in May 2004, expressed concerns about issues like animal traceability, vaccinations, animal movement systems and slaughterhouse hygiene. It is disturbing that the FVO found that significant food issues still persist.</P>
      <P>If third-country meat is slaughtered or processed in some manner, for example, pork sausages or the addition of breadcrumbs, the processor can label this product as Irish. This does not represent the true origins of the meat. Irish farmers produce a quality product that is traceable from farm to fork and it is recognised that they adhere to extremely high standards. They should benefit from measures that label their meat as 100% born, bred and slaughtered in Ireland. This will have the twofold advantage of protecting Irish farmers and Irish consumers. Consumer research on labelling commissioned by <Col N="1125"/>the Department of Agriculture and Food and published in December 2003 revealed that almost 70% of respondents wanted specific country of origin labelling. Irish consumers have the right to know whether beef labelled as Irish is actually beef that was born, bred, slaughtered and processed in Ireland. If it is not, they have the right to know before they make the decision to buy it.</P>
      <P>We still have problems with food safety. In 2004, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland served 60 enforcement orders against food businesses that failed to meet its minimum food safety standards. It expressed the view that many businesses continue to fail to comply with food safety requirements and that much more work needs to be done in this area. Recently, a food product that contained traces of bone came into Ireland from Germany via Rotterdam. A disaster was narrowly avoided. The product slipped past the inspectors at the Department of Agriculture and Food, despite assurances and eventually had to be recalled to store.</P>
      <P>Samples of feed material taken at two import stores recently were determined to contain traces of bone. The material in question was sugar beet pulp imported from Germany via Rotterdam on two separate shipments between 18 and 22 October 2004. It is worrying that this contaminated feedstuff got as far as it did before the Department&rsquo;s alarm bells sounded. The Department of Agriculture and Food has never fully explained how this feedstuff got past its inspection regime but we cannot allow such lapses to recur. We need an urgent modernisation of our food control laboratory services.</P>
      <P>A report entitled The Strategic Development Review of the Health Board Food Control Laboratories, published in 2004, called for a greater unification within the State&rsquo;s food laboratory service. It recommended a move from the fragmented activity of the current system to the establishment of a single service called the food safety laboratory service. State food laboratories would continue to be managed locally but the operational control and direction of service would be under the remit of a senior scientific laboratory co-ordinator in the Health Service Executive. These recommendations have not yet been acted upon but must be if we are to ensure that top quality food safety products are in place.</P>
      <P>Having safe food to eat is one thing but the food&rsquo;s quality is another. There are concerns about the effects of food, particularly the levels of obesity in children, arising from the problem that we have become a convenience society and that people tend to use convenience foods most of all. There must be regulation of this area. For example, I used a drive through take-away to buy a chicken burger but when I ate it, I discovered it was bad. There is no one to speak with at such places in these circumstances. A customer may have to deal with a foreigner who does not understand what is being said or the reason for the cus<Col N="1126"/>tomer returning. As it turned out in this case, food that had passed its sell by date was still being served to the public. This should not be allowed to happen. There must be greater regulation and inspection of these chains.</P>
      <P>Despite accounting for more than 50% of Irish exports, only 4% of the Government&rsquo;s overall research and development expenditure is on food and drink. It is an area that the Government must invest in to satisfy the consumer. All over the world consumers have grown more health conscious. There is a growing number at the top end of the market who wish to eat food that is good for them, such as organically grown meat and vegetables, and that is not tainted with GM, foot and mouth disease, SARS or antibiotics. These consumers want food that is ethically produced and not battery farmed as many chickens are. They want something that is in line with the fair trade scheme for coffee.</P>
      <P>Ireland, with its green image and low population density, is ideally placed on the edge of the richest market in the world to capitalise on this opportunity. If there is a scare elsewhere it is an opportunity to be taken advantage of by Irish farmers and producers because theirs is the best food in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a well known saying that we are what we eat and it is important consequently that we know what we are eating. The recent scare pertaining to Sudan Red 1 dye in food is particularly worrying given its status as a carcinogen. One can describe the production activities of using artificial colourants, fertilisers and so forth as greed. The producer wants to make more money faster. Angel dust fed to livestock is an example but only a small number of farming entities have been known to indulge in this practice, thankfully. As a strong supporter of the farming community I congratulate the IFA and other farming organisations for the policing of their industry. The overuse of artificial fertiliser is not good because we are what we eat. The overuse of artificial fertiliser in vegetables is reflected in the completed product. Organically produced food is a much better source of healthy food than its artificially produced counterpart.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to meat relabelling. Meat products are supposed to be labelled to identify their country of origin but this must be taken further. To ensure that the products can be sourced and that they are locally produced, vegetables and meat, be it beef, mutton, pork or so forth, should display the name of the farmer or butcher from whom they were purchased. This is not too much to ask. It will not be long before someone whose name is incorrectly used in a poor product will take steps to set things right.</P>
      <P>Eating is essential for human existence. Much has been said about the introduction of the smoking ban and the implications for health of environmental tobacco smoke. It is imperative <Col N="1127"/>that the substances we ingest are of the highest possible quality. It is true to say that ours is a primarily agricultural economy, even though the number of farming units is in decline for many unfortunate reasons. Senator Coonan is correct in that we are on the periphery of the biggest market in the world and we should make the optimum use of our attributes.</P>
      <P>Change in consumer demands have pushed the drive for improvement in food safety. Living standards are increasing and people travel and experience both good and bad standards in food hygiene. Education standards have risen and consumers are more aware of their rights and the standards expected of food premises. The seasonal nature of employment in the food industry adds significantly to the costs of employee-food handling training. All workers in the food industry must be trained to a level commensurate with their duties. Managers and trainers must first gain the experience themselves if they are to train employees.</P>
      <P>Training is available from the former health boards and now from the Health Service Executive through environmental health officers and health inspectors. Local employment training schemes owe much to the flexible nature of course management through private consultant trainers. Food safety management systems based on the hazard analysis and critical control point must be implemented on all food premises. The design and implementation of this approach in the food business is costly and takes much time, but it is worth doing if it makes the preparation of food and the finished product safe. Environmental health officers should make unscheduled inspections of all food producing premises to ensure optimum standards are observed.</P>
      <P>Hazard analysis and critical control point is a proactive process control system by which food quality is ensured. This system is now mandatory in the food and catering industry in Ireland under Article 15 of the European Union&rsquo;s hygiene and foodstuffs regulations. The HACCP involves a number of components &mdash; hazard analysis, identifying critical control points, establishing critical limits for them, monitoring critical control points requirements and using the data acquired to control processes effectively by taking corrective action, by appropriate record keeping and by verification.</P>
      <P>The HACCP process revolves around the identification and documentation of potential hazards. The range of hazards includes safety hazards such as toxins, contamination, foreign bodies, decomposition, microbiology and non-safety hazards such as product quality and product substitution. The next step is to identify critical control points in the production process and establish critical limits to them. CCPs are those where the failure of the process would cause or contribute to the occurrence of a hazard. Critical <Col N="1128"/>limits are then established for each CCP and these limits are determined by Government regulations. Where a CCP is not relevant, the standard operating procedure is required.</P>
      <P>We all remember what happened in Scotland some years ago with the cook-chill system. That system has been adopted by a number of health boards and everything is fine as long as the process is followed and food is stored at and reheated to the appropriate temperatures. If that is not done, listeria can result.</P>
      <P>It is often forgotten that our water supply is a vital link in the food system. When we speak of food we think of bread and butter but water is also important. The indiscriminate spreading of slurry at inappropriate times is a danger. Fair play to the IFA and the farming organisations that have taken the trouble to police their members but there are rogues, the exceptions to the rule. In Lough Owel in Mullingar, the main water supply for north Westmeath, there was an instance of cryptosporidium leading to &ldquo;boil water&rdquo; notices being sent out to the town and surrounding areas. This is a spring lake and a vital food source that we must protect.</P>
      <P>The standard operating procedure should be that all food purchasing should be from companies registered with the local health board, the county council veterinary department or other relevant authority.</P>
      <P>The standard for transport should be that high risk food should be refrigerated at a temperature of not more than 5&deg; Celsius, ideally 3&deg; Celsius, or -18&deg; in the case of frozen foods. The transport container must be clean, weather proof and have good air flow. Delivery is also critical. Critical limits should be that the food should be at a temperature of not more than 5&deg; Celsius, ideally 3&deg; Celsius, and refrigerated without delay.</P>
      <P>Storage is vital. Food should be refrigerated at a temperature of not more than 5&deg; Celsius, ideally 3&deg; Celsius, and all doors should be kept closed. Segregation of food must take place to avoid cross-contamination.</P>
      <P>Preparation is imperative and high standards of hygiene must be observed in the preparation of food. The critical limit for cooking should be that all food reaches a core temperature of 75&deg; Celsius for a minimum of two minutes. If food is being kept hot for carvery or banqueting, where the food shall not be served immediately after cooking, it must be kept hot. The critical limit for hot holding should be that food that has reached a core temperature of 75&deg; Celsius for a minimum of two minutes should be held at a minimum of 63&deg; Celsius while it is waiting to be served.</P>
      <P>Cooling is an important process. Critical limits should be that cooked food shall be cooled as quickly as possible and refrigerated within 90 minutes of cooking and that food should reach a core temperature of not less than 10&deg; Celsius within a further 60 minutes of being placed in the refrigerator.</P><Col N="1129"/>
      <P>Reheating is also important. The critical limit should be food that has reached 74&deg; Celsius and has been effectively cooled after this cooking must reach a temperature of at least 70&deg; Celsius on reheating. If that is not done there is a real danger of listeria breaking out.</P>
      <P>We are a small country with great potential. The high standards that obtain in most situations must be maintained and observed and we should interfere to the extent of reporting situations where food production outlets do not maintain appropriate standards. We should alert the authorities where such low standards exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this debate. It is taking place as a result of recent reports of the contamination of food products with the industrial dye Sudan Red 1. Most of us had never heard of it until it made the news.</P>
      <P>This opened up an important debate on food safety on this country and our attitudes thereto. This country has relied on the food industry in recent years. We have built a good reputation internationally as a country for fine food and drink. Kinsale is the gourmet capital of Ireland and is well connected with Keith Floyd, the celebrity chef. The food industry here has earned a reputation which we are proud to show off to tourists and avail of ourselves as consumers. It is an important part of the economy and we are therefore concerned about contamination of food products.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The agrifood industry faces many challenges. The international market is competitive and we are competing with much larger countries. Our exports must be of a high standard to ensure good output. We have to ensure there are high standards of food safety not only within the foodchain but within the production systems. This goes beyond the farm gate to the heart of the processing plants. We have all heard criticisms, as we did in the context of the National Tourism Development Authority Bill, concerning the scrutiny of premises which claim to be of an acceptable standard as food outlets. Exacting standards are applied to these outlets for obvious reasons. It is not unfair to expect those standards when dealing with an issue that is so important to our health, our environmental health and the economy. Any measures in place for the purpose of ensuring the prescribed standards are met in the area of hygiene are necessary.</P>
      <P>As a race, our minds are concentrated on what we eat and it has become a huge focus for health campaigns, health promotions, health awareness, healthy eating and healthy living. For many years we had not taken the healthy option and, probably, looked on food as something to be devoured, rather than taking into account its serious consequences. Many foods contain a high fat content which is injurious to health. Therefore, it is important from a health aspect that we are aware of what we are eating. As consumers <Col N="1130"/>we need to be assured of the origin of the food and that the standards required of the food industry are adhered to. That is important in terms of public confidence and human health.</P>
      <P>In the context of the smoking ban, the most important factor in terms of public confidence was the repeated lectures on health issues. As a nation we had become careless not only in terms of what we eat but how we abuse our bodies. There could be no argument in that regard as it was common sense. However, we had been unaware of these issues. The same logic must be applied in regard to what we eat. We have to be aware that the food industry is the single most important industry in Ireland. Its output value of &euro;16 billion is huge by any yardstick.</P>
      <P>Important components in ensuring a high standard of food safety include registration, identification, labelling, animal health, animal welfare, veterinary hygiene, processing plants, imports, exports and laboratories, much of which has come about by virtue of our membership of the European Union. Although food legislation goes back much further, one of the many benefits of EU membership has been the way in which we govern and regulate locally and deal with EU directives, not least in this area from where most, if not all, food legislation emanates.</P>
      <P>Our extensive grass-based production system underpins a fine food industry. We have to be cognisant well into the future that as a country that depends so much on the food industry in terms of providing jobs and generating revenue, we are equally concerned about the industry&rsquo;s reputation not only at home but abroad.</P>
      <P>As a nation we will celebrate the birth of our patron saint in approximately ten days&rsquo; time. This has already been publicised given that we are sending many of our Ministers abroad. It is part of our culture abroad and it is what defines us as being Irish. We have to be aware that any aspersions that could be cast on the standards applied to food production and exports may have serious knock-on effects not only at home but abroad.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, on his appointment and wish him well in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is making us hungry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;yeast extract, flavourings, flavouring enhancer E621, acidity regulator E262, rusk, citric acid E330, colours E160 and E100, and sweetener E954. That product, which contains many artificial flavourings, is consumed mostly by children. I am not casting any aspersions on the quality of that product. All I am saying is that given the number of products being brought into the market it is vital that the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children can ensure a safe foodchain.</P>
      <P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland was notified on 18 February 2005 of various recalls affecting a large number of products contaminated with Sudan Red 1. Sudan Red 1, an industrial dye, has been banned as a food colorant throughout Europe since 2003 due to its cancer causing properties. The British authorities were notified of a potential problem by supplier Premier Foods on 7 February 2005.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the Senator sample it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Why did the Food Safety Authority of Ireland only notify the public on 18 February? That delay is unacceptable. Just when one thought it was safe to step into the supermarket, more than 400 offending products were flying off the shelves in what the press dubbed, &ldquo;the biggest food scare since BSE.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Worried shoppers fear they and their families have been eating foodstuffs contaminated with an industrial dye, which is officially listed as a cancer risk and is normally used for colouring solvents, oils, waxes, petrol and shoe and floor polishes. Can one imagine anyone putting such a product into a food product? It is criminal.</P>
      <P>My main concern is that we were consuming these goods for years without anybody notifying us. How did our extensive food safety control system take so long to kick into gear? Those are <Col N="1132"/>questions to which the Minister of State should obtain answers.</P>
      <P>Our increasingly varied 21st century diet has left us exposed and vulnerable to food-borne health risks. Fortunately Sudan Red 1 is not immediately life threatening. Even so, this crisis highlights many of the vulnerabilities and unsustainable aspects of our global food system.</P>
      <P>Another disguised blessing is that scandals like these are good at raising public awareness about these issues. I would never have read the contents of that product were it not for this scare. Every person who purchases food should look at the label to see what it contains. When such scandals occur, they are one of the few times when many of the invisible, taken-for-granted, aspects of our food system are made more transparent, albeit often well after the event. Many complacent consumers, that includes most of us, did not really think about what went into the prepared foods they were eating.</P>
      <P>Even the favourite cuisine of &ldquo;Coronation Street&rdquo;, Betty&rsquo;s hotpot, has been found to contain the banned cancer-causing dye, Sudan Red 1. This dish has been used and promoted on<?oasys [jy?>&ldquo;Coronation Street&rdquo; for years. Who would imagine that the incorruptible Betty has been poisoning her customers for the past 40 years? It has now been withdrawn from the programme. The drink which is supposed to cure a hangover, Bloody Mary, has been contaminated for years with this product. Instead of being a hangover cure, it became a poison. A person could be poisoned with alcohol and then poisoned by the cure.</P>
      <P>This latest crisis is the thunder signalling a much larger storm on the near horizon unless some significant corrections are made within the global food system. It has highlighted the need for more vigilance in the case of the ingredients contained in the preservation of foodstuffs. Many systems are used to preserve food and extend its shelf life.</P>
      <P>Young people are consuming products which are not in their best interests. I suggest there is a good case to be made for the provision of meals in schools. Some schools provide quality breakfasts for their students. In Northern Ireland and the UK, provision of a full lunch is included in the school system. This country is now in the financial position to provide good quality meals, either breakfast or lunch, for students rather than have them eating products which may not be in the best interest of their health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is not able to provide classrooms, let alone food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>When I was at school many years ago, a small lunch system was in place in schools even though the economy was not very strong. It consisted of bread, marmalade and cocoa but at least young people who may not have had the financial means to have a full meal were given something to sustain them.</P><Col N="1133"/>
      <P>The delay in warning the public should be investigated. I hope the product has been removed from the shelves of supermarkets throughout the country. I am concerned about GM products and the methods used for the preservation of imported fruit. This may look very well but the method of preservation can sometimes be questionable. Health officers should be more active in respect of the food sold in fast food outlets.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State and his officials for coming to the House to put forward the Government&rsquo;s case. It is in the national interest that his Department actively pursues all such issues concerning the quality of food products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise for not being present for the Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution but I have read with interest his considered contribution. While we are winning the debate on food safety, we are probably losing the debate on food quality. It is important to differentiate between food safety and food quality. Many national and EU regulations govern the safety of food. Ireland is a food-producing and exporting nation and therefore the question of food quality must be considered. Obesity levels among Europeans, particularly the young, has been the subject of debate. The problem is also evident in Ireland. This debate must be taken to a higher level and the problem must be responded to. The quality of the food being produced should be at the core of the response to the question of the Irish and European diet.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State represents a rural constituency and will be aware of the debate about the future of agriculture. European Union policies are changing dramatically and the future of farming is in question. If Irish agriculture is to have a future, there needs to be an emphasis on the quality of food being produced on Irish farms. The traditional small Irish family farm can play a significant role in the improvement of the quality of food which is served not only in Irish but also in European restaurants. The issues of the future of Irish farming and the maintenance of small family farms should be grouped with the issue of improving the quality of Irish food.</P>
      <P>From any scientific perspective, there is more than sufficient regulation of food safety. Food safety legislation passed some years ago gave strong powers to the then health boards, now the Health Service Executive, which resulted in more monitoring of food outlets, restaurants, takeaways and food production units.</P>
      <P>Many people are of the opinion that the regulations and food safety guidelines which are in place and which stem from European legislation and regulation are being enforced more strictly here than in some member states. I refer in particular to the French and the Italians. Any visitor to those countries will report that there appears to be a different standard governing the presentation and sale of food in local country markets and small shops. Ireland has responded in full and <Col N="1134"/>perhaps almost to an over-regulated degree. All the European directives have been complied with.</P>
      <P>The debate should now move on to the question of food quality. If Ireland ensures that its farming community produces food of the highest quality, we can be sure that the food in question is safe. If modern methods of food production are implemented and there is investment in alternative agriculture, the maintenance of small farms and the production of significantly greater amounts of organic food, we will be doing more than our fair share for food safety and food quality.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State to consider these points. He has responsibility for food safety but an important factor must be food quality and food production and the maintenance of the family farm. Ireland can build up a niche market. I ask the Minister of State to engage in dialogue with the Department of Agriculture and Food to bring forward proposals in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and his official. Food safety is important from the points of view of the health of individuals, agriculture and the food industry. In the past ten to 15 years, food scares in Ireland and among our EU partners have had an adverse impact on certain categories of food. In using the word &ldquo;scare&rdquo; I do not necessarily mean the cases in question have been without foundation. It is in the interests of the health of citizens and our agricultural industry that we take food safety seriously. The regulatory framework here and in Europe has been beefed up, albeit to an insufficient extent. In this context, I pay tribute to the work of former Commissioner, Mr. David Byrne, one of whose main areas of responsibility was food safety.</P>
      <P>While the various aspects of the Sudan Red 1 case have been sufficiently discussed, prompt action was taken as it must be. This the best way of quickly restoring confidence because if regulators or industry are slow to act, it can have a devastating impact.</P>
      <P>Senators raised dietary issues. Although our diet was much more basic in the past, it came much more directly from farm and garden. Nowadays, a great deal of food comes in highly processed form and some products may be much healthier than others. There is a paradox in this. While I am on the issue of packaging and processing, I pay tribute to Bord Bia and its work abroad in selling Irish produce. The basic healthiness of production here and its green characteristics are major selling points, particularly when compared with some forms of intensive food production, which does not have these merits.</P>
      <P>Many of us are concerned that due to a variety of changes in lifestyle the dietary habits of the younger generation may be less healthy than those of our generation. It will be interesting to observe whether life expectancy will continue to increase or whether today&rsquo;s younger generation <Col N="1135"/>finds instead that various factors, including what they eat, the amount they drink and obesity, create many health problems for them in middle age.</P>
      <P>We still have much to do in terms of consumer knowledge and confidence. One must be an expert to make sense of various ingredients and small print on the back of packages and some guidance is necessary in this respect. It would be welcome if some vigorous consumer magazines were to operate in the Irish marketplace. The food sector deserves one of its own, perhaps on the lines of <i>Which?</i>, in which the pros and cons of competing products and their contents could be assessed in an objective rather than sensational manner.</P>
      <P>South Tipperary is the centre of organic food in Ireland. Organic farming is a niche market which does not provide all the answers. Some of the restrictions in place in the areas of preventive animal medicine, spraying and so forth make it difficult for most organic farmers to operate commercially. For this reason, I do not share the view that if all farmers were to switch to organic agriculture, it would solve most of our problems, although I accept it has a role to play in a niche market.</P>
      <P>Food safety is an important area which requires further work and attention. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland can take urgent action when required, such as in the Sudan Red 1 case, but we must also address the less urgent issue of guiding consumer choice in an informed way and giving consumers the information they need.</P>
      <P>It is a serious anomaly that a wide variety of standards and restrictions are imposed on food production in Ireland and the European Union, yet no requirements on providing place of origin and so forth attach to imports from countries such as Brazil. The import regime can run a coach and four through the tight system of regulation in force in the EU. I do not accept that those who wish to supply the European Union market should not be subject to the same standards and restrictions as European producers. This issue must be tackled at European level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their constructive contributions on the discussion. We all need a little food every day and some of us probably have a little too much of it. Everyone has an interest in food safety and it was interesting to note the different angles from which Senators approached the debate and the variety of issues they addressed.</P>
      <P>The importance of the food industry to the economy has been stressed by a number of speakers with whose analysis I fully agree. Due to time pressure I am not in a position to address individually obesity, food labelling, the use of additives and other issues raised by Senators but I undertake to respond to those who raised them in the coming days.</P><Col N="1136"/>
      <P>I am satisfied that the relevant statutory agency with responsibility for food safety control, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, acted rapidly and responsibly in the interests of consumers by providing full information and by working with other agencies in the food industry to ensure affected products were speedily removed from the market. There is, however, a need for vigilance with no room for complacency. I will be asking the Food Safety Authority of Ireland to conduct a review of how the Sudan Red 1 issue was handled to see what lessons can be learned. Such an exercise is important and, if necessary, changes can be put in place for the future.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for food safety is shared across several Departments and agencies. The Department of Agriculture and Food is responsible for policy matters regarding food of animal origin, including meat labelling. The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is responsible for policy aspects of fishing and aquaculture. The Department of Health and Children has responsibility for food safety in retail and catering establishments and in plants manufacturing foods of non-animal origin.</P>
      <P>In January 1999, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland was established as a statutory independent and science-based body, operating under the aegis of the Department of Health and Children. Its principal function is to take all reasonable steps to ensure food produced, distributed or marketed in the State meets the highest standards of food safety. It also ensures such food complies with food legislation and, where appropriate, with recognised codes of good practice. The authority carries out its enforcement functions through service contracts with official agencies. These contracts outline an agreed level in standard of food safety activity that agencies perform as agents of the authority. The authority has service contracts with county and city councils, the Health Service Executive, the Departments of Agriculture and Food, and Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs and the Marine Institute. In addition, the authority has memoranda of understanding in place with the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and the Customs and Excise.</P>
      <P>The structures in place have delivered a high level of consumer protection for the safety of food produced and marketed in the State. The timely and comprehensive response to the Sudan Red 1 problem showed the soundness of the systems. In this case, the origin of the problem was an affected consignment entering the EU, through the UK, in 2002, before the current EU controls were put in place in July 2003. The problem, therefore, predated the current controls and arose outside this jurisdiction. The food industry, at all levels, is highly regulated. The hazard analysis critical control point system is firmly embedded and the effectiveness of our food safety control measures are kept under ongoing review.</P>

I have been contacted by a number of An Post and SDS workers concerned at how senior management has dealt with the issue. Other sectors, including Oireachtas Members, have received their increases under the agreement.</P>
      <P>Members know the importance of An Post&rsquo;s work as every day we send correspondence to those we represent. Despite senior management&rsquo;s argument, An Post is now a financially stable and sustainable company. Obvious steps can be taken by management to improve and ensure the company&rsquo;s viability. The workers I have met are committed and willing to work with management to implement improvements to work practices. However, the manner in which the company has dealt with the issue shows no regard to the esteem of its workers. This is an important issue that must be resolved in the forthcoming Labour Court hearings. The Minister must ensure these payments are a prerequisite to any settlement made.</P>

	<P>I apologise on behalf of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, who is unable to attend the House. It is important to recall the background to the current difficulties in An Post and the decision of the An Post board not to pay Sustaining Progress increases to staff and, subsequently, to An Post pensioners. In such circumstances, it is open to the unions to refer the matter to the Labour Relations Commission and, ultimately, the Labour Court where a binding ruling can be made.</P>
      <P>The inability to pay claim was based on the fact that An Post sustained losses of &euro;43 million in 2003. This precipitated a financial crisis in the company, especially as these losses came on top of operating losses of &euro;17.4 million in 2002 and &euro;6.7 million in 2001. The financial accounts and report for 2004 have not yet been finalised. However, it is expected that the company will be close to break even position. The improvement in <Col N="1138"/>2004 against 2003 must be viewed in the context of savings made, including the non-payment of Sustaining Progress. The cost of Sustaining Progress in 2004 would have been &euro;18 million. The cost of Sustaining Progress going forward would be &euro;37 million in 2005 and &euro;56 million in 2006.</P>
      <P>Payroll and non-pay-related costs were reduced in 2004 against 2003 and this was brought about by vigorous cost control initiatives. However, the underlying problems which led to the financial crisis have not been solved and that is why the company and the unions are engaged in an intensive negotiation process under the auspices of the Labour Court. The real solution to the problems in An Post is for both parties to agree on a deal for a viable recovery plan. In this regard, a recovery plan was presented by the board and management which assumed significant changes in work practices, tariff increases and the payment of wage increases. Adoption of such a plan that delivers real change is the only way An Post workers can look forward to receiving pay increases in line with other sectors.</P>
      <P>An Post pensioners have also unfortunately been affected by the financial problems of the company. The existing terms of the An Post superannuation scheme provide for pay parity, that is, that pensions are increased in line with the pay of serving staff. This is in accordance with public service defined benefit pension increase policy generally, pay parity being an integral and well-established practice which is widely used in public service defined benefit pension schemes.</P>
      <P>In regard to SDS workers, the House will be aware that following substantial losses in recent years at the parcel delivery subsidiary, the board of An Post decided to close SDS and to reintegrate the parcels business into the letter post division. On 11 February last, the Labour Court conducted a hearing on outstanding issues in regard to SDS and met both parties again on 21 February to clarify their respective positions. The court is expected to issue a recommendation on certain key outstanding issues between the parties shortly.</P>
      <P>The matter of the non-payment of Sustaining Progress increases to An Post employees was heard by the Labour Court on 7 February. The court recommended that the Labour Relations Commission appoint assessors to examine whether the company was correct to invoke the inability to pay clause in regard to Sustaining Progress. An Post has accepted this recommendation.</P>
      <P>On the issue of the recovery plan, the Labour Court has also been active and has appointed a technical group to advise it on the complex issues arising. That group is to report back to the court by 6 May.</P>
      <P>With intensive work under way in the Labour Court on several issues, including the non-payment of Sustaining Progress increases, I urge both unions and management to embrace this opportunity to reach agreement on change within the company. It is essential that both sides continue <Col N="1139"/>to work together in conjunction with the State&rsquo;s industrial relations machinery to broker a deal that will allow the company to deliver quality services to our citizens while at the same time providing sustainable well paid employment to its staff. This is the challenge facing the board and management together with the unions and they should not allow themselves to be deflected from meeting that challenge.</P>

	<P>The workers at An Post have always been willing to negotiate with the management. The Minister of State mentioned the losses. I <Col N="1140"/>understand capital expenditure has been included in the figures in respect of losses. If one said teachers should not be paid their increases because there was capital expenditure on school building or school refurbishments, it would not be acceptable. The losses the company has incurred should not be used as an excuse for not paying workers their due increases under Sustaining Progress.</P>
