	<P>I have received notice from Senator O&rsquo;Meara that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to outline the up-to-date position regarding the rehabilitation of the tailings pond and other mine sites in the Silvermines area in Nenagh, County Tipperary, given that a full report has been furnished to him regarding this issue in recent weeks.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator John Paul Phelan on the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to provide funding to facilitate the construction of a new swimming pool in Kilkenny in light of the extreme deterioration of facilities at the venue due to regular closures, thus displacing some 250 swimmers.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Bannon on the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to explain the prohibition on a Nigerian woman who is a qualified nurse from engaging in full-time paid employment.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by Senators O&rsquo;Meara, John Paul Phelan and Bannon as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The House rightly had full expressions of sympathy on the death of Pope John Paul II on the week commencing 11 April 2005. It is only proper to reflect on the election of Pope Benedict XVI on 19 April and to highlight this as a significant international event. The Pope is not just the leader of the Roman Catholic Church but is a figurehead throughout the world.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach&rsquo;s invitation to Pope Benedict XVI to visit Ireland at his first opportunity to follow in the footsteps of Pope John Paul II in 1979. To the critics of the new Pope, a Pope is unlike any other man. He had a life before he became Pope and will have one after his election. I wish him well in his difficult job as the new pontiff and hope he will reflect all of the strands comprising the Roman Catholic Church, people of other faiths and those of none.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>We had a discussion before our recent break on the need to consider the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform&rsquo;s document on immigration, which outlines his thinking with a view to future legislation. Many of the speakers on both sides of the House felt this would be useful. There is no crisis issue in this area currently as it has calmed momentarily. Now and not in the heat of battle, as it were, is the time we should be discussing it, when we can sit back and examine the system. There are matters in this about which we must be clear. If we all buy into a system we must live with the downside and the upside but we can at least put our views on record.</P>
      <P>It would be helpful if we could be given notice of a discussion on this document to allow people to consult thereon. This is one of the issues on which we spoke about consulting people outside the House in terms of Seanad reform. Many people are involved in this issue. Indeed, I noticed the Leader speak out over the weekend. We have all met groups with different views on the issue. We now have an opportunity to do something and I would like the Leader to give perhaps ten days notice of when we might deal with this issue to allow Members to consult.</P>
      <P>The Government has spoken about urgent infrastructural projects on two or three occasions. Many of us believe there are urgent projects which are being slowed down unnecessarily, although there are others which must go through a process. It is a question of striking a balance. Rather than deal with these projects when a snail is found somewhere or there is a difficulty, let us identify the proper way to deal with them.</P>
      <P>I would like a discussion with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on his view on the directors&rsquo; compliance statement in the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act passed last year establishing the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority. It seems different views &mdash; different from those articulated last year &mdash; are now emerging from different sections of the business community and politically. I would like the Government to put its view on the record.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>There was a long discussion on radio this morning on the Health and Safety Authority&rsquo;s review of safety in accident and emergency departments. As a sometimes engineer who endeavours to teach people the rudiments of safety, it is shocking to find that a large number of accident and emergency units have been reported to the fire service for rudimentary failures such as blocking emergency exists. There are two separate issues here. One is the scale and capacity of accident and emergency units, which is a serious issue in itself. However, the fact these units are under pressure is no excuse for their managers leaving material in places which threatens public safety and health. This almost sounds like a cracked record, coming back yet again to talk about the health service.</P>
      <P>The issue of safety as distinct from the quality of medical care is a profoundly serious one which will result in a major tragedy sooner or later if it is not tackled by legal enforcement or by good management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind the Senator this matter is on tomorrow&rsquo;s Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The matter on the Order Paper relates to accident and emergency services but this is a matter capable of being remedied instantaneously by good management. I do not believe there is an overnight solution to accident and emergency because of the eight years of neglect it has suffered.</P>
      <P>I was in Nairobi last week at a conference on peace in the Great Lakes region and I tried to be helpful, which is my usual constructive position. One of the terrifying facts which emerged was that there are approximately 100 million small arms in that region in the possession of people other than governments. That is scary. It is morally repugnant that almost all of those arms were made in Europe, mostly in countries which have subscribed to one protocol or another on responsible arms exports. This raises the question yet again of the European Union&rsquo;s apparent intent to end its embargo on the sale of arms to China. Once one opens up an area such as that to the export of arms, one does not know what will happen to them after they get there. I request a debate on the EU&rsquo;s embargo on arms sales to China. I would like to hear from the Taoiseach because I believe it was a Government decision endorsed by him but it is a decision which needs to be reviewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>In recent years we have undergone an expensive process, called benchmarking, that was predicated upon reform in the Civil Service and public service. However, on 17 February 2005 there was a finding in the Department of Finance on skills shortages with regard to the recruitment of 26 people. The trade union IMPACT brought a case, which was not about the fact of skills shortages but who would represent these people if they were appointed at a <Col N="72"/>technical grade or an assistant principal officer grade. The purpose of Sustaining Progress is to address such issues.</P>
      <P>In view of this I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister for Finance to come into the House and explain in precise terms the reforms achieved under the first benchmarking process before there is any attempt to embark on another round. The report states that it has been acknowledged by both sides that this particular provision of Sustaining Progress, which is concerned with the recruitment of skilled staff shortages, was one of some sensitivity and it is, therefore, reasonable to presume that the parties express themselves with some care in regard to the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has adequately elaborated his case for a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>This exercise has cost us dearly and I ask that the Minister for Finance come into the House to explain in precise terms the reform that has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join in the call for a debate on immigration. Despite the increased use of communications it is virtually impossible to make contact with the visa or immigration sections of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. That is unacceptable in this day and age. I am aware of one constituent who has spent more than four weeks trying to get through to the immigration section of the Department. I ask that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform come before the House to explain this outrageous situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Brian Hayes has raised the matter of the election of the Pope. I have made my mixed and doubtful feelings known on a previous occasion and it would be indecorous for me to revisit those sentiments this morning. It is very natural&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I advise the Senator that while the Seanad may acknowledge the election of Pope Benedict XVI we are not discussing his beliefs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that and I do not propose to. It is perfectly natural and appropriate to send good wishes to anybody entering a new and onerous job and I am happy to do so. The new Pope has chosen one of the most beautiful Papal names. Benedictus is someone who is well spoken, speaks positively and in a godly fashion. I wish that he is able to find in himself the qualities to live up to this beautiful name.</P>
      <P>The other point I wish to make follows on from what Senator Ryan said. I have warned in this House that immigrants into this country are being crammed into unsuitable hostels. A fire in Paris last week had tragic consequences. This is going to happen here if we do not inspect those premises. I am aware of situations in the city of Dublin where somebody in breach of planning laws has <Col N="73"/>owned property in which there has been this kind of fire in which people jumped out of second floor windows. Luckily they were not killed. On the same day he was in court he was given further planning permission by Dublin City Council to develop further hostels. As Members of the Oireachtas we ought to keep an eye on the situation before there is a tragedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I subscribe to the sentiments expressed by Senator Brian Hayes in wishing Pope Benedict XVI the best. Whatever his beliefs and whatever our beliefs he has a mammoth task ahead and I wish him well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The annual report of the data protection commissioner is an interesting document and should be discussed here. For some months I have been arguing strongly for the introduction of speed cameras throughout Ireland as a method of reducing road deaths. The Data Protection Commissioner has some very moderate views in this regard. This topic would benefit from a debate which would express the voice of the Oireachtas on this matter.</P>
      <P>There was a call yesterday for a debate in the House on the introduction of fair trade products. The Leader of the House attended the Comhl&aacute;mh lunch last week which I did not attend. This subject should be debated in the House because every citizen and not just the Government can do something about it. Fair trade coffee is automatically served in the Members&rsquo; restaurant in Leinster House unless another type is requested. This positive discrimination is very worthy and I encourage the rest of us to take action in this area also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to consider a debate on UN reform in light of the important appointment of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to be the eyes and ears, as the media describe it, throughout Europe of the Secretary General. He embarks today on a visit to 43 capital cities. The figure may be exaggerated but I am merely quoting the media. The list of meetings he will attend in the next six months is quite comprehensive. He also carries out his existing duties as Minister for Foreign Affairs exceptionally well. In light of this important appointment and the fact that Ireland tends to hang its colours of neutrality around the importance of the United Nations, I ask for a debate in the context of the European treaty. There is a wide scope of subject matter to be debated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Brian Hayes raised the relevant issue of the election of Pope Benedict XVI, to whom I offer my congratulations. He echoed the Taoiseach&rsquo;s call that the Pope visit Ireland and reflect on all of the strands that make up mankind.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole asked for a debate on immigration. The House received two reports on this <Col N="74"/>matter last week from the Minister and they seem to be good. I take the Senator&rsquo;s point about giving time to allow for consultation with groups before statements are made in the House. He referred to urgent infrastructural projects which are being delayed. He asked that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment come to the House to discuss the directors&rsquo; compliance statement.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan asked for a debate on the health and safety statements relating to accident and emergency departments. He correctly stated that this is the business of management. The T&aacute;naiste cannot personally move chairs away from doors. When I heard this report this morning I wondered who was responsible for putting chairs against doors. It is a disgraceful practice. We must depend on legal enforcement and good management. Senator Ryan also referred to Nairobi<b>, </b>European involvement in the small arms trade and the question of the sale of arms to China.</P>
      <P>Senator Morrissey asked for a debate on benchmarking and referred to the IMPACT report. He asked that the Minister for Finance come to the House to explain whether departmental reforms will underpin benchmarking. I suspect that is explained in the small print.</P>
      <P>Senator Feighan asked for a debate on immigration and the long delays experienced by those wishing to contact the Department&rsquo;s visa section. I am familiar with this problem also.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris expressed his good wishes for Pope Benedict. It is a lovely name which means &ldquo;blessed&rdquo; and it is very fitting. The Senator also referred to hostels and to those who lost their lives in the hostel in Paris. They were mostly immigrants and their children.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Senator McCarthy wished the new Pope well in his job. Senator Quinn asked for a debate on the report of the Data Protection Commissioner. He also referred to fair trade and Comhl&aacute;mh. I attended a fair trade coffee morning in Mullingar last Monday at which there was great praise for Senator Quinn in ensuring his stores stock fair trade coffee, tea, bananas and other products. The organisers observed that Superquinn is one of the few chains of stores that is effective in this regard. I congratulate Senator Quinn on this achievement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The achievements of the Fair Trade Organisation are well documented and its coffee and tea products taste just the same if not better than other brands. Senator Quinn is well due the acclaim he has received for his endeavours in this area.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney observed that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, will visit some 43 countries in his new United Nations role and expressed a desire for the Minister to come to this House to debate UN reform. I am unsure whether he will be able to drop in between his <Col N="75"/>visits to the 22nd and 23rd countries but I will ask him to accommodate a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure either of the Ministers of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Conor Lenihan and Deputy Treacy, would be an adequate replacement during such a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I send my good wishes on behalf of my party to the new Pope on his elevation.</P>

    <Title>Veterinary Practice Bill 2004: Report and Final Stages.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Before we commence, I remind Senators that a Member may speak only once on Report Stage, except the proposer of an amendment, who may reply to the discussion on the amendment. On Report Stage each amendment must be seconded. I welcome the Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 10, line 30, after &ldquo;public&rdquo;, where it secondly occurs, to insert &ldquo;free or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister back to the House for Report Stage of the Bill. The Minister considered this amendment on Committee Stage. I would hope that, since then, she has had a change of heart and will now accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>We discussed this amendment on Committee Stage, in particular the addition of the word &ldquo;free&rdquo; to the definition of &ldquo;printed and published&rdquo;. Under the legislation, the Veterinary Council of Ireland will be able to make documents available &ldquo;at such reasonable price (if any)&rdquo;. The council will not have to charge for documents, so it can waive any charge. Provision is made for publication by means of the Internet, which will give people access to such documents as veterinary registers or annual accounts without any charge being attached. I have introduced flexibility so the council may determine whether it wishes to introduce a charge &mdash; it may choose not to do so &mdash; as well as providing information using modern technology. I do not want there to be an imposition that the documents must always be free. A particular document might cost quite a lot of money to provide. Flexibility is provided for the council to do whatever it needs to do, and it may waive charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 11, line 6, to delete &ldquo;practitioner&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;surgeon&rdquo;.</P><Col N="76"/>
      <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister to the House. On Committee Stage, I explained that vets themselves would like the traditional name of &ldquo;veterinary surgeon&rdquo; to be maintained. They feel that, in the eyes of the public, &ldquo;practitioner&rdquo; means someone who is involved in the practice of veterinary medicine. While that is what most of them will do, a substantial number of vets are involved in academic veterinary medicine or various sectors in the food industry. These people will be covered by the Act but the feeling of my colleagues in veterinary medicine is that the public would not see them as veterinary practitioners and that is why they would prefer the traditional name of veterinary surgeon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment. I cannot improve on Senator Henry&rsquo;s contribution and I support what she said. I welcome the Minister back to the House. On Committee Stage she paid attention to many of the amendments before us again today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>To be quite frank I find it difficult to understand why people are so wound up about this issue, not necessarily the Senators but perhaps the people they represent. If one examines the situation one sees that vets, veterinary surgeons or veterinary practitioners can still use the word surgeon under section 54 of the legislation.</P>
      <P>This section indicates that subject to sections 55 and 59 a person, other than a veterinary practitioner shall not use the title or description that would give the impression that he or she is registered under Part 4, such as &ldquo;veterinary surgeon&rdquo;, &ldquo;veterinary specialist&rdquo;, &ldquo;veterinary practitioner&rdquo; or &ldquo;veterinarian&rdquo;. Under the legislation those words can be used but a person who is not qualified cannot use those titles. We feel any of those titles can be used; one can be a veterinarian; a veterinary surgeon; a specialist &mdash; although of course a specialist has a particular academic acumen; or a veterinary practitioner. They must all still do the same exam.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept what the Minister says.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P el="5">Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 3 to 7, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together by agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 16, line 1, to delete &ldquo;who is not eligible to be so registered, but&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I will not improve on my contribution on Committee Stage. I would appeal to the Minister to use the change of heart she may have had since we last debated this amendment to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment. On amendment No. 6, I acknowledge the Minister has taken on board most of our concerns on this <Col N="77"/>Bill and has done a good job. However, I am still not satisfied with the provision on the appointment of a member of the farming community. The basis for this motion is that I want that provision to be more specific. I recognised the fact the Minister stated that she would allow me to choose a farmer representative for the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I said the Senator could recommend someone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>Animal welfare is of prime concern to the farming community &mdash; the second most important group in this Bill after the veterinary surgeons as they are the people who care for animals in the majority of situations. I move this amendment which seeks to specify that a full-time farmer is on the board representing the farming community.</P>
      <P>The Minister suggested a member of an animal welfare group. Someone from Compassion in World Farming could represent the farming community in that situation. I ask the Minister to ensure that a full-time farmer, someone making his or her living solely from farming, is on the board.</P>
      <P>On the amendment to increase veterinary numbers, I acknowledge the Minister has increased the overall number by two and that is designed to cover this issue. Perhaps the figures are wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan"><NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
	<P>The point is well made by Senator Coonan, but this is also provided for in the Bill. The final two paragraphs on page 15 clearly mean that someone availing of the service is a farmer. Equally, I would share the concern of Senator Coonan about the definition of animal welfare and the appointment of an individual from that community. It can be stated clearly, without fear of contradiction, that nobody is more concerned about animal welfare than the farmer who is out there looking after a herd of cattle, a flock of sheep or other animals. No farmer wants to see injury done to animals and no farmer wants to see the welfare of animals compromised. I suggest that both sections 16(<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) would allow for the appointment of farmers, who are the people using the services. That is my interpretation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>This has been widely discussed and evaluated and I agreed with the extension of the numbers on the Veterinary Council.</P>
      <P>There are two considerations on the issue of education. First, the Department of Education and Science has provided a considerable amount of grant aid to the Veterinary Council. Second, while we only have one veterinary college at present, there is nothing to suggest we will not have another college in the future, which would be entitled to make a recommendation. To restrict the entitlement to one college would be inappropriate. The dean of the faculty of veterin<Col N="78"/>ary medicine in UCD is a member of the Veterinary Council at present.</P>
      <P>On the issue of subsections (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>), my concern is that if I indicate that the representative must be a farmer, I will have every farming organisation lobbying for a position on the council &mdash; the IFA, the ICMSA, the ICSA, ICOS. At that rate &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be up to the Minister to decide between them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Solomon did a great job &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I take it the Minister would not be afraid to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>It would not work in this &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>Judging by the last consultations, it would be the same people on the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>Alternatively, the Minister could accept my nominations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue is that if it is limited to a &ldquo;farmer&rdquo; then the question arises as to whether it is a farmer representative or a farmer. I accept the principle of the argument. I also said that Senator Coonan could make a recommendation, but I did not say he could appoint someone. He can do that when he is the Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>
      <P>Senator Callanan is correct, however, particularly under subsection (<i>b</i>) which states, &ldquo;one at least of whom avails of veterinary services in the course of business, trade or profession&rdquo;. Business, trade or profession includes the farming community and the Senator is correct in saying that someone who uses the veterinary service should be entitled to be part of the Veterinary Council. I do not have an issue with that. I foresee that this will happen.</P>
      <P>Another issue that stretched peoples&rsquo; imagination is the determination of who should represent animal welfare concerns on the council. Should it be a farmer, or should it be X, Y or Z? I would like the freedom to examine that more closely. Animal welfare is an area in which vets are involved, as are farmers. Unless they are not doing their job correctly, they will all have cognisance of animal welfare.</P>
      <P>However, there are other people who occupy a particular niche with regard to animal welfare, many of whom are supported by the Department, and they have done a fine job in creating awareness of animal welfare, particularly concerning pets. I feel such people should have a voice on the council. The legislation is purposely not prescriptive in order to allow flexibility on this issue. The aim is to be as fair and as flexible as possible. Often if one is over-prescriptive one can limit the possibilities.</P>
      <P>There are other areas where I would like to be over-prescriptive, for example, on the number of <Col N="79"/>women to be recommended by the governing bodies to the Minister. I believe that such recommendations should include at least one man and one woman. There is nothing to suggest I might not change my mind on this issue, although it is a matter for consideration under alternative types of legislation. While there are a number of women vets, it is also important that there be a good gender balance on a council such as this. I have been assured that will be the case and I hope it will happen.</P>

The question at issue did not relate to the substance of the amendment but whether it would be better achieved by means of the Bill or the Freedom of Information Act.

	<P>I second the amendment. Following our discussion on Committee Stage, I looked up what is officially covered under Class A diseases.

Unfortunately, I did not being the list with me.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to make the same case as has been made regarding the insertion of &ldquo;Class A&rdquo;. The Minister&rsquo;s reasoning for not mentioning &ldquo;Class A&rdquo; in the Bill was that this might not be the term used in ten or 20 years time when the legislation would still operate. However, I believe to do so would put at rest the minds of those with concerns.</P>
      <P>Section 46(3)(<i>a</i>) reads:</P><Col N="82"/>
      <P LI="1">This subsection applies to a person who &mdash;</P>
      <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) satisfies the Council that he or she has the requisite knowledge and skill for the purposes of <i>subsection (2)</i>,</P>
      <P FLI="0">My amendment No. 17 would replace this with &ldquo;has undergone courses of training and education, and acquired educational qualifications prescribed under <i>section 65</i>,&rdquo;. The subsection as drafted is too vague and needs to be more specific. The vagueness of &ldquo;satisfies the Council&rdquo; is not nearly as clear as the form of words I have suggested. A strong case can be made for this amendment, as it would satisfy those who are concerned that at some point in the future someone with lesser qualifications might be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister gave a very good explanation for the wording of the Bill as drafted. However, she would expect university Senators to defend professional qualifications. I believe Senator Quinn&rsquo;s amendment is worth accepting. The wording in the section as it stands is very loose. While I am sure the council would do its best when considering qualifications, it must be given guidelines, which is not the case with the words used. The person merely &ldquo;satisfies the Council that he or she has the requisite knowledge and skill for the purposes of <i>subsection (2)</i>,&rdquo;. This is not very objective and I would like the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate from where the profession is coming regarding amendment No. 17. It does not want to see what is commonly termed &ldquo;yellow packs&rdquo;. This is not the situation. This provision will only be invoked in the case of a disease eradication programme where there is an epidemic or pandemic. I evaluated this matter. Section 66(2) states: &ldquo;For the purposes of <i>subsection (1) </i>the Council shall consider any relevant recommendations furnished to it by the Education Committee under <i>section 63</i>.&rdquo; I assume the education committee would have the necessary prerequisites to determine whether people were qualified. This is not a determination of a permanent registration of the council or having a permanent post in the State. To be permanently registered, a person would have to be qualified and meet the same requirements as other vets.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this provision is to enable the Department, in due course, to address the fact that many vets are not entering conventional veterinary practice and choosing instead to work with pets rather than large animals. Vets have always worked with the farming organisations and the Department in carrying out a broad programme of disease eradication and inspection and have developed a good relationship with the farming fraternity. Unfortunately, however, the position is changing because some areas are no longer serviced by vets.</P>
      <P>The Department must have emergency legislation available to it to address any pandemic or epidemic that may arise. Registration would be <Col N="83"/>temporary and the people in question would be deregistered once the task at hand was completed. This means, for example, that a person from Australia, New Zealand or elsewhere brought here for a specific purpose would be deregistered as soon as the issue in question had been addressed. He or she would not be allowed to remain registered or establish a practice without holding the necessary qualifications.</P>
      <P>The Department is examining the possibility of introducing a consolidation Bill to address the issue of Class A and B diseases. Given that diseases evolve and change, it is possible that a Class B disease or an unknown entity could become a Class A disease. The provision introduces flexibility in dealing with unknown entities because the Department may need to take immediate action without first making classifications.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the Veterinary Council of Ireland and the Irish Veterinary Union are concerned the provision will allow individuals to circumvent the requirements their members had to meet prior to registration. Their concerns are unfounded, however, because any persons brought here must be qualified to perform the tasks they are requested to undertake. In the circumstances provided for they will, in the main, act under the instructions of departmental vets who will determine which tasks they will carry out.</P>
      <P>I am concerned to ensure Ireland continues to have a cohort of vets and avoids circumstances such as those prevailing in the United Kingdom where large areas and counties have no veterinary practices providing veterinary services. This is a frightening prospect and one which the Department may have to evaluate in due course.</P>
      <P>As I stated, the Bill makes provision for a temporary, emergency arrangement. This is an enabling provision which I hope will never be used. It introduces the flexibility required to deal with disease and will only be invoked in the event of an emergency. If something untoward happens, we will deal with it in due course.</P>

      <P FLI="0">When the Minister made her case regarding Class A disease, to a large extent, she put the cart before the horse. The qualification and signature of a veterinary surgeon or a veterinary practitioner, as it will become, are recognised worldwide. In an emergency, the Minister will enable other people to carry out these functions which will downgrade their position and is likely to lead to trouble in the future. I have stated that the number of diseases listed under Class A well and truly covers any potential concern the Minister or Department may raise. In this case, the Minister should examine Class A diseases and if a change is needed to cater for a disease or something that is likely to cause trouble, the Minister can make a suitable amendment. I am concerned that by permitting people to do the work of a veterinary surgeon in an emergency, the Minister will downgrade the profession in times to come. This would be a very serious and worrying development and I suggest the Minister should do it the other way around.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I should not have bothered to ask. One of the features that would be removed, perhaps unwittingly, if this amendment were accepted, is that under the definition of &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; one can have a situation where a person such as a farmer or farmhand is obliged to deal with an emergency. However, if one ties such a person to being registered on a temporary basis, it is no longer an emergency. I appreciate the Senator is trying to deal with an issue where one determines that an emergency reflects a Class A disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, I am specifically speaking about disease eradication here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is trying to limit the application of an emergency provision to Class A diseases. This is what the amendment means. I am aware this is not exactly what the Senator intends to do as he has agreed there are practical emergencies, where someone must deal with a fallen or injured animal. We do not wish to become tied up in red tape about that issue. I appreciate that what the Senator is saying is that one should have time to ensure that people who are temporarily registered can only deal with Class A diseases which harks back somewhat to the previous amendments. The Senator is correct <Col N="85"/>in stating that Class A and B diseases change as new diseases arise. I am considering the possibility of introducing a consolidation Bill on the issue of animal disease, but this will take some time. We have flexibility in that there are prerequisites to determine what a disease is in the first place.</P>
      <P>The amendment arises from an undue worry that this Bill undermines the veterinary profession. However, the Bill is intended to place the veterinary profession on the same level as the medical profession, as was reflected in a number of amendments. We have high educational standards for our vets and I do not want to have them undermined. That is not the intention or the practical implication of the Bill. This is also the case within the European Union and some other countries such as New Zealand and Australia. I will keep on eye on this issue and if we detect a situation whereby the rules are being circumvented, it will be dealt with quickly. However, many issues arise pertaining to emergencies and if I accept this amendment it will mean that unwittingly, I will prevent people from dealing with an emergency, which is not the Members&rsquo; intention.</P>

      <P FLI="0">This follows on from the debate on Committee Stage and concerns the section dealing with a registered person not using an incorrect title, with an important emphasis on a person who deliberately misleads the public into believing he or she has or uses a title which he or she is not necessarily qualified to use. This amendment seeks to delete the last part of the section, namely, &ldquo;the details of which are registered on the Register&rdquo;. I hope the Minister will examine this issue, use the practical approach she adopted during the passage of most of the Bill and accept this amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware that Senator McCarthy raised this issue on Committee Stage when he outlined his concern about the current wording of the section. I have indicated that it is designed to ensure the public is not misled as a result of a registered person displaying, for example, a title or qualification which he or she does not possess on the signage of his or her premises. However, if a person simply overlooks the registration of a qualification or speciality which is genuinely held, it would simply be a matter for that person to rectify the situation when his or her attention has been drawn to the oversight by the council. Moreover, one cannot envisage a person being subjected to serious disciplinary proceedings in a situation where he or <Col N="86"/>she has failed to register a qualification that he or she actually possesses. Hence, I am not in a position to accept the amendment as I do not think that kind of draconian ideology should be part of the council&rsquo;s work in a case where someone actually possessed a qualification and it was just a mere oversight.</P>

The inclusion of &ldquo;the testimony of the applicant&rdquo; is impractical in that a host of issues is associated therewith. The Bill itself would be better without that particular section.

	<P>I have evaluated this amendment and as the Senator is aware, we made quite a number of changes concerning evidence and a person&rsquo;s entitlement to know of what he or she is accused. I have given the fitness to practise com<Col N="87"/>mittee the flexibility to call upon the complainant to give direct evidence, where appropriate. The council will determine whether it is appropriate that this should be done. This is not a diktat but will take place when it would be appropriate to permit a person to give evidence. I do not envisage this in terms of someone giving evidence against himself or herself but as an opportunity for people. I want to have an open attitude under the fitness to practise provisions because it is a very onerous task. I would not like to have such an onerous task as either the medical or veterinary fitness to practise committees. I do not see the complainant as being under a microscope on this issue but the Bill provides an opportunity to put forward his or her case. It is appropriate to allow that possibility because the legislation permits the council, if it is appropriate, to determine that.</P>
      <P>I appreciate from where Senator McCarthy is coming. People might feel some pressure because they are talking about themselves or they may feel they are giving evidence against themselves, although that is a nonsensical way of looking at the question. However, the measure is not prescriptive so it permits this flexibility.</P>

	<P>By being so prescriptive, we would remove people who may have an indictable offence that does not affect their fitness to practise as vets. I gave the example of a person who was convicted of drink driving. Should this person be deregistered as a vet? Indictable offences that affect a person&rsquo;s fitness to practise as a vet will, of course, be treated differently. We have to be fair and say that there is no person in this House and this country who may or may not escape any type of impropriety of any sort over their lifetime. We should not punish people for offences which they may have committed but which do not affect their ability to practise as vets. It is on that basis that I prefer to not to be so prescriptive on this issue. There are issues regarding a person&rsquo;s ability within their profession, which will be dealt with by the council. <Col N="88"/>We are all practising politicians who know that people have unfortunate circumstances and I would prefer if we do not tie ourselves into knots because of a conviction which may not impinge upon a person&rsquo;s professional ability.</P>

      <P FLI="0">The legislation here appears to be loosely constructed although I accept that the Minister is speaking in terms of minor medical procedures and minor surgery. However, in human terms, a heart bypass operation was considered major surgery some years ago, whereas it is now considered minor surgery. If one is concerned about animal welfare and a situation prevails where remedies can be left up to individual veterinary surgeons, to the extent that they oversee them, the provisions set out in section 91(2) appear to allow them to do anything. They are very loose and the purpose of these amendments is to be more definite about what a veterinary nurse can and cannot do. This aspect of the Bill needs to be tightened up.</P>

	<P>There is a definition of &ldquo;minor&rdquo; in the Bill. Equally, we have carried out considerable work, which I agree was the right route to take, regarding the work of a veterinary nurse under the direction or in the presence of a veterinary practitioner. On that basis, we are allowing a new type of profession to develop. We are not saying that a veterinary nurse can carry out a major procedure. The legislation contains definitions of what constitute minor procedures. We would tie ourselves in knots if veterinary nurses were not permitted to do a stitch or deal with minor issues. I understood Senator Coonan was satisfied with the definition of &ldquo;minor&rdquo; given on Committee Stage. That is democracy at work.</P>
      <P>I would like to see the work of veterinary nurses develop. This is the first time that they have been recognised. It is a new type of profession and I agree that it has to be developed under the direction of others who are professionally qualified. However, the definition of &ldquo;minor&rdquo; in the Bill is appropriate and it determines what a veterinary nurse can and cannot do.</P>

I also understand that the council has indicated it is happy with amendments that have already been made. Regarding amendments Nos. 34 and 36, the concerns expressed by the Senators have been substantially addressed by the amendments we introduced on Committee Stage. According to the legal advice available to me, the term &ldquo;regularly&rdquo; is not sufficiently precise. Therefore, I am not in a position to accept the amendments.

	<P>The legal advice available to me is that it would not be possible to make provision for a joint application, as suggested by the amendment. However, it will be possible for veterinary practices to make private contractual arrangements among themselves, enabling a single applicant, in effect, to make an application on behalf of a practice. Equally, and things may change as they are evolving from a legislative perspective, the matter of partnership law as it relates to the professions is likely is be reviewed by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment as part of a review by the company law review group. If it has an implication on the basis of this registration over and above the contractual arrangements that are allowed to proceed, we must amend the legislation. It would be best to await the outcome of that discussion. The advice from the council to its members would be that a private contractual arrangement can be made whereby members are registered in a single practice.</P>

      <P FLI="0">We debated this on Committee Stage. The intention is to copper-fasten the Bill&rsquo;s provisions. The existing provision, at section 110(2), states: &ldquo;Only a registered person may apply for, or be granted, a certificate under <i>subsection (1)</i>.&rdquo; However, there is no definition of the word &ldquo;registered&rdquo;. The amendment is clear and leaves no room for doubt.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>A consequence of the amendment would be to exclude the possibility of veterinary nurses applying on their own behalf to register veterinary premises. We must have a balance between on the one hand, the established profession of practitioners and, on the other hand, nurses. In the case of veterinary nurses, there is an opportunity for them to register in their own right. As nurses will carry out certain tasks, these tasks will operate either in the presence of or under the direction of a practitioner. Often in practice, veterinary nurses who are registered in their own premises carry out post-operative work. This type of treatment, as carried out under the direction of a veterinary surgeon, practitioner, specialist or whatever, was the issue brought to my attention.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is also complementary work, such as grooming, for which a veterinary nurse would be allowed to register. Under the amendment, he or she would not be able to do certain things unless under direction. I do not wish to prevent veterinary nurses from registering although I appreciate from where the Senator is coming in that people cannot simply stick up signs and claim they are registered. However, the question of with whom they are registered is another issue. For this reason it is important that the council does its work to ensure people are aware of what will be within the remit of the legislation.</P>
      <P>There are some veterinary nurses who are registered and carry out specific types of practices. They work with veterinary practitioners and, on this basis, Senator Quinn&rsquo;s amendment would discommode them from a practical point of view. It would also disallow them from a type of practice that is holistically complementary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <P LI="1">In page 86, line 15, after &ldquo;suitability&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or a copy thereof&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">We debated a similar amendment on Committee Stage. I have an issue with the certificate of suitability being displayed in the premises itself. I see no logical reason as to why a copy cannot suffice. Having experience of dealing with officials while searching for original copies of certificates and documents, it is a difficult and onerous task. It is bureaucratic and unnecessary in many cases and this amendment adds to the security of maintaining such original documents and certification. We must do this for the sake of being non-bureaucratic and for assisting those who panic when they cannot find original documents. For example, a passport application is a typical case where people scramble at the last minute to find original documentation.</P>
      <P>These certificates are vital and they must be secure and maintained. I appeal to the Minister to subscribe to the notion that they must be stored in safe places and not left hanging on walls. A copy should suffice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment. We had a good debate on Committee Stage and I agree with Senator McCarthy&rsquo;s point. Documents are hard to come by and are not always easily replaced. I keep my birth certificate in a safe for when I need it but I have a copy if it is required for other occasions. The same applies in this instance.</P>
      <P>We passed legislation concerning driving licences to the effect they must be carried while driving. I am unhappy with this. Copies can now be easily obtained. I am sure the Minister will accept this amendment due to the manner in which the House has accepted her other points. It is sensible, logical and correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I also support the amendment. I previously made the suggestion of using a copy. If the Minister does not find a copy acceptable for display on a premises, her Department should insist that dual copies are issued when a person makes an application or qualifies for a certificate. If so and if the Minister insists on an original being placed on a wall, the person will have a second original to be in safe keeping. The amendment is logical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has learned much from her predecessor, Deputy Joe Walsh. Every now and then he would throw the House a bone, a little amendment such as this. We would all be <Col N="93"/>grateful and then assist in passing whatever legislation he introduced.</P>
      <P>We know what happens to originals if they are too easily accessed. Signposts are now taken home as souvenirs, never mind a nice little document denoting a registered veterinary premises. I hope the Minister can see her way to throwing in little bones, as have former Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>We threw in 75 bones recently. Every now and then we need a bit of craic when discussing legislation. The easiest place to find a copy is on the wall as it will always be there, whereas if it were in a drawer it would never be found. In my previous portfolio Senator McCarthy and I agreed on the introduction of good legislation with regard to access to birth certificates. It can now be done anywhere in the country in 30 seconds. It is progress and there is now no need to cry about birth certificates.</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>If Senator McCarthy is stuck for a birth certificate, he does not have to travel to Dublin but can get one closer to home. He should not feel he is ever under pressure when getting an original.</P>
      <P>We are not speaking about a copy of one&rsquo;s qualifications. The first action everyone takes after receiving their qualifications is to place them on a wall to show how great they are.</P>

      <P FLI="0">I explained this issue at great length on Committee Stage. Why is it only a veterinary premises <Col N="94"/>which can be entered if the authorised officer believes something is wrong? It could be as relevant for the authorised officer to be able to enter a premises which is not a veterinary one. I realise this extends the provision. If an authorised officer believes a registered veterinary practitioner is acting in an unprofessional manner, he or she should not have to wait until the veterinary practitioner is found on a veterinary premises. I realise most of these activities will probably take place on a veterinary premises but it would be better if we did not confine it to such premises. It restricts matters to an extent that might make it impossible for the practitioner to be discovered engaging in misdemeanours as he or she could engage in such activities elsewhere.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 43:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 87, line 17, after &ldquo;premises,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;on foot of the issue of a warrant issued by a judge of the District Court,&rdquo;.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P FLI="0">We are back to the Committee Stage debate when I spoke about rights in respect of a person&rsquo;s home. A person&rsquo;s home and veterinary practice could be the same premises. Interestingly, the report of the Data Protection Commissioner was published yesterday, on which I called for a debate on this morning&rsquo;s Order of Business. I am concerned about the invasion of privacy that may occur as a result of legislation being slipped through. My first experience of this occurrence was in the context of the Competition Bill which gave rights to invade a person&rsquo;s premises in pursuit of infor<Col N="95"/>mation. I am concerned we are passing legislation without reminding ourselves that we are giving the right to somebody, other than a court of law, to invade a premises. While I understand why we do so in the context of drug, tax and competition offences, I am reluctant to allow somebody, other than a judge, to make that decision.</P>
      <P>The amendment states &ldquo;on foot of the issue of a warrant issued by a judge of the District Court,&rdquo; which is stated elsewhere in that if one wants to inspect another premises, one must go to court to get that right. However, in this case, one does not need to do that. The Minister will state that a veterinary premises is not somebody&rsquo;s home but it is possible that it could be. I express this concern that we may end up in a police state by allowing legislation to intrude on our private lives without a court order. I would like the Minister to put my mind at rest or to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment. I would like some equality to apply in the searching of premises. When I spoke about this issue on Committee Stage, I said the Veterinary Council would not want people to have illegal drugs, such as angel dust and so on, on their premises. However, I have a considerable amount of sympathy for veterinarians in respect of various drugs they may have on their premises. Immediately after I spoke about what reputable people they were, I noted two veterinarians were had up somewhere for bringing in some drugs which could, in fact, be useful.</P>
      <P>Veterinarians face a very difficult situation, particularly in regard to equine drugs. The horse is considered part of the food chain despite the fact thoroughbred horses are most unlikely to end up in the food chain, although perhaps the Minister knows horses which perhaps should end up in the food chain as result of running too slowly. This is a considerable problem because there are drugs which are very satisfactory for horses, for example, butazolidin which is probably the most successful anti-inflammatory drug for inflammatory ailments in horses. However, it is not allowed because there is a small risk of aplastic anaemia in humans. It is not really a practical proposition to suggest that humans will get aplastic anaemia from whatever amount of horse meat they may eat where the horse has been given butazolidin. Veterinarians&rsquo; hands are severely tied.</P>
      <P>I understand an EU group has come together in London to consider veterinary medicines. However, I do not know what progress it is making. Ireland is particularly disadvantaged because the market is smaller. For a company to sell some of these drugs in this country would involve considerable expense and it would not be in its interests to bother doing so. We have what are described in medicine as &ldquo;orphan drugs&rdquo; which could be very useful for some animals, particularly expensive race horses and so on.</P>
      <P>We have seen people run into trouble as a result of using human drugs because perhaps <Col N="96"/>there were no similar drugs in the veterinary line which could be used and it has caused much grief and distress. Such veterinary drugs would perhaps be available and licensed in America given the considerable number of animals there on which they could be used. I have a fair amount of sympathy for veterinarians in respect of this issue. I do not believe the Minister can do much to persuade the pharmaceutical companies making veterinary medicines to apply for licences for drugs for which there will be little demand.</P>
      <P>Veterinarians are being singled out here and people can go into their premises without warrants. Of course, they must act within the law but it is hard on them in respect of the treatment of some animals. Everybody should be searched in the same manner rather than veterinarians being singled out. If any of these drugs were kept on other premises, the authorised officer would need to get a search warrant before entering the premises but he or she would not have to do so in respect of the registered veterinary officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I support these amendments. Senator Quinn articulates his views very well. We have to be careful about those to who we give the power to search people&rsquo;s homes. It is a significant authority to invest in anybody and there are prescribed methods by which that should be done. This certainly reflects Senator Quinn&rsquo;s amendment which outlines the only way such a search should be allowed to be carried out.</P>
      <P>There is a second issue in regard to the location of a premises and the home place. I know of a practice that is conducted for two hours, one evening per week. A bedroom in a bungalow has been converted for the purpose of holding that clinic. Therefore, to go into the home place where there is a family is unnecessary and extreme. I urge the Minister to look at the amendment with a view to accepting it on that basis. This is an important issue and goes beyond the power one entrusts in these people. The issue of privacy is important and dear to all of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan"><NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
	<P>On balance I support amendment No. 43, as I did on the last occasion. I ask the Minister to give it favourable consideration. To enter such premises would be an intrusion without the warrant being properly structured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendments, particularly amendment No. 43 in the names of Senators Quinn and Henry. I am concerned about what is contained in the legislation. This matter was argued at great length on Committee Stage when the Minister gave an undertaking that she would look at it again and, perhaps, come back with amendments. I am disappointed she has not done so because I thought she was getting the core of our amendment. Will the Minister define what she and her Department would define as &ldquo;reasonable force&rdquo;? Is she proposing to set up a hit squad or a crack squad within the Department that would go around breaking down doors?</P><Col N="97"/>
      <P>There is one organisation charged with administering law and order and that is the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I support Senator Quinn on going down the District Court route or at a minimum getting a search warrant from a chief superintendent in the area. Reasonable force should be used or exercised only by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It is deplorable that the Bill provides for the use of &ldquo;reasonable force&rdquo; by a Department. Will the Minister clarify what is meant by &ldquo;reasonable force&rdquo;? Is she in favour of a hit squad or hit men going around the country breaking down doors or will she employ lads of 20 stone like me to break down a door to get into a premises? This is a worrying issue and it cannot be allowed to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree. My problem is that in the interregnum between our debate on Committee and Report Stages I have not had finality on my discussions with the Attorney General. My personal view is that there should be equity. Therefore, in the case of registered and unregistered premises we should look at a court order. Unfortunately, I have not been in a position to provide the amendment to the House. I will probably have to provide a further amendment at our further discussions in the other House and bring it back to this House.</P>
      <P>There are some concerns in the Attorney General&rsquo;s office with regard to the exact issue raised, and other types of legislation where a search warrant would not be the appropriate way to proceed. Such measures are designed for use in an emergency which is not the case in the scenario we are discussing regarding this legislation. I am working on that issue and I hope to provide the amendment in due course.</P>
      <P>The court will determine what is &ldquo;reasonable force&rdquo;. If a search warrant is required the Garda will be present. Therefore, it is a matter for the Garda and the court. It is not a matter for the Minister or the council to determine what is &ldquo;reasonable force&rdquo;. I am taking on board the Senators&rsquo; concerns. I agree with them and will table the necessary amendment in due course.</P>
      <P>I do not know how we sometimes come to debate horses. Under the new passport scheme there are exemptions for horses, which will address some of the concerns raised. In other words, if they are for human consumption that is written on it and certain issues have to be adhered to. If they are not for human consumption that is also written on it.</P>
      <P>I doubt very much if a horse that has won the Gold Cup will be on anybody&rsquo;s plate. It would certainly be an expensive evening. The Senator is correct in saying there are practical issues in regard to drugs. It is a very expensive process to have drugs approved by the Medical Council.</P>
      <P>Under a new EU Directive 2004/20/8 vets, under controls, will be allowed to import foreign drugs. That will address the issue to which the Senator has adverted. Many drug companies have pointed out that making a number of drugs avail<Col N="98"/>able here would be very expensive. Given that the EU directive is being introduced it should address the concerns of the vets.</P>

	<P>The Minister has used moderate words. In regard to an amendment we tabled with the best of intentions, time has not been found to answer it and it may be answered in the other House, in which case it will come back to us. We would like the kudos of having it in this House rather than in the other House.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister and her officials for the way in which they have handled the Bill. We look forward to the outstanding one or two amendments coming back to the House. The Bill is a much improved and better Bill than when it originally came before the House.

	<P>I thank the Minister and her officials for this very good Bill which has come before the House. I thank her too for her courtesy and the good humour with which she deals with all of us. It is important legislation and I hope she can encourage the Minister for Health and Children to bring forward a medical practice Bill as soon as possible and, perhaps, a few hints from her Department would be useful in regard to the setting up of registers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I add my congratulations to the officials and to the Minister and echo the words of Senator Henry regarding the manner in which the Minister dealt with this Bill. It had a long gestation but nothing seemed to be happening until the Minister took hold of it. I reiterate that she dealt with the Bill in a logical, rational and moderate manner. I did not use the phrase, &ldquo;pleasant smile&rdquo; but I could have done so. I assure the Minister it is a powerful weapon to ensure amendments are withdrawn.</P>

	<P>I join with my colleagues in the expression of appreciation to the Minister and to the officials. It is fair to say that at 12 or 14 years, this is the longest gestation of any Bill ever known. At long last, we have a substantial and competent Bill. In my communications with interested bodies such as the Veterinary Council, Veterinary Ireland and the Irish Veterinary Association, I am aware they are substantially satisfied with the Bill.</P>
      <P>I refer to Senator Henry&rsquo;s contribution this morning in which she said, &ldquo;Give us a bone, Minister.&rdquo; Not alone did the Minister give us a bone but she took the carcass of the Bill and put flesh on it. She made a Bill out of something that needed alteration and reconstruction and I congratulate her. The House appreciates what she has achieved. This is a substantial Bill which has gone through this House without a vote and that is to be appreciated. I thank the Minister and her officials.</P>

	<P>I thank the Seanad for accommodating this legislation. Since its initiation we have developed this legislation to reflect many of the concerns which the Department, the profession representatives and Members have brought to my attention.</P>
      <P>I agree this Bill, brought forward by my colleague, the former Minister, Deputy Walsh has had a long gestation. This type of legislation must reflect modern trends.</P>
      <P>I thank Senators for their constructive proposals and for working with me to ensure this is the best possible legislation. I thank the two officials who accompany me who have suffered in rewriting this legislation since its initiation and other members of the staff of the Department. Unless one is on this side of the House, one does not appreciate the amount of work involved in drafting legislation and in the consultative process.</P>
      <P>I believe the legislation will reflect the concerns of the profession regarding its regulatory needs and equally will address many of the human concerns raised. I thank the House for its support in ensuring the passing of the Bill.</P>

This provision is in response to a request from the harbour companies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>In respect of amendments Nos. 9 and 19, is there some future plan to extend the remit of Waterways Ireland to take over the functions of local authorities in this area? The legislation seems to place Waterways Ireland at a plane just above that of the other bodies. The provisions indicate that local authorities and harbour companies can enter into joint agreements. I assume this means, for example, that local authorities can make by-laws in respect of waters under the jurisdiction of harbour authorities but not in the jurisdiction of Waterways Ireland. I do not argue it would be a negative development for Waterways Ireland to become a more powerful body in the future but I seek the Minister of State&rsquo;s clarification on this point.</P>
      <P>A number of ports come under the provisions of the Harbours Acts 1946 and 1976. Does this legislation refer to some of the larger ports, such <Col N="104"/>as Dublin, Waterford, Cork, Shannon, Limerick and so on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>In regard to the Senator&rsquo;s first point, that is not the Bill&rsquo;s intention. Second, all harbour and port authorities, large and small, will be included in the provisions of the Bill.</P>
      <P>By way of background, the objective of the Bill is to strengthen the currently inadequate local authority powers. The purpose of amendment No. 9 is to include Waterways Ireland within the definition of &ldquo;authority&rdquo; which is used as a convenient shorthand term when discussing the various powers, duties and functions provided to local authorities, harbour authorities and Waterways Ireland under the provisions of the Bill. The term &ldquo;harbour authority&rdquo; is similarly being redefined to include harbour authorities established under the Harbours Acts 1946 to 1976.</P>
      <P>Waterways Ireland is one of the six North-South Implementation Bodies established under the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999. It has direct responsibility for the management, maintenance and development of the navigable waters of the island. Specifically, that covers the Royal Canal, the Grand Canal, the Barrow navigation and the southern part of the Shannon-Erne waterway.</P>
      <P>When it was initiated in June last year, the Bill could not cover waters under the control or management of Waterways Ireland without agreement first being reached by means of the agreed structures of the North-South Ministerial Council. Agreement has since been achieved with the assistance of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. It is perhaps fortuitous that the Bill did not get through previously as we can now use it as a vehicle to include Waterways Ireland.</P>

      <P FLI="0">I thank the Minister of State and his officials for accepting this amendment and for supplying us with the extensive briefing notes on the more than 60 amendments that were tabled to meet the concerns that were raised on Second Stage. When I got those notes, I wondered if it might have been better for the Bill as initiated to have been withdrawn and for it to have been rewritten to incorporate all of them. I assume that there is a good reason why that was not done as the process appears cumbersome. However, I commend the Minister of State and thank him for taking on board the extensive concerns that were raised in this House on Second Stage, which was taken some time ago. I also thank him for responding in the way that he did, which has made the process comprehensible. I wish other Departments would do the same.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for ensuring the change contained in amendment No.15, which I referred to in my speech on Second Stage.

    </Speaker><Col N="106"/>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The importance of the Second Stage debate is demonstrated. The issues were raised by Senators previously. Senator O&rsquo;Meara and her colleagues tabled amendments that were the same as my amendments Nos. 14 and 15. I acknowledge her kind words about our officials. I asked them to provide the briefing material because of the major changes that have been made. The Senator suggests that we should have perhaps withdrawn the Bill, but the end product will be much the same, and we will possibly get there more quickly. It was important that Senators received a full, comprehensive brief.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 14 and 15 are similar in that respect. I am pleased that we were able to accommodate Senator O&rsquo;Meara and her colleagues. Senator Kenneally also raised the issues at the time. The Senators are as familiar with the issues as I am, so there might not be any need to go into more detail, except to say that, given changes in technology, it was important that the 2.5 m threshold was removed. I am glad that there is<?oasys _jy?>unanimity on that.</P>

	<P>I move amendment 16:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 8, subsection (1), line 6, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This is a small amendment, the purpose of which is to delete the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;. As we know from our experience as legislators in this House, language is extremely important when one is putting a Bill together, particularly with little words such as &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo;. The amendment aims to ensure that the regulation and control of recreational craft, as provided for under the Bill, are achieved. This would not be assured if the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; was to apply. The Long Title provides that the purpose of the Bill is &ldquo;for the regulation and control of&rdquo; recreational craft. It is important to ensure that it is not a case of permitting something to be done, but requiring it to be done. In other words, the regulation must be required, rather than simply allowed for. My concern is that simply allowing for regulation does not go far enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>Although I would like to be able to accommodate the Senator, I believe that it should be left to the relevant authorities to decide whether or not to make by-laws under section 4 as it stands, rather than obliging them to make what could be needless by-laws. If there is not a problem for certain local authorities at some ports, why introduce regulations unless they are necessary? Such regulation will be a matter for local authorities. That is why I have decided not to accept the proposal to delete the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;. It is better that such matters be left to local authorities to decide. <Col N="107"/>Some local authorities will have very little input in this area. If the wording was &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, some of them may make needless by-laws. I do not think that having &ldquo;may&rdquo; in any way dilutes the Bill or removes anything from it that helps achieve our objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I will consider what the Minister of State has said, and will withdraw the amendment, although I may reconsider the matter on Report Stage.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 8, subsection (1), lines 6 and 7, to delete &ldquo;regulating or controlling the operation of craft&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This is a drafting amendment. My understanding is that the words &ldquo;regulating or controlling the operation of craft&rdquo; might be interpreted so as to limit in some way the matters that can be dealt with by by-laws. In any case, I am also informed that there is a grammatical problem with the existing lines 6 and 7 on page 8, which refer to the &ldquo;operation of craft&rdquo; by local authorities and so on. That wording is ambiguous. This drafting amendment is designed to be helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised that the words &ldquo;regulating or controlling the operation of craft&rdquo; are an essential for any by-laws to be made under section 4. Senators will appreciate that the Oireachtas has responsibility for primary legislation. If the Oireachtas or the Minister delegate responsibilities to other bodies then it would be somewhat dangerous to leave them open-ended or to give the bodies concerned <i>carte blanche</i> to act. We must provide powers that are definite. We need to know their limitations. The Senator also asked about the text, and I will consider that aspect on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>

	<P>This is merely a technical amendment.

	<P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 8, subsection (1), between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P LI="2">&ldquo;(v) such other matters as in the opinion of the authority concerned are ancillary or related to the foregoing matters.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Through amendment No. 21 we wish to ensure that the by-laws can be comprehensive. A by-law prohibiting a person from being carried on a pleasure craft which is unlawfully operated might be held to be outside the scope of the requirement that the by-laws regulate the operation of craft. Accordingly, there is a good case for a general catch-all clause to permit a local authority to provide for ancillary or incidental matters. This amendment is very much in the context and spirit of the legislation, which is to give a particular local authority the necessary latitude to ensure that pleasure craft are as fully regulated as it may wish them to be. It is very important that the by-laws are comprehensive. The legislation goes a long way towards achieving that but this amendment is designed to provide for ancillary or incidental matters giving a local authority extra leeway if required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I have difficulty in agreeing to this amendment giving local authorities the extra leeway suggested by Senator O&rsquo;Meara. The amendment is too wide and somewhat vague for the Oireachtas. Under the Constitution we have responsibility for primary legislation and to decide the scope of by-laws that are made. It is necessary to set down in primary legislation the policies and principles to show the specific purpose for which by-laws may be made.</P><Col N="109"/>
      <P>There can be no question of open-ended or <i>carte blanche</i> by-law making powers. The Supreme Court has ruled in past that the Oireachtas is responsible for primary legislation. While we can delegate to the local authorities to certain specific limits, these cannot be exceeded. If we were to go down the road of allowing for such matters as the opinion of the authority concerned we would be vulnerable as this would be too wide. We must stay within the framework of policies or principles. There must be a balance between local area control and national requirements. That is the advice I have received and I am not in a position to accept this amendment.</P>

	<P>These amendments are self-explanatory. The purpose of the five amendments is to increase from &euro;3,000 to &euro;5,000 the maximum fine on summary conviction originally proposed in the Bill. This is in accordance with the recent decision of the Attorney General that the maximum fine for summary offences generally should be updated to increase the deterrent effect. In short it is to ensure the increased maximum fine is a deterrent. It is a matter for the courts to decide what the fine should be.</P>
      <P>There are proposals to introduce a fines Bill in the future and I hope that would ensure that fines could be increased on an annual or biannual basis in line with inflation or the consumer price index <Col N="110"/>or whatever the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may decide.

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a technical question for the Minister of State. In the context of the amendment, I notice that in section 10(2), a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can arrest a person without warrant. Is this a departure from the norm or is this now normal practice? I know of the concept of citizen&rsquo;s arrest.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 24 is consequential on Government amendment No. 25 which provides comprehensively for the power to arrest suspected offenders without warrant. If I may refer to Senator Mooney&rsquo;s question, this is standard practice now and the House would agree that in a situation where jet skis or vessels are in water, in the time a warrant could be obtained for arrest a tragic accident may already have occurred and the legal advice is that this is the correct way to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Minister of State for his answer. My reason for asking the question was not just with regard to whether it was a departure from the norm. I am sure the Minister of State can envisage a scenario where a garda on his or her own, although given the right by this legislation to arrest someone without a warrant, may face more than one person.</P>
      <P>There could be a potential conflict as, after all, if the garda is contemplating arrest the individuals are in breach of the law. Can the Minister of State reassure the House that this power, while it will be included in the Bill, will be used in a very practical way? I would hate to see a situation where a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na might be subjected to any form of physical abuse as a result of having the right to execute an arrest in these circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>This provision would only be used in cases where there are extenuating circumstances. However, even one such circumstance is one too many. This provision is in place to cover potentially serious offences. Those of us living <Col N="111"/>near waterways or on the coast know the consequences and that too often lives have been claimed. I take the point made by the Senator.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>This is a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the individual, or individuals, involved. I am sure it will not be abused in any way and will be used sparingly. I have no doubt that, as the Garda has requested this provision, it is the sensible thing to do. I take on board the concerns of Senator Mooney. I hope garda&iacute; will not be disadvantaged as a result of being on their own. The general public and the vast majority of those who go to sea are responsible, sensible people. The legislation is wide ranging and must cover all of those concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no problem with what is proposed in amendment No. 25. From a practical point of view, how is an authorised person going to operate within the functional area of another authority? If he or she sees somebody acting illegally in another functional authority area or is pursuing somebody who enters the area of another functional authority, how will he or she obtain authorisation quickly? If contact cannot be made immediately, the opportunity for apprehension will be lost. What practical mechanism exists whereby an authorised person can operate in a functional area other than the one to which he or she is attached?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>This issue was raised at the initial stages of drafting this legislation. There is provision for hot pursuit, for example, for leaving Waterford and entering the functional area of Wexford or crossing the bay from Donegal to Sligo. If the legislation did not make provision for hot pursuit it would be weak and would not achieve its objective.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>When this legislation defines &ldquo;authorised persons&rdquo; it refers specifically to garda&iacute;. The Bill also refers to various Harbours Acts which provide for harbour masters in many areas. Harbour master positions are statutory and while they can become authorised persons if the harbour boards appoint them, there should be automatic recognition for them in the legislation. I do not understand the reason they are excluded because, in reality, they will become authorised persons. Their unique position would suggest that they should be included in the primary legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I had anticipated this question. Some harbour masters fear that the Bill&rsquo;s provisions for the appointment of authorised persons to enforce the law against improper use of fast powered water craft would interfere with their safety and their other duties under the Harbours Acts. I am advised that this fear is not well founded.</P>
      <P>Harbour masters are appointed by the port companies and I expect that when such companies appoint authorised persons, that the harbour masters would be some of the appointees and would be fully involved in all safety matters. It is not an issue for the Legislature but for the port companies. I would be overstepping my responsibility in naming specific people. It is for me to <Col N="114"/>refer to authorised persons and it is a matter for the requisite bodies to decide who they should be.</P>

Persons in charge of, or accruing vessels are obliged to be aware of and follow any such safety codes relating to the vessels.</P>
      <P>The new Part 3 comprises 15 sections, 18 to 32. Section 18 prohibits the sailing of unseaworthy vessels and makes it an offence for any persons in command of the vessel in accordance with the terms of subsection (1) and the owner or hirer of the vessel in accordance with the terms of subsection (2) if they know or discover by ordinary care that the vessel is unseaworthy. Subsection (3) provides for a fine and/or imprisonment on conviction by the court for such offences. Subsection (4) is a standard defence provision to allow for actions taken in good faith.</P>

	<P>This is the new section 21 and makes clear provision in primary legislation for prohibiting in section 1 and penalising in section 2 operation of any vessels in Irish waters and any Irish ships in waters anywhere by any person under the influence of alcohol or drugs or both. These provisions in primary legislation were recommended by the Office of the Attorney General to avoid challenge to the prohibition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a query with regard to the practical implementation of this measure. I agree totally with the thrust of the legislation. If the person in command of a particular vessel is under the influence of alcohol, the Garda cannot breathalyse him or her. They can only breathalyse such a person under the Road Traffic Acts. Does this mean they cannot do so in this regard? Is this a flaw in the legislation, and perhaps a loophole through which somebody can avoid being convicted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The legislation to which the Senator refers is not applicable here. The garda can arrest, on suspicion of the person having con<Col N="119"/>sumed alcohol, even if the garda does not have a breathalyser at the time. This is a major step forward because heretofore one could be in control of a vessel while under the influence of alcohol and there was very little that could be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for clarifying the matter and thank Senator Kenneally for raising it. I was concerned as to whether the measure contained in this legislation was as rigorous as that available under the Road Traffic Acts. I am assuming it is, but perhaps the Minister could provide reassurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome this measure regarding intoxication. Unfortunately these regulations will most likely be enacted after a major tragedy. There are garda&iacute; and checkpoints on the roads. I had a pleasure craft on the Shannon and it was clear that the vast amount of people in control of such crafts had consumed alcohol. Are we going far enough? Is there a case for having spot-checks at locks and so forth? Unfortunately such enforcements will be put in place after a major incident, perhaps one involving a death. We should be proactive rather than reactive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>Our hands are tied until the Bill is enacted, which is all the more reason for me to take responsibility and co-operate with Senators to get the Bill through this House and on to the D&aacute;il so that it can be enacted as quickly as possible. It is possible that accidents will occur between this and the date of enforcement.</P>
      <P>The legislation is rigorous. Suspicion is a more than sufficient basis on which to arrest a person responsible. I would like to consider whether I could tighten this provision between now and Report Stage. If I feel I could introduce an amendment to strengthen this provision I would be happy to do so. Members of both Houses are anxious that all measures be taken.</P>
      <P>I hope what I am about to say does not fall on deaf ears. I remind all those going to sea and those responsible for a vessel or its navigation that they have a personal responsibility. While it is not statutory, they have a moral obligation. From what the Senator has said, I take it he has some experience. We want to send out the clear message that as soon as the legislation is enacted we will try to deal with these occurrences. It is sad to think that some people are so irresponsible that they consume alcohol and then navigate a boat on our waterways or our seas. We can only legislate and establish a framework. However, if people are totally irresponsible it makes it more difficult to apprehend them. We certainly will attempt to do so and the rigours of the law should be taken into consideration. These people should be arrested and then it will become a matter for the courts to decide their fate.</P>

    <P LI="1" el="5">&ldquo;22.&mdash;(1) A person on board a vessel in Irish waters or an Irish ship in waters anywhere shall not consume alcohol or take a drug or any combination of drugs or drugs and alcohol while on board the vessel in circumstances which could affect the safety of persons or create a disturbance or nuisance on board the vessel or affect the safety of other persons using Irish waters or constitute a nuisance to such persons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The new section 22 complements the new section 21. It makes clear provision in primary legislation for prohibiting persons while on board a vessel in Irish waters and any Irish ships in waters anywhere from consuming alcohol or drugs or both which could endanger other persons on board the vessel or on the water or cause a nuisance. The person in command or charge of the vessel is obliged to ensure compliance with that prohibition. Subsection (3) provides for a fine and-or imprisonment on conviction by the court for an offence under subsection (1). These provisions in primary legislation were recommended by the Office of the Attorney General so as to avoid challenge to the prohibition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>How will these provisions be enforced, particularly late at night? I know of stops along the Shannon used by pleasure craft with public houses nearby. It is quite common for people to get off the boat, go to the pub or restaurant and come back again, which could happen quite late at night. Without having officers at every stop along the way, how can we ensure such situations do not get out of control? People often take a boat on the Shannon for pleasure purposes including birthday parties etc. During the summer in particular, it is quite common that a reasonable amount of alcohol might be consumed although not, I hope, by the person steering the craft. How do we ensure the peace and quiet and good behaviour we all want?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>What resources will be given to enforcing these provisions? Senator O&rsquo;Meara has outlined the issue of people getting off and on vessels to go to hostelries along the Shannon. I do not believe the Garda is fully equipped to <Col N="121"/>apprehend such people who overindulge in alcohol. How will these provisions be enforced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>Nobody can give a 100% guarantee. The person in command of the boat has the responsibility to keep good order. It will not be possible to have an authorised person at every port or stop along inland waterways like the Shannon. Spot checks will be vital and as a deterrent the authorised persons should be seen, which will be a matter for the local authorities or the harbour authorities. If it were all so simple we could ensure that zero tolerance applied and if the same were true for drunken driving on the road we would have no difficulty there either. Once the legislation is enacted we need to send out the right signals. If it is necessary to make an example of some, then so be it. I reiterate my earlier statement that the person in command has responsibility not only to himself or herself, but also to all others on the boat. I am making it very clear to all the prescribed bodies and the authorised officers who will be appointed by those prescribed bodies, that they should be seen and be active.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment is the first of a batch of substantial amendments. It inserts a new Part 4 to update vessel safety regulation provisions. The new Part 4 has three sections, new sections 33 to 35, inclusive. The new section 33 updates and restates, for ease of reference, enforcement and administration, regulation-making sections 18, passenger boats; 19, fishing vessels; and 20, pleasure craft; and also section 27, fixed payment notices of the Merchant Shipping Act 1992 (No. 2), as substantially amended by the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Act 2000 (No. 14). Subsection (3) of <Col N="136"/>the new section 33 provides on standard lines for the continuance in force of existing regulations as if made under the relevant section of the 1992 Act as now being amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a substantial and comprehensive amendment. Does the term &ldquo;pleasure craft&rdquo; include jet skis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>The new section 33 inserted by the amendment will regulate jet skis. I am particularly interested in the section which will give the Minister power to make regulations providing that the use of a pleasure craft must not create a disturbance or constitute a nuisance. This issue was raised by many Senators on Second Stage, particularly in terms of inland waterways and lakes. Does the new section give the Minister power to make by-laws to control jet skis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I also seek to have this issue addressed. The House had a spirited debate on Second Stage on what constitutes a nuisance and, specifically, the lack of powers accruing to local authorities to penalise excessively robust jet skiing which could upset boat passage. Am I speaking to the right section? During the Second Stage debate, when the former Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy John Browne, was in the House, some difficulty arose because of Northern Ireland, the waterways and the lack of control whereby the inland waterways did not have the legal right to intervene which in turn meant that neither did the local authorities. I want clarification on that point. I informed the interested parties in my home in Athlone that this Bill was due for discussion this week and that I would raise the point. I want clarity from the Minister of State on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am unsure if I am speaking on the same issue, but currently the use of jet skis varies under the by-laws introduced by local authorities. I wonder if this will involve on-the-spot fines and penalties up to &euro;2,000. The Leader of the House has correctly stated that all the Members appear to have a difficulty with jet skis and while one does not wish to make jet skiers out as &ldquo;bad boys&rdquo;, this is an issue about which all Members are concerned. Will this strengthen the by-laws that are introduced by local authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment appears to be very substantial but is merely a restatement of sections 18, 19 and 20 of the 1992 Act, as was extensively amended by the 2000 Act. This was necessary to improve the law&rsquo;s coherence. In each case, the opportunity was taken to substitute &ldquo;personal flotation devices&rdquo; for &ldquo;life jackets&rdquo; and to provide for prohibition by regulation of towing anything from or by vessels, except fishing nets by fishing vessels which was not included, and to regulate the number of persons who may be car<Col N="137"/>ried. This was covered under various subsections of sections 18 and 19. The opportunity was taken to substantially amend the Bill. I give credit to Members of this House who raised many of the issues and practicalities that they had experienced in the midlands or elsewhere. This was all-embracing.</P>
      <P>The Leader of the House, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, referred to the inland waterways. When amending the Bill, we took the opportunity to include Waterways Ireland which we could not have done previously. However, due to the fact that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>How is it possible to do so now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>It is now possible because the necessary approval of one of the six cross-Border groups has been secured. We now have the approval and <i>imprimatur</i> which was lacking when the Bill was initiated and the Second Stage was debated in this House in June 2004.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Is this now legal? Can it be enforced now? Previously, doubt existed because it was under the aegis of a cross-Border body and this House did not have the legal right to intervene and interfere. Can the Minister of State spell out who has the authority? How has the Minister of State managed to circumvent or include it? Which agency now has the powers for fining or intervening if there is misuse of the waterways?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I also want the Minister of State to provide an expansion of the points raised by Senator O&rsquo;Rourke because they are crucial to an understanding of the issue.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise another issue which I have raised with the Minister of State on a number of occasions previously. This new Part 4 of the Bill makes provision for passenger boats, fishing vessels and pleasure craft and the three sections mirror each other. In each, the phrase used is &ldquo;may provide for the registration&rdquo; of these craft. As far as I am aware, this is the first time in legislation that the registration of pleasure craft has been provided for. Perhaps this is not the case. I know it could be done earlier. Can the Minister of State indicate how it might work? There are many reasons this seems to be the case.</P>
      <P>It is very difficult to recognise an individual boat. It reminds me of a racehorse or a Friesian cow, where farmers must draw them and keep their colours and markings to recognise them. Irish pleasure boats, some of which can be quite expensive, are generally not registered. The reason for this is a difficulty with the Department, which is not anyone&rsquo;s fault but is simply the way things are. Currently, getting a pleasure craft registered requires a person to go through 90% of the same procedure as if one were getting the <i>Queen Mary</i> registered. This is not an exaggeration and one must go through all the same steps. I have informed the Minister of State previously that we should have a simple method whereby someone can register a boat very much like one <Col N="138"/>would register a car. In the UK, there are two kinds of registration, one for small boats and the other is like Lloyds list.</P>
      <P>This issue will be important in the future. At some stage the Minister of State will regulate that a boat must pass a safety test, a sort of NCT for boats, to ensure it is a safe craft. There must be some element of registration involved and the Minister will never require people to go through the current process. We need an easier process to do it as it is currently very hard to prove. The Revenue Commissioners perform a test and check people who buy boats because they believe a lot of hot money has gone into boats. I have a boat which I can assure the Minister of State was not bought with hot money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a lovely boat. I have been on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>However, as it was bought abroad and imported, it would be hard to show the exact steps that one went through to buy it, if I had to prove where it came from. One can state where one paid for it and where one put the money. However, boats should be registered. There should be an Irish registration and more importantly, the Irish registration should be part of a European registration.</P>
      <P>I have been on boats on the inland and coastal waters of different European countries and there is no consistency. Different rules and regulations exist and in most places one could almost make up papers. Waterways Ireland will find this to be very interesting and entertaining but the only registration document which I possess for my boat is a Shannon licence for being on the waterways of Ireland. Consequently, I have a piece of paper with a number on it from Waterways Ireland, as should all boats on the Shannon.</P>
      <P>At one stage, I took my boat abroad and that was the piece of paper I showed, as it was the only piece of paper that I could find. People were happy enough with it. It was in English and as people did not know what it contained, the number was taken and written down.</P>
      <P>There is also a hull number on the boat which Lloyds have stamped on every hull that is made. Certain registrations are already happening. Most well-made boats have a hull number which is approved by Lloyds. The phrase used is &ldquo;made under Lloyds&rdquo;. Consequently, a number is already available which can be followed through in some cases.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s Department should create an easy method to register a boat in the same way as a car, whereby one takes the engine number, the hull number, where it came from, where it was made and the year, registers the number and puts it on the side. All boats in Holland, France and Germany be they for inland waterways or the sea, have registration numbers, no matter how small they are. This is something that we should also do.</P><Col N="139"/>
      <P>The lack of a number also facilitates crime. In recent times, in a number of locations along the Shannon and at sea, boats have been stolen. It is very difficult to trace a boat that does not have a number on it. The Minister and I were both raised in fishing towns and every fishing boat has had a number on it for as long as I can remember. It is very strange that pleasure craft in Ireland do not have numbers. We need a measure for pleasure craft. I apologise for belabouring the issue but it is important in terms of safety, taxation, imports and exports and the regulation of the industry to know how boats are bought and sold, where they are placed, who owns them, where they are and where they have travelled.</P>
      <P>Section 18 also contains the idea of regulating for master&rsquo;s or owner&rsquo;s certificates of boats. The House must forgive my use of sexist terminology; we must find a new term as, unfortunately, that is still the term used. Most people now pursue courses or obtain certificates through sailing clubs or groups. It is time for somebody to put it all together. One of Senator O&rsquo;Rourke&rsquo;s neighbours in Hodson Bay gives training in the use of boats. It is not difficult to demand that people who are going to own a boat undergo training at some stage to show they are fit to do so. I would like the Minister of State to address the issues of the registration of pleasure craft and the regulation of the certificate of competency given to the owners of boats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the point raised by Senator O&rsquo;Toole regarding the registration of boats. It appears to make considerable sense in the context of the new structure of regulation around matters such as safety brought forward by this Bill. It is probably necessary to have some totally transparent way of distinguishing one boat from another, particularly with regard to the gathering of evidence because there are many serious offences arising out of that contained in the Bill. The proposal made by Senator O&rsquo;Toole is very valid and useful and I would ask the Minister to consider it on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The aim of the small vessel register, which will be known as the SVR, is to provide, as has been suggested by the Senator, a simpler form of registration. The registration of small vessels should then be almost commensurate with small boats and should not be similar in any way to the registration of any fishing vessel. The only vessels currently registered are fishing vessels. Under a new scheme approved last year for potting vessels &mdash; many of the smaller vessels that, for the most part, are potting only for lobster and other forms of shellfish &mdash; we are currently registering those vessels. Possibly 800 registration numbers are being offered to the owners of potting vessels, which were registered in the past but had no official recognition. Until these vessels are registered, we will not be able to fund them in any way so that they can <Col N="140"/>pursue their activities regarding potting for shellfish. The registration of potting vessels is a mammoth task.</P>
      <P>The safety regulations include measures regarding life jackets for smaller boats; the EPERB, with which every boat must be fitted; compulsory training courses in the use of EPERBs, which are provided by BIM or the private sector, and all the other items required on board boats. At one stage, I thought the use of a second boat behind the first boat to tow all the equipment would be necessary but, by and large, this equipment can be stored on one boat. This equipment can be expensive but one cannot compromise on safety. BIM will provide 40% of the funding for this equipment. Surveyors must certify that they are happy, which can be also be expensive but is grant aided.</P>
      <P>There are many benefits to be derived from the small vessels register. A public consultation process, which took place in 2004, involved all stakeholders. We will take many of their views and the views expressed in this House into consideration. The small vessels register will form part of an overhaul of the registration process by the relevant directorate within the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. Initially, the register will be introduced on a voluntary basis. I am anxious to ensure this scheme is put on a statutory basis, which may require secondary legislation. The maritime safety directorate of the Department is currently evaluating comments received during the consultation process and I will feed the views expressed in this House into this process. It is not as simple as going out and putting a number on every boat but an identification system is needed. For most boats, it is a matter for their owners to decide what name they want for the boat, but this does not constitute registration. I assure the House that the Government is moving on the issue of registration, an area which has been neglected in the past. Potting vessels from 0 to 6 m are being registered. There are different categories of potting vessels: 6 to 9 m, 9 to 12 m and 12 to 15 m. We are dealing with all of that and hopefully, this will be another item on my agenda.</P>
      <P>Regarding a matter raised earlier on today, Waterways Ireland, one of the six North-South Implementation Bodies established under the British-Irish Agreement of 1999, now has direct responsibility for the management, maintenance and development of navigable waters. When the Bill was initiated in June 2004, we could not cover these waterways because we had not reached agreement between the agreed structures in the North and South. As a result of the work of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, we have reached agreement leading to the amendment to incorporate harbour authorities and Waterways Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very pleased with the Minister of State&rsquo;s remarks. I completely support the amendment, which is very positive and necessary. <Col N="141"/>I compliment the Minister of State and his officials on bringing it forward.</P>
      <P>I wish to clarify a few matters. The small vessel register is a necessary measure. I have changed the name of every boat I have bought even though it is considered to be bad luck in the parts of the world in which the Minister of State and I were born. Boats cannot be traced because of this. There are many boats named <i>Lady Ann</i>, <i>Mary Ann</i> or <i>Ann</i>, as Ann is the most common name for a boat. There must be several thousand of them in Ireland.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I agree this should be introduced on a voluntary basis. It is a good way of beginning and discovering where difficulties lie. A responsible boat owner will go out of his or her way to register because people who have an interest in boating and waterways will wish to do so. I have no difficulty with this.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s comments on secondary legislation worry me. He should give himself power now by introducing a Schedule to the Bill to allow him to establish a system for small vessel registration by ministerial order rather than any other requirement. I was under the impression the Minister of State could do this under the legislation and I see his official nodding. This is the way it should be so the Minister of State can now examine what comes before him.</P>
      <P>It is this simple. In terms of registration, every boat has an engine of some description. There is a number on every inboard engine, which can be used to register the vessel in the same way as a car. There will also be a hull number on the majority of boats. These are two ideas that can be followed through on to make the original identification. Whether people change the name afterwards is irrelevant, as the number sticks with the boat.</P>
      <P>Waterways Ireland has made a significant improvement. It has removed all the &ldquo;harbour horrors&rdquo; on the inland waterways, as Senator O&rsquo;Rourke and others may have seen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>People may have left their boats to rot for months on end without paying a fee and Waterways Ireland has certainly dealt with this problem.</P>
      <P>There is a need for the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department to take an interest in the issue of accessibility to marinas, both inland and on the coast. His own county is poorly served with marinas and I support people who wish to change this. There is a plan to build one there or close to Sligo. I am unsure as to which county it will be in. There is also a proposal to build one in the Erris area.</P>
      <P>Places where people can pull in must be developed as there is a shortage of such places on the River Shannon. I spoke earlier on the need for urgent infrastructural projects but the difficulty in having environmentally friendly marinas built and provided along the Shannon is worry<Col N="142"/>ing. I have examined some of the proposals that were ruled out of order and would think myself to be as environmentally friendly, conscious and supportive as anyone.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s Department should get involved in supporting responsible people who are trying to provide a good service by supplying proper environmentally-friendly marinas along the Shannon in particular. It is one of the most beautiful waterways in Europe and can stand up to comparison with any of them. I have been on the waterways of France and elsewhere. They are beautiful but it is difficult to beat those of the Shannon-Erne for its combination of beauty and size. Irish people will never appreciate them in this way. Waterways Ireland is making a showpiece of this facility.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State, as I know I have gone off point in my comments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a different query to which I need the answer because I will be meeting the people involved over the coming days. There was a difficulty on the inner waterways of Lough Ree, a scenic and beautiful lake that is used by many people. One enters from a little cut from the main body of the lough and onto the inner waterways, which is where the jet skis were causing problems.</P>
      <P>I understood the North-South status of Waterways Ireland from our debate in June 2004. The county manager of the local authority meets with Oireachtas Members on a regular basis. At a recent meeting, the programme manager with responsibility for this area stated the authority cannot enforce fines on people causing an environmental nuisance because it does not have the power. Has this issue been settled? All I want is a straight answer as I have not received one.</P>
      <P>I am interested in Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s comments on the registration of small craft and whatever. The inner waterways of Lough Ree did not fall under the same umbrella of other inland waterways for some reason, as mentioned by Minister of State, Deputy John Browne, in 2004. Who has the authority to impose fines and what are the fines? If this Bill becomes an Act, will someone be given the necessary powers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has now explained her first question on why Waterways Ireland did not have power but does now, which I have answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State answered it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a different question. I will obtain the information on the area the Senator referred to as a matter of urgency. If it falls within the responsibility of Waterways Ireland, that body must pursue these issues. If the responsibility is not that of Waterways Ireland, it is that of the functional local authority.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="143"/>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;make the necessary by-laws. Fortunately, the Members of this House have been helpful in ensuring the matter was returned. I hope it will not be long before we move on. We must ensure this Bill is passed before the summer with the co-operation of all parties in the other House because if we are to be responsible&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Has it been before the other House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>It was initiated in this House. I will pursue this issue. It is dealt with by the authority of a functional area and Senator O&rsquo;Meara moved a motion to insist they introduce by-laws but we will leave this to the discretion of the local authorities. It may be unnecessary for some local authorities to introduce by-laws, as some will have no responsibilities in this field.</P>
      <P>I will take this opportunity to remind all water users that they have a responsibility. We can introduce as much legislation as we wish but we cannot have an authorised officer at every nook and cranny, whether it is Waterways Ireland, our lakes or offshore. These people should be more responsible.</P>
      <P>I favour the establishment of a necklace of marinas around our coast. Senator O&rsquo;Toole is right and has touched on proposed developments, such as Rosses Point and Roundstone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>Decisions were taken a number of years ago that I wish to assist but I am caught in so far as suggestions of State aid could create difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>It is infrastructural.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The establishment of marinas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The semi-private sector is carrying this out. It would be fine if the State were providing the marinas but they depend on available funding and the priority issues we must take into consideration. I favour our supporting the private sector in establishing marinas around our coasts. There are various issues because it is not just a question of commencing the establishment of marinas but also of a foreshore lease. In <Col N="144"/>instances where this permission is required there is a statutory process that one must pursue. When an application for a foreshore lease or something else is received by the Department our officials try to deal with it as quickly as possible if it is valid. There are criticisms that applications take a long time, which is true if an application is invalid, but it is the same as a request for planning permission, which cannot be dealt with if it is invalid.</P>
      <P>The legislation will be available to me to establish the small vessel register. There may be some commencement dates, etc., but it will be available to me. I do not wish to give the impression we have such a surplus of people in the relevant directorate and in the marine surveyors office that this can be done immediately. We have a plan and we are working on evaluating the comments received as well as those from this House. It will not just be a matter of registering a vessel. It will be a question of looking at all the safety factors to ensure each vessel complies with any safety measures we introduce. We can have all the safety measures and legislation in the world but anyone going to sea without a life jacket or any vessel going out to sea without the basic equipment required is being totally irresponsible.</P>
      <P>I am sure we can all think of instances where people have not only put their own lives in danger, which is in their own hands, but have put the lives of the coast guard and those in the other voluntary bodies, of which there are so many around the country, at risk. Today provides me with an opportunity to pay tribute to all those who give their time, including those in the coast and cliff rescue service, on a voluntary basis. Their lives are put in danger and I hope that is something about which individuals going out to sea without the necessary safety equipment will think. Some 90% of people act responsibly.</P>
      <P>As regards environmental issues in marinas, on the Shannon and elsewhere, perhaps the local authorities or Waterways Ireland could consider basic recycling facilities rather than have people dump everything overboard, which was the practice in the past. People have become much more responsible and I hope our calls do not fall on deaf ears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted the Minister mentioned the coast guard. The Department could be a little more supportive of members of the coast guard on whom our lives very often depend, which the Minister of State quite rightly said, and to whom we owe a great debt of gratitude. These people should get some type of call-out fee, some element of support or some financial help. They put their lives at risk, particularly the coast guard which is not part of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. They are very much dependent on the Department. I know this area is being restructured, which is important. Will the Minister of State ensure the types of supports and structures in place for them are adequate?</P><Col N="145"/>
      <P>It is not necessary for surveys to be carried out by personnel from the Department. If I buy a boat and get it insured, it is my responsibility to get a marine surveyor to survey the boat. There are a couple of marine surveyors in Senator O&rsquo;Rourke&rsquo;s and Senator O&rsquo;Meara&rsquo;s constituencies and a number elsewhere in the country. Most boats which have been bought have been surveyed along the way. It should be enough for the Department to recognise the person carrying out the survey. One of the major problems has been having to depend unfairly on the Department to get surveys done. That pressure should not be on the Department and people should use qualified surveyors. There are a number of recognised qualifications for marine surveyors who are very diligent about their work because their reputations depend on it. They will not state a boat is safe if it is not because it will come back to haunt them.</P>
      <P>My father used to say legislation which cannot be enforced should not be passed. I am probably turning my back on that good advice. However, legislation should be passed to provide that people on boats should use only eco-friendly detergents. It is a small thing as they are not much more expensive. Most supermarkets along the Shannon and other waterways sell such products, particularly along the inland waterways. Sink waste is more damaging to the environment than sewage and biological detergents cause more damage than anything else. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government should introduce legislation, a directive or a ministerial order stating that only eco-friendly detergents should be used on boats.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for tabling this important amendment. He has reassured us on a number of issues, including that of marinas. The European Union is completely wrong about marinas. A marina cannot be moved. It is not a tradeable commodity between the west of Ireland and the west of France. It is only for the use of people who visit it. People will not travel from the west of France to the west of Ireland simply because there is a marina there which is being supported by the State. A marina is like a road; it is an infrastructure for boats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State and his officials for the work done on this Bill since we last met. I regret that it looks as if it will not get through the other House before the summer recess when the type of issues about which I spoke are most prevalent. Be that as it may, legislation must run its course. We have been waiting for this legislation and we are glad to deal with it properly and as expeditiously as possible.</P>
      <P>I fully agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole in regard to detergents. Biological detergents create much foam and are far more dangerous than sewage. One will find great big packages of eco-friendly detergents lined up in the smallest supermarket in Rooskey, which is only a small village. It would <Col N="146"/>be very useful if use of such products were mandatory for boat owners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator O&rsquo;Toole for his kind comments on the coast guard. He reflected the views of the majority. If the voluntary contribution of the coast guard was converted into monetary terms, it would be quite sizable so this type of contribution could not be bought. From time to time we take the opportunity to recognise the commitment. Recognition may not mean much in voluntary terms but I know those who receive recognition for their endeavours greatly appreciate it and I made presentations in this area last year. However, I take on board what the Senator said and will ask officials to consider it.</P>
      <P>On the marine survey, Senator O&rsquo;Toole will be glad to know that with the introduction of the new potting licences, which has added greatly to the necessity for surveys of small boats, we established a panel of qualified surveyors. That panel is in place and it is busily surveying these boats around the coast. I hope that panel will remain <i>in situ </i>so that when the small vessels register is introduced, it will be available.</P>
      <P>On the issue of eco-friendly detergents mentioned by Senators O&rsquo;Toole and O&rsquo;Rourke, we can specify good practice in regard to use of detergents in the code of practice in section 27 which is being inserted in the Bill by amendment No. 46. I will consider this issue between now and Report Stage and I will speak to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to see if he could introduce a ministerial order or otherwise. As I said earlier, orders and legislation can be difficult. I will take every opportunity as Minister of State with responsibility for the marine to prevail on all water users to desist from using detergents other than eco-friendly ones. If this needs to be done on a statutory basis, I will establish whether it can be done. I will certainly include it in the code of practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join my colleagues in calling for the use of eco-friendly detergents on boats. Perhaps now is the time to acknowledge we have come a long way as 20 years ago, it was accepted that most rubbish was thrown overboard. The introduction of the plastic bag levy has helped to reduce much of the rubbish along the canals and waterways. Perhaps the Department could liaise with the various county councils. While it would be desirable to have bring centres or bins at harbours where boats go out&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>They are usually provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>The policy of many of the councils is not to provide bins at scenic areas because they have found they create more rubbish. At most scenic areas in County Roscommon the county council is not providing bins because the people fill them with their own rubbish. They were regarded as a green light for rubbish. Perhaps the Minister&rsquo;s Department would liaise with <Col N="147"/>the county councils in regard to the Shannon and other rivers. If no bins are provided, unfortunately those who have no regard for the environment will throw away rubbish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>It is dangerous to talk about zero tolerance but perhaps it could be minimised to reasonable levels. When I speak with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government about eco-friendly detergents I will discuss with him the possibility of speaking with the relevant local authorities to ensure recycling facilities are made available. This does not just happen at harbours. At any recycling facility in any town one will find refuse that should not go into it. It comes down to the moral obligation and the responsible attitude of people.</P>
      <P>I will pursue this matter. We have come a long way and people have become more responsible. This applies not only to boat users but to everyone. The use of detergents in the home should also be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Government amendment No. 53:</P>
    <P LI="1" el="5">In page 16, before section 18, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P LI="1" el="5">&ldquo;34.&mdash;The Act of 1992 is amended&mdash;</P>
    <P LI="2" el="5">(<i>a</i>) in section 35(2) (which relates to careless operation of vessels) (inserted by section 44(11) of the Act of 2000) by substituting &lsquo;&euro;3,000&rsquo; for &lsquo;&euro;500&rsquo;, and &lsquo;one month&rsquo; for &lsquo;3 months&rsquo;, respectively, and</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The new section 34 updates penalties in the 1992 Act which was amended by the 2000 Act for careless and dangerous operation of vessels. We are restating an updated format in lines 29 to 38 of the original section 19 on page 17 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there a bigger fine?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>We dealt with that earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>I am curious to know why in a number of sections the Minister has increased the fines from &euro;3,000 to &euro;5,000. This is the first place where we are introducing the concept of a &euro;3,000 fine in the Bill. For the sake of consistency perhaps they should all be maintained at &euro;5,000.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="148"/>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The advice of the Attorney General was that the fines should be increased from the original &euro;3,000 to &euro;5,000 in this case, and from &euro;500 to &euro;3,000 and from &euro;10,000 to &euro;25,000. The purpose of the increased fine in this instance is to deter people from acting in a careless and dangerous manner while operating vessels. It is the maximum fine. It will be a matter for the courts and the judge of the relevant court to decide the fine that should be imposed. It is largely a deterrent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>On the question of safety I support this section. As far as I can recall, the section deals with those who steer, drive, manoeuvre or pilot their boats. A significant number of the call-outs are by those who have been careless in their planning and have taken no notice of the weather. They think that because they have a new boat with a big engine they do not have to worry about anything. Suddenly they find that at a headland they are not ready for the force 7, 8 or 9 winds on the other side. There should be a requirement in passage planning for any distance that people check on the weather.</P>
      <P>Met &Eacute;ireann is helpful and good at what it does but in terms of improving safety at sea it requires significantly greater resources. For most of the coastland of the UK and even of Northern Ireland, it is possible to get a localised sea area forecast. For example, one can get a full forecast for the day from, say, Lizard to Land&rsquo;s End, a basic 30 miles. In Ireland the sea area forecast, which is on the radio three or four times a day, covers Slyne Head to Malin Head, and down the whole Irish Sea including Roches Point. The difficulty is that it can never be completely correct, particularly for small boats.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State knows as well as I do that the weather in Dingle Bay might be quite placid but around Blasket Sound to the north side of the peninsula it could be roaring a force 6, 7 or 8 and could be a yachtsman&rsquo;s storm. If more resources were provided to Met &Eacute;ireann it could, in addition to the national forecast provided to RTE radio, provide a more detailed sea area forecast to the local radio stations, such as Hyland Radio, North West Radio and Radio Kerry. For example, Radio Kerry could give the forecast from Mizen Head to Valentia, Valentia to the Blaskets, the Blaskets to Kerry Head, Loop Head or wherever. In this way one would get a much more detailed forecast. That should be done. Met &Eacute;ireann has the ability to do this but it does not have the resources to make it available.</P>
      <P>Met &Eacute;ireann also provides personalised weather forecasts. This morning I asked it for the detailed four day forecast over the next three or four days for the Fastnet and Plymouth areas which it would e-mail to me. It will provide that kind of forecast very effectively but many do not know it is available. Such a service should be more freely available. Met &Eacute;ireann is required to pay for it and is entitled to charge for it. I make no complaint about that. It does its work well and <Col N="149"/>is efficient. However, in terms of safety the State should be prepared to pay for that type of forecast. More money should be put into Met &Eacute;ireann.</P>
      <P>Apart from the creation of Waterways Ireland following the Good Friday Agreement, Irish Lights and Trinity House in the UK merged into one. Nobody noticed, there were no arguments and the new arrangement is working well. At the time I was concerned that the same arrangement were not made with the weather service. Had it been done it would enable people on both islands to get the kind of weather forecasting the boating fraternity can get in the UK, where a narrow sea area forecast along the coast is provided. We need a similarly detailed forecast in Ireland for greater safety, to create greater awareness and to prevent people taking chances when going out on boats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I had responsibility for the Met Service in my previous position as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and I will have a word with the Minister of State, Deputy Bat O&rsquo;Keeffe, to see what can be done. I have visited Met &Eacute;ireann and I am aware it does excellent work and provides a fairly accurate service, as reflected by Senator O&rsquo;Toole. If there is any doubt about the weather, any responsible person going to sea should establish the situation for themselves. That is their personal responsibility.

	<P>It is not a question of there being much additional cost involved. I hope local radio stations will take a greater interest and possibly make a slot available a number of times each year for their own specific areas. There is little point in Radio Kerry giving a forecast for north Donegal, for instance. I will raise this matter with the Minister. I emphasise the importance of the co-operation of seafarers in checking the weather forecast before they set out because it shows a responsible attitude. The meteorological office in Glasnevin provides information by telephone if required. It would be beneficial if the system could be streamlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that gesture by the Minister of State. It is a good idea to suggest that the local radio stations along the coast would give a coastal sea area forecast for the smaller areas such as from Mizen Head to Valentia, Valentia to the Blaskets and the Blaskets to Loop Head with Clare Radio giving the local sea area forecast for the seas around its coast. This would be a significant development which would be welcomed and would add to safety. It could be done at small cost. I appreciate the Minister of State&rsquo;s positive response and look forward to hearing the <Col N="150"/>response of the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, to that request.</P>

	<P>This is a substantive but straightforward amendment. It inserts a new section 39 in the Bill to amend the Shannon Navigation Act 1920.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I support this amendment. However, I ask the Minister of State to consider a final point. The last survey of Lough Ree and Lough Derg in the River Shannon was taken in 1847. I have never seen a survey of Lough Allen. <Col N="156"/>The survey of Lough Ree and Lough Derg was done by the British Admiralty and is surprisingly accurate. However it is no longer useful for modern use. It would be worthwhile for safety reasons if the Department took the opportunity to have a new survey done of the lakes in the Shannon.</P>
      <P>I suggest the department of oceanography in NUI Galway could do the survey. It is not satisfactory to be using charts prepared in 1840. Some of the towns such as Dromineer are not marked and towns and villages on the Shannon are not mentioned as ports in that survey. Two years ago I personally tested some of the depth readings and the charts were surprisingly accurate. The eastern side of Lough Derg, which will be very well known to the Leas-Chathaoirleach, has not been very well surveyed. It contains rocks, shallows and shoals which could be marked on a new chart. I ask the Minister of State to consider a survey of both lakes in order to create a new chart. Some of the oldest sailing clubs in Europe are based on Lough Ree and they have a lot to offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the Senator&rsquo;s comments. I have used Lough Key and the River Shannon system and I am amazed that resources have not been directed into better mapping of the rivers and lakes. Many of the boat hire companies have filled the void to a certain extent but that is not enough. It is unforgivable to see tourist boats caught on rocks because they did not have the proper maps.</P>
      <P>I suggest that part of the fee for registration of boats should include the provision of a map. It should be a legal requirement for all boats to carry maps. I can safely say that 80% of those who sail pleasure craft have no idea where the rocks are. Many of the rocks and shallow areas are not properly signed and the situation has not improved in the past 20 years. Many fishing clubs who are familiar with the river erect makeshift buoys but this is not good enough. The safety of boat users is being compromised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>As I am a layman, I presume this would be a substantial task as the last survey was done in the 1840s. I will discuss the matter with the responsible relevant authorities whether those are one of the agencies or within the Department. The Senator has made an interesting proposal. Many people are navigating our waters by means of markers and buoys. The sonar system is a great advance which can indicate the existence of rocks and dangers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State and his officials for their forbearance during this debate. It was somewhat startling to discover that while the original Bill consisted of 20 pages, the amendments ran to some 27 pages. However, after such a lengthy and comprehensive discussion on Committee Stage, Members will agree we have succeeded in producing legislation that is superior to its original inception.</P>
      <P>We often complain when there is a delay between Second and Committee Stages but the delay in this instance has ensured we have a better Bill. We will accommodate the Minister on Report Stage in this House to ensure the Bill is processed as quickly as possible. Everyone will be anxious to facilitate the enactment of the legislation before the summer, if possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State and his officials for the comprehensive and reassuring explanatory material he has provided on this legislation. It would be a welcome development and would make our job much easier if all legislative matters were explained in such a manner.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael broadly welcomes this Bill. Our approach is to emphasise that safety must be the greatest priority and concern. The best way to achieve this is through strict enforcement of rules and regulations which ensure we do not damage the vibrant marine culture. It is during the summer months that most maritime accidents take place. One concern in this regard is that the timing of the Bill means it will probably not be enacted until after the summer. I accept the numerous amendments have improved the legislation but it should have been signed months ago.</P>
      <P>The provisions regarding the range of fines from &euro;1,000 to &euro;5,000 are welcome. Rules and regulations are all very well but how are we to know they will be enforced? The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Coastguard are hopelessly under-resourced and the Bill will be rendered much less powerful if it is not accompanied by the provision of extra funding. How are the regulations to be communicated to those who might act recklessly in our waters and endanger themselves and others? Will there be an appropriate publicity campaign to ensure everybody is aware of the penalties arising from such behaviour? What type of review of the new regulations will be established to monitor their effectiveness? Such a review should take after a number of years.</P>
      <P>It is desirable that there should be a new explanatory memorandum as this is a much changed Bill to the Bill as initiated. I hope the legislation ensures people can still enjoy themselves in the waters and that lives will be saved.</P>

It is important that we attempt to ensure this legislation is enacted before the summer, if only for the propa<Col N="159"/>ganda value of raising awareness as Senator Feighan observed. This would signify a clear new beginning for the new boating season which starts at this time of year. The Government should be mindful of the importance of this.</P>
      <P>I reiterate the sentiments of my colleagues in thanking the Minister of State and his officials for the work that has been put into this legislation. The officials in particular can take a bow for their achievement. This Bill is an example of the type of legislation which it is better to initiate in this House. That approach allows the issues to be spun out and facilitates a softer and less confrontational debate. This is the manner in which legislation should be put together.</P>
      <P>This is an important Bill and the Minister of State is to be applauded for his role in its development. Incidentally, I look forward to his responses on the issue of local sea-area weather forecasts and the question of registration and new soundings on new lakes. I wish the Bill well on its journey through the other House.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for their support for the amendments which I sponsored. Many of the amendments arose as a consequence of the Second Stage debate which took place last year. That comprehensive debate reflects the importance of the Seanad. I also recognise the amendments submitted by Senators, a number of which I was able to accept. I hope Senators understand and appreciate the rationale I offered in respect of those two or three others I did not accept.</P>
      <P>The Bill, as amended, is a considerable advance on the original in terms of protecting our waters against the improper use of fast-powered craft. In addition, it clearly provides for the promulgation of safety codes by me as Minister of State with responsibility for marine matters to secure the safe and proper operation of vessels generally. I assure Members that water safety will remain a priority on my agenda. I salute the courage and professionalism, as noted by other speakers, of all involved in our marine rescue services, comprising the official and voluntary sector. I trust the Bill will ensure greater safety awareness on the part of all water users and will reduce pressure on the services. If people act more responsibly, not only will they not be putting their own lives <Col N="160"/>at risk; they will also not be putting the lives of those in the rescue services at risk.</P>
      <P>As far as holding a review at a later stage is concerned, let us get the Bill through first, and I will give consideration to the proposal thereafter. The Bill has been substantially changed, so I will publish a new memorandum for the Bill as amended by the Seanad. I thank Senators for their kind words and, I think, for the fact that the Bill has changed substantially. It was important that Senators received briefing material explaining the many amendments that I found it necessary to introduce. I recognise the long hours and days of work that have been put into the Bill by officials in my Department. I thank Senators for also recognising that fact, and I concur with their sentiments.</P>

      <P FLI="0" el="3">
        <?oasys _cl11.5-?>I welcome the Minister of Transport to the House for this important motion. Anyone who saw the scenes of utter chaos at Dublin Airport on our television screens in recent days can be in no doubt that our national airport is in an utter mess. These problems of long delays to clear security and chronic overcrowding are not new.</P>
      <P>During peak periods in the summer and on bank holiday weekends, such overcrowding has become normal at Dublin Airport. The uncovering of serious security breaches last week put the problems at the airport back in the public&rsquo;s mind and under the scrutiny of the <Col N="161"/>national media. There is no doubt that Dublin Airport is struggling to cope. The time has long passed when it could function as a normal, efficient, effective working modern airport.</P>
      <P>The airport&rsquo;s most basic problem is chronic overcrowding. Not only does this cause major inconvenience for the travelling public and airport staff, it also conveys an extremely negative image of Ireland to tourists and overseas business travellers alike. Most fundamentally of all, it is a dangerous security hazard. While there was quite justified concern at the security breaches that occurred at the airport last week, the most obvious threat, particularly when one viewed the situation developing over the weekend, was the question of public safety within the terminal building itself, regardless of what persons might be trying to smuggle on to an aeroplane. If an emergency situation such as a bomb scare or a fire were to develop inside the terminal building, there could be numerous fatalities and injuries in the stampede which would undoubtedly transpire.</P>
      <P>The finger of blame for the dangerous and unacceptable situation at the airport must be pointed at the Government, which has sat idly by and allowed it to develop. We have a Government willing to allow a First World country such as Ireland have a Third World airport. One member of the public recently referred to the airport as being akin to Lagos airport, which has been rated as one of the worst airports in the world. That is quite an accolade.</P>
      <P>For many years the Government has been aware of the extent of the problem facing Dublin Airport. We have witnessed various Ministers for Transport come and go but nothing has happened. We have been constantly promised an imminent decision on the need to develop a second terminal at the airport but the public has received nothing. The Government continues to dither over the issue of developing a new terminal and all the while Dublin Airport grinds to a halt.</P>
      <P>The aviation sector is rapidly expanding throughout the world and Ireland is no exception. Over the past 20 years the number of people travelling has grown enormously, greatly helped by the advent of the low-cost carrier model best exemplified by the Ryanair business philosophy. A weekend away to a European city is no longer viewed as an exotic luxury by many. For those who have invested in property overseas in particular, it is a regular occurrence.</P>
      <P>Dublin Airport has benefited hugely from this growth in the aviation sector. Last year alone, 17 million passengers passed through Dublin Airport. That figure is expected to rise year on year, with projected growth to 30 million passengers within a ten year period. However, this rapid growth is becoming the undoing of the airport&rsquo;s success, not least because the Government has stalled and appears to be unwilling to act to <Col N="162"/>alleviate the problems arising there. Critically, this inaction is also preventing the airport from tapping into the great potential presented by passenger growth.</P>
      <P>The bottleneck preventing the expansion of Dublin Airport, and the potential this represents in terms of job creation and increases in tourism revenue, is the Government. It is unacceptable that it has stalled and dithered on this critical issue. It has been shaky on the issue since it first took office and in its 2002 programme for Government it could not even give a commitment to develop a second terminal for the airport, even though it was clear a new terminal was needed.</P>
      <P>Instead, the Government gave a commitment merely to examine the possibility of an independent terminal at the airport and, despite glaringly obvious evidence to the contrary, remained unsure as to the feasibility of a second terminal. Three years on it would appear it is still being examined. One can only conclude the Government has its head in the clouds or perhaps the years of being ushered through Dublin Airport without having to endure the endless queues faced by the public has made it blind to the chronic overcrowding.</P>
      <P>Why does it take the Government so long to act? It is little wonder this Government, too long in office and utterly paralysed, failed to spend its full capital allocation in 2004. A long list of reports has been received and read by the Government on the need for a second terminal &mdash; the Doogan report in 2002; the Aer Rianta master plan; the Mullarkey report; and the Skidmore, Owings and Merrill report &mdash; yet it has continued to dither.</P>
      <P>It defies logic that the Government is willing to sit back and allow utter chaos to develop at our airport. No one has been called to account for these delays, much less asked to explain why making a decision on a much needed second terminal is taking so long. It seems that the same old mantra is now being repeated by the current Minister for Transport. His predecessor, Deputy Brennan, constantly told us that a decision was imminent. Despite having received 13 expressions of interest in building a second terminal he was not able to take that decision before the Fianna F&aacute;il axe ended his opportunity to deliver.</P>
      <P>A decision is also imminent from the current Minister but we have seen nothing. In the absence of the full details one must rely on media speculation, which indicates that the Government&rsquo;s preferred option is that the Dublin Airport Authority build and operate a second terminal on airport land. It would appear that the Progressive Democrats commitment to a privately owned and independently operated terminal has been pushed to one side.</P>
      <P>The Government&rsquo;s apparent support for the Dublin Airport Authority&rsquo;s plan has more worrying consequences than whether the terminal is <Col N="163"/>State or privately owned. The greater worry lies in the fact that the Dublin Airport Authority&rsquo;s site may not be the best site for the development of a second terminal.</P>
      <P>This site, which lies to the north of the existing terminal, has several characteristics that make it inadequate and less than ideal. The capacity of a second terminal is critical, not least in dealing with the predicted growth in passenger numbers at Dublin Airport. As I understand it, the Dublin Airport Authority site at Dublin Airport is limited in size and could not be expanded in the future. If we accept the plan of the authority, we could be left with a less than optimal site that will reach full capacity quickly. This may leave us in the position in ten years of having to consider building a third terminal to cope with demand.</P>
      <P>Vision is required from the Minister for Transport. A site must be selected that will allow a terminal to be developed that has growth potential into the future. Short-term measures are not enough. The consequences of user growth being underestimated can be disastrous, as evidenced by the M50 motorway and more recently, by the waste water treatment plant in Dublin, which is insufficient. There was no foresight used in the latter development, even though the Minister stated this was the way forward and the plant was exactly what Dublin required. Now we find the plant is inadequate.</P>
      <P>The only way to overcome the problems at Dublin Airport is to develop a new terminal on a greenfield site. A site to the west of the existing terminal, sandwiched between the existing runway and the proposed new runway is the best location. Greenfield sites, largely chosen for their future development potential, are now the norm internationally. It would be a retrograde step for the Government to opt for a design concept, favoured by the Dublin Airport Authority, which is falling out of favour internationally. However, the Government is taking a short-term view and has not considered anything other than the plan put to it by the authority. Fine Gael is not convinced this is the best option for the airport.</P>
      <P>I urge the Government to act immediately on the second terminal. Its failure to act to date is impacting negatively on the business and tourism sectors. It is tarnishing Ireland&rsquo;s image abroad and endangering the safety and security of the travelling public.</P>
      <P>A decision on a second terminal cannot be delayed any longer. Action is needed now. The location and future capacity of a second terminal are critical issues and if they are not dealt with properly, we face the prospect of returning to this issue shortly and passengers face the prospect of more overcrowding at the airport.</P>
      <P>The examples of security breaches highlighted last week are further evidence of the deterioration in conditions at Dublin Airport. The level <Col N="164"/>of security breaches detected, including the smuggling of knives, firearms and bomb-making equipment, is very frightening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>It is dreadful to think of a situation, which could so easily develop, either at Dublin Airport or on a flight out of Dublin Airport &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should not talk rubbish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not know what the situation is regarding other airports or the ports. The media should be commended for highlighting what happened at Dublin Airport and I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s explanations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the motion and welcome the opportunity to discuss not just the immediate issue of security, but the ongoing problem of the failure of the Government to act since its commitment in 2002 to build a second terminal.</P>
      <P>I am astonished at the brass neck of the Government, with no intervention on the part of the Minister for Transport, I hope, in tabling the amendment before us. The amendment deletes the Opposition motion and goes on to state that the House &ldquo;welcomes the Government&rsquo;s efforts to ensure the timely provision of additional ter<Col N="165"/>minal capacity at Dublin Airport on an efficient, cost-effective basis&rdquo;. Timely? This has gone on since 2002. The former Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, was &ldquo;days from a decision&rdquo; before he was ousted and sent to the Department of Social and Family Affairs. At least he was prepared to make a decision on this issue. Why has no decision been reached? This has nothing to do with the terminal. This is about the failure of the Government to produce a viable strategy for Aer Lingus. That is the problem.</P>
      <P>There are two separate issues the Government and specifically, the Taoiseach, have intertwined. The Taoiseach is trying to strike a deal with both sets of unions to keep them on side in order to ensure that there are no industrial relations problems in the run-up to the general election. Senator Morrissey is aware of this and has made eloquent statements on the matter outside the House. It is inevitable that Aer Lingus will be part-privatised and there will be a spat over that. The payback for the unions in the Dublin Airport Authority will be to allow the authority to build and run a new terminal. This is where the problem lies and this explains why the Government has not made the decision that was promised in 2001.</P>
      <P>Who suffers as a result of the side deal between the unions and the Taoiseach? I suspect the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, has no say in the matter and is looking on from the side lines in frustration, chipping in as he goes along. The Minister has no real say on this because it will be decided in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office. The people who are losing out because of the inertia of the Government are consumers. The fact that we do not have a second terminal up and running, leaving aside the daily mess that is Dublin Airport, is dreadful. An operational terminal could entice more operators into the market, achieve lower prices for consumers and attract more tourists into the country to spend money. Consumers are losing out as a result of the failure of the Government to act.</P>
      <P>Dublin Airport is reeling, as everyone knows. It is a mess. That is clear to anyone who goes through the airport, whether on a weekly or monthly basis. It is a catastrophe waiting to happen. The lack of space for the travelling public is appalling, with 17 million people using the airport annually. There is a complete failure to deliver quality customer services. Until recently, one had to pay for a trolley. Imagine passengers from Manchester or London arriving in Dublin Airport with sterling in their pockets and being told that they need a euro coin to obtain a trolley. Thankfully, that has changed recently. The way in which people are fleeced for a cup of tea, coffee or a sandwich in the airport &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is true of every airport.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="166"/>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is becoming agitated, I must be hitting some buttons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>No, the Senator is just talking off the top of his head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the failure &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator must have read all of the tabloid newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the result of the failure of the Minister for Transport to take a decision on the issue and to deliver a service for people in the airport, a service that is focused on the customer rather than one that is driven by union politics. There is an obvious disagreement between two unions at the airport, with one union supporting one terminal option and the other supporting an alternative option. However, the big losers in all of this are the consumers.</P>
      <P>The Minister must deal with a number of issues concerning the Dublin Airport Authority. We have had the Mullarkey report, which was an assessment of the 13 bids received by the Government when the project was put out to tender in 2002. We have had the Fingal report, from the elected members of Fingal County Council. That report states that the site favoured by the Dublin Airport Authority just north of the existing terminal is not the best option because of lack of capacity. When Dublin Airport Authority was considering what was best for the airport, did it consider all of the options or only those in which it had a controlling interest, namely, lands that it owned? In determining what was best for Dublin Airport the authority only looked at land within its control. The Minister can confirm or deny this. He should comment on this crucial issue in the course of his reply.</P>
      <P>Dublin Airport Authority commissioned a report on its own site which has never been published. Will the Minister publish it? He appoints the authority and in effect takes quasi-control and responsibility for the authority through both Houses of the Oireachtas. Will he publish the authority&rsquo;s report on its own site? All of the flaws, to which my colleague Senator Paddy Burke referred, in terms of lack of capacity, failure to plan for the future and the disruption it would cause the current site could be highlighted if we could see the report.</P>
      <P>This is an important issue, not only for consumers and investment in the city and throughout the country but also for safety, as rightly stated by Senator Burke. The Minister must answer significant questions. His failure to make a decision on the matter suggests it is being made at a higher level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P><Col N="167"/>
      <P LI="1">To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P FLI="0" el="5">
        <?oasys _is1p8-?>&ldquo;&mdash;<?oasys _is0p2-?><?oasys _ix?>welcomes the Government&rsquo;s efforts to ensure the timely provision of additional terminal capacity at Dublin Airport on an efficient, cost-effective basis;</P>

        <?oasys _is1p8-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p2-?><?oasys _ix?>notes the future arrangements for the provision of such capacity will be designed to ensure that both the location and operation of such terminal capacity are in keeping with the optimum development of an efficient Dublin Airport;</P>
      <P FLI="0" el="5">
        <?oasys _is1p8-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p2-?><?oasys _ix?>notes the Government commitment to ensuring the highest standards of aviation security at Irish airports;</P>
      <P FLI="0" el="5">
        <?oasys _is1p8-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p2-?><?oasys _ix?>notes that the key issues raised by the EU security inspection at Dublin Airport were addressed with immediate effect; and</P>
      <P FLI="0" el="5">
        <?oasys _is1p8-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p2-?><?oasys _ix?>notes that the Minister for Transport and his Department will engage with the airports and airlines with a view to ensuring that all improvements in security arising from the findings of the EU inspection are implemented.&rdquo;</P>
      <P FLI="0" el="5">I welcome the efforts of the Government, the Minister and the previous Minister in dealing with the changing nature of the aviation sector. Those of us who understand what is happening within the sector are clearly aware of the dramatic changes which have taken place in the past number of years and the associated pressures. A tremendous amount of work has been done by the current Government in dealing with this changing environment. It requires ongoing effort and the Minister is committed to that. He has taken up his brief in a very efficient manner and is dealing with it in a most expeditious way.</P>
      <P>The passage of the State Airports Bill last year was something the Opposition called for over a considerable length of time. The amount of work and consultation which went into that process cannot be undermined. The Opposition seems to think there is a quick-fix solution based on knee-jerk reactions that can be overlaid across the aviation sector in Ireland and that the problem can be solved overnight. I am delighted with the approach the Government is taking. It is consultative, involves all stakeholders and clearly recognises the changing nature of the environment within which it is set. Company law issues were identified in the State Airports Bill as were issues regarding financing, future funding and developments at the airports. These must all be taken into consideration and cannot be whitewashed in a knee-jerk reaction as expected by the Opposition.</P><Col N="168"/>
      <P>This is happening against a backdrop of great change in the sector and in the economy. Senator Paddy Burke likened Dublin Airport to the airport in Lagos. I have not been there, but I was recently in an airport in Ghana which would also be referred to as a Third World airport. Facilities were not great but very few people were passing through the airport because of the state of the economy. Major problems associated with the growth in the economy have put great pressure and strains on Dublin Airport&rsquo;s infrastructure. The economy is thriving as a result of decisions taken by the Government to ensure the Celtic tiger continues to thrive. Issues relating to a thriving First World economy, not Third World facilities, have brought about some of the pressures and strains at Dublin Airport.</P>
      <P>The decisions require widespread planning, careful consideration of all issues and a needs assessment of the airlines. It is critical that decisions are made in consultation with the airlines and stakeholders. We need to make the right decisions and the airlines are critical stakeholders. Senator Brian Hayes spoke about customers, but the airport&rsquo;s customers are actually the airlines. They dictate whether they will do business with the airports. Their needs must be assessed and catered for to ensure the growth in numbers travelling through and in the tourism sector. We cannot lose sight of that.</P>
      <P>We must also consult with the workers because they have brought us to where we are now. They had a huge input during very difficult times in the economy and forgave and forwent all manners of conditions and pay increments to which they were entitled. They ensured the success of the airport and aviation sector. Their considerable contribution must be recognised in any changes.</P>
      <P>Other people must also be taken into account, such as those who live in the region of the airport. The Opposition talks about expanding growth and installing new terminals and runways immediately. There are people in the greater Fingal area who believe there should be a cap on the number of passengers travelling through Dublin Airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should read the development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I know the development plan, but other considerations must be taken into account. We must not steamroll or bully anybody. Perhaps that will be the Opposition&rsquo;s approach should it come to power. Perhaps it will build terminals on the back of certain proposals from private developers. However, one must do so in a consultative format which involves due partnership and planning from all concerned.</P>
      <P>There has been much talk about an optimum solution for a second terminal. However, the issues are extremely complex. There must be <Col N="169"/>careful consideration of all issues, some of which I have alluded to. There are issues in terms of whether it is private, public or a PPP and there are different agendas. Senator Paddy Burke seems to be advancing the case as put by the McEvaddy brothers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I never mentioned the McEvaddy brothers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator spoke about the western area of the airport and since they own and control the land there is no doubt that it is a McEvaddy proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Dooley should read the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>Notwithstanding that, there are many other proposals. Many of those in the private sector will have their own agenda which is about profit. I am not sure that it is necessarily about delivery of a service. Private companies are involved in the generation of profit whereas the State can be more focused on the delivery of a service because there is no profit requirement involved in what it does. Of course there is a necessity to provide value for money and facilities and services in line with the need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The situation with regard to Shannon Airport speaks loud and clear in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>We can have a debate about Shannon Airport at another time and I would be happy to advance the case in that regard. The State must have an objective of delivering a facility that will cater for the needs of the travelling public in a manner that continues to encourage growth which is critically important for a vibrant and active tourism sector in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has one minute remaining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>The facility must be delivered in an efficient and reliable manner, one that will encourage the airlines to continue to operate through the airport. It must be cost effective and ensure the low-cost model which now pertains throughout the aviation sector reduces the cost.</P>
      <P>The Mullarkey report has been mentioned in a very selective way during this debate. It refers to an independent and competitive terminal. However, it also states that in the medium term when there is an increase from &euro;17 million to &euro;30 million, there must be an increase in passenger charges in order to sustain the two terminals throughout that period. I am not sure the airlines accept this measure, which is a critical point that is being missed. The airlines are the airport&rsquo;s customers. One could not go to Michael O&rsquo;Leary <Col N="170"/>or the new chief executive of Aer Lingus and suggest an increase in charges at Dublin Airport.</P>
      <P>If charges are not increased a situation will arise with regard to security. One must increase security levels to reduce the level of queuing, but who will pay for it? The traffic passing through must be able to pay for the facilities which is difficult because of the low-cost model. This must be done in a way that does not compromise security. I do not have time to deal with this aspect, but Senator Wilson will do so later.</P>
      <P>The solution is not as simple as that proffered by the Opposition. There are very complex issues with which the Government is dealing. When the Government introduces its strategic plan for the future of the aviation sector with a particular reference to Dublin Airport, I have no doubt that it will be comprehensive, holistic and will look to future needs and plans; it will not be a knee-jerk reaction driven by some private agenda with a view to making vast sums of money at Dublin Airport.</P>

	<P>I ask Senator Dooley to be orderly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh. I hope the Minister will not simply outline another catalogue of delays. It is staggering how long it has taken to make a simple decision about the second terminal at Dublin Airport. Senator Dooley spoke about the process being expeditious, ongoing, consultative and used all sorts of other words to describe it. He failed to point out that the real problem for the Government is sitting behind him in the person of Senator Morrissey. This is a defining issue for the Government. While it will not fall on the issue, deep ideological disagreements on the matter exist between the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste, and between the two parties. They are paralysed. One wants to go hell for leather and place the second terminal in private hands and the other wants to do what <Col N="171"/>Jack O&rsquo;Connor and David Begg tell him to do. Those two objectives are absolutely irreconcilable, resulting in paralysis and delay. In the meantime, as pointed out by Senators Brian Hayes and Paddy Burke, we have unacceptable delays at Dublin Airport. We had a crisis with security last week, which was a direct result of the malaise and the kind of culture that exists in Dublin Airport at the moment.</P>
      <P>I see no great hope of a decision on the matter. I can see the motivation. The Taoiseach wants this problem not to be resolved or certainly not to cause any more trouble before the next general election. All that matters to the Taoiseach are the half-dozen or so Fianna F&aacute;il seats in north Dublin, which are dictating the fate of Dublin Airport. Otherwise what is happening would be inexcusable. Any excuses about the various decisions of the stakeholders and the consultation required are complete and utter rubbish. Senator Dooley may remember a Taoiseach from his party not long ago, Mr. Charles Haughey.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>In 1987, when this nation was in a far more critical economic state than it is now, Mr. Haughey, whom no doubt Senator Dooley still describes as a decent man,&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>True.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash; had the vision to establish the IFSC. That decision did not take as long as it has taken to establish a second terminal at Dublin Airport. Mr. Haughey was able to make a decision on the IFSC and get it moving successfully within months, yet the Taoiseach has not been able to make any decision on this rather less important issue over three years. The reasons for this are simple &mdash; the seats in north Dublin and obsession with politics. It has nothing to do with any of the issues described by Senator Dooley. It has nothing to do with economics, finance or the consumers; it is to do with the seats. While the Senator can bamboozle people with figures until the cows come home, the sole objective is to hold the north Dublin seats.</P><Col N="172"/>
      <P>Let us consider the people Senator Dooley claims need to be consulted. I would agree with him about one or two of them. Certainly it is now perfectly normal to consult the unions &mdash; I see nothing wrong with that. However, it is not perfectly normal to be dictated to by the unions or to do deals with the unions, which affect not only the second terminal, but also affect Aer Lingus. Senator Brian Hayes is right in saying that it is obvious that the deal is being done with these two semi-State bodies in mind. It is a single deal intertwining them. The people not being consulted are the businesspeople of the country while the trade unions are being consulted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the Senator is sharing his time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should not take all the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has had way too much time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Businesspeople are not being consulted on this issue and they certainly deserve consultation, as they will put up the capital for the second terminal. Let us look at this from the point of view of the investor. What would an investor in Aer Rianta, now the Dublin Airport Authority, or in Aer Lingus do when considering this problem? A prospective investor considering the privatisation of Aer Lingus who saw the deal the Taoiseach is cooking up with the unions&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

	<P>That would be acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Considering these problems, what would a prospective investor in Aer Lingus do knowing the Government was fiddling around with it politically and without knowing whether it would have a chief executive?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>The investor to which the Senator refers is not from the travelling public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has more to say from a seated position than he had when he was standing up.</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>Senator Ross should have listened.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="173"/>

	<P>The Senator can waffle better from his seat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Ross can do it from both positions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot have verbal exchanges across the floor of the Chamber. We will hear Senator Ross without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>What would an investor do? He would not know what the Government would do. He would see a split Cabinet and all sorts of special deals for the staff. He would be unclear as to whether he would get 49% or 51%. If it were to be 49%, the Minister can forget about it. He will not get anything like the value he expects. At the moment the shares are trading on the grey market at a level giving the company a valuation of approximately &euro;350 million, which is a pittance. The Minister can be certain there is very little confidence in this one taking off.</P>
      <P>What else would an investor consider? He would realise the airline does not have a chief executive and cannot get one because of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>It is because the future of the airline is undecided. While the Minister may laugh, if the Government had made a decision it would still have Willie Walsh, who had to leave for various reasons. If the airline had a chief executive it might attract investors. However, the Government cannot get a chief executive because it cannot make a decision on the future of the airline.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>The future of the airline will remain in doubt as long as the Government refuses to take politics out of the equation. It needs to consider the economics and the value to the country of a decision, which it should make quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have this opportunity to reiterate the commitment of the Progressive Democrats to the needs of consumers in the aviation industry. This debate should leave no one in doubt that the interest of the consumer is our foremost concern. In the past, discourse on aviation policy and infrastructure was dominated by engineering and planning issues. It is really about what is best for the travelling public. We cannot afford to waste any more of the public&rsquo;s time in driving reform in transport, and competition is the way to go. The Progressive Democrats continue to believe that innovation and <Col N="174"/>competition should be fostered and rewarded. Competition is a dirty word for some people who incorrectly associate it with reduced services, job cuts and worsening conditions for workers and consumers.</P>
      <P>The State and private forces must play a role in tackling the problems in aviation. Competition, when applied strategically, is the key to improving services and choice for the consumer. This is the goal which sets the Progressive Democrats apart from all other parties in the House.</P>
      <P>The decision to break up Aer Rianta has been rewarded with new routes and lower fares for consumers. We have beneficial competition between airlines and, more recently, between airports. We also need beneficial competition within airports. Given that we have competition in the market to and from Dublin Airport, why not have it within it? An independent second terminal at Dublin Airport represents the best method of delivering competition and, as such, the best method of delivering benefits to the consumer. An independent terminal would rule out the involvement of the Dublin Airport Authority and Ryanair. Many expressions of interest were submitted to build a second terminal, including one from Ryanair. The company, like the Dublin Airport Authority, should not be considered because its proposal could well distort competition at the airport.</P>
      <P>Proposals for the provision of additional terminal capacity at Dublin Airport are being considered by the Government. The best interests of the consumer must be uppermost in its considerations. New capacity will be required to cater for expected growth in passenger numbers at the airport. The detailed planning and implementation process will address the issue of the location of the next capacity increase and encompass all other relevant operational factors, including traffic management and access.</P>
      <P>Public safety and security are of such importance that other issues become almost irrelevant. On Monday, 11 April officials carrying out an EU security audit managed to evade detection during security checks at Dublin Airport. I will cite part of the response issued by the Dublin Airport Authority to this abomination. In its statement it indicated it was &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo; that the safety and security of passengers had not been compromised and noted that the airport continued to operate &ldquo;normally&rdquo;. In the context of my earlier comments, it is evident that the authority should be excluded immediately from operating any second terminal at the airport.</P>
      <P>As well as serving to enhance a monopoly, it is obvious the authority needs to reassess how it manages that which is already under its control. If it is failing to adequately deal with current demand, why would anyone expect it to be able to cater for even more customers?</P><Col N="175"/>
      <P>Contrary to the authority&rsquo;s statement that the airport continued to operate normally, passengers faced queues of more than 90 minutes to get through security at one stage over the weekend. Queues of hundreds of people circled the building, staff were forced to close the departure terminal to all but intending passengers for a time and many passengers missed flights as a result of the lengthy security delays. If this equates to normal operations in the eyes of the management of the Dublin Airport Authority, I shudder to think what would be a bad day at the airport.</P>
      <P>The travelling public needs to be completely confident that its safety is being provided for to the greatest possible extent and EU regulations introduced to protect it are being complied with. As we know, much of the surveillance at airports is carried out by persons and machines. Those responsible for monitoring machines must be given adequate breaks and have their duties rotated to ensure their health and well-being are protected. This is an important factor in protecting customers of Dublin Airport and one on which I seek reassurances from the Minister.</P>
      <P>Current forecasts suggest passenger numbers at Dublin Airport could increase to 22 million, which presents a considerable security task for the Dublin Airport Authority. It is obvious that if a review is instigated, it must specifically set out how the airport intends to address this issue.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister contacted the Dublin Airport Authority after the recent audit uncovered serious security breaches at the airport. I understand officials met representatives of the authority the following day and were advised as to the measures taken to address security issues.</P>
      <P>I return to my original point regarding the primacy of the needs of the travelling public. Security at our airports is paramount and must be taken seriously by Government. The Cabinet is waiting for the conclusion of the current security audit at the airport and will scrutinise its findings. The public must be reassured that the Government will take security seriously.</P>
      <P>Aviation is a fast-moving, complex business which makes it a complicated policy area. Some simple facts remain, however, including that competition increases choice and reduces costs for consumers. We should have no part in sustaining or, worse still, creating new restrictive practices. Consumers need choice and enhanced, secure facilities. This should be our focus in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no particular hang-up, based on daft ideological grounds, about the ownership of airports and other facilities, nor do I have an ideological hang-up that competition always produces better services. The example of the health care system in the United States should calm all those who get too carried away with <Col N="176"/>ideology. The US spends between 14% and 15% of gross domestic product on health care but has the lowest life expectancy and highest infant mortality rates in the developed world. Its health system does not work. For those who can afford to pay for all they require, it is wonderful but as a provider of health services for consumers it is far from it.</P>
      <P>I have no problems with competition and regard it as beneficial in many cases. The issue, however, is the necessity to protect those who are at work. We are observing in the courts the manifestations of a seedy, slimy form of competition involving people who could not speak English. While I do not wish to prejudice the case, if a quarter of what is alleged is true, it is the most unpleasant form of competition. Let us not, therefore, get carried away with competition and business efficiency.</P>
      <P>I have always been intrigued by the first study of Aer Rianta&rsquo;s proposals to develop Dublin Airport. Commissioned in 1999, the Warburg Dillon Reid report took issue with Aer Rianta&rsquo;s forecasts on passenger numbers growth. A cursory reading of the findings makes clear that Aer Rianta&rsquo;s predictions were closer to what eventually transpired than the eminent and, I am sure, extremely expensive consultants. Wearing my engineer&rsquo;s hat, I am sceptical that anybody could forecast five years ahead with an accuracy of more than plus or minus 10%. The consultants claimed they could forecast better than Aer Rianta but got it wrong. The reason I make this point is that there is no single answer and it is the role of Government to act. Governments should not wait for all the issues to resolve themselves and deal only with what is left. That approach is about giving up as opposed to governing.</P>
      <P>I do not need eminent consultants to tell me that Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam is so far ahead of Dublin Airport in terms of service to customers that the two are beyond comparison. I recently flew from Amsterdam to Dublin and the difference between the appearance of the airports, service, accessibility, friendliness and everything else was an embarrassment for Dublin Airport. The reason has nothing to do with ideology or competition but is due to the quality of the people who run the service, their commitment and the willingness of those who fund the airport to provide funding in advance, rather than spending seven years in an ideological distorted dance with each other.</P>
      <P>We have two Government parties, one of which has no ideology but wants to stay on good terms with a trade union that does and another which has an ideology which is totally irrelevant to the issue. The real problem is not what decision was taken but that no decision was taken. Our major airport is now grossly overcrowded, grossly underfunded and because of overcrowding, less than efficient. It may be <Col N="177"/>efficient in terms of revenue per passenger, but in terms of the comfort of those who use it, it must be slipping rapidly down the European chart of desirable places to use airline services.</P>

      <?oasys _cl11.5-?>
      <P>I have no idea what the outcome will be. I speak as a member of a party to which SIPTU is affiliated. Currently, SIPTU is vigorously opposed to privatisation of Dublin Airport. However, if a 15% share was put on offer to the members of SIPTU who work there, I suspect that a dramatic ideological conversion would take place overnight. I am supposed to defend both positions, but I will not do so. If this starts a row between the Labour Party and SIPTU, so be it. Fundamentally, it is not a question of ownership but a question of the rights of those who work there to be protected, no matter what the ownership system might be, provided the workers do the job they are supposed to do. However, the fundamental problem is that we now have an ideological stand-off between two Government parties. One of the parties, whose position has been articulated with clarity and consistency by Senator Morrissey, believes contrary to evidence, that the way forward is through competition. For example, there are three major airports around London, namely, Gatwick, Stansted and Heathrow. Stansted is the growth airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>There are actually four airports, including London City Airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is also the city airport. I beg the Senator&rsquo;s pardon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Ryan should be permitted to speak without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>In spite of the fact that Stansted is a vigorously competing airport, airport charges in Heathrow are extremely high. If one books a return air fare from Cork to Heathrow to travel next August, as I happen to have done recently, the air fare is actually &euro;9 with Aer Lingus. However, the ticket costs &euro;54. The charges come to &euro;45, most of which are incurred in Heathrow.</P>
      <P>I wish the two Government parties would abandon their dances with various partners and abandon a nonsensical ideological position that is not based on objective evidence. We should get a plan to give our capital city an airport which works. The sight of two parties staring at each other and setting out their aims separately reveals a level of incompetence that should be resolved after eight years in Government together. The Government parties should learn to work with each other as they have been practising for long enough. The people of this country and city are the victims of the inability of the Government to make its mind up about a fundamental issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this debate and the opportunity to set out the position regarding important matters concerning Dublin Airport. I hope Members will view the fact that I have come into this House as a mark of my deep interest in this debate and of my commitment. As a general point,I wish to make it clear that despite some comments that have been made in this House, to defer or deflect decisions concerning Aer Lingus or the terminals at Dublin Airport is not a sustainable position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has been in power for seven years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Ryan should let the Minister speak without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am responding directly to an accusation that was levelled. Moreover, it is not the view of any member of the Government, irrespective of position, that this is a sustainable position. I wish to put on the record of this House that all within the Government are <i>ad idem</i> on the view that I have stated, that decisions on these matters are of the utmost importance and must be made shortly and with absolute clarity. That is my position and I have stated it consistently since I came to office six months ago.</P>
      <P>It is also important to reflect, for those who suggest that nothing has happened in this area, that the break up and separation and the provision of independence and autonomy to the three key airports, namely, Dublin, Shannon and Cork, is significant and singularly important in the development of not only the airports themselves but of tourism and passenger numbers into this country. That took place in 2003. The Minister for Finance and I await and hope to see the completion of the airports&rsquo; business plans shortly.</P>
      <P>Parallel to that process, we are positioning ourselves to make a decision on a number of issues pertaining to aviation policy. These are my strongly-held views. I do not have an ideological view on this and it would be fundamentally flawed to take a view based on ideology alone on any particular issue. That approach would not deliver, no matter what side of the argument one might be on.</P>
      <P>It is the policy of the Government to encourage as wide a range as possible of reliable, regular and competitive air services to and from Ireland. The central tenet of this policy is the belief that a strong, competitive and efficient network of air links is vitally important for developing our trade and tourism sectors, particularly having regard to our island status and peripheral location.</P>
      <P>As Members are aware, passenger traffic through Dublin Airport is expected to grow from last year&rsquo;s level of over 17 million passengers to approximately 30 million by 2018, although I suspect the higher figure will be reached more rapidly than that. New infrastructure capacity and <Col N="179"/>facilities, both airside and landside, will be needed to cater for this growth, including further terminal capacity.</P>
      <P>Over the past decade, passenger traffic at Dublin Airport has more than doubled from 8 million passengers in 1995 to more than 17 million last year. This occurred in a relatively short timeframe. While the Dublin Airport Authority will continue to optimise the use of the existing terminal facilities in terms of growth, in the near term the time is fast approaching, indeed we have already reached it, when a decision must be made on the next tranche of terminal capacity so future growth at the airport will not be constrained. In this regard, the Dublin Airport Authority has already submitted a planning application for a second parallel runway to Fingal County Council.</P>
      <P>In terms of access, inward investment, economic development and tourism generally, Dublin Airport is and will remain the metropolitan gateway to the State. Ireland&rsquo;s island status creates a greater dependancy for the country and a much greater requirement for adequate modern airport infrastructure, with associated air services, than for other European countries with significant land borders. It is also noteworthy that the national spatial strategy has acknowledged that the expansion of the level of air services from Dublin Airport to a wider range of destinations is essential in the interests of underpinning Ireland&rsquo;s future international competitiveness. Notwithstanding the welcome increase over recent years in traffic at Shannon and Cork airports and indeed at some of the smaller regional airports, Dublin Airport will remain crucial to the national economy as a vital strategic component of national infrastructure.</P>
      <P>For this reason, there are two crucial issues guiding the overall consideration of how further terminal capacity will be provided at Dublin Airport. We must ensure the continued overall operational integrity and strategic development of Dublin Airport to meet the needs of current and future users of the airport, both airlines and passengers. Airlines are a serious customer of the airport, and are as important as passengers. It will also be necessary to ensure that additional terminal capacity is provided in good time to meet the growth in air traffic and that we do not allow new bottlenecks to develop in our strategic national transport infrastructure.</P>
      <P>Subject to these two guiding principles, I will bring proposals to the Government very shortly concerning this matter. The Government&rsquo;s objective will be to ensure the provision of terminal capacity on an efficient, cost-effective basis.</P>
      <P>Once the Government makes a decision regarding this matter, the detailed planning and implementation process will address the issue of the location of the next tranche of terminal capacity and all other relevant operational factors, <Col N="180"/>such as general access and the management of traffic, both airside and landside, at the airport.</P>
      <P>As I stated earlier, the Oireachtas passed the State Airports Act last year and pursuant to that Act, the new board of the Dublin Airport Authority took office on 1 October 2004. That new board brought together people of the highest calibre and expertise in business and aviation who have the commitment and the vision to address the challenges surrounding the delivery of enhanced infrastructure and facilities to meet projected growth at Dublin Airport.</P>
      <P>The State Airports Act 2004 also changed the remit of the Commission for Aviation Regulation. The latter is now obliged to balance economic efficiency, the reasonable interests of existing and future users and to ensure the airport&rsquo;s financial sustainability in a way that would promote its long-term development.</P>
      <P>The CAR is now well advanced in drawing up a new airport charges cap for Dublin Airport, which must be completed no later than 1 October 2005. The regulator has indicated that he will publish the draft determination on 6 May next. Under the legislation, the commission will then give an opportunity to interested parties to state their views on the draft determination before reaching a final view on the scope of the determination.</P>
      <P>Regardless of who owns the infrastructure at the airport, there is a need to achieve a commercial return on investment. Terminal facilities and runways are costly and, ultimately, the users of the airport must pay for them. It is the job of the regulator to be satisfied that the commercial rate of return given to the airport authority is reasonable.</P>
      <P>Arising from the existing comparatively low price cap at Dublin Airport, the DAA is acutely aware that it has to focus on its cost base and achieve efficiencies and show that capital expenditure is planned and carried out efficiently. To show that capital expenditure on infrastructure in planned efficiently and is responsive to user needs, the authority will continue to consult with stakeholders on the design and specification of future infrastructure facilities.</P>
      <P>In recent years, the low-cost airline market has led to a dramatic increase in passenger numbers at the airport, accounting for over 50% of all traffic at present. This is a larger market share than many peer airports elsewhere. It is also important to point out that the charging regime at Dublin Airport is among the lowest of European airports. Somebody must be doing something right to be in that kind of sustainable position. The management and workforce must be doing something right. It is wrong to suggest that everything is going wrong at Dublin Airport. The mythical portrait of Dublin Airport painted by some people who have vested interests completely distorts many of the good things about the <Col N="181"/>airport. I am not suggesting that it is run in the best and most cost-efficient way in its entirety. However, it is a long way from the manner in which it is presented by those who seek to undermine it.</P>
      <P>The regulator will set the cost base on all of these issues, whether the airport is owned by a private sector operator or the public sector. Any private investor in any facility will look for a substantial return on his or her capital deployed. At the same time, the airport must continue to have the operational flexibility to cater efficiently for the requirements of the long haul and charter markets which would have different expectations about service level standards, particularly in terminal facilities. This challenge requires the airport authority to try to achieve stakeholder consensus on matters such as the use of air bridges and comfort requirements for the range of passenger categories, including families and older people, transiting passengers or passengers embarking on a transatlantic flights.</P>
      <P>The challenge for the DAA is to continue to plan and develop the airport so the variety of its customers benefit from infrastructure service levels that strike the appropriate balance between cost effectiveness and comfort for those using the airport. As a policy maker, the State must decide on a future framework for the provision of terminal facilities at the airport that ensure that both the location and operation of such terminal capacity are in keeping with the optimum development of an efficient Dublin Airport. I expect to announce the Government&rsquo;s decision on that framework shortly.</P>
      <P>I now wish to turn to aviation security matters. Security at our airports is paramount and is taken very seriously by this Government. We are committed to ensuring the highest standards of security at all our airports. Aviation security is a complex business. It comprises a range of technical, procedural and human measures designed to protect crew, passengers, ground personnel, aircraft and facilities of an airport against unlawful interference perpetrated on the ground or in flight. It involves layers of measures, some overt, some covert, but which taken together maximise the protection of civil aviation.</P>
      <P>Our aviation security policy is based on the requirements set down by the European Union, the International Civil Aviation Organisation and the European Civil Aviation Conference. In accordance with these requirements, my Department has established a detailed framework and guidelines on the measures and procedures to be implemented by all of the entities involved in civil aviation security at the airports and other locations.</P>
      <P>The terrorist events of September 2001 led to a major review of civil aviation security globally and to greater co-ordination and co-operation at that level. As anyone travelling by air since then <Col N="182"/>will be well aware, the security regime at airports changed dramatically worldwide. In an EU context, a new regulation establishing common rules in the field of aviation security for member states was adopted. The guiding principle at all times of all the requirements and regulations is the security of passengers.</P>
      <P>The new regulation has resulted in fundamental changes to aviation security involving the putting in place of new measures and procedures principally by airlines and airports to enhance and strengthen security arrangements. The requirements of the EU have been incorporated into my Department&rsquo;s national civil aviation security plan and this has been made available to all relevant entities. I understand that at the national level, airports and airlines have responded positively to the increasing demands placed on them relating to security and have co-operated in implementing changes since 2001.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, there was a recent European Commission inspection of Dublin Airport. Dublin Airport and other airports in the State are subject to frequent audits and inspection by international organisations such as the European Civil Aviation Conference, the US Transportation Security Administration, foreign airlines and other governments. My Department also conducts regular security inspections and tests of aviation security facilities and operators at Irish airports. While all audits raise issues which must be looked at, no significant issues have been raised regarding Dublin Airport by these audits.</P>
      <P>The recent inspection by the European Commission was the first by that body at an Irish airport and was intended to establish the compliance by Dublin Airport and airline operators with the legal requirements set down in EU Regulations 2320/2002 and 622/2003. Officials from my Department accompanied the inspectors during the course of the inspection. Similar inspections have been conducted by the European Commission at other airports in the European Union over the past two years since the adoption of the regulations.</P>
      <P>At the completion of the inspection, officials from my Department and the DAA received an oral briefing on the findings of the inspection last Friday. In accordance with established procedures and practice, my Department, the European Commission or the DAA will not be making any comment on the specific outcomes of the inspection. A formal report will be sent by the European Commission to my Department in due course dealing with all relevant issues. This is a confidential report and will not be published.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, during the course of the inspection, a number of controlled tests were undertaken by the inspectors to test the various security arrangements around the airport. Some of these tests breached key security arrange<Col N="183"/>ments. Department of Transport and DAA officials were on hand to ensure all appropriate action was taken and that any security breaches identified were immediately addressed. Specific remedial measures were implemented by the DAA and I was furnished with a report from the authority on the measures taken. I wish to state categorically that no explosives, detonators, guns or live ammunition were used during those tests. Media speculation that such items were used is totally unfounded.</P>
      <P>Let me assure the House that I am determined that any deficiencies identified during the inspection will be remedied. Apart from the immediate remedial actions, I have instructed my officials to prepare an action plan in response to the Commission&rsquo;s findings. This will be done in consultation with the airport authority, airlines and other entities. I am determined that there will be a consistent and comprehensive application of security measures at all airports. I expect that all relevant operators will fully engage and co-operate with my Department to ensure that this is achieved.</P>
      <P>The House will recognise that the nature of security precludes detailed discussion of measures. Therefore, I will not disclose the nature or extent of any security measures that have been implemented or the nature of any additional measures that are under consideration. However, I am satisfied that the Dublin Airport Authority responded effectively and immediately to the deficiencies identified during the tests.</P>
      <P>Recognising the serious issues that were identified during the inspection, an extraordinary meeting of the DAA board&rsquo;s sub-committee on security was convened on Thursday, 14 April to review the issues. The board&rsquo;s sub-committee approved proposals for the appointment of an internationally recognised security consultant to undertake an urgent examination of the security systems and procedures of the airport. I was made aware of this and fully support that an international expert to benchmark against would be available to the DAA to go beyond its own expertise. I will ask the chairman to report to me on the outcome of this examination as soon as the information is available.</P>
      <P>A special meeting of the Dublin Airport security committee attended by senior managers from relevant organisations was convened on the morning of 20 April at the request of my Department to review the findings of the EU inspection and to ensure that all operators comprehensively implement approved security requirements. Representatives from my Department and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were in attendance.</P>
      <P>I have asked that an early meeting of the National Civil Aviation Security Committee, NCASC, be convened to review the findings of the EU inspection and to address any issues aris<Col N="184"/>ing from it. The role of the committee is to advise the Government and the civil aviation industry on security policy for civil aviation, to recommend and review the effectiveness of security measures and to provide for the co-ordination of the various interests involved. The committee is composed of representatives of Departments, Aer Rianta, the airlines, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Defence Forces, An Post, Customs and Excise, the Irish Aviation Authority and the Irish Airline Pilots Association, IALPA. An assistant secretary from my Department chairs the committee. Any advice from the NCASC will be taken into consideration in the action plan to which I referred.</P>
      <P>It is not only airport operators who have aviation security responsibilities. Airlines are obliged to comprehensively implement a range of approved security measures and procedures. There were significant failures in this regard. The problem was not just within the airport. Being aware of the specific details, there was an equality of failure, which is worrying. However, the response from all involved on both sides has been positive in putting matters to rights. Officials from my Department convened meetings with the airlines during the course of the inspection to ensure their full and proper implementation of security measures.</P>
      <P>My Department has been in touch with other airports in the State concerning full implementation of security measures, which answers some questions raised with me by Senator Dooley and others. All operators have responded positively and my Department will be keeping the situation under review.</P>
      <P>I will address the issue of delays that have resulted from the increased security arrangements at Dublin Airport. The DAA is monitoring passenger movements and controls to minimise inconvenience and delays and is liaising closely with the airlines. Passengers can make an important contribution to easing the workload of screeners by minimising the volume of hand baggage presented at the screening points and by co-operating with the screeners&rsquo; instructions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Airlines can facilitate the movement of passengers through earlier opening times and greater numbers of check-in desks. It is not enough to have the Dublin Airport Authority ask passengers to arrive two hours earlier if the airlines do not open their desks to facilitate passengers. The ball is on both sides of the court for everyone to play fair and not to seize on opportunities to lay the blame in one place. An efficient airport has many stakeholders to maximise its cost effectiveness and its ability to serve its passengers well. I appeal to both sides to co-operate <Col N="185"/>during peak times of passenger transit and security checks.</P>
      <P>I am concerned with the delays at the airport I saw on my screen. There is no question that these are unacceptable. Nobody wishes to sustain such a situation for passengers and I am glad to see that all sides are moving to correct it. People must be aware that if they come to the airport on time they will generally get through efficiently. Everyone arriving late with too much baggage under their arms is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>The DAA has advised me that it will maximise the use of existing facilities and will endeavour to efficiently manage airport processes to cope with the increasing passenger numbers passing through the terminal. It is also reviewing the level of staff resources available to effectively manage the situation. An additional 60 screeners are in training. Of these, 20 will come on stream later this week, a further 20 will have completed their training within the following two weeks and the remainder will have completed their training in four weeks. The availability of additional screeners will allow greater operational flexibility in rostering and dealing with peak passenger periods.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the work of security staff at our airports who endeavour to carry out a range of tasks to the highest standards in a complex and pressurised operating environment. Effective security demands consistent application by staff of the required security measures. I am committed to ensuring the highest standards of aviation security at our airports and will ensure that the lessons learned from the EU inspection will be taken on board. In regard to Dublin Airport specifically, I will be ensuring that the security issues are addressed in co-operation with the relevant parties so that there is full confidence in our arrangements and that they are managed in such a way as to minimise passenger disruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister will agree that Dublin Airport is not just the heart of Ireland in terms of economic growth but the heart and lungs of the country. As a former member of Fingal County Council for many years, I am aware of how important the airport is to the eastern region and to Ireland as a whole. Fingal and the wider area has grown and has developed many companies in the vicinity of Dublin Airport and Dublin&rsquo;s tourism industry has grown because of it.</P>
      <P>As the Minister mentioned, 17 million passengers used Dublin Airport in 2004. We expect that number to grow to 30 million by 2018. This is good for the country. In order to sustain this airport and the economic growth in trade and tourism, we must ensure Dublin Airport grows with development and the increased numbers. This growth should be planned and dealt with in a timely fashion but that has not been the case to date. The Government promised that it would <Col N="186"/>assess the need for a second terminal in Dublin as part of its programme for Government in 2002. How long will it take? I accept the Minister&rsquo;s statement that he wishes to bring proposals to Government shortly but it is taking far too long.</P>
      <P>The previous Minister asked for expressions of interest in 2002 and received 13. I do not know why a decision was not taken based on these before now. A number of reports, including the Mullarkey report, assessed them and reported problems with the sites identified by the DAA. I will cite Fingal County Council&rsquo;s development plan. It recommends that a site to the west of the existing terminal would be the best option. This is not the DAA site.</P>
      <P>I will not get hung up on questions of ownership and do not believe any Member should. We must search for the best site and examine what is best for the airport. If we muddy the waters with issues of ownership, such as sites owned by the DAA or the future of Aer Lingus, we will not make decisions based on the best interest of the growth of Dublin Airport. We must examine the wider picture.</P>
      <P>I am not hung up on ownership but believe in competition. I see a role for the DAA in the future. I do not understand why it could not develop a site to the west of the airport which is in private ownership at present. That site could then be vested in the Dublin Airport Authority but run by an independent operator. That could give us the best of both worlds. I would like such a venture to be considered. We should avoid monopolies at all costs and introduce competition. That is what will deliver growth at the airport, result in an increase in the number of people visiting this country and deliver the low cost airlines.</P>
      <P>It is important we deal with this issue quickly. We want to sustain the airport. As many speakers have said, the situation at the airport is unacceptable. One would not see the likes of the overcrowding and the appalling situation at carousels when one is trying to get baggage after a flight anywhere else. The situation is even worse than that which one would see in the Third World. There is a need for urgency in respect of this issue and that is why I support the Fine Gael motion and reject the Government amendment.</P>
      <P>The issue of security, which the Minister addressed, has caused much concern among the users of the airport. It is important the Minister restores confidence among the travelling public so people know that when they go to the airport or step on an aeroplane, they are safe. In light of recent terrorist attacks, people are cautious and worried about travelling on aeroplanes. It is, therefore, important people are reassured and that the Minister ensures safety measures taken at the airport are of the highest standard. What we witnessed last week was bizarre and would be funny if it were not as serious. I accept the <Col N="187"/>measures the Minister will put in place will address that problem. I am surprised the audits, which the Minister said are carried out regularly, did not highlight the failures which showed up last week during the tests. The delays at the airport and the fact people are missing flights does not inspire confidence. I hope those issues will be addressed quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Senator Kitt.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and his officials. I agree with Senator Terry that Dublin Airport is very important not only for Dublin, but for the eastern region and, indeed, the country. I am delighted to speak on the Fine Gael motion. As the motion tried to do, it is easy to focus on the current delays at Dublin Airport and to blame the Dublin Airport Authority and the Government which appointed it. I have spoken to people who faced the queues at the airport, which we all saw on the news. There has been chaos at the airport over the past week or so, particularly at peak times, as a result of the EU audit whereby a fake bomb and a number of other dangerous implements which should have been detected got through security. It is not good enough that they were not detected but that is not the fault of the Government, the airport authority or the overstretched and tired employees at the security check.</P>
      <P>These delays are the result of thorough security arrangements. I would be very concerned if travelling on an Aer Lingus flight from Dublin to America or on any other flight, internal or external, if I was able to walk through security without any checks or examination. Nobody likes to queue, whether in the supermarket or on the way in or out of Croke Park, but it is a fact of life. The existence of queues is a reassuring sign in the context of airport or airline safety. We have all gone through airport security and wondered about the need for such examination. However, it is there to ensure air travel is safe for travellers.</P>
      <P>For many of the people working at our airports and elsewhere, it is a difficult and, in many cases, a thankless job. On many occasions, employees are the subject of abuse and smart comments. They have an important responsibility and the travelling public must treat these important employees with the respect they deserve.</P>
      <P>We have all heard stories about nightmare delays, problems caused by missing flights, etc., but this is not entirely the responsibility of the Dublin Airport Authority. The airlines in question must carry some of the responsibility. The airport authority asks people to arrive an hour and a half or two hours early to check in, which they are doing. However, they are not always facilitated by the airlines in question as they are not providing extra personnel to deal with people <Col N="188"/>who arrive early to check in and this results in considerable queues at security checks.</P>
      <P>There seem to be many experts on airports, airport security, etc., but I certainly would not claim to be an expert, particularly in regard security. On 13 April 2005, the Ryanair deputy chief executive officer, Michael Cawley, confirmed that airline&rsquo;s full confidence in security procedures at Dublin Airport. He stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">As the largest airline operating at Dublin Airport with over 24,000 departures per annum, we have many complaints about facilities at the airport, but none about its safety or security. In our experience the security procedures at Dublin are among the best in Europe and compare favourably with any of the other airports to which we operate.</P>
      <P FLI="0">He is an expert and deputy chief executive of one of the largest airlines in this country, so I rest my case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State. I am glad to speak on this motion. Unlike other speakers, I am not hung up on ideology, although I think everybody has to say that, nor am I concerned about ownership. However, it is important there are improvements at Dublin Airport, to which this motion mostly relates. I do not like the word &ldquo;terminal&rdquo; but I suppose it is the only one we can use to describe what we are looking for here. It is most important there is an efficient cost-effective base and the commercial rate of return about which the Minister spoke.</P>
      <P>I was very interested in the debate on security at Dublin Airport and, indeed, in the regional airports. My first reaction was to ask, why are more people not involved in screening? However, the Minister dealt with that question. It is important there are extra screening areas. As in the United States of America, there is no reason people could not be interviewed in order to get details in regard to their flights, even if they are in a queue.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, since September 2001 and the terrorist attacks, there have been many difficulties in regard to security. Anyone who has travelled in the United States will know of the difficulty there. I know from having travelled in the Middle East in recent years that it is even more difficult there. If we go to the extreme whereby people must take off their shoes and sometimes their belts and braces, then they will not be interested in travelling. One wonders why we cannot deal with this issue in some other way. Speakers have said we must think of the customers first and there should be a better way to deal with this issue.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that passengers are being asked to be at Dublin Airport 90 minutes before flying. That has been the case at the airport for some time. The regional airports also advise that one should arrive 90 minutes before boarding. There <Col N="189"/>are twice daily flights from Galway to London City Airport, which boasts a 20 minute arrival time before checking in. If one goes to the Aran Islands from Galway one is required to arrive only 15 minutes before departure.</P>
      <P>There will be competition and we have to be aware of it. This is happening at a time when travel is popular. Today&rsquo;s newspapers refer to the increase in the number of elderly who are travelling. I applaud and welcome that but if we go to the extremes outlined in this debate, travelling will be made very difficult. While there must be security, the airlines have a major role to play. I do not see why they would not undertake an audit, given that the European Union has done one which has been well reported.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that Galway has the fastest growing airport in the country. I welcome the fact that it is putting security in place. Airport officials in Galway say that if there is to be extra security, which they would welcome, it will require greater expenditure and there will have to be greater co-operation from the public. The airlines have to play their role in security matters as well as the EU auditors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to tell a story about arriving in Shanghai Airport in Singapore a few years ago. The plane on which my wife and I arrived landed at the same time as two other jumbo jets. I looked to the left and to the right and said we would be at the airport all day. As we came to the immigration department I was impressed that every seat was occupied. There was no delay. The immigration authorities who questioned us were friendly. They asked what was the purpose of the visit and told us to enjoy our stay. I said we would have to wait to get our bags. When we got to the luggage area I was impressed that our bags were there before us.</P>
      <P>When we got to the customs officer, who was a strong tough lady, she asked if I was aware that the death penalty existed for the importation of drugs into Singapore and if I had any. The answer to one question was &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and to the other &ldquo;No&rdquo;. I had to make sure I said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;No&rdquo;. She examined us carefully and let us through.</P>
      <P>When we got to the hotel the staff was waiting for us. When we required a driver he said he would be back in two minutes. We waited and he got his car. When we got into the car he asked me to tell him about our experience at the airport. He inquired about the immigration department. I described it and he said, &ldquo;Good&rdquo;. He asked if our bags were at the luggage area before we got there and I said they were to which he responded, &ldquo;Good&rdquo;. He asked about customs and I told him. He said we may have noticed that when he picked us up he did not pull up at the kerb but waited until we arrived and there was no delay.</P><Col N="190"/>
      <P>He said that last year Shanghai Airport came second to Schiphol Airport in the competition for the best airport in the world and it was determined to win this year. The areas where they lost marks were in those I have mentioned. For example, when drivers came to pick up their passengers they double parked and treble parked and there was a delay. The people of Singapore agreed not to double park. They wait for their passengers and then pick them up. One may ask why I am relating that story. It shows the commitment of the people of Singapore to win that competition and they won it. They have won it practically every year since then.</P>
      <P>I am taking pains with this issue because we have to achieve what has been achieved at Shanghai Airport. If we can manage to take a national pride in Dublin Airport which is the main gateway to this country, that would be the solution. Responsibility for that rests with the Government, the Taoiseach and the Minister.</P>
      <P>We are not proud of Dublin Airport and what is happening there. Irrespective of who owns it and whatever the commitment, the real answer is to create that pride. It is capable of being created. The onus of responsibility to do so rests with the Government and the Minister. There is no point in blaming unions or ownership. Unless we achieve pride in the airport a valuable national asset will be lost.</P>
      <P>Everybody coming in to Dublin Airport is a potential business investor, whether a tourist or whoever. I want to see a sense of pride coming into those who provide a service at the airport. It can be achieved but not if we delay, wrangle and do not take responsibility. It is in the hands of the Government and the Minister. I urge the Minister to immediately grab hold of that opportunity.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House. Schiphol Airport has been mentioned twice by Senators Ryan and Quinn. Listening to Senator Ryan one would think it was built only recently. Schiphol Airport has developed in a first-class manner. Dublin Airport modelled itself on it in many ways in the late 1960s when it was designed. It is a model of careful development that grew in proportion to the amount of traffic going through Amsterdam. By contrast, Dublin Airport is a disaster zone.</P>

	<P>Having worked in Dublin Airport on the building of the new airport in 1970, I speak from experience. I went in and out of it four and five time a week developing my business. The building, the flow of passengers and the manner in which luggage is dealt with is appalling.It is not the fault of the previous airport authority or the current airport authority but the Government that did not deliver on time a proper airport infrastructure. It cannot cope.</P>
      <P>Approximately ten years ago, when I was a member of the council of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, I pushed for a second terminal. With vision, Casement Aerodrome will be developed as a second airport for those coming from the south. In our Government manifesto in 2002, we said we would proceed with a second terminal. We are talking about the Government acting on behalf of the taxpayers whose money is paying for Dublin Airport. It should get on with it and make the decision because it is holding back the image of our country abroad.</P>
      <P>As Senator Ryan said, the pressure put on the architects and engineers who designed Dublin Airport is cruel. The original airport building, which was built in the 1950s, is a work of art and its design is perfect. The 1970 design of the new airport was first class but the manner in which it has grown organically is appalling. I came through the airport on Monday week and looked at the chaos and the flow of the passengers coming in. This has nothing to do with security but the lack of a concept about the design of the airport.</P>
      <P>Having worked in the airport, I have a vested interest. That was where we grew our business because we had a captive market. The size of the terminal cannot deal with the 17 million people currently using it. It is a role of Government to plan for infrastructure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I wish to share my time with Senator Feighan. I compliment the previous speaker on her comments. She shares the sentiments of the Fine Gael motion. I respect that she must vote with her party, as does every Member in this House, but she spoke a lot of sense.</P>
      <P>This motion is about the future of Dublin Airport, the future of air transport and the future of the country. It must be conceded that to some degree Dublin Airport is almost the victim of its own success. The Minister&rsquo;s statistics were quite startling, showing a projected growth from 17 million passengers last year to 30 million by 2018. That is a phenomenal number of passengers using Dublin Airport. It will be necessary to plan ahead in a detailed fashion for the ever-growing numbers. Unfortunately, the current facilities are not sufficient for today&rsquo;s 17 million passengers and the quicker the second terminal is developed, the better.</P>
      <P>Senator White summed it up by saying that the business of Government is to get on with the job, to allow the work commence on building the terminal and to worry about the ideology afterwards. There appears to be a difference of ideological policy between the Government parties, which is fair enough because that is politics but it is disappointing that the difference of political approach and ideology appears to be holding up a decision in respect of who will build what and where. The Minister, Deputy Cullen, gave an indication that we are moving towards a decision regarding who will be building the second terminal. Media reports today state that one of the private developers who was willing to invest has indicated he has been told on good authority &mdash; if the House will excuse the pun &mdash; that the Dublin Airport Authority will be given the contract. It is not a question of who does the job but rather of how it is done, where the terminal will be sited and whether it will provide the competition required.</P>
      <P>Competition is an absolute necessity in the air transport sector. It has worked very well in making air travel affordable to the masses and it is required in the delivery of passengers and the provision of airport facilities. I hope the Minister of State and his senior colleague will ensure the final structure is not a one-man band.</P>
      <P>On the issue of security referred to in the Fine Gael motion, the situation in Dublin Airport recently is untenable. Urgent action is required. There are times when the solution seems to lie in hiring more staff but this seems to be out of ideological favour. The security system at Dublin Airport is now so blocked up that additional per<Col N="194"/>sonnel and facilities are required quickly. We cannot allow the current situation to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Bradford for sharing his time with me. I agree with the decision to develop a second airport terminal at Dublin Airport. I suggest some improvements could be made now. I raised the issue of parking in this House. I parked my car at the airport for one day last week and the daily cost was &euro;30. I was in a hurry and I parked at the terminal. The parking charges for my car were more than the flight cost. This did not include any extras such as car washing or valeting. I would prefer to use other car parks but I was in a hurry that day.</P>
      <P>On another occasion I used the Aer Rianta car park costing &euro;8 a day. On returning, I sat into the shuttle bus to the car park. The driver left the bus to deliver an item into the airport building. The second bus arrived and we remained waiting in our bus for 18 minutes. I made a complaint at airport reception but was informed that it was not their problem because these were private bus operators. This is unacceptable. The driver eventually returned and I was happy to get to my car. That driver&rsquo;s lack of service let down the Aer Rianta employees who give sterling service. There seemed to be no procedures in place to discipline him. Tourists were also waiting for service and were disappointed, as was I.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Quick Park service. It is obviously independently operated and the cost is &euro;5 per day. The service from Quick Park is much faster to the airport and represents value for money.</P>
      <P>I suggest Dublin Airport take a leaf out of Knock Airport&rsquo;s book. The security personnel welcome the passengers home with a smile. Knock Airport charges a &euro;10 departure fee and those of us in the west of Ireland are delighted to support the airport because that charge pays for the upgrade of vital facilities which are of significant benefit to the area. People will pay charges if they get the service.</P>
      <P>I was concerned to learn that knives, replica guns and a replica bomb could be brought through security at Dublin Airport, especially when one considers that security staff were aware of the presence of 15 inspectors. Even in a heightened security environment, therefore, inspectors were able to bring such items through. The workers are not to be blamed for this but rather the procedures in place in the airport. The inspectors&rsquo; findings represent a serious breach of security and such incidents should not take place again.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael believes the Dublin Airport Authority should have some say in the development of a new terminal but that this terminal should have an independent operator. This is the approach that works in business and other related areas. I welcome the Fine Gael motion.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="195"/>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to share time with Senator O&rsquo;Toole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I have represented the Shannon area in the Oireachtas for 32 years and have heard much talk about airports in that time. I am glad we are having this type of discussion because for far too long people in my constituency were worried about whether there would be any more flights into Shannon Airport. It was a case of seeking special concessions and devising other ingenuous means to attract airlines into the airport.</P>
      <P>Today, however, we are debating a situation whereby airports are crowded with passengers queueing to get on flights. There is a thriving aviation industry and a thriving airport in Dublin. There are undoubtedly some problems with accommodation but it is preferable to endure such difficulties than to have Dublin Airport staff watching the sky in vain hope of the arrival of an aircraft as did their counterparts in Shannon in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to lecture Members and it is unnecessary to do so. The stark reality is that Dublin Airport is crowded with business as more people wish to fly into and out of the country. It is inevitable there will be a strain on accommodation but there are several measures than can be taken to reduce that strain. It is obvious that Members who made reference to Third World airports have not been to any such facilities. I have seen them on my travels around the world in my 30 years in the Oireachtas, in various Ministries and as a member of several committees.</P>
      <P>There has undoubtedly been a change in the security position in Dublin Airport and a clear slowing down of passenger traffic and throughput. For instance, a passenger travelling from Heathrow Airport to Dublin Airport with a connection to Shannon Airport, a journey I undertake regularly, could heretofore transfer within the high-security area from one gate to the next. Now, however, one must exit through the baggage hall, pass through the least secure part of the airport and re-enter as if one is a new passenger by undergoing all the security checks once again. In other international airports, as in Dublin Airport in the past, passengers making connecting flights do not have to endure multiple security checks. The sensible approach is to transfer such passengers directly to the gateway from which they will board their onward connecting flight. This speeds up the process because passengers can check in their baggage as far as their final destination at the beginning of their journey.</P><Col N="196"/>
      <P>The system in Dublin Airport is archaic and was perhaps introduced at a time when there was not much business. The situation has changed, however, and I appeal to the airport security authorities to terminate the daft procedure by which passengers who are taking a connecting flight are obliged to leave and re-enter the departure area through the least secure section of the building. This is an unwarranted, time-consuming and frustrating process for both passengers and staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask Senator Daly to conclude so Senator O&rsquo;Toole may have time to speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I was only warming up. However, I conclude by observing that it is a great day when we are debating a situation where we have more business than we can handle. I wish it were the same in other parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Daly for sharing time with me. One of the problems with this debate is that everybody has their own ideological position to promote. I am well acquainted with Dublin Airport as I live beside it and many of my neighbours work there. I have visited many airports worldwide but have encountered only one in the past two years, Gerona Airport, in which free parking was provided. I returned to this airport, of which Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Leary has often spoke, twice in the past three months and discovered that once it began attracting more business, those parking their vehicles were subject to a charge.</P>
      <P>Parking in Dublin is expensive. It is amazing to hear people complaining about parking costs in the airport but passing no comment on the similar prices in locations across the road. It is a question of Dublin prices. If the Dublin Airport Authority were to provide free parking, there would be Members who claimed this was typical of the public service and its inability to make a shilling. The authority is charging &euro;20 per day for parking because that is what the public is prepared to pay. This is what market forces and privatisation are about.</P>
      <P>Senator Feighan observed that the quick-park facility costs &euro;5 per day for long-term passengers while the short-term car park in the airport costs &euro;20 per day. However, the long-term car park in the airport costs &euro;5 or &euro;6 per day. It is all about the market and passengers can choose the option they prefer. In the development plan for what we call the &ldquo;Swords metro&rdquo;, my local authority, Fingal County Council, has factored in a large park and ride facility at Swords which will allow people to travel on the metro to the new airport terminal, if it is properly designed, having paid a quarter of the price to park their vehicles. This is the way forward.</P><Col N="197"/>
      <P>With regard to security, Senator Daly is correct that it is very frustrating that passengers with connecting flights are obliged to undergo security checks more than once. However, the same situation pertains in Los Angeles, Heathrow, Stansted, JFK and so on. This is now international practice. If one travels to Stansted Airport with the airline owned by &ldquo;Mr. Efficiency&rdquo;, Michael O&rsquo;Leary, one must disembark the aircraft, collect one&rsquo;s luggage, walk half a mile to the end of the terminal, go through the check-in process and walk back again in order to take one&rsquo;s connecting flight. This is how Mr. O&rsquo;Leary, the god of the private sector, manages the process in his operation. It is not his fault that it must be so but rather it is the security requirement. This is the reality. As Senator Feighan observed, the private bus operator which was to solve all our problems in Dublin Airport will not allow buses to depart until there are enough passengers to render such journeys economically viable.</P>
      <P>We must recognise that this economic reality will also apply in the case of the new terminal. Services will not be cheaper. However, the Fine Gael motion is correct in its contention that the Government should have made progress on the new terminal. It is inexcusable that this has not been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Like Senator Daly, Senator O&rsquo;Toole is only warming up. However, I must ask him to conclude as the time is almost up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I shall conclude by outlining the main issues. First, if a new terminal is built, the number of security checkers per passenger will not be any more than it currently is because it would not pay for airport management to appoint more. Second, it is not the case that only one new terminal is required. This issue has caused such ideological conflict that one may ask why we cannot have a terminal for each ideology. Let SIPTU build one and Senator Daly&rsquo;s constituent in Ennis, Mr. Michael McNamara, build another. None of us will be concerned as long as there is a train link between the three terminals. The best man will win in this situation, just as it should be.</P>
      <P>However, the motion is correct in urging the Government to take a decision on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear. The Government should get on with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Such a development will create more jobs and more capacity. We must recognise, however, that it will not reduce the cost of parking in Dublin Airport or the security queues. Those responsible for building and operating the terminal will want to make a profit and will scale back their costs as far as possible.</P>

	<P>Passenger numbers will increase substantially over the next ten years. It has even been reported that there will be up to 30 million passengers by 2018. If we break that figure down, it means something in the region of an additional 30,000 passengers a week over the next ten years. The number of passengers has grown at a phenomenal rate, yet the Government is making no decision on the matter. It is standing idly by, week after week. The fallout will be that people will stop coming here and business and tourism opportunities will be lost.</P>

	<P>The Minister of State said the level of staff resources is being reviewed to manage the situation effectively. He said that an additional 60 screeners are in training, 20 of whom will come on stream later this week; a further 20 will have completed their training within the following two weeks and the remainder will have completed their training in four weeks time. The availability of additional screeners will apparently allow greater operational flexibility in rostering for and dealing with peak passenger periods.</P>
      
      <P>The Dublin Airport Authority states that it cannot guarantee additional security channels in the existing terminal. Several Senators from the Government side asked this evening why the air<Col N="199"/>line desks do not open up earlier and let people through. What would happen if that were done? The terminal would be blockaded with passengers. We cannot have that. There is no question that additional screening facilities are needed. If 60 new screeners are to be provided, they are going to be working on top of each other at the screening points. Additional screening channels are needed immediately, and I cannot understand why the Minister of State did not say that in his speech. There is obviously a great need for additional space and for a new terminal. I am dis<Col N="200"/>appointed the Minister was not more focused this evening and did not tell us he will provide this as a matter of urgency. He just said the same thing this evening that he said six months ago, namely that a decision will be made in due course.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State should contact the Taoiseach as a matter of urgency and ask him to act for once and for all on the issue. The needs are pressing. If it continues as it has done for the past few years, the situation will be a disaster for the country from the points of view of both tourism and business.</P>

	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me raise this matter again. I have raised it on a number of previous occasions but the context is now considerably altered. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources <Col N="200"/>urgently needs to make a decision on a report currently sitting on his desk relating to the future plans for the rehabilitation of old mine sites in the Silvermines area.</P>
      <P>As the Minister knows, this issue has been a source of considerable concern since 1999, but it has come to a head in the past year. The Department, the EPA, the county council and the local community have worked together, but have struggled to come to a position where Mogul of Ireland would come up with a plan acceptable to all, involving the rehabilitation of those mine sites in the Silvermines area for which the company is responsible.</P>
      <P>When the latest &ldquo;final report&rdquo;&mdash; to use a Department term &mdash; sent from Mogul to the Department was circulated to the interested parties it did not meet any standard by which it could satisfactorily be considered as a rehabilitation plan. The county council, the EPA, the local community and the consultants, SRK, all had major <Col N="201"/>concerns. The report was seriously substandard regarding what needs to be done, not only on the tailings pond but on other sites also.</P>
      <P>If I can speak specifically on the tailings pond, what is needed is a rehabilitation plan to ensure that erosion, which is now quite rampant on surface of the pond, would be ended and controlled in the future. A proposal to put low-grade compost, which is unacceptable for spreading on agricultural land, on the surface of the tailings pond could not meet the requirements of such a rehabilitation plan.</P>
      <P>A series of flaws in the proposal make it unacceptable. My understanding is that a report has been given to the Minister by officials in his Departments setting out the current situation. I do not know what is in that report because, quite rightly, the officials cannot say. It is up to the Minister to make a decision on that report, however, it has been with the Minister since early March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise for interrupting but there is noise outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>Indeed there is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like that noise to cease. I apologise for interrupting, but in fairness to Senator O&rsquo;Meara and to the House, I think the interruption was warranted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach. At present, the community is awaiting the decision of the Minister on the rehabilitation plans. If Mogul does not take this on, who will? I know from my dealings with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, and from everything that has been said to the community over the years, that a major decision must be made. If the company is not to carry out the rehabilitation the State may have to take it on or an agency may have to be contracted. We do not know what is the position. We are in a limbo at the moment and I tabled this matter in an effort to obtain information for the community so that it knows when the Minister is likely to make a decision and what the implications might be.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hoctor stated at a recent meeting of the Joint Committee of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, which departmental officials attended, that the Minister wants to meet the community before he makes a final decision. That is very welcome and I hope that it happens. I have no information on when or where that meeting might happen and the neither does the community. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, to set out the current position and to outline the Department&rsquo;s plans going forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator O&rsquo;Meara for raising this matter, which was last addressed in <Col N="202"/>the House on 27 January 2005. The House will be aware that the Minister requested the Department to deliver to him, during February of this year, a comprehensive report on the current position concerning the Silvermines area. The report was to deal with the current state of the Department&rsquo;s consultations with all stakeholders, especially the local community and on the Department&rsquo;s efforts to obtain from Mogul a credible and implementable remediation proposal that would effectively and finally address the long-standing concerns of the local community, to which Senator O&rsquo;Meara referred.</P>
      <P>In addition, the report was to address the issue of the legal responsibility of the company, under clause K of its State mining lease, to remediate the company mine workings in the Silvermines area. It was also required to outline and assess the technical and financial capacity of Mogul to design an appropriate remediation programme and to carry out the necessary work, as well as the legal and other issues arising in that context. Moreover, it was to include the consolidated and up-to-date views of the local community, the Department&rsquo;s own consultants, the EPA and the local authority on the most recent Mogul proposals. The Minister also requested that the report address the implications, at a broad policy level, of any decision not to proceed with a dialogue with Mogul and the consequences, in principle and in practice, of taking an alternative route.</P>
      <P>The House will appreciate that in light of the complex nature of the issues before the Minister and the implications of a decision from a practical, policy, legal and financial perspective, it is imperative that the matter receives careful consideration by him. It is clear that there are fundamental questions of principle involved in bringing this matter to a conclusion. For instance, is it appropriate that the company responsible for the remediation be let off the hook, given its legal responsibilities? Is it appropriate that the taxpayer should be drawn into funding a remediation that is a private, legal responsibility? What are the wider implications for public policy of any direct State involvement in remediation? Another question concerns the implications, for the timing of effective and final remediation of all of the Silvermines clause K sites, of taking the Mogul, as opposed to other possible routes. Finally, what should the public policy position be regarding the non-clause K sites in the area and, indeed, other mine waste sites elsewhere?</P>
      <P>The Minister can make no apologies for any perceived delay on his part in progressing this complex and difficult matter. Despite the comprehensive nature of the report the Minister received, there are further questions to be answered and consultations to occur, as part of the deliberation process. Only then will the Minister be satisfied that the chosen way forward on this issue makes public policy sense from the broader perspective and is in the best interests of all stakeholders.</P><Col N="203"/>
      <P>I assure the House that the Minister will progress this matter in full recognition of its urgency and the long-standing concerns of the local community. However, he also has to have regard to its sensitivity from a legal point of view and to the ultimate need to make a decision that is consistent with good public policy principles. He undertakes to lay out the position in a comprehensive manner when he has fully and carefully considered all of the issues I have outlined.</P>

	<P>This is a simple issue and I hope the Minister of State has some good news. My adjournment matter concerns the public swimming pool in Kilkenny city, which is in a very dilapidated condition. There are detailed proposals for the building of a new pool in the city. A site has been located but the question of funding has not been resolved. I have heard mixed reports on this, from different sources. Some people have said that the Government plans to make the money available, while others have said that it is not yet available. I hope the Minister of State can tell the House that this important recreational facility for Kilkenny city and its environs can be provided as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Phelan for raising this issue and I am pleased to respond to him on behalf of the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, on the local authority swimming pool programme and, in particular, on the position of the Kilkenny swimming pool project which comes under that programme. The aim of the programme, which is administered by the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, is to assist local authorities in the provision of new public swimming pools or in the refurbishment of existing pools. Grants of up to &euro;3.8 million are available towards refurbishment or the provision of new pools, subject in both cases to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project, or in the case of projects in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the cost. Support is available towards the cost of a swimming pool, a toddler pool, sauna and steam room. The closing date for the receipt of applications under the current programme was 31 July 2000.</P>
      <P>Various stages must be completed before a decision is made on the formal allocation of moneys under the programme. The four principal stages are the feasibility study and preliminary report, the contract documents, the tender and finally, construction. The Department&rsquo;s technical advisers at the OPW evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless they receive prior approval from the Department. Grant aid is allocated only when tenders have been approved and the grant aid is capped at the time of the allocation.</P><Col N="204"/>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>

	<P>If the news is good, I doubt anybody will worry.</P>

	<P>The Senator knows that the Minister of State is referring to the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The council applied for grant aid to replace the existing swimming pool on a new site. Following the approval of the feasibility study in that year, the council decided that the most suitable site for the development was at a different location, at Scanlon Park, which already had an eight lane athletic track and an all-weather full size pitch. The council submitted the preliminary report for the new site in September 2004, which I am pleased to inform the Senator, was approved by the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism in March this year. This approval allows the council to prepare the detailed contract documents for the work proposed. On submission of this documentation, the project will be considered further. The proposed new facility will include a 25 m., six-lane swimming pool, a children&rsquo;s fun and learner pool, a fitness suite including a spa, sauna and steam room, as well as a sports arena the size of three basketball courts.</P>
      <P>There are 55 projects in the pool programme, 15 of which have been opened or have completed construction work. These are in Arklow, Courtown-Gorey, Dundalk, Ennis, Enniscorthy, Monaghan, Navan, Wicklow, Roscommon, Aquadome Tralee, Ballinasloe, Finglas in Dublin, Grove Island in Limerick and the regional sports and leisure centres in Tralee and Clonmel. Ten projects are at construction phase in Tuam, Churchfield in Cork city, Ballymun, Ballyfermot, Drogheda, Jobstown, Youghal, Cobh, Letterkenny and Monaghan town. Some 30 other applications are at various stages in the process: five are at tender stage, 11 are at contract document stage and 14 are at preliminary report stage. Significant progress is being made to implement the programme.</P>
      <P>The Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism is carrying out an expenditure review on the swimming pool programme which is expected to be completed later this year. This will examine, among other things, how the programme has worked to date, the benefits accrued to the areas where pools have been built, the levels of funding required to honour existing commitments, how these commitments can be managed within the confines of available funding and any amendments which may be required to ensure effective and efficient delivery.</P>
      <P>It is vital that the promotion of sport in general and the development of facilities such as swim<Col N="205"/>ming pools is carried out in a strategic and focussed manner. This entails the establishment of priorities, the avoidance of overlaps and ensuring maximum public access to available facilities.</P>
      <P>The Government is anxious to ensure that the investment of taxpayers&rsquo; money provides value for money by ensuring that attractive, viable facilities are built with the level of funding provided for 2005 by the Department at almost &euro;62 million in respect of the sports capital programme, over &euro;34 million in respect of the Sports Council and, in this context, &euro;32 million in respect of the local authority swimming pool programme, which represents an increase of over &euro;14 million on the previous years&rsquo; expenditure. The commitment to sport and leisure provision by this Government is being sustained.</P>
      <P>The last approval required of the Department was in March 2005. I will speak to the Minister at the first available opportunity about the matter raised by the Senator with a view to making progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for taking this Adjournment matter. There is a pressing need for action with regard to non-nationals awaiting residency who are under severe financial strain due to the restrictions imposed on them in terms of full-time paid employment. What progress has been made with regard to a rational and productive solution to the lifting of such punitive restrictions?</P>
      <P>Ms Abbey Okubadejo from Nigeria has lived in County Longford with her two sons and daughter since November 2002. Her residency status has not yet been finalised although she has lived in this country for the past five years, having previously been here in the early 1990s. Ms Okubadejo is a skilled nurse and qualified in London in 1980, having previously worked as a secretary. With three children to support, she urgently needs to work and has much to offer. However, she is forced to do what she can to make ends meet without the benefit of a salary, to which she would be entitled under any humane system.</P>
      <P>Ms Okubadejo moved from London to Dublin in 1991 with her husband to set up an engineering company. Her eldest child was born here but sadly her husband died and she returned to Nigeria with her daughter. She remarried there and had three more children, two of whom are in secondary school in Longford. These boys are exemplary pupils who wish to pursue third-level education and this is a worry for their mother as their residency status awaits regularisation, together with hers.</P>
      <P>Ms Okubadejo desperately wishes to work and keep her nursing skills up to date. She has much to offer and, conscious of the nursing shortage in this country, is puzzled and frustrated at not being allowed to put her training to good use both for herself and the community. Far from being idle, she does voluntary work with St. <Col N="206"/>Christopher&rsquo;s special needs school. This work is extremely welcome and helpful for the school but does not solve her financial problems.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, during statements on migrant workers last week in this House stated that he wanted to send a clear message that those who come to Ireland seeking employment are welcome. I hope these sentiments extend to all those with valuable skills, such as those offered by Ms Okubadejo. The Government should ensure that such people are given every necessary assistance to use their skills both for their own good and that of the community in which they live.</P>
      <P>Ms Okubadejo has endured much. She was abused by members of the Nigerian security forces immediately before coming to Ireland. Details of this incident are available on request. Her husband died shortly after she came to Ireland and she was left with a small child.</P>
      <P>She has a family of whom she can be proud. In spite of the changes in their lives, they have settled into Longford and are doing well educationally. However, sustaining a decent standard of living for any family demands money and in order to do so one must work. It is a disgrace that, despite her qualifications, Ms Okubadejo is not allowed to work.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to regard the merits of the case and allow Ms Okubadejo to take up the employment she so desperately needs. Her children are exemplary and references can be obtained from any of their schools. She is very anxious that they should have some security before they leave post primary school and go on to university. I would be pleased to forward any further details the Minister requires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Bannon for raising the matter and giving me the opportunity to respond on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The person referred to by the Senator arrived in the State on 16 November 2000 accompanied by her three children and claimed asylum. Her claim for refugee status was examined by two independent statutory offices established to consider applications for refugee status and make recommendations to the Minister on whether such status should be granted. These are the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, which considers applications for a declaration of refugee status at first instance, and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, which considers applications for a declaration at appeal stage.</P>
      <P>Ms Okubadejo&rsquo;s application was refused by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and she was notified of this recommendation by letter on 21 November 2001. Her subsequent appeal was refused by the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and she was notified of this recommendation by letter on 30 April 2002. She was notified of the Minister&rsquo;s decision <Col N="207"/>to refuse her refugee status by letter on 29 May 2002, in which she was informed of the three options open to her at that point, namely, to leave the State before her case was considered for deportation, to consent to the making of a deportation order in respect of her, or to make written representations within 15 working days to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform setting out the reasons why she should not be deported and should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.</P>
      <P>Ms Okubadejo lodged an application for leave to remain in the State. In the normal course of events, her case file, including all representations submitted, would be considered under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and under section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended. However, this person claims to be the parent of child born in the State in 1979 when she was previously here with her then husband for business purposes.</P>
      <P>On 22 March 2005, she applied for permission to remain in the State under the revised arrangements introduced by the Minister for the consideration of applications for permission to remain in the State made by the non-national parents of Irish-born children born before 1 January 2005.</P>
      <P>The details of the revised arrangements were publicly announced on 15 January 2005 and the deadline for submission of applications under the scheme was 31 March 2005. Application forms and explanatory leaflets were made available from 21 January 2005 at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform office at Burgh Quay in Dublin as well as at Garda district headquarters stations outside the Dublin area. They were also available at accommodation centres of the reception and integration agency as well as from a range of non-governmental organisations. An information notice was also published in the national press.</P>
      <P>The application form required applicants to provide personal details, immigration history, other identities used in the State and details of their Irish-born children. The form also included a statutory declaration to be signed by the applicant to the effect that, if granted permission to <Col N="208"/>remain, the applicant would not engage in criminal activity and would make every effort to become economically viable, and accept that there is no entitlement to family reunification. The applicant was also required to provide, among other documents, an original passport or national identity card, original birth certificate for the Irish-born child and two passport size photographs.</P>
      <P>Those granted permission to remain will be allowed to remain for an initial period of two years. During this period they will be permitted to work or to engage in business in the State. They will be expected to make every effort to become economically viable during this period. The renewal of their permission, which may be for a further three years, will be subject to their being economically viable.</P>
      <P>By 31 March 2005, the deadline for receipt of application forms under the scheme, more than 17,800 applications had been received and almost 4,000 permissions to remain have been granted. It is intended that all these claims will be processed by the end of June 2005. Each application will be considered on its merits and will be subject to a rigorous examination. Applications will in general be processed in the order in which they were received.</P>
      <P>The woman who is the subject of the Adjournment matter made her application for residency under these arrangements on 23 March 2005. Given the number of applications being processed, it will take several weeks before the processing of her application will be completed. I am sure all the factors will be taken into consideration and I hope a decision can be reached in the not too distant future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for the response. I am confident that a favourable decision will be reached by June. The Minister of State has stated that the woman must become economically viable during the period and I have no doubt she will. She is a qualified nurse who is extremely anxious to work as a nurse in the midlands. She will make a valuable contribution to the local community once she is allowed to do so.</P>
