	<P>I have received notice from Senator Henry that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children to take action regarding the inordinate delays in genetic testing at the national centre for medical genetics, Our Lady&rsquo;s hospital, Crumlin, given that breast cancer test delays can be more than one year, despite the fact that more than &euro;2 million has been given to the centre recently by her Department although a cap on staffing in the hospital means these funds cannot be used.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Order of" RHead="Business">
    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, a referral motion whereby the subject matter of Nos. 10, 11 and 12 on the Order Paper will be referred, without debate, to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children for consideration. The proposed amendments in respect of the risk equalisation scheme involve the inclusion of a provision that specifically recognises the Health Insurance Authority&rsquo;s powers of interpretation and clarification to three existing definitions. In respect of the open enrolment regulations, the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2001 provides for the extension of the right to take out health insurance to persons of all ages. Previously there was no obligation on insurers to cover persons aged 55 and over who were not renewing cover. The minimum benefit regulations update references to the proposed open enrolment regulations and, similarly, provide for the term &ldquo;relevant health services&rdquo; replacing &ldquo;ancillary health services&rdquo;; No. 2, motion re the operation of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998, to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude <Col N="1830"/>not later than 12.15 p.m. with each spokesperson having ten minutes; and No. 3, Air Navigation and Transport (Indemnities) Bill 2005 &mdash; All Stages, to be taken between 12.15 p.m. and 2 p.m. Spokespersons will have 12 minutes and other Senators eight minutes on Second Stage with the Minister to be called on to reply not later than five minutes before the conclusion of Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>My party is concerned about No. 2 on the basis it was not originally scheduled to be taken before the Air Navigation and Transport (Indemnities) Bill and our justice spokesperson has not had an opportunity to research the motion. Will the Leader consider taking the Bill first to give our spokesperson an opportunity to conduct some research into the motion?</P>
      <P>Yesterday reference was made to the National Roads Authority&rsquo;s policy on service stations on new motorways. The sentiment of the House was that it was an unwise policy. The NRA&rsquo;s annual report states service stations should not be built beside motorways. The distance between Portlaoise and Dundalk is 150 km and no service station has been built on the route. The national roads policy is contradictory in that towns are bypassed while filling stations are not built on motorways, which means juggernauts are forced to stream through small towns. The NRA should rethink the policy and examine the German experience of filling stations at least every 16 km along roads that are more modern than ours. These would be the sentiments of the House in advance of the NRA&rsquo;s meeting today.</P>
      <P>An important European summit is taking place over the next few days, which will mainly examine the seven year budgetary strategy. We would all concede that the constitution has taken a battering on the basis of its rejection by the French and Dutch populations. It seems that Britain, the Czech Republic, Denmark and even Ireland may reject the constitution. Luxembourg also has reservations. It is, therefore, time for a reflective phase in Europe. I do not share the optimism of Ministers that we could proceed with the referendum and ratify the constitution after the rejections in France and Holland. We must park the matter for a period and determine whether sentiments on the issues that made people vote against the constitution could shift in Europe.</P>
      <P>An important decision is being taken in the budgetary strategy meeting. Britain and France are rowing about the annual rebate Britan receives, arising from an agreement entered into in the time of Margaret Thatcher back in 1984. Britain receives two thirds of the funds it gives Europe on an ongoing basis because it did not feel it was the beneficiary of agricultural subsidies at the time. We have progressed since then. Britain is maintaining this type of policy and says it will not budge unless those subsidies are reduced. I remind Members that we met yesterday with representatives of a farming body in Buswells Hotel, who indicated the crisis in the <Col N="1831"/>dairy industry. These types of prices will become binding if Britain gets its way in Europe. It is time for reflection on the European constitution and the Government must consider whether it will go ahead with a referendum. If it does, Ireland may get a bloody nose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be worthwhile for the House to give some consideration to discussing the early section of the Constitution, which determines the name of this country. I was reared in a house where it was thought to be demeaning for people of other countries, particularly our next door neighbours, to refer to us in English as &Eacute;ire. &Eacute;amon de Valera when Taoiseach introduced a Constitution that outlines the name of this country as &Eacute;ire as Gaeilge and Ireland in the English language. He ensured this was so in all activities of the State and that we were not referred to as &Eacute;ire at all. Is this constitutional precedent being ignored? Is it constitutional that we are now changing the names of towns against the will of people who do not want them changed? This is a matter we must examine.</P>
      <P>During the discussion with the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, last night, he invited Senator Coghlan and I to table an amendment to the Official Languages Act 2003 to allow people to have a say in changing their areas&rsquo; placenames. The Senator and I intend to do so shortly and look forward to the support of Members from all sides. Considering that the suggestion came from the Minister, although he said he would not table an amendment himself, I presume my colleagues on the Government side will be only too happy to offer support. It is quite ironic that the grandson of the Taoiseach who insisted we be bilingually named should now be ramming one language down people&rsquo;s throats.</P>
      <P>As if this were not sufficiently unprecedented, in terms of how the House operates, I saw three distinct rules of procedure ignored last night when a Member demanded the Minister&rsquo;s speech before it was given to the Cathaoirleach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a long established precedent that the Cathaoirleach gets a copy of the Minister&rsquo;s speech and any other speech at all times. The rules of procedure are clear. If a person even raises an issue or item, it must be presented to the Cathaoirleach. That the same Senator would refer last night to the comings and goings of Members who were attending committee meetings or were in their offices engaging with the debate through their television sets as swanning in and out was astonishing. This is unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>It is also unacceptable that the long-established rota of speakers agreed to within <Col N="1832"/>and between groups should be perverted. People who have been Senators for the past three years should know the rules of the House by now. Perhaps people need to be reminded again but most of us know how the rules operate. If we do not, we ask some of our colleagues who have been here longer. I found last night&rsquo;s events embarrassing and unacceptable and I would like the Cathaoirleach to give a ruling on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>For the information of the House, I agree with everything Senator O&rsquo;Toole has said. A Minister&rsquo;s speech cannot be given to the Chair or to Members until he or she has commenced the speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I am quite concerned about comments the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, made yesterday when drawing from a position document launched by the National Council on Aging and Older People. The Minister is examining the area of pensions with a view to reforming it, which is a good idea. He goes on to say that, in some countries, the State operates a deal whereby parts of the properties owned by older people are mortgaged and the returns supplement their pensions in old age.</P>
      <P>We live in a country that has one of the highest concentrations of home ownership in the European Union. Everybody&rsquo;s home is their castle. People in retirement are entitled to own their houses, to belong and to have the natural benefit of owning all their properties. I am unsure that allowing mortgage companies to enter into agreements and deals with older retired people to supplement their income by virtue of mortgaging parts of their properties is a good idea. I am very concerned about this. Knowing this country&rsquo;s financial institutions and the manner in which they have operated in recent years, it would be worrying as this particular section of society would be open to significant exploitation by the mortgage companies.</P>
      <P>I agree with the leader of the Fine Gael group today when he points out that the NRA needs a significant shift in focus in terms of its policy concerning filling stations on motorways. We have learned from the UK&rsquo;s experience that filling stations serving the driving public are very beneficial and have proven to be an important part of general road safety. In this day and age, it is ludicrous that there is a 150 km stretch around this city from Portlaoise northwards without filling stations readily accessible to people.</P>
      <P>We had an important debate on the matter of Sellafield recently. I made a point during that debate and will continue to make it. When the Taoiseach is discussing the Northern Ireland peace process with Northern parties and when this issue is on the political radar, it is an opportunity to raise the continuing concerns of those in this country surrounding the ongoing situation at Sellafield. The recent leaks there are very worrying for people, particularly those on the eastern <Col N="1833"/>seaboard of this country. There is potential in the context of the Northern Ireland discussions for this important issue to be raised and pursued by the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>As we approach another European summit, a vital matter is affecting Irish farmers, namely, the &euro;95 million special beef premium through which the European Union now wants to financially penalise them. When we were pushing the second Nice treaty, which was discussed in this House, one of its main selling points was that the former Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, was attending important CAP reform negotiations in Brussels and that if we rejected the treaty, we would be jeopardising the future of Irish farming. The former Agriculture Commissioner, Franz Fischler, gave a commitment in this building to the Irish nation that when we signed up to the CAP, we would not lose financially as a result. A U-turn is clearly on the horizon. When the present Minister, Deputy Coughlan, goes to Brussels and when the Taoiseach attends the European summit, I urge them to raise this issue and to fight for a good deal for Irish farmers. They must fight to retain the <i>status quo</i>, which is all we are looking for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to pick up on the point that has just been made. I was encouraged yesterday to hear the Taoiseach say that the Common Agricultural Policy would be defended. It would be utterly wrong if the policy were to be sacrificed on the altar of trying to find a financial settlement to overcome some of the difficulties that are besetting the Union at the moment. A painful and difficult deal was done and the Minister for Agriculture and Food at the time should be congratulated on the way he made it and on the outcome for Irish farmers and farming in the Union in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be wrong for the CAP, having been so difficult to negotiate, to be up for grabs again. We must be quite emphatic about this and support the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture and Food in everything they do. I also note that the French Government has taken a similar position on the matter and I hope that position will prevail.</P>
      <P>Senator Finucane raised the issue of roads and I note that the last service station, if one is travelling south from Dublin towards Naas, is at Kill, beside Goffs. The next station on the Cork road is at Abbeyleix and the next one on the Limerick road is at Mountrath. There seems to be some disconnection between the National Roads Authority and common sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>They got a divorce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>It will only take a few vehicles stopping on a high quality, fast motorway because they have run out of fuel for a serious accident to <Col N="1834"/>occur. Then we will clamour in this House for a solution to be found to the problem. The solution should be found now before something like that happens. I recommend to the Leader that we have a debate on the role of the National Roads Authority and on roads policy generally.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Professor Drumm on his appointment as chief executive of the Health Service Executive and I hope reforms will lead to the world-class service that we all aspire to and deserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday I raised the issue of the National Roads Authority and its policy of opposition to every application to develop service stations along national motorways. This policy was published in the authority&rsquo;s annual report and confirmed on radio yesterday by the head of corporate affairs, Mr. Michael Egan. Today we have learned that the NRA has had discussions on the provision of six service stations on one route and is in negotiations with private interests for the provision of rest and service facilities.</P>
      <P>There is something seriously wrong with a national agency that states one day that it will object to the development of service stations and later on the same day states that it is in negotiation with private enterprise on the provision of such stations. It is a clear example of the fact that the NRA makes up its policies as it goes along. That is one of the reasons there are such enormous overruns in many of the estimates for the provision of infrastructure. I support Senator Dardis in his request that the Minister of Transport comes into the House to outline his direction to the NRA in the provision of infrastructure and allied services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>As with previous speakers, and Senator Finucane in particular, I hope the European Council will reach a consensus on an approach to the ratification of the constitution for Europe and restore confidence in the way forward on that and other matters. There is no question of other member states, not just Ireland, France, Germany and others, agreeing to a renegotiation or dismantling of the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
      <P>It ought to be observed that when this question has arisen in the past, the strongest opponent of reform of the CAP was the British Government because it always represented the interests of the largest farmers, those who collect &euro;2 million or &euro;3 million in subsidies. When reform was discussed in the past, the emphasis was on maintaining the social fabric of the countryside and the viability of medium and small farms. To be frank, the British have no credibility on this subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>Over a year ago a group of clinical microbiologists sent a short paper on MRSA, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, infec<Col N="1835"/>tion to the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin. It contained a number of suggestions on how the infection could be tackled. Regrettably, Ireland has once again appeared at the top of the list in Europe for rates of MRSA infection, according to a report published earlier this week. The Irish rate is 2.5 times greater than that of the next country on the list, Portugal.</P>
      <P>No action has been taken on the paper submitted by the microbiologists, although they did meet the former Minister approximately three weeks before he left office. I realise the current Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, has a lot on her plate, but this is a serious issue. People are dying because of this infection. I urge the Leader of the House to invite the Minister to the House to explain why this issue is not being addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Members on both sides of the House in their call for a debate on matters pertaining to the NRA. Senator Ulick Burke&rsquo;s use of the word &ldquo;direction&rdquo; is appropriate. Ministers should direct the NRA. There is a glaring need for rest and service facilities and, as Senator Dardis and others have pointed out, an accident is waiting to happen. It is only a matter of time. This is a problem that emanates from giving an entity too much power. Some degree of political power must be retained and while some will criticise when that is done, this is a clear example of how useful political power can be in certain circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Henry&rsquo;s call for the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House to debate health issues and, in particular, MRSA. Several Members met with a group of cystic fibrosis sufferers in Buswells Hotel yesterday and we were appalled to hear that people with this condition are likely to die in Irish hospitals, particularly in Dublin, because of the presence of MRSA and their low levels of immunity. Last week I was contacted by a person from north Tipperary who was due to go to Dublin to undergo tests. However, that person was advised not to go because of the danger posed by MRSA. That is a serious situation, which is why I support the call for the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House and outline her plans to deal with this problem. I urge the Leader to also ask if the Minister would consider providing automated external defibrillators to community groups and sporting organisations. Perhaps she could make grant funding available to organisations which wish to install such equipment. While I welcome the appointment of Professor Drumm to the HSE, who obviously got all that he wanted, he needs to tackle basic cleanliness and hygiene in our hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Several days ago, I raised the question of contaminated water in a number of towns <Col N="1836"/>around the country. I have since learned that the situation is far worse than I originally believed. I made specific reference to Tyrellstown, in the Fingal County Council area, where a water problem arose last weekend which was not resolved until Monday. Last night, I was notified by the council that the water in Tyrrelstown is once again contaminated and cannot even be used for washing at present.</P>
      <P>I ask if the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will come to the House to tell Members whether this problem is endemic throughout the country or one that has only recently arisen. Perhaps we always had this problem but now that we have become more vigilant we are more aware of it. This problem is causing great concern because people suspect we are not aware of a problem in other areas only because it has not been detected yet.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I wish to add to the very strong point made by Senator Henry about MRSA. I read in an article that hospitals in Great Britain have installed something like a bed washing machine, which is akin to a car wash, thereby allowing every bed to be washed before it is used by a new patient. By doing this, hospitals have reduced the incidence of MRSA by an enormous degree, I understand the figure was 75%. The incidence of MRSA is a solvable problem. It is simply a question of having the determination to reduce its incidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the arguments made by various speakers regarding the farming industry and the various price support mechanisms from Brussels. Those of us who attended the various meetings yesterday with the agriculture organisations which called upon politicians noted the sense of despair that is now prevalent in Irish agriculture. It is over 12 months since I called for us to initiate a series of debates about the future of Irish farming. The problem was serious at that stage but it is now even more serious.</P>
      <P>Statistics clearly show that unfortunately, young people are leaving farming. If we want to ensure there is a productive and viable Irish agriculture sector, we must ensure that young people see a future in it. There must be political leadership on this issue. It is not simply a question of trying to agree a set of financial packages at EU level. The Government and the political leadership must show a strong renewed interest in the future of Irish agriculture. We must demonstrate to young farmers that they can have a future and a future livelihood in farming. This House could play a valuable role and I ask the Leader to set up a series of discussions so we can initiate real debate on the future direction of Irish farming and the role of young people in agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>We had the debate on the Morris tribunal last night and in recent weeks we have had debates regarding the Supreme Court decision on nursing home charges and serious management failures within nursing homes. The <Col N="1837"/>report of the Comptroller and Auditor General has also highlighted serious management deficiencies within the public service. I ask the Leader to consider having a debate in the House on enhancing management and competence within the public service and achieving value for money. It is time that a Ministry was put in charge of this issue. It is one of the serious failings within the public service, which appears to be accelerating, and I would like a debate on the matter in this House. Perhaps we might initiate a campaign in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call made by Senator Finucane and others regarding our farming community. As has been stated by many speakers, including Senator Dardis, those of us who attended the meetings yesterday took up what was said at them. It is very important that we support the Taoiseach and that he manages to hold the line because we do not need to see our farmers suffer anymore. There is a great threat there. I also take on board Senator Mansergh&rsquo;s argument about the lack of credibility in the UK on this issue.</P>
      <P>I strongly support the remarks of Senator O&rsquo;Toole because all we were doing and want to do is to follow the prime example given by the former Taoiseach and President, &Eacute;amon de Valera, when he introduced the provision that the country would be called &Eacute;ire as Gaeilge and Ireland in English. All we are seeking is bilingualism. In view of this we will, as suggested by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, introduce the necessary amendment to the Official Languages Act. I hope there will be all-party agreement to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We will await the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon"><NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to consider having a debate on the EU budget. There is no rush because, as I understand it, the auditors have refused to sign off on the accounts for the last seven or eight years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>What?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon"><NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
	<P>While it is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, the Leader might invite one of our own auditors to the House to explain this. It is a very serious matter. If any other organisation or company&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think Senator Lydon is completely in order in referring to auditors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon"><NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair does not think it has been signed off on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no opinion on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon"><NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
	<P>I will leave it at that.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1838"/>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should not pre-empt the decisions of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon"><NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
	<P>We will not invite anyone but perhaps we could have a debate on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support paying farmers compensation with regard to the beef overshoot. The Minister for Agriculture and Food is doing her best in this regard and farmers have cross-party support in the House.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach met with the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, Dr. Ian Paisley, yesterday. A very inappropriate statement was made to the effect that the Taoiseach should keep his dirty hands away from the North. This House would not agree with these sentiments and wishes the Taoiseach well in his negotiations on the most serious issue that Ireland has faced over the years. The statement was inappropriate and should be counterbalanced by support for the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The acting leader of the Opposition, Senator Finucane, referred to the short notice that the Fine Gael spokesperson received in respect of the motion on the Offences against the State Act 1998. The schedule for the week was issued Thursday two weeks ago and again on last Friday. It was indicated on both schedules that this motion would be debated today. The fact that the motion is now the first rather than the second item for debate should make no difference. It is ludicrous to suggest that the Fine Gael spokesperson would not have enough time to study the motion and I expect the spokesperson to make wise and interesting statements on the matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Finucane also raised the issue of the NRA&rsquo;s approach to service stations. The NRA has handled the issue in a brazen manner. Following the Order of Business yesterday I contacted the authority and left a message that we were very annoyed about what had happened, particularly with regard to the interview given by the NRA spokesman on RTE radio when he made it clear that there would be no service stations on motorways and that motorists would have to go into towns and villages for rest breaks. Now, the authority is saying there will be service stations on motorways and that it is negotiating to acquire sites. This is an amazing <i>volte-face</i>.</P>
      <P>Senator Finucane also raised the issue of the European constitution and said there should be a reflective phase for other nations and that the constitution should be parked for a period. I agree with the Senator&rsquo;s argument. Senator Finucane also called for a debate on agriculture. I agree that we should endeavour to get the Minister for Agriculture and Food to come to the House for a short period. There is strong pressure on time in terms of legislation but we should endeavour to get the Minister here for a short debate.</P><Col N="1839"/>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred to the Constitution and how the country is called &Eacute;ire as Gaeilge and Ireland in English, which is a fair argument. He spoke about how President de Valera introduced this provision in the 1937 Constitution. I was told about the debate here last night and I heard a good portion of it. The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs suggested that the two estimable Members bring forward an amendment to the Official Languages Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I have it before me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased that the amendment will be tabled. I am sure it will stimulate a very good debate in the House.</P>
      <P>Regarding the point made by Senator McCarthy, I was surprised to read that the Minister for Social and Family Affairs said we should all begin mortgaging our homes or part of them. I would advise everyone to hold on to their houses and not to remortgage them.</P>

	<P>Keep a firm grip on one&rsquo;s homestead and do not mortgage it to anybody as it will then be taken over. The Senator mentioned Sellafield. I believe many wrong and noxious things are happening at Sellafield but they are being overlooked because there is so much other business and turbulence at present. The Senator urged that the Taoiseach, when discussing the Northern Ireland peace process with Prime Minister Blair, raise the issue of Sellafield.</P>
      <P>There is probably nobody in the land who does not know about the beef overshoot. I will endeavour to get the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, to come to the House to discuss it. Senator Dardis said Irish agriculture policy should be safe and he noted that the French Government has taken the same position as the Irish Government. He suggested a wide-ranging debate on the NRA and roads policy. He also congratulated Professor Drumm on taking up the position in the HSE. The T&aacute;naiste was due a break and she got one in securing Professor Drumm for the job. We expect great things as a result.</P>
      <P>Senator Ulick Burke raised the NRA matter yesterday, which led to us contacting the NRA. The Senator is correct that it is bizarre that the NRA should say one thing in its report and on the radio yesterday and completely change its mind the following day. Senator Mansergh expressed the hope that the European Council will restore confidence. We share that hope. He also said the Common Agricultural Policy will not be dismantled and that Britain had led the opposition to reform but has now changed. Of course, that is not the issue. This is a useful tool for Prime Minister Blair to get over the difficulty that he could not bring his country into the heart of Europe because the people would not vote with <Col N="1840"/>him on it. It has lengthened his tenure in No. 10 Downing Street. It was always understood that when it was put to the people he would disengage but now he can stay forever because he is seeking to retain the subsidy. He is imitating Margaret Thatcher, which is interesting.</P>

	<P>Senator Henry raised MRSA and the paper which was given to the previous Minister for Health and Children. I hope to get the T&aacute;naiste to come to the Seanad before the recess if legislative matters permit.</P>
      <P>Senator Glynn said that the NRA should be directed in its road policy rather than make policy, which it appears to be doing in a random manner. Senator Coonan referred to MRSA and said that people awaiting tests in Dublin were advised not to go because of the danger of contracting the condition. He asked that automatic defibrillators be distributed to communities. He also welcomed the appointment of Professor Drumm.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn pointed out that the water in Tyrellstown is again contaminated and wondered if contamination occurs more often now or if it is due to better detection of the problem. I do not know the answer but I will endeavour to get the Minister to come to the Seanad to discuss it. Senator Bradford said there is a sense of despair in Irish agriculture and that young people are flocking away from it. However, in times of high economic activity young people tend to leave farming to take up the jobs available. Nevertheless, I agree there should be a debate on agriculture and I will invite the Minister to the House for it.</P>
      <P>Senator Jim Walsh referred to the Morris tribunal and the nursing home scandals and suggested a debate on enhancing management capabilities and on value for money. It is difficult to get a Minister to take up that matter because it is not the remit of any single Minister. The Senator suggests it should be. We look forward to seeing the amendment to the Official Languages Act from Senator Coghlan and Senator O&rsquo;Toole. Senator Coghlan issued a great rallying cry, which will be useful when we have that debate. Senator Lydon sought a debate on the European Union. We are not allowed to mention other matters.</P>
      <P>Senator Feighan raised the beef overshoot and spoke about the need for compensation. I welcome his nice remarks about the Taoiseach. I did not like to see the headline referring to the &ldquo;dirty hands&rdquo; remark by Dr. Paisley. I will convey the Senator&rsquo;s good wishes and, in the interests of maintaining good relations, we will forget that Dr. Paisley made that nasty remark.</P>

      <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann resolves that sections 2 to 12, 14 and 17 of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998, No. 39 of 1998, shall continue in operation for the period of 12 months beginning on 30 June 2005.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P el="0">I am speaking on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Michael McDowell, who is attending a funeral following a family bereavement.</P>
      <P>The resolution under consideration in the House seeks approval for the continuance in force of those sections of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 which would otherwise cease to be in operation on 30 June. In commencing the debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Senators will recall that the 1998 Act was enacted in the aftermath of the Omagh bomb of August 1998, which claimed the lives of 29 innocent people and injured more than 200 others. That appalling act of barbarism continues to reverberate through the years and I am pleased to note that charges have recently been brought against a person in Northern Ireland relating to these murders. The investigation into this atrocity continues on both sides of the Border and there continues to be excellent co-operation between the Garda authorities and the PSNI in this regard.</P>
      <P>It will also be recalled that, in recognition of the exceptional circumstances surrounding the enactment of the 1998 Act, there was general agreement that the Act should be regularly revisited by the Oireachtas. The purpose of this recurring Oireachtas scrutiny is to ascertain if the <Col N="1842"/>circumstances prevailing in 1998 justify the continuance in force of its provisions. Accordingly, by virtue of resolutions passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas on 15-16 June 2004, sections 2 to 12, 14 and 17 of the 1998 Act will cease to operate on and from 30 June next. That is, of course, unless a further resolution is passed by each House authorising the sections to continue to operate for a period not exceeding 12 months.</P>
      <P>In addition, there is a requirement in the 1998 Act to lay a report on the operation of the Act before each House of the Oireachtas prior to any consideration by the Houses of the renewal of the provisions. Such a report was laid before this House last Monday by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The conclusion of that report is that the relevant sections of the 1998 Act should remain in force for a further 12 months. In the first instance, this is the firm view of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which considers the Act to be vital legislation in the continuing fight against terrorism and which considers it to be of paramount importance that the relevant provisions remain in operation.</P>
      <P>Second, the harsh reality is that, despite the democratically expressed wishes of the people North and South of the Border, those responsible for the Omagh bomb continue to pursue, plan and promote a campaign of violence. In this regard, it must be remembered that there have been a number of &ldquo;near misses&rdquo; involving the Real IRA and the Continuity IRA since Omagh and it is only through dint of excellent police work by the Garda and the PSNI that further tragedy on a massive scale has been averted.</P>
      <P>The new and more sinister forms of international terrorism, particularly Islamist terrorism, have been brought home to Europe with the Madrid bombings of 11 March 2004, involving the murder of 200 innocent commuters. The Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005 was enacted last March to deal with this international terrorist threat by enabling the application of the Offences against the State Acts against international terrorist groups and individuals. Chipping away at these Acts would be neither wise nor warranted.</P>
      <P>I will now turn to the individual sections of the 1998 Act this House is being asked to continue in force for a further 12 months. First, dealing with those sections of the 1998 Act that were used since the end of the last reporting period, that is, from 1 June 2004 to 31 May 2005, the following is the case. Section 2 was used on 30 occasions. By way of explanation, section 2 provides that where, in any proceedings for membership of an unlawful organisation, the accused failed to answer or gave false or misleading answers to any question, the court may draw such inferences from that failure or from the furnishing of a false or misleading reply as appear proper. However, a person cannot be convicted of the offence solely on an inference drawn from such a failure.</P>
      <P>Section 3 was used on one occasion. By way of explanation, section 3 provides that, in proceedings for membership of an unlawful organis<Col N="1843"/>ation, the accused must give notification of an intention to call a person to give evidence on his or her behalf, unless the court permits otherwise.</P>
      <P>Section 4 was also used on one occasion. This section amends section 3 of the Offences against the State Act 1972 in such a way as to expand the definition of &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; that can be considered as evidence of membership of an unlawful organisation. Specifically, &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; can now include matters such as &ldquo;movements, actions, activities, or associations on the part of the accused&rdquo;. This change simply aligns the definition of &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; in the 1972 Act with the reference to movements, actions, activities or associations used in section 2 of the 1998 Act.</P>
      <P>Section 5 was used on 20 occasions. This section provides for the drawing of adverse inferences in the prosecution of a person for any offence under the Offences against the State Acts, any offence scheduled under the Acts, and any offence arising out of the same set of facts as such an offence, provided the offence carries a penalty of five years&rsquo; imprisonment or more. The effect of this section is to allow a court to draw inferences where the accused relies on a fact in his or her defence that he or she could reasonably have been expected to mention during questioning or on being charged but did not do so. As with section 2, however, a person cannot be convicted of the offence solely on an inference drawn from such a failure.</P>
      <P>Section 7 was used on two occasions. This section makes it an offence to possess articles in circumstances giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that the article is in possession for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of specified firearms or explosives offences.</P>
      <P>Section 9 was used on 69 occasions. This section makes it an offence to withhold information which a person believes might be of material assistance in preventing the commission by another person of a serious offence or securing the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of another person for such an offence.</P>
      <P>Section 10 was used on five occasions. This section extends the maximum period of detention permitted under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act from 48 hours to 72 hours, but only on the express authorisation of a judge of the District Court. In this regard, the judge must be satisfied, on the application of a Garda officer not below the rank of superintendent, that the further detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence concerned and that the investigation is being conducted diligently and expeditiously. The person being detained is entitled to be present in court during the application and to make, or to have made, submissions on his or her behalf.</P>
      <P>In the reporting period in question, an extension was applied for in five cases, and all these applications were granted. Charges resulted in <Col N="1844"/>four of these cases, with the fifth resulting in a file being sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
      <P>Section 11 was used on two occasions. This section allows a judge of the District Court to permit the re-arrest and detention of a person in respect of an offence for which he or she was previously detained under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act but released without charge. This further period must not exceed 24 hours and can only be authorised in circumstances where the judge is satisfied, on information supplied on oath by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, that further information has come to the knowledge of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na about that person&rsquo;s suspected participation in the offence.</P>
      <P>Section 14 was used on 99 occasions. The effect of this section is to make the new offences created under sections 6 to 9 and 12 of the 1998 Act scheduled offences for the purposes of Part V of the 1939 Act. This means that persons suspected of committing these offences are liable to arrest under section 30 of the 1939 Act.</P>
      <P>I now turn to those sections of the 1998 Act that were not used in the period under report, namely, sections 6, 8, 12 and 17. Section 6 establishes the offence of directing, at any level of the organisation&rsquo;s structure, the activities of an organisation in respect of which a suppression order has been made under the Offences against the State Act 1939.</P>
      <P>Section 8 makes it an offence to collect, record or possess information which is likely to be useful to members of an unlawful organisation in the commission of serious offences.</P>
      <P>Section 12 makes it an offence for a person to instruct or train another person in the making or use of firearms or explosives or to receive such training without lawful authority or reasonable excuse.</P>
      <P>Section 17 builds on the provision in the Criminal Justice Act 1994 providing for the forfeiture of property. Essentially, the 1994 provision empowers a court, in its discretion, whenever any person is convicted of an offence, to order the forfeiture of any property in the possession of that person which was used, or intended to be used, to facilitate the commission of the offence. The effect of section 17 is, in the case of a person convicted of specified offences relating to the possession of firearms or explosives, and where there is property liable to forfeiture under the 1994 Act, to require the court to order the forfeiture of such property unless it is satisfied there would be a serious risk of injustice if it made such an order.</P>
      <P>The information on the use made of the provisions of the 1998 Act is based on data received from the Garda authorities and is contained in the report on the Act laid before this House.</P>
      <P>At this point, I should mention the report of the Hederman committee, which was established to review the Offences against the State Acts 1939 to 1998. Of those sections of the 1998 Act on which specific recommendations were made, it should be noted that the Hederman committee <Col N="1845"/>unanimously recommended retention of sections 6, 7 and 12. Moreover, a majority recommended the retention of sections 2, 5 and 9, while the committee was evenly divided in its opinion as to whether section 10 should be retained. A majority recommended the repeal of section 8 of the 1998 Act. The committee unanimously recommended the repeal of section 3(1)(<i>b</i>)(ii) of the 1972 Act, as amended by section 4 of the 1998 Act, but the amendment in question was simply to the wording. The committee also made general recommendations relating to the scheduling of offences, which would have implications for section 14 of the 1998 Act.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, of the 13 sections of the 1998 Act being considered for renewal by this House, the Hederman committee expressed a substantive opinion on eight of them. Of these eight, the committee recommended the retention of seven, either unanimously, by a majority or, in one case, on an even split. Accordingly, although a full consideration of the entire set of recommendations of the Hederman committee remains ongoing, it is clear that little or no change to the provisions of the 1998 Act would, in any case, be warranted.</P>
      <P>In any event, in the past year, the House will be aware that the Minister, Deputy McDowell, has been busily engaged in bringing forward an extensive programme of legislative reform. In the counter-terrorism area, efforts in the past year were focused on enacting the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005, which occurred in March last. Now that this Act is out of the way, a fuller consideration of the entirety of the recommendations of the Hederman committee can proceed, and the Minister intends to bring further proposals to Government in due course.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement remains an ongoing challenge. Recent events in Northern Ireland and this jurisdiction point to the fact that paramilitary organisations are involved in activities of a criminal nature. One cannot ignore the simple fact that there are paramilitary organisations out there committed to the destruction of the Agreement and all other initiatives designed to bring lasting peace to the island of Ireland. As long as there are organisations dedicated to frustrating the will of the people through violence and mayhem, there must be robust counter-measures available to the State. Although the efforts of paramilitary organisations to wreak death, destruction and destabilisation have often been thwarted, we cannot allow the proven successes of the two police services to lull us into a false sense of security about their intentions or their capabilities. Given half a chance, both the Real IRA and the Continuity IRA would gladly bequeath to us any number of terrorist atrocities.</P>
      <P>The Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 is one element of the State&rsquo;s ongoing response to this threat. It is just one element, but to do away with it now would be to weaken, in an irresponsible manner, the State&rsquo;s bulwark against <Col N="1846"/>terrorism. I commend the resolution to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. Fine Gael supports the motion, as it always has since 1998. As the Minister of State said, the amending legislation was introduced in September of that year in the aftermath of the horrific Omagh bombing, the worst single incident in more than 30 years of violence. It was a particular shock, coming within months of the signing of the Good Friday Agreement and its subsequent endorsement by referenda by the overwhelming majority of the people of the country.</P>
      <P>If the Garda authorities believe they need this legislation to assist them in their battle against terrorism, Fine Gael will certainly support that view, as it has always done. There is no doubt terrorism still exists. We have seen the wave of crime in recent months in which paramilitaries are turning to criminal activities, an area we have tried to tackle in other legislation in the past year or so. There is no doubt that garda&iacute; must be given every possible legislative assistance to fight terrorism and curb paramilitary atrocities on all sides. We believe it is necessary with regard to this legislation. We will probably need it for another couple of years, but hopefully not indefinitely. The vast majority of people on this island understand there can be no return to the previous state of affairs. The will of the people will ultimately prevail in terms of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
      <P>My party fully supports the motion, as we have done through the years. It is interesting that the Hederman report is in full agreement with most of the sections that have been mentioned. In that context, we will fully support the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not welcome the extension of these provisions, but I support them. It is unfortunate that circumstances do not allow for the discontinuation of the section. However, I fully support the arguments put forward by the Minister regarding their necessity. We all remember the Omagh bombing atrocity when 29 people were killed in an enormous loss of innocent civilian lives. It always struck me as peculiar, and I could never understand how certain people thought they could attain the unification of this country by killing fellow Irish people. It was a misplaced notion and unfortunately led to much anguish on both sides of the Border, particularly in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I am glad to hear of the excellent co-operation between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI. This is a positive force in combating further acts of this nature and is proving quite effective. It is a pity we do not get reciprocation for our co-operation with the British, particularly with regard to past crimes such as the Dublin and Monaghan bombings which caused the largest loss of life on the island during the Troubles and resulted in the deaths of 34 innocent civilians who were going <Col N="1847"/>about their daily lives in a normal manner. Despite the best efforts of the investigation inquiry set up by the Government and the work of a committee, very little, if any, co-operation was received from the British authorities. It was recognised by a number of committee members in their examination of the inquiry that there appeared to be PSNI co-operation up to a point but that was unfortunately thwarted by the Northern Ireland Office.</P>
      <P>It is also regrettable that we must put such comments on the record of the House, but they need to be said because many people were bereaved and injured and feel quite aggrieved at the failure of legitimate, elected Governments to behave in a way that would conform with proper international standards in this regard. Unfortunately, we have very little evidence of that from our neighbouring island. I have been led to believe there may be further responses coming from those authorities in the near future and I hope there would be a change of heart, even belatedly, to ensure the information that is undoubtedly available in the records would be supplied. In this way, closure can be brought to these events and we can move to a different, newer and better level of co-operation in the genuine understanding that the past has been put to rest, rather than having lingering suspicions that we cannot even now trust neighbouring authorities.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has pointed out that certain sections will cease to operate from 30 June unless there is approval by the Houses to further extend them. That view is also confirmed by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which is supportive and feels it is necessary that powers be extended. We must take account of this support. It was also good to highlight the number of near misses that have occurred. We had a debate here last night which was critical of small sections of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but we should recognise that the force has played a very courageous role in protecting citizens over the years. While there have been breaches, the Garda deserves our commendation and, in certain circumstances, members of the force have paid the ultimate price with their lives in the service of the State and the performance of their duties. We should never forget that and acknowledge their contribution.</P>
      <P>A compelling point with regard to the extension of these powers is the continuing threat of international terrorism. Although there may be some lingering threats of ongoing Real and Continuity IRA activities, these have been fairly well contained through co-operation which is a credit to our security forces. However, the threat of international terrorism has defied containment by the most sophisticated of security systems. Apart from the atrocity of 11 September, we were recently reminded of the threat to Europe by the bombings in Madrid, when some 200 people lost their lives while commuting to work in the morning. We must forever be on our guard against <Col N="1848"/>people who do not in any way discriminate between innocent civilians and their own objectives. Therefore, the continuation of these strong and hopefully effective provisions is necessary. It is important to legislatively equip the forces of law and order to ensure they can effectively combat existing threats. Liberal elements would obviously argue that some of these provisions are very draconian, but they are necessary and people of liberal views would concur.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that section 2, whereby a judge can draw inferences from the failure of an accused person to answer questions, has been used on 30 occasions. This has proved quite effective. The Minister has clearly outlined other instances where judges can take inferences from actions and associations of the accused and from the withholding of information. The Hederman committee was divided on section 10 with regard to the period of detention. It is essential when dealing with hardened terrorists, who have been trained in measures to avoid disclosing information, to give garda&iacute; the powers to detain them for up to 72 hours with a judge&rsquo;s permission in order to obtain information vital to a successful prosecution.</P>
      <P>There is probably no further need for me to comment on the provisions outlined by the Minister. Seven years after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, those of us who cherish the achievement of a united Ireland would see lasting peace as a prerequisite in order to create a climate of greater co-operation and further mutual understanding between both sides of these islands. Some of the intemperate comments one hears from time to time are indicative of that. I hope those who aspire to that particular ideal realise it is only through dialogue, communication, co-operation and working together that we will create the climate where we can come closer in the interests of all the people we serve on the island. I hope the current discussions will lead to that end.</P>
      <P>I remind the republican movement and all participants that we should not see the peace process as an end in itself. Sometimes that is the impression one gets from comments. The peace process is a step on the road to creating the island and the Ireland we all wish to have.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome and support this action to ensure we continue to have the necessary legislation in place to provide as best we can for the security of our State. When the renewal of these provisions is discussed in this House or in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, contributions typically begin with reference to the circumstances in which this legislation was enacted, namely, the Omagh bombing. The House does not need me to set out the awfulness of that atrocity. I wish to address the Minister of State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The House does not need me to set out the awfulness of that atrocity. It is without question so I would rather focus on the contentious issue of whether we need to renew these provisions.</P>
      <P>The valid question of balance between maintaining the security of the State and maintaining appropriate civil liberties persists. Since its establishment in 1976 the Irish Council for Civil Liberties has monitored emergency legislation in the State and has called for its constant review for the purpose of determining if its retention is necessary. There is nothing unreasonable in that request and I welcome today&rsquo;s contributions as part of that process. The council points out that on several occasions international human rights institutions, at the levels of the UN and the Council of Europe, have raised concern at the proportionality of Irish emergency powers legislation. That includes the Offences against the State Act.</P>
      <P>This is a question of balance. The continuing need for these provisions requires a balanced assessment of the continuing threat to the security of our State. I rely on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the first instance to provide that assessment. I thank the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for the report laid before the House last Monday concerning the operation of these provisions.</P>
      <P>I also refer to the conclusions reached last month by the Independent Monitoring Commission which stated they present &ldquo;a disturbing picture of ongoing activity by both republican and loyalist groups&rdquo;. Before focussing on so-called dissident republicans I wish to comment on the Provisional IRA. The report concluded that the level of paramilitary activity was still high despite a downward trend over the past year. The commission found that the IRA continued to recruit and train new members. We must think about this and ask why this is so. Is this not a continuing threat to the security of the State? I noted with some amusement, if not surprise, the contribution on this day last year by a Deputy in the Lower House. The Deputy and his party suggested we should discount the views of the IMC and stated it has no credibility. Perhaps we should trust the security assessment made by him and his contacts or the preferred assessment of his contacts. The Deputy stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">This is supposed to be legislation dealing with an emergency. There is no emergency<?oasys _jy?>. . . . In fact, it has led to the special branch being what it is today, namely, a political police force.</P>
      <P FLI="0">There is no emergency, no threat to the State security. The IMC imagines it, the Garda S&iacute;och<Col N="1850"/>&aacute;na imagines it and, I suppose, the find of 10,000 rounds of IRA ammunition last September was also imagined.</P>
      <P>One must consider the scale of such finds. The arsenals of arms are not the arsenals of petty thieves. According to the IMC the ammunition finds demonstrate, &ldquo;PIRA&rsquo;s continuing efforts to maintain its preparedness&rdquo;. For what is it preparing? I will mention only in passing the Northern Bank robbery, the murder of Robert McCartney, three shootings, six assaults and arson attacks all believed to have involved the IRA. Where are the civil liberties of these victims?</P>
      <P>Regarding the Real IRA the primary basis for these provisions is the continuing threat it poses. I refer to the IMC report of last month. The report states:</P>
      <P LI="1">RIRA has continued to be the most active of the dissident republican groups and has been responsible both for brutal attacks and robbery. It sent explosive postal packages in September 2004 and again in January and February [2005]....it undertook shooting attacks against PSNI stations. It exiled somebody whom it had previously shot. It undertook a number of assaults.....conducted a campaign of hoax and genuine explosive devices at commercial premises... In January 2005 it destroyed a store in Strabane by arson, and in February petrol bombed a person&rsquo;s home. RIRA has also recruited, trained members in the use of firearms and has targeted police officers. It has continued efforts to improve its capacity in the use of explosives. We believe this is the work of an organisation which is ruthless and committed to terrorism.</P>
      <P FLI="0" Just="Left">There have been some arrests of Real IRA members in Northern Ireland and in the South. My central point is that the Real IRA remains a threat to this State. Last Monday five members of the Real IRA were sentenced to jail terms at the Special Criminal Court. Mr. Justice Johnson said the court was satisfied that each of the accused was an active member of the Real IRA, a dissident organisation that is not on ceasefire. The court viewed the charges very seriously. I accept the view of the courts, I accept the view of the IMC and I accept the view of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I reject the contrary views of parties with dubious connections and backgrounds. I am satisfied the balance required between civil liberties and State security has been struck and, accordingly, I support the motion.</P>
      <P>In enacting legislation such as this we should not take from the political efforts made by the Government and the parties in Northern Ireland to secure full implementation of the Good Friday agreement. That is what everyone who believes in true democracy wants to happen. We wish the Taoiseach and the Government continued success in their efforts to bring about the full implementation of the Agreement.</P>

	<P>I thank the House for allowing me to say a few words. I do not propose to speak for long. Like our spokesperson, I regret that it is necessary to renew this resolution but I have no doubt it is necessary. The Minister of State has set out in some detail why that is so and, indeed, active use has been made of the legislation in the past 12 months.</P>
      <P>The days immediately following the Omagh bombing, on 15 August 1998, were among some of the most terrible times in the Troubles. This legislation was a key part of the Government&rsquo;s response to try to stop the continuation of such activity. To date, it has been very effective. I wish to second the warm congratulations that have been offered to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na whose members have managed, so far, to get on top of this threat, which cannot be discounted.</P>
      <P>It is a great pity that, virtually without a scintilla of public support, dissident organisations still attempt to carry out acts of terrorism from time to time. The ideology of the people concerned &mdash; the Real IRA and an associated body, the 32 County Sovereignty Committee&mdash; is riddled with fallacies which have been pointed out publicly. History is moving away from such people who are on the wrong side of history. What inspires their ideology belongs to the past, not the future.</P>
      <P>As Senator Jim Walsh said, those of us who want to see a united Ireland seek that outcome <Col N="1852"/>on the basis of peace and dialogue. It will be achieved by different methods than those that have been attempted in the past. Despite the setbacks that have occurred over the past six months, I would have some hope that we are moving towards a situation where paramilitarism &mdash; certainly in its main manifestations &mdash; is going to dry up. We would all warmly welcome that.</P>
      <P>It is good to see dialogue going on all around. The fact that the Taoiseach met the DUP leader, Ian Paisley, and his colleagues, is far more important than any disobliging comment that may have been made afterwards.</P>
      <P>We must also not lose sight of the fact that paramilitary activity is continuing on the loyalist side. I noted in <i>Daily Ireland</i> yesterday that the east Belfast office of an Ulster-Scots organisation was raided by the PSNI, and that it was managed by a leading loyalist. According to the newspaper report, the searches were carried out by detectives investigating serious crime, just days after UDA people had been arrested and charged with money laundering.</P>
      <P>A former chairman of the Ulster-Scots Agency, who is a member of the House of Lords, has been remarkably zealous in many public statements expressing concern about the methods that we are using to bring all paramilitarism to an end, in so far as it lies within our power to do so. I hope, therefore, that Lord Laird will show the same zeal in asking questions about money provided by both Governments to what is a bona fide and worthwhile organisation &mdash; the Ulster-Scots Agency &mdash; to ensure that none of it has been in some way diverted or used for paramilitary purposes. Since this relates to an agency which Lord Laird headed up until recently, he is uniquely well placed to pursue that matter with the vigour that is characteristic of all his interventions.</P>
      <P>I would like to echo what Senator Jim Walsh said about the unsatisfactory nature of the response to past investigations concerning the Dublin-Monaghan bombings and, in particular, the Finucane inquiry. The British Government will have to do better because these matters will not go away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all Senators for their thoughtful contributions to the debate. In an ideal world this type of legislation would not be necessary. However, as long as there are individuals and groups who are bent on usurping the democratic institutions of this jurisdiction, the State must have the means at its disposal to protect its institutions. We know from bitter experience that these organisations have very few qualms, if any, as to the methods they will employ in the furtherance of their aims.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my opening remarks, we are now also confronted by international terrorism, particularly in the form of Islamic terrorism. On 11 March 2004, Europe learned a hard lesson when 200 innocent commuters going about their <Col N="1853"/>daily business were murdered in Madrid, with many hundreds more being injured.</P>
      <P>The Criminal Justice (Terrorism) Act 2005 was enacted last March to deal with this international terrorist threat by enabling the application of the Offences against the State Acts against international terrorist groups and individuals. Although I do not wish to be in any way alarmist, it would be naive of anyone to think that Ireland does not need to have at its disposal the instruments necessary to fight international terrorism.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>As regards the Good Friday Agreement, Senators will be aware that following the elections in the North of Ireland and in Britain, renewed efforts are now being made at a high level to overcome the well known obstacles to progress. Both Governments are anxious to make headway with the ultimate goal of promoting the full implementation of the agreement. However, notwithstanding the much hoped for progress in the peace process, the fact remains that it will not impact in the slightest on those groups which have never acknowledged the legitimacy of the democratically expressed wishes of the people of Ireland, North and South.</P>
      <?oasys _cl10.7-?>
      <P>As is evident from the report laid before the Houses by the Minister, the provisions of the 1998 Act remain actively in use and are yielding results. Equally, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is clearly adopting a balanced and reasoned approach to the powers at its disposal. As the Garda authorities themselves state, the 1998 Act is regularly used and has proven to be a vital piece of legislation in the continuing fight against terrorism.</P>
      <P>I join with all colleagues in this House in looking forward to a time when the Act will no longer be required. Unfortunately, however, that day has clearly not yet arrived. In the meantime, the State must use all legitimate means to respond to the dissident paramilitary threat.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P><Col N="1854"/>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the House for agreeing to deal with this important emergency legislation at such short notice. The House will recall, following the appalling terrorist attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001, insurers withdrew cover for third party war and terrorism risks at short notice and it was then necessary for governments to provide cover so civil aviation could continue to operate.</P>
      <P>In Ireland we enacted the Air Navigation and Transport (Indemnities) Act at short notice in December 2001. Due to the enormous liability being undertaken by the Exchequer under that Act, it was designed to expire after 12 months unless motions were passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas keeping it in place. Thankfully, commercial insurance became available by the second half of 2002 and it was possible to allow the Act to lapse.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, however, the problem has not gone away. During 2004 it became clear that insurers were very unhappy with the prospect of calamitous claims in the event of a terrorist attack involving the detonation of what is referred to as a &ldquo;dirty bomb&rdquo;. This is a bomb that has been deliberately contaminated with chemical, biological or radioactive material so as to cause widespread damage to people and property.</P>
      <P>The problem for insurers is that an event involving one aircraft or airport would almost certainly give rise to claims under several, perhaps dozens, of insurance policies. Cover for &ldquo;dirty bomb&rdquo; risks is not normally provided in other areas of insurance, such as marine and property insurance. The international insurance industry believes this risk cannot be covered by insurance and must be dealt with at Government level, in the same way as natural catastrophes.</P>
      <P>This matter was discussed on a number of occasions at meetings of the European Commission&rsquo;s <i>ad hoc</i> group on aviation insurance. As might be expected, neither the Commission nor member states were anxious to give any premature signal to the insurers that they would be prepared to take over any part of the insurance risk. Consequently, no action was taken while it was not clear that insurance cover would actually be withdrawn. A key part of the strategy in 2001 had been to encourage the commercial insurers to go back to providing the cover that had been withdrawn.</P>
      <P>At the most recent meeting of the <i>ad hoc</i> group, on 2 June 2005, member states were informed that insurers have now begun to withdraw cover for &ldquo;dirty bomb&rdquo; risks for aircraft hull insurance as renewals fall due. This has already affected the Spanish airline Iberia and the Department has been advised that it will also apply to the Irish cargo airline, Air Contractors, when its policy falls due on 1 July. As a result of this information, the Department immediately set about drafting new legislation to enable the Government to provide indemnities. This Bill is very closely based on the 2001 Act. However, some changes have been necessary to reflect our <Col N="1855"/>experience with that Act and to take account of developments in the intervening period.</P>
      <P>The most significant change arises because this is expected to be a permanent change in insurance conditions. Insurers do not intend to go back to covering &ldquo;dirty bomb&rdquo; risks in the future. Therefore, it is not appropriate for the new Act to have a provision for it to lapse automatically. It is possible that the aviation industry in Europe will establish a mutual insurance fund that will, eventually, eliminate the need for Government support. However, that will take a number of years and may need some further legislation when the exact form of the scheme becomes clear. Also, in view of the fact that this will be a permanent change, the new Bill will allow Government orders and ministerial indemnities to be issued for 12 months at a time. This should significantly reduce the administrative burden for the aviation companies as well as for the Department.</P>
      <P>The other important change is that in 2004 a new European regulation was adopted requiring all but the very smallest aircraft to have insurance, including insurance for war and terrorism risks. This regulation will come into effect on 30 April 2005. In 2001, it was only licensed airlines that were required to have insurance and the 2001 Act did not allow the issue of indemnities to private or corporate aircraft operators. Under the new Bill, it will be possible to issue indemnities for private and corporate aircraft registered in Ireland, as well as for the airlines, airports, ground handling and maintenance companies that received indemnities under the 2001 Act. If we did not extend the legislation in this way, it would be tantamount to a legislative decision to ban all private and corporate aviation. As a consequence of this change, the Bill extends the scope of airports to include all that are licensed for public use by the Irish Aviation Authority. The 2001 Act included only airports with commercial scheduled services. The extension of the definition will include the aerodromes at Connemara, Inisheer, Inishmaan, Inishmore and Weston.</P>
      <P>The new Bill also deals with a problem that emerged under the 2001 Act. Under that Act indemnities could only be issued to businesses that had commercial insurance policies before the cover was withdrawn. In other words, no provision was made for new airlines, or other indemnified businesses, that might commence operation after the withdrawal of insurance. As a result, it was not possible for the Minister to provide an indemnity for a new airline, Skynet. As it happened, Skynet was able to obtain sufficient insurance to allow it to commence operations. As a precaution, and in view of the fact that the withdrawal of cover for &ldquo;dirty bomb&rdquo; risks is expected to be permanent, the new Bill will allow indemnities to be given to new businesses that otherwise meet the criteria for qualifying for indemnities.</P>
      <P>In order to increase the protection for the State, the new Bill contains examples of reasons why the Minister may refuse to grant an indem<Col N="1856"/>nity or may issue a restricted indemnity. In the 2001 Act, while the Minister was under no obligation to issue indemnities, it was not clear why he might refuse an application. The reasons for refusal now include situations where an applicant has not or will not comply with conditions, whether an applicant has paid amounts due to the Minister under the Act, the applicant has all the necessary operating licences, the risk is excessive or it would not be in the public interest to provide indemnities for a particular class of activity, aircraft or applicant.</P>
      <P>In order to avoid any future problems about collecting moneys, it is intended to require payment in advance for the indemnities to be issued under the new Bill. It is not clear at this stage how much revenue will be collected for indemnities under the Bill. Under the 2001 Act, approximately &euro;5.4 million was collected and a further amount of about &euro;2.6 million is the subject of a High Court claim between my Department and Ryanair.</P>
      <P>Section 1 deals with interpretation. Three categories of aviation undertakings who will be able to obtain indemnities are identified, including airlines and operators of private and corporate aircraft airports, aerodromes which are licensed as public service aerodromes by the Irish Aviation Authority and other companies that provide essential aviation services, including baggage handling, maintenance, refuelling and security.</P>
      <P>Section 2 deals with making a state of difficulty order. It and section 3 are the fundamental sections. Section 2 gives the Government power to make an order to declare that a state of difficulty affecting the supply of insurance &mdash; relating to air navigation services &mdash; exists. The requirement for the Government order reflects the enormous levels of indemnity required to provide enough cover to enable Irish aviation continue operation. The maximum period for such an order is 12 months and further orders can be made. It is anticipated that this change in insurance cover worldwide is permanent and this will mean orders must be made for the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>Section 3 empowers the Minister to give or renew indemnities during the course of an order under section 2. Section 4 provides that an indemnity may only be issued in a case where the undertaking requesting the indemnity had insurance immediately prior to the state of difficulty that gave rise to the order under section 2. However, where a new aviation undertaking starts business after the commencement of the state of difficulty order, which normally would have required this cover, an indemnity can be issued for it also.</P>
      <P>Section 5 makes it clear that the Minister is not obliged to give an indemnity and provides that no liability will attach to the Minister if an indemnity is not given or is delayed or is in error. This section appeared as section 12 in the 2001 Act but has been moved in this Bill to make the order of the Bill more logical. While the 2001 Act did not give any examples of reasons the Minister might wish to refuse to issue or to renew an indemnity, <Col N="1857"/>this Bill cites some issues that the Minister may take into account including the following: failure to pay for previous indemnities issued under this Bill; whether the conditions of previous indemnities have been complied with; whether the Minister is satisfied that conditions in an indemnity to be issued will be complied with; whether the undertaking holds all the necessary licences to operate; or if it would not be in the public interest to issue an indemnity having regard to the overall liability under the Bill.</P>
      <P>Section 6 allows the Minister to impose conditions when issuing an indemnity and he may declare an indemnity void if the conditions are not complied with. It is expected that the conditions will include a requirement to comply with whatever conditions were in the original insurance policy and to notify the Minister if an event arises that might give rise to a claim. This section has one additional feature over the 2001 Act. It specifically states in subsection (2) that the Minister may impose conditions for the purpose of reducing the risk of claims arising in connection with the indemnity.</P>
      <P>Section 7 limits the State&rsquo;s liability to whatever limit previously existed under the original insurance cover before the state of difficulty order came into force. Furthermore, when all indemnities are taken together, the State&rsquo;s liability will be limited to &euro;9 billion, the same as in the 2001 Act. The Bill proposes that if the total claims from indemnified undertakings were to exceed &euro;9 billion, the payments from the Exchequer would be a proportion of the claims made. This section complements the provisions of the 2001 Act by providing for the issuing of indemnities for undertakings which were not in business before the state of difficulty order came into force, but which would normally have required this insurance cover if it were available in the market. This lacuna in the 2001 Act became evident when a new airline was established during the period of a state of difficulty order. There was no legal basis for issuing the new airline with an indemnity. As the insurance market was recovering at that time, fortunately, the airline was able to acquire sufficient insurance. As this withdrawal of insurance cover is expected to be permanent, that solution may not be available to newcomers to the market from now on.</P>
      <P>Section 8 limits the period of a single indemnity to 12 months, as I have mentioned. An indemnity may be shorter than 12 months if that is considered appropriate. The period of validation was limited to 31 days in the 2001 Act because the indemnities were seen as a temporary measure. I have said on many occasions that this withdrawal of insurance cover is likely to be permanent. Therefore, the administrative burden faced by the aviation sector and the Department of Transport will decrease because indemnities can be issued every 12 months. It has been deemed appropriate to proceed in this fashion. The Bill will extend the retrospective period back to today&rsquo;s date, 16 June 2005, if charges need to be applied to cover the period of validation of any letters of comfort <Col N="1858"/>issued by the Minister for the period prior to the enactment of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Section 9 allows the Minister to impose charges for indemnities. The charges to be applied for indemnities under the Bill have not been set. Guidelines for charges for indemnities were put in place by the European Council after the passing of the 2001 Act. It is likely that the European Commission will review the guidelines in light of the current situation. Commission officials have indicated that the issuing of indemnities by Governments will not be deemed to contravene the restrictions on state aid. Legislation to that effect is expected to be initiated by the Commission, possibly before the end of July.</P>
      <P>Section 10 provides that the Minister may issue indemnities to Irish licensed airlines, to private and corporate aircraft and to airports and service providers which offer services which are essential to support civil air services. A new provision in this section enables indemnities to be issued to private and corporate aircraft. As recent EU legislation requires such operations to have war and terrorism risk cover, they cannot fly without such cover. They were not previously statutorily required to have such cover, although many of them did have it.</P>
      <P>Section 11 gives the Minister the defences against claims which would have been available to insurance companies if the insurance cover system had remained in place. Section 11(2) ensures that the issue of an indemnity by the Minister does not give additional rights to a person, compared to the rights they would have had if the insurance cover system had continued in force. As I mentioned earlier, this Bill, unlike the 2001 Act, caters for cases in which indemnities are issued for undertakings which were not in business before the state of difficulty order came into operation, but which would normally have required such insurance cover if it were available in the market. Such undertakings would not have had previous insurance on which to base the Minister&rsquo;s defences. In such cases, the Minister&rsquo;s defences are based on the forms of insurance which are normally held by such undertakings in their policies.</P>
      <P>Section 12 requires applications for indemnities to be in the form required by the Minister. It also requires undertakings to provide relevant information to the Minister. Section 13 provides that the insurance Acts do not apply. The application of the Acts would mean that various statutory requirements could arise, which would not be relevant or appropriate for the matters with which this Bill is concerned.</P>
      <P>Section 14 allows the Minister to terminate or suspend indemnities at any time. An indemnity in respect of an aircraft in flight will not be terminated until the aircraft lands safely. If indemnities are terminated, airlines must get their aircraft to land at the nearest airport as soon as possible, unless they are given specific permission from the Minister to fly to another airport. That is another key element in limiting the exposure of the Exchequer.</P><Col N="1859"/>
      <P>Section 15 allows the Minister to reinsure all or part of the liabilities associated with the indemnities, if such reinsurance cover becomes available. Section 16 gives the Minister the power to make payments in respect of claims under the indemnities. Some minor textual changes have been made to the 2001 Act to clarify how claims are to be presented to the Minister. Section 17 provides for the Minister&rsquo;s expenses for the administration of this legislation to be met from the Exchequer. Section 18 provides for the payment to the Exchequer of moneys received under the Bill. Section 19 provides for the Short Title of the Act. I am happy to commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. That it is necessary to introduce a Bill of this nature is a reflection of recent developments. I thank Mr. Miche&aacute;l &Oacute; M&eacute;al&oacute;id of the aviation regulation and international relations division of the Department of Transport for giving Members some helpful briefing documents. Such advance information is welcome when one is speaking on a technical matter such as the Bill before the House. I thank the officials from the Department of Transport for their assistance.</P>
      <P>If we had considered the state of the aviation industry four years ago, we would have been sure that the days of aircraft being hijacked were over. That was before thousands of people were killed in the horrific attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001. The harrowing scenes we saw on television that day made clear to everyone the dangers of international terrorism. Many insurance providers stopped offering indemnities as a consequence of the events of that day. The Government, like its counterparts in many other EU member states, introduced a system of indemnity to compensate for the failure of the insurance industry to offer such a system.</P>
      <P>The insurance industry often demonstrates its importance and strength by picking and choosing the forms of insurance cover it wishes to provide. In this instance, insurance companies decided to withhold cover because they were worried about becoming bankrupt. We sometimes worry about the simple things in life. It would be very serious if a &ldquo;dirty bomb&rdquo; were to spread toxins, etc., and kill many people. We should bear in mind that such an event could also bankrupt the State and many other countries. This is a serious issue. I commend the Minister of State on bringing this legislation to the House. I would like him to give specific details in response to my questions about some aspects of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Air Navigation and Transport (Indemnities) Act 2001 related to airports with commercial scheduled services. I welcome the extended definition in this Bill, which will include the aerodromes at Connemara, Inis O&iacute;rr, Inis Me&aacute;in, Inis M&oacute;r and Weston. Airlines would not be allowed to use such aerodromes if the indemnity was not extended to them. The decision of many insurers to withdraw cover for aircraft hulls will cause many aircraft to be grounded. The <Col N="1860"/>Government had Hobson&rsquo;s choice &mdash; it had to pursue this course of action to provide insurance cover in the interests of the safety of passengers and third parties.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has indicated that a small levy &mdash; a certain percentage of the cost of a flight &mdash; will be imposed on passengers. How expensive will the levy be? What will be the additional cost to passengers? While one cannot put a cost on passenger safety, we need to be given details of the extra levy that will be placed on an average airline ticket. The Minister of State also referred to a sinking fund of &euro;9 billion. I wonder, without having gone through the figures closely, whether it is enough. Will that fund cover all the indemnity? If a &ldquo;dirty bomb&rdquo; explodes over Ireland and leads to damages of over &euro;9 billion, will the Government be able to keep its costs below that level? If we found ourselves in a situation where we could not afford it, would other EU countries, or other countries around the world, help us? It is a serious situation which is more likely to happen in other countries, and we may have to help them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be proportional, but I will respond to the Senator later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill although it is regrettable that we must introduce such legislation. I hope the fund will generate sufficient capital and there will not be serious liabilities. I hope this situation never occurs. We should try to ensure that the war on terrorism, and the awful atrocities that took place, will be a thing of the past. I thank the Minister of State for introducing the Bill, which we will support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I join my colleagues in welcoming the Minister of State to the House, particularly his officials who provided an excellent briefing document on this emergency legislation. It can often be difficult to try to get to grips with such legislation in the time available. Like Senator Feighan, I thank Mr. &Oacute; M&eacute;al&oacute;id and his colleagues in the Department for being extremely helpful to us over the past day or so.</P>
      <P>The speedy passage of the Bill is vital to ensure that commercial air transport, in particular, and private air transport to a lesser extent, will be allowed to operate in an environment where cover is available. This legislation will ensure their trading can continue as soon as the legislation is in place. It is also important to recognise it is retrospective and that the cargo business will be facilitated as quickly as possible. It is currently in a position where it may not be able to put in place the type of indemnities required to continue to operate. I hope the speedy passage of the legislation through both Houses will ensure this cloud of uncertainty is lifted.</P>
      <P>The Bill is technical in nature. It provides a facility for the Minister and the Department to put in place the necessary orders required in respect of the indemnities. The airline business is a particularly difficult business in which to operate. Insurance is a crucial component in <Col N="1861"/>terms of the business model of airlines. It is a significant cost for them, which is no different from the price of oil. Like the price of oil, insurance has tended to fluctuate over the recent years, which can affect the viability of an airline. While a business model for an airline may have been developed over a prolonged period, a situation such as this which arises overnight whereby a reassessment of the risk is carried out by international insurance companies, could throw a particular airline&rsquo;s business model out the window and make it unviable to operate. This is something about which an island nation such as Ireland would have a real concern because we are more dependent on air transport than many European member states. Our colleagues in Europe do not have the same isolated island status we have. Anything that happens in the aviation sector that either has the potential to affect the viability of airlines or has the capability to increase air fares is of crucial importance to us, not just from the point of view of continuing to do business here but, more important, ensuring that our tourism sector, which is a vital component of our economy, is protected.</P>
      <P>I was interested in the comments of the Minister of State on the previous incarnation of the Bill in 2001 in response to the atrocities in the United States and the fact that it is difficult to collect the premium that would accrue to the State as a result of the indemnities that were put in place at the time. I do not want to refer to this aspect because it is <i>sub judice,</i> but we must ensure there is some structure in place for payment in advance, because certain operators will use every possible means to frustrate the State in collecting fees. Certain airlines believe taxpayers should pay for services which contribute to these companies making vast profits. I am sure the Minister of State is well aware of this and he does not need to come to this House to hear about it, but it is worth putting it on the record.</P>
      <P>Insurance companies have assessed the risk in this situation in a different way from what they did in the past. It is understandable in light of what happened in the United States, particularly in regard to the 9/11 atrocities. I am concerned that there has not been anything in terms of terrorist activities in the world in recent months, or in the past year &mdash; obviously we are not part of the information which is shared among police and military sources throughout the world &mdash; that would appear to suggest a background or reason for this decision, other than that the insurance companies assessed the risk and decided not to provide indemnity in this regard in the future. As time moves on, will insurance companies continue to take this approach to certain other identified risks they perceive would leave them open to large claims? Will what we understand to be insurance no longer be just that? Will they cover just certain risks which do not pose a great threat to them, thereby ensuring their profitability is guaranteed? We all understood the principle of insurance to be that insurance companies must also take a risk.</P><Col N="1862"/>
      <P>Obviously it is not a matter for the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department. He is responding to legislation to deal with a problem in regard to airlines, aircraft and companies that operate in and around airports, ground handling and so on. I hope his Department will contact the relevant Minister who has responsibility for the insurance sector. This is something that must be dealt with on the international stage, and probably within the European Commission. I am not clear why an insurance company is now prepared to move aside from this &ldquo;dirty bomb&rdquo; risk, which appears far-fetched compared to the standard risk of an explosion, which may not be a &ldquo;dirty bomb.&rdquo; Given what we know about the materials available to different terrorist organisations throughout the world, it is far more likely a regular bomb would be used. Is it the case that within the next two to three years insurance companies will decide they are no longer prepared to provide this war on terrorism indemnity required under European legislation as a result of a directive which is referred to in the briefing document we received from Mr. &Oacute; M&eacute;al&oacute;id? I hope the Government and the European Commission will act as quickly as possible to ensure this does not happen. There has been a period of relative stability in regard to terrorism around the world, which is why people are curious about the need for this decision by insurance companies.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State addressed the issue of cost recovery. Obviously the charging out to airlines on a premium basis needs to be addressed. There is also a need to force insurance companies who are avoiding this risk to pass on the corresponding reduction in the premium to airlines. This must be investigated to ensure it is passed on to the airlines because no doubt the Minister of State will want to charge the airlines for the indemnities he is putting in place. The recovery of this cost must come from the insurance companies that no longer cover the risk. Someone must deal with this element. I hope the State will be provided with as much revenue as possible to ensure it deals with the potential liability of &euro;9 billion, which is a huge figure in terms of overall Exchequer funds.</P>
      <P>Section 15 addresses the reinsurance issue and the Minister of State referred to the possibility of member states coming together to pool resources to establish a fund in this regard. That is the credible way forward. The potential liability would have an enormous impact on an economy and, hopefully, the EU can expedite such a fund. The Union can expedite various crazy rules and regulations for which none of us has regard.</P>
      <P>However, this is an important issue on which member states can come together to put in place a fund to ensure the risk is spread across the Union. That would give more credibility to what the Union is about and it would give people confidence. It would also go a long way towards giving people a reason to believe there is a need for Europe and help all of us to convince the public during the upcoming debate on the European constitution. Such an issue can highlight the benefits of Union membership, quite apart from <Col N="1863"/>the funding that has resulted over the years. Will the Minister of State comment on the timeframe in this regard?</P>
      <P>Will all member states enact similar legislation? It would be a concern if one or two do not intend to do so because it could mean that private and small airlines could register their businesses in Ireland to benefit from the indemnities. Will the Minister of State make provision to prevent foreign airlines registering in Ireland to avail of the indemnities provided in the legislation or will a ministerial order suffice? The Minister of State set out a number of the reasons he might refuse to sign an order for an airline but it is not clear how he would deal with an airline wishing to fly the flag of convenience of a state to avail of the indemnities. It is unlikely that American Airlines or Alitalia would register in Ireland but private airlines could do so, which would ultimately lead to a greater burden on the State from operators outside the jurisdiction for whom the State should not have to provide indemnity.</P>
      <P>I welcome the legislation. I compliment the Minister of State and the Department on implementing it before the summer and on identifying the issue early to ensure the problem is resolved. A deadline of 1 July has been set for large cargo airlines. I hope it will be quickly signed into law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and I commend him for acting quickly and comprehensively by bringing the legislation before the House. We have had many debates on aviation over the past years and the risks to the aviation sector have been highlighted because of its cyclical nature and the problems associated with investment. However, without the indemnities provided for in the legislation, flights in and out of Ireland could come to a halt. As an island nation, the aviation sector is important. More importantly, we are fortunate that two of the most profitable and successful airlines in Europe operate out of Ireland.</P>
      <P>This legislation is necessary from the point of view of both business and tourism. It is regrettable that it must be brought forward because of the times in which we live. The Government responded responsibly and quickly, given the repercussions of 11 September, when it introduced similar legislation in 2001. I welcome the updating of that Act through the extension of indemnities from one to 12 months, the sunset clause and the extension of its provisions to cover aerodromes, corporate and civil aviation.</P>
      <P>This is a technical Bill and its scope and content is comprehensive in dealing with the challenges set out by the Minister of State. I support it and I hope it will have a speedy passage through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the Minister of State and his officials. This is important legislation. Since 11 September 2001, airplanes have become potential bombs. As a result, they have become a major risk for insurance companies, <Col N="1864"/>which have been sent diving for cover. The legislation will enable the Minister for Transport to issue indemnities to airlines, airports and essential service providers in the wake of the withdrawal by the worldwide insurance market of aviation insurance for damage caused by terrorist activities and &ldquo;dirty bombs&rdquo;, which comprise chemical, biological and radioactive substances and electromagnetic pulses. Since the beginning of June 2005 the insurance industry worldwide has begun to withdraw cover from aircraft hull and it is, therefore, necessary for the Government to enact this emergency legislation to enable aircraft to continue flying.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I have a number of concerns. The Minister of State said the State&rsquo;s liability is limited to &euro;9 billion, which is an enormous amount for a small State such as ours. He also said it is possible the aviation industry in Europe will establish a mutual insurance fund, which will eventually eliminate the need for state support. This should be pursued by the Government as a matter of urgency. This represents too large a risk for the State to undertake and I urge the Minister of State to work with his colleagues in Europe to establish this fund as speedily as possible.</P>
      <?oasys _cl10.7-?>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State and his officials for the work they have put into the legislation. I support its passage through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to welcome the Minister of State. I appreciate the work he is doing on aviation generally. What is the European view on this issue? In the maritime area, a similar scenario occurred and an international fund has been long established. Ireland has had to pursue a number of claims and, although the claims process is slow, the fund is important. An application was made for substantial funding following the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> incident. I am not sure whether the full amount was received but that is a matter for another day. The EU is contemplating a new directive later this year. Where will this legislation fit in that context? It would be important to keep in mind what the EU will do in this area. The Union might establish an international fund that could be drawn from in the event of large claims, such as those contemplated here.</P>
      <P>It is not my wish that the State would take over responsibilities undertaken by insurance companies until now, to which Senator Dooley referred earlier. It would not be proper to expect taxpayers to deal with a situation where insurance companies that have been gaining substantial funding under these policies for many years would now have taxpayers&rsquo; money substituted for theirs. We have seen some such activity regarding consultants in another Department within which the Minister of State had some responsibility not so long ago. The State was expected to step in and pick up a bill where premia had already been paid to companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1865"/>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is fully aware that the reason I am raising this matter is because we do not want a similar situation to occur here. It would be important to have a response from the communities concerned rather than an individual State in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a fair point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a second point. If this type of insurance existed at the time of the Air India disaster off the south-west coast, who would have responsibility for the large insurance bill rising from that incident? I do not wish to anticipate anything but international terrorism has been mentioned. If there were to be a tragic incident between here and the United States through a bombing or mishap, where would Ireland&rsquo;s jurisdiction start and finish? What would be the State&rsquo;s responsibility if something such as this happened within the Irish air navigation system?</P>
      <P>These are some of the issues that must be discussed and dealt with, not at a national but at international level, especially in the aviation business. I strongly recommend that the Department examines funding in the maritime area in this regard to determine how the matter is being addressed there, as it has been dealt with by the International Maritime Organisation for many decades. I am sure the Department has already examined the issue. An international response would minimise the &euro;9 billion burden as we could receive a claim of almost that amount after one incident alone.</P>
      <P>Does this legislation mean in effect that some of the private jets owned by people in Ireland would be covered by insurance provided by the taxpayer? From reading the Bill, I am not sure, as I only glanced through it quickly. I do not want to name any particular individuals and draw the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s rebuke but I could name quite a few wealthy business people who own private jets. From my interpretation of the legislation, would the taxpayers pick up the bill for these indemnities?</P>

	<P>The Senator has one minute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>We should move cautiously, keeping in mind what the communities have done in the absence of European legislation and considering whether we should press this matter at the present time pending whatever initiatives the communities take. I recommend to the Minister of State to go to the European Union in his official capacity on the Council of Ministers and suggest to his counterparts that they might consider introducing an international fund, such as exists in the maritime area, which would indemnify carriers. Many claims could have significant consequences for taxpayers here and could be dealt with at the international rather than national level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their contributions and will try to respond to the questions as they raised. Senator Feighan asked what would be the charge on the airlines and would it be in euro or cent. The charge in 2001 was 30 cent per passenger. No decision has been made but this guideline is in place for the 2005 charge. A question was asked about the figure of &euro;9 billion. The Bill limits the Government&rsquo;s exposure to this amount. If the cost incurred were greater, there would be an international reaction and decisions would then have to be made. No arrangements are in place for other countries to help us. As I indicated and as has been witnessed in the past, there is usually a natural international reaction.</P>
      <P>Senator Dooley asked a range of questions. On the matter of insurers, they have been renewing their risks and monitoring the market since 2001. They have concluded that so called &ldquo;dirty bombs&rdquo; present a risk they cannot sustain because so many people would be affected. The insurers&rsquo; exposure would be too great. Both Senators Dooley and Morrissey asked about ordinary insurance. There is no indication that insurers are considering withdrawing ordinary aviation insurance. The regulation of the insurance industry is undertaken by IFSRA.</P>
      <P>I thank my good friend Senator Wilson for his kind comments on the Bill and for raising a number of issues. I intend to respond to his and Senators Daly and Morrissey&rsquo;s questions together, as they all concern the same issue, namely, the fund itself. From the country&rsquo;s point <Col N="1867"/>of view, the total exposure will be in the amount of &euro;9 billion.</P>
      <P>Senator Daly made some interesting comments and I may take the opportunity to discuss the matter further with the Senator because I am aware that he has an enormous fund of knowledge and experience relating to the marine fund. This is something that we can explore further at a later date. However, there is no aviation fund that would reflect or mirror the marine fund.</P>
      <P>In response to Senator Wilson&rsquo;s question, when the EU pooling scheme commences it may develop along the lines alluded to by Senator Daly. At present the is that the aviation industry will pay for the establishment of the fund, with Government guarantees, until it is large enough to cover the 2001 charge of 30 cent per passenger.</P>
      <P>We will also examine the wider international issues that may have an impact in this area. The Bill allows for indemnity for private aviators but no decision has been made on whether this should be available and in any case, the indemnity will only apply to a small part of the aviation aspect of their insurance.</P>
      <P>Senator Daly made a point relating to a private jet and I wish to clarify the situation in that regard. We must examine the impact that one aircraft may have on an airport, for example, Shannon Airport. We all want to ensure that Shannon Airport continues to operate, develop and accommodate all of the necessary components to make it a viable operation. We cannot debar anyone and we must ensure that appropriate insurance is in place for all who wish to utilise the airport. Should there be a disaster, everybody would then be covered and would be in a position to continue to operate.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with legislation that addresses an important area, given where we are on the world stage, enjoying the fruits of the 21st century and playing such a pivotal role in the global economy. It is important to ensure that the aviation business continues to grow and develop and I know that it is the wish of Members of the Oireachtas that Ireland continues to play a pivotal role, as we have done in the past, in the development of aviation. There are obvious reasons for this wish, not least the fact that we are an island nation.</P>
      <P>I hope that I will not be back in this House explaining the application of this legislation. However, I would welcome the opportunity to return to deal with other issues, including the scourge of international terrorism. It is to be hoped that I, my colleagues in Government and Members of this House will show the courage and strength required to address the course of conflict and the evils that have created some of the concerns that exist regarding international terrorism, as experienced, for example on September 11. Hopefully, such events will never be witnessed or experienced again. Ideally, we will never be in a position where we have to apply the provisions we are putting in place through this emergency legislation. This legislation is a safety net that will <Col N="1868"/>ensure our aviation industry can continue to operate.</P>

	<P>I do not wish to delay the passage of the Bill, but I have certain reservations about this section. I am concerned that this will provide an exemption for insurance companies, where the State is involved. It might be better to have a combination of insurers and the State. I bow to the ministerial advice on this, but removing the insurers&rsquo; responsibility is not the way to proceed. Perhaps we might amend this section at a later stage, but if it is left as it stands, it would provide an open season for insurers to evade, or at least minimise, their responsibilities and liabilities and the onus would be left on the State.</P>

	<P>I appreciate Senator Daly&rsquo;s point but it does not apply to section 13. This section allows for the non-application of the insurance Acts, which means that the various statutory requirements that could arise out of those Acts, which would not be relevant or appropriate to the Minister under this legislation, would not apply. The section is in place to allow the Minister to put the indemnities in place without having to take all of the insurance Acts into account, in so far as he or she does not have to act in the capacity of an insurance company. It prevents a situation where the Minister would have to put in place all the regulations demanded by the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority. Put simply, this section means that the Minister for Transport does not have to act in the capacity of an insurance company.</P>

It is very welcome to see the Department of Transport being able to enact or draft legislation so quickly. We often complain about other Departments and the length of time it takes to bring legislation to this House. It is probably due to a considerable amount of work carried out by a number of people over the past number of days that this element of aviation legislation has been dealt with.</P>
      <P>As a number of Senators noted, aviation is vitally important to Ireland because it is an island and because of its peripheral status within Europe. It is necessary to ensure there is a continuous link with Europe and the rest of the world. I thank the Minister of State for assisting other Senators and myself with the questions we had regarding the Bill and giving assurances relating to the protection of the Exchequer from unnecessary claims at a later stage.

	<P>I welcome the Minister for State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to the House. I know he realises that the issue I am addressing is very serious. Unfortunately, breast cancer is a very common problem in Ireland, with approximately one in ten women being affected by the disease at some stage in their lives. A small number of these cancers are found in families genetically predisposed to getting the disease. Irish scientists have done important work in elucidating the genetics of the disease.</P>
      <P>I spoke about this issue years ago and the problem we faced with a US company called Myriad, which was trying to patent the DNA sequences so it could insist that all tests carried out in Ireland were done through it, for which it would charge a considerable fee. We were at the forefront of fighting this patenting proposal in Europe and, fortunately, we won. Myriad lost most of the cases regarding the patenting of tests for breast cancer. In general, this was due to inaccuracies in the DNA sequencing it put forward.</P>
      <P>Ireland and other countries are in a position to carry out tests for those genetically predisposed to breast cancer. However, it is not possible to carry out genetic testing because there is a cap on staff numbers in Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin, which houses the national centre for medical genetics, which carries out these tests, even though more money than ever before has been spent on cancer genetic services in the centre. This cap applies to the centre, as well as the hospital. Facilities have been put in place there for additional staff, laboratories have been built and consulting rooms put forward but at the same time, there is a deficit of approximately 35 staff who are needed. They include counsellors, consultants and technical staff.</P>
      <P>It is important to remember that these people are urgently required not simply for the service that the national centre for medical genetics was trying to provide itself but also because the private clinic in Galway, which did not have an adequate medical input, was forced to close down earlier this year. Staff at the national centre for medical genetics have been forced to deal with the additional workload created by the Galway clinic&rsquo;s closure while no change has been made to the cap on staff at Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital for Sick Children.</P>
      <P>Breast surgeons constantly contact me to complain about the fact that if they have a patient who they feel is genetically predisposed to breast cancer, they are in no position to get the other members of the patient&rsquo;s family counselled and tested. If a young woman aged around 36 years presents with breast cancer, gives her family his<Col N="1871"/>tory and is discovered to have an aunt who suffered from breast cancer, she, her family and her consultant are very keen to get the family tested as quickly as possible. Those who would need to be tested include the mother and a sibling or siblings, possibly aunts. If an older woman presents with breast cancer, her daughter or daughters may need to be tested. It takes over a year for these people to be given a simple blood test and the results assessed.</P>
      <P>This is extraordinarily unsatisfactory and puts a great strain on all the people involved, including clinical staff. The upshot of this is that tests are being sent to Myriad in the US to be processed at the cost of $3,000 per test. While we won, we also lost because we are unable to carry out these tests in our own country, having put such effort into ensuring that we would not allow patents to go through on what we discovered in this country. We have a person in the national centre for medical genetics putting blood tests into packages and sending them to the US to be tested at a cost of $3,000 per test rather than having some counsellor talking to patients, a technician carrying out the laboratory work in the centre, the Irish public having the benefit of these people working here and the Exchequer getting its taxes.</P>
      <P>This situation is ridiculous and I suggest to the Minister of State that many people would find it ridiculous as well. I ask him to make some suggestion as to how this ridiculous situation can be rectified so tests can be carried out in this country, as they should be. The Exchequer should not have to bear this dreadful cost. Patients are being seriously disadvantaged by the current situation.</P>

	<P>The national centre for medical genetics based at Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin was funded by the Health Research Board in 1998 to carry out a collaborative study on the implementation of testing for hereditary breast cancer in Ireland. This study has established the technology and expertise for screening for mutations in the BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 genes and has provided important information about the frequency of particular breast cancer gene mutations in the Irish population. The study also established expertise in Ireland in assessing and counselling families with hereditary breast cancer.</P>
      <P>Since 2003, a cumulative sum of almost &euro;1.8 million has been allocated for cancer genetic services to the national centre. This includes approval which was given in 2004 to extend the national testing programme at the centre, supported by the appointment of an additional consultant clinical geneticist. The Department of Health and Children is working closely with the <Col N="1872"/>HSE and the national centre to further develop this service.</P>
      <P>The HSE has informed the Department that the national centre is in the process of upgrading its facilities and renewing and modernising much of its laboratory equipment at present. The hospital advertised in 2004 for the post of consultant clinical geneticist and interviews took place in January of this year. However, the hospital was unable to appoint a suitably qualified candidate. It will shortly re-advertise the post of consultant clinical geneticist with a special interest in hereditary cancer and hopes to appoint a suitable candidate towards the end of this year.</P>
      <P>The hospital is currently outsourcing much of its cancer genetics testing internationally and is in discussions with the Health Service Executive about the employment ceiling and the difficulties involved in recruiting staff for the genetics service. The hospital is also exploring the feasibility of outsourcing, as an interim measure, the necessary counselling and backup required for women who have been identified as having an increased risk of breast cancer. These strategies are aimed at reducing the current waiting times in genetic testing.</P>
      <P>Major advances have been made in recent years in cancer genetics. The increasing worldwide understanding of the role of genetics in the provision of cancer care is leading to an increased demand for the development of services in the area. This presents major medical, organisational and financial challenges which need to be addressed to ensure that patients get the highest quality care. The opportunity now exists to bring policy into line with medical advances in the area and to develop cancer genetic service provision.</P>
      <P>A subgroup of the National Cancer Forum on genetics has examined the specific areas of inherited familial predisposition to cancer, cancer risk profiling of persons without inherited mutations and molecular diagnostics and molecular therapeutics. The work of this subgroup has informed the recommendations of the forum in terms of genetics. It is anticipated that the strategy will be completed in the autumn.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I again confirm the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the development of the national cancer genetics service. The Government will continue to work with the Health Service Executive to ensure that the best service possible is made available.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply but this is a chicken and egg situation. We will not get a good consultant clinical geneticist until the service is properly established.</P>
