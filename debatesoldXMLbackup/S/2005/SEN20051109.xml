	<P>I have received notice from Senator Mooney that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to outline the stages the discussions between his Department and RTE are at on the provision of Irish television services to the Irish community in Britain; and if it is his intention to amend the Broadcasting Authority Acts 1960 to 2001 to permit transmission of RTE outside the Republic of Ireland.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Feighan of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to give an update on the submission for a swimming pool in Ballaghaderreen, County Roscommon.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Tuffy of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need to ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to give an update on the application by a person (details supplied) for leave to remain on humanitarian grounds, including her medical condition.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Bannon of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to clarify the position regarding his refusal to grant an orphan&rsquo;s contributory allowance or supplementary welfare allowance to the grandparents of two young children (details supplied).</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Morrissey of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to specify the European directive under which <Col N="1250"/>vehicle heights may be unilaterally reduced by an EU member state, without consultation, in light of the ongoing public debate about access to the Dublin Port tunnel.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Browne of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to clarify the current position concerning the opening hours of primary schools and access by children to the school building before the formal opening time.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Kitt of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to clarify the response on the Government&rsquo;s initiative for the disposal of surplus land for Departments and Government agencies in County Galway for affordable housing.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Coghlan of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to outline the steps he intends to take to ensure a workable telephone service for the people of the Black Valley, Beaufort, Killarney, County Kerry.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by Senators Mooney, Feighan, Tuffy, Bannon, Morrissey, Browne and Kitt as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and I have selected Senators Mooney, Feighan and Tuffy whose matters will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Bannon, Morrissey, Browne and Kitt may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise. I regret I have to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Coghlan as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, the Registration of Wills Bill 2005 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, to be taken at <Col N="1251"/>the conclusion of the Order of Business until 5 p.m., the proposer of the Bill and spokespersons have 15 minutes and other Senators ten minutes; and No. 17, motion 24, to be taken from 5 p.m. until 7 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>As we move this week towards Armistice Day, does the Leader agree that this House support a unanimous motion in the name of the leaders and Members of this House on the case being made by the Shot at Dawn Campaign? This is a group of over 300 families in Britain and Ireland campaigning for a pardon from the British Government for their loved ones who were disgracefully executed for alleged military offences in the First World War. The group involves 26 Irish men, Catholics, Protestants, Unionists and Nationalists, from Northern and Southern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Irish Government has recently been supportive of the Shot at Dawn Campaign, giving an excellent dossier to the British Government arguing for pardons and clemency. This would be an act of reconciliation to people on this island and the over 270 people in England, Scotland and Wales who were executed in such an appalling way. We should remember these people who gave their lives in appalling circumstances in the First World War.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to meet with me and other leaders after the Order of Business to agree a wording that could be put unanimously on the order of the House tomorrow. The campaigners will then know this House fully endorses their work and will ensure that a Labour Government will deliver on this issue. The notion that a Labour Government would not grant a pardon to over 300 people who have been executed in this way is astonishing.</P>
      <P>The House should support this campaign and I intend to raise the matter with the Northern Secretary at the next meeting of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body. Senator Mooney also has a question on the matter. On a cross-party basis we should continue to put pressure on the British Government and I ask the support of everybody in the House.</P>
      <P>On tomorrow&rsquo;s Order of Business, there is considerable interest from all colleagues to speak on the Ferns debate. Does the Leader agree that this should be an open-ended debate for the next number of weeks? The time tomorrow is approximately two and a half to three hours and there may not be an opportunity for everybody to participate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>That is tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps it is not appropriate for me to raise it on today&rsquo;s Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1252"/>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I have raised that matter with the Leader and I agree the debate will require more time if possible. Senator Norris has raised the issue of the Shot at Dawn Campaign several times and will have something to say on it today. It is worthwhile to remind ourselves of the First World War. At the weekend, I heard the story of the last surviving British soldier who played football between the trenches with his German counterparts. He still carries a cigarette box he received as a gift from one of the Germans against whom he was once more engaged in battle the following day. That was not an official ceasefire but something the soldiers on both sides undertook against orders. It corresponds to the point made by Senator Brian Hayes in that these soldiers were acting on conscience. Such people were not cowards and received the support of many, including Thomas Kettle, the Irish intellectual, writer and poet. Many recent books, including Sebastian Barry&rsquo;s <i>A Long, Long Way</i>, nominated for the Man Booker prize this year, and those of Sebastian Faulks deal with the First World War. We must remember and acknowledge what was done in our name.</P>
      <P>Some ten years ago, the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, came to this House and proposed a Bill to create a national monument of na Blascaoid &mdash; An Blascaod M&oacute;r, go d&iacute;reach. Idir an d&aacute; linn, bh&iacute; deacrachta&iacute; ann, but it did not become a national monument because there was a challenge in the courts. Yesterday, however, I was taken aback to discover that a question answered in the other House indicates that the Government has no plan to declare the Blasket Islands a monument. Notwithstanding that the relevant legislation has been struck down, this seems to reflect a major turnabout in Government policy.</P>
      <P>In this regard, I would appreciate a discussion with the Office of Public Works about developments on the islands. According to information imparted yesterday in the D&aacute;il, it seems the OPW plans to buy the land, thus bringing it into State ownership. What is the intention if it is not to become a national park? There are certain monuments there, including the home of Peig Sayers, which must be considered. Will the Leader clarify the situation regarding the new report on the management of the island? I understand it will be presented to the Government but has not been agreed to by all the stakeholders and landholders on the island. I call for a discussion with the OPW on the Government&rsquo;s proposals for An Blascaod M&oacute;r as seo amach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I draw the Leader&rsquo;s attention to a nationwide poll on child care featured in today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Examiner</i>. As the mother of a young child, whose partner minds our child in the home, I identify strongly with this issue. The poll finds that in a high percentage of families, one parent <Col N="1253"/>cares for children in the home. Another significant finding is that four out of ten couples with two children believe the birth of a third child would necessitate the withdrawal of one parent from the workforce. Such parents must weigh up the costs of child care before making a decision on having any more children. The survey also finds that approximately two thirds of women leave full-time employment once they start a family. Some 20% of child care is carried out by family members, most often grandparents, in the home.</P>
      <P>Of particular significance is the finding that 84% of parents surveyed believe the Government has failed to address the issue of child care. This poll endorses the policy document launched recently by my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Meara, which promotes the idea of choice and support for parents, irrespective of the choices they make in terms of care arrangements. I call for a debate on this issue, notwithstanding the awareness that, in approximately 18 months&rsquo; time, the Government will be in power for ten years. It has done nothing to address this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>We will not be able to help Senator Tuffy in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join my colleague, Senator Brian Hayes, in calling for all-party support for the Shot at Dawn Campaign. The campaign deserves our support, particularly when one studies the cases that have been put forward. People were shot for wandering from trenches, suffering either from shell shock or post-traumatic stress disorder. We are aware of these disorders now but they were unknown at the time. In one of the cases, the judgment of the military tribunal was that the soldier had become a worthless soldier. Nobody asked why he had been wandering after spending six months in the trenches and being subject to bombardment, mortar attacks, gunfire and so forth. There was no understanding. Not only were these individuals sentenced to be shot by their own forces but their families were sentenced to carry a stigma. This is a worthy campaign and I hope other parties will support the call by Senator Hayes for a cross-party front in the House in supporting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Fifteen Members have indicated that they wish to speak so I ask them to be brief.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1254"/>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>There was a most disturbing episode last weekend when 13 Latvians were left stranded on an island off Skerries. It was disgraceful to leave them on that island, particularly in those terrible weather conditions. They had no shelter. Thankfully, they were able to contact the mainland by mobile telephone.</P>
      <P>Recently, there has been much discussion about Irish Ferries and a race to the bottom as a result of the decision to employ east European workers on the ferries. This exposes the fact that there is exploitation of these immigrants in this country. Most of these people do not speak English. At least when the Irish emigrated in the past, they went to the United States and the UK where they had the benefit of speaking English. These immigrants do not and they are ripe for exploitation.</P>
      <P>As I have said previously in the House, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment must strengthen its inspectorate. It is pathetic when one considers the number of immigrants that have come to this country. In 2002, there were over 8,300 inspections. In 2004, there were 5,300. That is a decrease of approximately 3,000 in the two years when there was a massive explosion in the number of immigrants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator seeking a debate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I am. If this country is to project the right image internationally, this type of situation should not emerge. It behoves us to respect these immigrants. They are making a vital contribution to our economy. The inspectorate must be strengthened so it can monitor this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Finucane&rsquo;s call for a debate on the exploitation of workers in Ireland. The latest incident involving the Latvian workers is a disgrace. Another instance recently came to my attention. An employer engaged a recruitment company to recruit a temporary member of staff. The employer was offering a wage of &euro;13 per hour but the recruitment company only passed on &euro;7 per hour of that wage. That is a disgrace.</P>
      <P>If that is still happening in this day and age and in this country, it is an example of a bad memory on our part when one considers that the Irish who emigrated were looked after and treated well. If we do not deal with this situation decisively, we should look &mdash; and God forbid that it happen here &mdash; to the hatred and resentment that have been incited to cause the current rioting and unrest in France. We must deal with these issues decisively and immediately and treat these people with the respect and fairness with which we and our ancestors were treated in America, England and elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1255"/>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It appears we will be allowed to continue the debate on the Ferns report. I welcome that decision. If we are serious about this issue, there is something we can do. I refer to No. 23 on the Order Paper, a motion put down by me and most of my Independent colleagues. It requests the Government to re-examine the exemption given to the churches from the operation of the equality legislation. It is fine to bleat about how heartbroken we are and say that the church is not above the law. However, it most definitely is above the law. In recent years, both Houses have made it so. We can change this. This motion simply requests the Government to re-examine the exemption of the churches from equality legislation. It is not tolerable that an organisation which protected serial child abusers is given the right to fire perfectly decent, respectable and good teachers on the sole basis of their sexual orientation. It is a reproach to the House&rsquo;s integrity if we do not take up this matter. I ask that we combine the statements on the Ferns report with the taking of this motion. The motion does not bind the Government to any action. If we are serious about the church not being above the law and other citizens, the House must request the Government to simply re-examine the issue in light of the Ferns report.</P>
      <P>I welcome the comments of Senator Brian Hayes on the Shot at Dawn Campaign. I have raised the matter several times too. The cases are absolutely tragic. A disproportionate number of Irish people, serving in the British army during the First World War were shot for desertion, cowardice or whatever it was. I have read many of the cases. One, in particular, concerned a young lad who was shot peremptorily because, after having been through the thick of battle, he refused to put on a muddied, sopping wet hat which could have given him pneumonia. It was inhumane. They shot the Irish <i>pour encourager les autres</i>. It was a barbarous and awful matter. The New Zealand Government got what it wanted and it has recognised those executed by awarding them medals posthumously. I strongly support this campaign.</P>
      <P>When will the ending of the groceries order be enforced? There is something fishy about the very phrase &ldquo;below-cost selling&rdquo;. What businessman actually sells below cost? Several charities have claimed it will do damage to the most vulnerable elements in society. We already have two chain stores controlling over 50% of the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is Senator Norris seeking a debate on the groceries order?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but I want to explain why. Yesterday, on the wireless, Mr. Ben Dunne said we need to be careful about the removal of the groceries order, as the chain stores will use it to get gullible people into their stores. The Govern<Col N="1256"/>ment is apparently committed to removing the order. However, the regulations must be monitored. If the chain stores are allowed, without being told,&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader understands the point Senator Norris is making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know how she can because I have not made it yet. However, I know she is a wonderfully perceptive and intelligent woman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very clever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Ben Dunne&rsquo;s point is that if stores are allowed to sell below cost, they must be made do so for a reasonable period at every branch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Otherwise, they will just use it to draw people into their stores. The House must monitor this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Brian Hayes has raised an important issue with the Shot at Dawn Campaign. It would be right and significant for the House to demonstrate united support for the campaign. In recent years, we have seen, particularly through satellite television, the archival film material from the battlefront of the First World War. We have all come to realise how horrific it was.</P>
      <P>I have read some of the case histories of those soldiers shot at dawn. Many were not for serious infringement of rules. Some of these points have been made by Senator Minihan and others. Very often the cases concerned simple disorientation of an individual for 24 or 48 hours. The significance of Senator Brian Hayes&rsquo;s comments is that it would not only be human and right, but symbolic for the House to show what war does to ordinary people. I read some comments subsequent to the executions made by officers, many of whom were not happy with what was happening. We owe it to ourselves and the families and memories of those who were wrongly executed to ensure such barbarity will never again happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the comments by Senators Finucane and MacSharry on migrant workers. This is part of a broader debate on future labour trends needed in the House. My colleagues on the Joint Committee on European Affairs are beginning a major study of the topic. In recent days the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, has pointed out that the economy will need 60,000 workers in the coming years just to keep ticking over. Others say we will need 40,000 each year for the next 20 years.</P><Col N="1257"/>
      <P>How we treat and cope with the huge number of migrant workers needed for the economy will become a major issue which requires serious debate. We must ensure exploitation is investigated, dealt with and driven out and that we put in place social, economic and community structures to ensure we can deal with the social changes brought about by large numbers of people coming to this country in the next ten to 15 years. The Ireland of 2016 will be very different from the Ireland of today and we must prepare for change now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the proposal by Senator Brian Hayes regarding the Shot at Dawn Campaign. Even in the context of that time the sentences were shameful. I have a personal interest in this matter as a distant relative of the Mansergh family was involved in one such tribunal. Such a fact only redoubles my support for the campaign.</P>
      <P>We often criticise newspapers and the media in general in this House but I warmly compliment RTE on its interesting and balanced &ldquo;Land of Gold&rdquo; documentary last night on the Lansdowne estate in Kenmare, which was a model of its genre. It gave vent to people&rsquo;s legitimately strong feelings but also gave credit where credit was due.</P>
      <P>It may not be welcome to some colleagues in the House but the modification of the equality directive was sought under the last Government by all the churches together. The Ferns report has no relevance to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>In that case the Senator is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I add my voice to calls for a debate on the situation pertaining to immigrant workers. Senator Bradford is correct that the Joint Committee on European Affairs is about to engage in research into the subject. Along with others I am concerned that the Latvian workers who were abandoned while picking periwinkles were not apparently willing to go to the Garda. There are probably more people here, quite legally because they are from within the EU, who do not understand that they can make complaints. They might not be eligible for social welfare payments but they can certainly make complaints. This House needs to make sure that everyone knows what their rights are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader if she will consider a debate on the harmful and often fatal effects that paracetamol can have. In recent years great strides have been made by allowing only one packet of, for example Panadol, to be sold over the counter but we must do more.</P>
      <P>It came to my attention over the summer that people take paracetamol without realising the <Col N="1258"/>effect it has on the liver, in particular. This can be a silent and deadly killer. Medical personnel from accident and emergency departments have told me many young people who present themselves have overdosed on paracetamol without realising. Once damage is done to the liver there is no going back.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>It is time that Members of the Oireachtas sought to educate people on the matter. It may be an interesting topic to debate at some stage. We can do more than restricting sales to one packet at a time, and we could label the medicine with a warning, for example. We shout about the harmful effects of cigarettes and alcohol on our lives and bodies, but we can see these effects. We do not see the harmful effects that paracetamol can have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole in calling for a debate on the issue of the Great Blasket Island. There was a debate in this House on this issue before many of the current Members were here, when Mr. Haughey was Taoiseach. It was a worthwhile debate but much has happened since then. We do not wish the matter to descend into a mess.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, yesterday announced the abolition of the groceries order with great fanfare. He did not reveal proposals to amend the Competition Act 2002. Senator<?oasys _jy?>Norris&rsquo;s comments on the matter were correct, and the vagueness of the Minister&rsquo;s proposals is a cause for concern. While he indicated that he would strengthen the Competition Act 2002 to outlaw &ldquo;hello money&rdquo;, resale price maintenance and the imposition of unfair discrimination, he has not indicated if he will strengthen the Act to outlaw predatory pricing. The legislation will not be of much use without this measure.</P>
      <P>It is often said that the devil is in the detail. In this case the devil is in the absence of the detail.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not want to face the appalling vista of less Irish food being produced, fewer local shops and the duping of consumers by gimmicks. We should have the debate which has been called for already.</P>
      <P>I will see the Leas-Chathaoirleach in his office with regard to the technological discrimination perpetuated against the people in the Black Valley in Killarney, County Kerry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with the calls for a debate on the implications of recent events pertaining to labour law, particularly the serious con<Col N="1259"/>sequences which may have occurred with periwinkle pickers. This underscores a more serious problem of how immigrant workers can be integrated into the system while ensuring the competitiveness of industry on one hand, and fair treatment for both immigrant and domestic workers on the other hand.</P>
      <P>With regard to the working world, there are instances of both overregulation and underregulation. One sector in which there is underregulation is the legal profession. Approximately three or four weeks ago a debate was advocated on this matter because of certain controversies. The time has come to ensure that self-regulation in these areas is discontinued and that independent regulation comes about. I ask the Leader to consider having a debate on the regulation of solicitors and barristers. The Law Library and the Law Society should not be the determining bodies on progress in the matter. Admission to the professions, which in turn has adverse consequences for competition, is controlled.</P>
      <P>There is also a need for the Judiciary to be accountable to an independent body. Other countries have established independent commissions to deal with the conduct of their judiciaries and other issues of major public concern, such as consistency of sentencing. The time has come for us to adopt best practice in these areas.</P>

	<P>During the week, a statement issued from a PD source in County Galway indicated that a directive, issued from the Department of the Taoiseach, requested the sale of six acres of land adjoining Grove Hospital in Tuam, two acres of land adjoining the workhouse in Portumna and 32 acres adjoining St. Bridget&rsquo;s Hospital in Ballinasloe. The Government gave undertakings that the Bon Secours Hospital would be redeveloped and state-of-the-art facilities provided for north-east County Galway, for example, adjacent to the psychiatric services hospital in Ballinasloe. If these lands were to be sold, it would deprive a very active committee in Portumna of the opportunity of continuing its work in developing sheltered housing.</P>

	<P>Will the Leader seek clarification from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office or the Minister&rsquo;s office on whether this is true? Is it particular to east County Galway or is it national?

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>We will address this issue when we receive further information from the Leader. In its programme for Government, the Government promised that no child under nine years of age would be taught in a class of more than 20 pupils after 2007. We learned from a statement made by the INTO today that class sizes have increased at primary level, particularly in this category in north Dublin and the Minister for Education and Science&rsquo;s own constituency, which has experienced an increase of 34%. Will the Leader arrange for the Minister to address the House and explain why there is regression and the promise given by the Government in 2002 is not being honoured?</P>

I am glad that Members on all side seem to be of the one opinion and I hope the motion is passed as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on the World Trade Organisation talks? Thousands of farmers were on Dublin&rsquo;s streets yesterday to protest the scandalous approach of Commissioner Peter Mandelson in advance of the talks. It would be important for Senators on all sides to have the opportunity to express their views to the relevant member of Government before the discussions are up and running.</P>

	<P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on the Department of Health and Children&rsquo;s report last week on the audit of cleanliness of acute hospitals, which revealed startling statistics concerning a number of hospitals throughout the country and levels of uncleanliness that were shocking? It would be appropriate for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children to discuss this matter with the House as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Does the Leader agree that, at a time when the Government is being criticised for cutting back on spending on road safety, it was a disgrace that the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Callely, plastered his picture in colour on yesterday&rsquo;s daily newspapers to tell us what a fantastic job he has been doing?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>My attention was drawn to an advertisement in the daily newspapers last week calling for a land development opportunity in Dublin. This was advertised by the group recently established by the Government to provide some of these houses under Sustaining Progress. It asked for lands that were zoned but also not zoned, which drew my attention. It asked for owners of unzoned lands to come forward to become involved in this unique development opportunity. I have two concerns. Is this an acknowledgement that the Part V provisions do not accommodate the thousands of acres of land zoned for housing in Dublin? What implications for forced developments will this have for county councils across Dublin? Developers might come forward to state they made a deal at governmental level under Sustaining Progress for a certain amount of affordable housing units on land not previously zoned, which would force the local <Col N="1262"/>authorities to zone that land in the future. I request that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government come to the House to clarify this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the calls to invite the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, to the House to update us on what actions she intends to take to improve the hygiene standards in our hospitals. It was rich of her to comment that she was disappointed with the results of the hygiene audit. The same T&aacute;naiste has been in Government for more than eight years and has done absolutely nothing in this area. It proves to us and to the citizens of the State that the Government and Cabinet does not listen to the people. That is a fact.</P>
      <P>I wish to discuss another matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>On another issue, many health and environmental officers travel throughout the country investigating publicans and owners of restaurants and small hotels. I know of one person who was visited three times in one day and did not have a case to answer. Last Christmas Day a hotelier was called to twice. If the same rules applied, half of the country&rsquo;s hospitals would be closed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>

      <P>It is important to remember the hygiene standards that should be met, such as those pertaining to the disposal of excreta which is a nursing duty. Does that occur in every hospital? I believe&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does Senator Glynn support the calls for a debate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes I do. I wish to make the point that is it extremely important that hygiene practices traditionally attributed to professionals are perhaps no longer carried out by professionals. I do not offer that as an excuse but we must remember that the disposal of certain substances is an important way in ensuring that hygiene standards are sustained and maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is part of the debate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>On numerous occasions I highlighted the fact that 50,000 young Irishmen died in the Great War and it is only recently that we have begun to commemorate and remember them. They were volunteers and not conscripted. We should unite to ensure a blanket pardon for those men who were executed. An Irish soldier was ten times more likely to be executed than a New Zealand soldier in a contingent of the same size. The British Government and people showed a bias against the Irish who volunteered. The lower classes were also treated badly. King George pardoned those of the higher ranks because the petitions were signed by people of influence. I can see no reason for the British Government&rsquo;s refusal to accede to this request to pardon innocent Irish and British men who were shot at dawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Last May while receiving treatment in Dublin, my father was told there was not one clean hospital in Dublin. I looked at him in disbelief when he told me this. Unfortunately the results of the hygiene survey published last week proves&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>There is St. James&rsquo;s Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that the consultant who said it was not too far off the mark. It would be opportune for the House to have a debate on the hygiene report. I am very concerned that even though the report was flagged well in advance, 91% of hospitals did not come up to scratch and the audit was a month and a half late. This does <Col N="1264"/>not augur well for the future. There seem to be no targets, no sanctions and no issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure this issue will form part of the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children should be invited to the House next week to outline her plans. This report is only the beginning. Will regular checks be carried out? The report only examined acute hospitals. Will the audit be extended to all other hospitals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>We are debating this matter in the Joint Committee on Health and Children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>On another matter, I travelled by train from Galway this morning, passing through Athlone which is the Leader&rsquo;s base. It struck me that the land surrounding most train stations is totally derelict and this gives a very bad impression of the nearby towns. I ask for a debate on transport with the Minister for Transport to ascertain if the lands could be sold for affordable housing or else improved. Most towns are involved in the Tidy Towns competition and the train stations are costing them many points every year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of information, Senator Browne said there were no Dublin hospitals well up the list, I remind him of St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, the biggest hospital in the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I was quoting somebody who made that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Where does that leave Mallow Hospital? It is a case of &ldquo;Up Cork&rdquo; again.</P>
      <P>Senator Brian Hayes referred to the imminence of Armistice Day and the Shot at Dawn Campaign proposal. He asked if the leaders of each of the parties could meet outside the House and I am in agreement with him. He suggested we could combine our wishes in that regard and ask the motion be relayed to the British Government, which is the authority to decide on retrospective pardons. It is a very fine idea.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the House it was never intended that statements on the Ferns report would conclude tomorrow as it will be ongoing. I hope there will be many contributions to the debate. In this regard Senator O&rsquo;Toole asked for more time to discuss the Ferns report.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole also referred to the soldiers in the First World War who created their own ceasefire. This is a poignant incident in that period when the soldiers sang &ldquo;Silent Night&rdquo; in their different languages and made friends with one another. I believe the ceasefire extended from Christmas Eve to New Year&rsquo;s Eve and may <Col N="1265"/>have been spasmodic. It is very poignantly remembered in the poetry of that period.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole asked whether the Blasket Islands are regarded as a national monument. The legislation was overturned. He asked that the House seek a report from the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>Senator Tuffy asked for a debate on child care. I must dispute that nothing was done. In 1997 the Government inherited a very parsimonious situation with regard to child benefit but it has increased in leaps and bounds since then. I agree with the Senator that much more needs to be done regarding the provision of child care facilities. A plethora or reports, advices and position papers have been produced. It will be a case of what to choose. One could become bamboozled but I am confident they will all be taken into account.</P>
      <P>Senator Minihan supports Senator Brian Hayes on the Shot at Dawn Campaign.</P>
      <P>Senator Finucane raised the exploitation of a group of people who were left on an island while picking periwinkles. I agree with him that the labour inspectorate should be beefed up. It is not sufficient to take the laudable decision to open our borders to anyone from the accession countries if we do nothing to ensure they secure their labour rights.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris referred to motion 23, tabled by the Independent Group, which proposes: &ldquo;That Seanad &Eacute;ireann, in the light of the Ferns Report, requests the Government to re-examine the exemption of the churches from the operations of equality legislation.&rdquo; It will not be possible to discuss motion 23 during the debate tomorrow because it is a formal motion. While I do not know which Minister will come before the House for the debate, he or she would have to be given guidance on the matter. Nevertheless, I see no reason the matter cannot be raised in the context of the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Would it be possible to make time available to take the motion at some point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>We will try to do so when the Ferns report is next scheduled.</P>
      <P>The Senator also referred to the groceries order and competition legislation. The reason I knew what point he was about to make was that I heard Mr. Ben Dunne state on radio yesterday that special offers should be made available for defined periods and at all outlets.</P>
      <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, in referring to the Shot at Dawn Campaign, noted what was done to ordinary people at the time. As conscription was not introduced in Ireland &mdash; figuratively speaking, that battle was won &mdash; those shot were volunteers. Their executions were sad events and the campaign marks an attempt by the current generation to do address the issue.</P><Col N="1266"/>
      <P>Senator Bradford also raised the issue of migrant workers. I am pleased the Joint Committee on European Affairs is compiling a major report on the issue. Senators could feed into the committee&rsquo;s deliberations if the House has a good debate on the issue.</P>
      <P>Senator Mansergh indicated his support for the Shot at Dawn Campaign and praised RTE for last night&rsquo;s &ldquo;Land is Gold&rdquo; documentary on the Lansdowne estate in Kenmare. He also pointed out, as Senator Norris will be aware, that all the churches requested exemption from the equality legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the reason I specifically used the word &ldquo;churches&rdquo;, the plural form, in the motion. I regret that Senator Mansergh does not approve of equality for all citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Both Houses agreed to the exemption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, and it was a disgraceful decision at the time. Look at where it got us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Feeney referred to damage to internal organs, such as the liver, by overdosing on paracetamol. Senator Coghlan called for a debate on the Great Blasket Island and asked what amendments would be made to the Competition Act. We will endeavour to have the Minister come before the House to discuss the groceries order compendium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Amending legislation will be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Jim Walsh raised labour law competitiveness and the need for independent regulation of members of the legal profession, a matter on which I fully agree with him.</P>
      <P>Senator MacSharry made a powerful intervention on the issue of immigrants living here, without whom a great deal of work would not be done. It is simply not sufficient to welcome them without providing for their needs, as it has created a major gap. The Senator also raised the spectre of ongoing events in Paris and elsewhere in France, which is experiencing serious problems night after night. The French take pride in the concepts of <i>libert&eacute;</i>, <i>egalit&eacute;</i>and <i>fraternit&eacute;</i>, yet the country&rsquo;s immigrants are bunched up in out-of-town apartment blocks. The House should have a debate on this matter.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I have no idea what issue Senator Ulick Burke was referring to and I cannot imagine that any Taoiseach would issue an edict requiring that land be sold in Tuam or elsewhere. The person from whom this story emanated may be an overly ambitious Progressive Democrats hopeful who may have lost the run of himself or herself. I know nothing about it, and I do not propose to <Col N="1267"/>go blundering through various offices to find out who said what. I am not a private detective. However, I suggest that an Adjournment matter, as the Leas-Chathaoirleach proposed, might be a good vehicle through which to address the matter. Senator Ulick Burke raised the issue of smaller classes and proposed that the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, attend the House to tell us when that commitment will be realised.</P>
      <P>Senator John Paul Phelan agreed with Senator Brian Hayes and others regarding the Shot at Dawn Campaign. He also referred to the World Trade Organisation and Commissioner Mandelson. Many of us have spoken of him, and there is no doubt that he is a loose cannon who simply wants his own way, particularly in that campaign. The Senator also said that we should review the reports on cleanliness and road safety. One cannot condemn any Minister or Minister of State who gets his or her photograph taken. The Opposition was great at it.</P>

He also requested that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, attend the House.</P>
      <P>Senator Bannon said that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, should attend the House. She should be commended on getting the report done. If it had not been written, how would we know the degree of cleanliness in the various hospitals? We should not decry her. It was not pleasant to be presented with such a report, but she sought its completion, and now there is a benchmark towards which she will work. We should condemn the state of some of the hospitals and not someone who had a report carried out.</P>

      <P>I place on record my appreciation to the Leader of the House, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, the <Col N="1269"/>Chief Whip, Senator Moylan, our spokespersons, Senators Glynn and Feeney, and every other Fianna F&aacute;il Senator for the overwhelming support and encouragement they have given this Bill. I also thank the Opposition and Independent Senators for their support. The Bill is of universal importance, it is not a party political issue and will benefit the majority of people. I am confident it will be agreed and will proceed to Committee and Remaining Stages.</P>
      <P>It has come to my attention that many people have been deprived of their rightful inheritance by the lack of a will or the inability to find the will of a family member. They have been done a great disservice by the State and this Bill is the only way to rectify the situation. When I returned to the Oireachtas, other cases came to my attention where wills had allegedly been made but not found. I recently came across a case where a person died and the family is still seeking the last will and testament but have not succeeded to date. I have heard many other stories where people have tried to find a will but have failed.</P>
      <P>In 2004, some 5,400 wills were probated in Ireland but more than 28,000 people died. This significant shortfall demonstrates my point &mdash; many people do not make wills. Many make private wills but these are normally held with their papers and documents. The only individuals required to register a will are Catholic clergy. Every Catholic cleric must leave a copy of his will in the possession of the bishop.</P>
      <P>There is a saying that it is impossible to live without lawyers and impossible to die without them. Over 6,000 solicitors practise in Ireland in 2,100 offices. There is no requirement on the solicitors registered in this country who execute and make wills to provide lists that would be held in a central bona fide registry such as the General Register Office in Roscommon. At present, a person makes a will with a solicitor who records it in his or her book of wills and the document is held in the legal firm&rsquo;s safe deposit box. The <i>Law Society Gazette</i> regularly advertises requests for the whereabouts of wills that have been mislaid, are missing or cannot be found. Many people who would otherwise be entitled to inheritances from wills have been deprived. To quote Jack Lemmon, &ldquo;Death ends a life, not a relationship&rdquo;. There are pages and pages of people searching for lost wills in the <i>Law Society Gazette</i> in the hope that their loved one made a will. Many people make wills not knowing that sometimes they may not be executed correctly or at all. It is a unique situation where the purchaser of this service has no after-sales come back. We have a responsibility to ensure that citizen&rsquo;s wishes are honoured and given the proper legal recognition they deserve.</P>
      <P>In the course of my research I have discovered a Council of Europe convention for the establishment of a scheme of registration of wills. This <Col N="1270"/>dates back to 1972 but was never ratified by Ireland. The main aim of the convention was the provision of a registration scheme enabling a testator to register his will to reduce the risk of the will remaining unknown or being found belatedly, and to facilitate the discovery of the existence of the will after the death of the testator. This was on account of the situation where a growing number of persons make their will away from home and even in a foreign country. Since most member states do not require wills to be deposited with a court of law, a notary or another authority, and have no central register, the heirs are often unaware of the existence and the whereabouts of a will. The current situation must stop and therefore I ask that the Registration of Wills Bill be dealt with.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to introduce the Registration of Wills Bill 2005 and to outline its provisions. Before doing so, however, I wish to explain why the provisions set out in the Bill are so important. We are currently faced with a unique situation where many people&rsquo;s last wishes are not being honoured and the Bill will rectify that. I am glad the Minister of State is here to assist with this work. The proper system will involve the General Register Office, located in Roscommon.</P>
      <P>The Bill will enable a person who makes a will, or his or her solicitor, to voluntarily register the name and address of the custodian of his or her will. This will reduce the risk of the will remaining unknown or being found belatedly. It will also facilitate the discovery of a will after the death of the person who made it. This Bill provides for the privacy of the registered particulars of the will prior to the testator&rsquo;s death. This will underpin the development of a modern system of registration of wills that responds to the needs of modern society.</P>
      <P>The Registration of Wills Bill 2005 amends the Civil Registration Act 2004 and provides a clear statutory basis for the registration of wills by extending the civil registration service. The register of wills will be kept in the General Register Office in Roscommon, further facilitating decentralisation. The office has settled well and is a good example of a Government agency being decentralised.</P>
      <P>Civil registration was introduced in Ireland in 1845 for the registration of non-Catholic marriages and expanded in 1864 for the registration of births, deaths and Catholic marriages. Therefore, since the 1800s a registration system has been in place. Irish society now requires a national system of registration of wills to facilitate the finding of a person&rsquo;s will after his passing.</P>
      <P>Part 1 of the Bill contains the usual provisions for short title, collective citation, definitions and commencement. Part 2 outlines the organisational structure for the administration of the register of wills. Part 3 provides for the regis<Col N="1271"/>tration of wills. Part 4 provides for miscellaneous amendments to the Civil Registration Act 2004. Section 10 provides for the registration of wills by a registrar of any local registration authority. Qualified informants may register wills at a convenient office by providing the required particulars of the will and signing the register in the presence of the registrar. A qualified informant is the testator or his or her instructed solicitor. The required particulars of the will are set out in the Schedule and include the following: the name and address of the custodian of the will; the testator&rsquo;s signature, name, address, sex, date and place of birth; the testator&rsquo;s personal public service number; the informant&rsquo;s signature, name and address; the date of registration; and the registrar&rsquo;s signature.</P>
      <P>Section 10(3) provides that one or more wills, including codicils, made by the same testator may be registered or re-registered. This, of course, means that if a person decides to change his will he can register the new will.</P>
      <P>Section 11 provides that information held on the register of wills shall not be accessible to the public and that such information shall not be made available except as provided under section 12. That ensures the privacy of will records. Section 12 requires the registrar or a member of his or her staff authorised by him or her to search the register of wills and provide a certified copy of an entry in such register at the request of an applicant on payment of the appropriate fee, provided the death of the testator has been registered or the applicant is the testator. This means that a copy of the register entry is only available to the testator or to someone else on the death of the testator.</P>
      <P>The further modernisation of the civil registration service is essential to ensure rights for those who make wills and for their beneficiaries. I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to a constructive debate on it.</P>
      <P>I will bring forward certain amendments on Committee Stage on the basis of information provided to me to date. One&rsquo;s marital status affects one&rsquo;s rights to inherit from one&rsquo;s spouse or partner. If one is not married, one may only inherit from one&rsquo;s partner if left a bequest in a valid will. However, a spouse is entitled to what is called a &ldquo;legal right share&rdquo; of their deceased spouse&rsquo;s estate even if there is no will, the will is invalid or there is a valid will but it leaves little or nothing to the surviving spouse. The marital status of the deceased person may also indirectly affect the inheritance rights of his or her children.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I thank all those associated with bringing forward the Bill. I am grateful in particular for the assistance I received from counsel, Wesley Farrell, who is in the Visitors Gallery, and others who have made worthwhile contributions to the Bill, including Ms Margaret McCluskey, who for<Col N="1272"/>warded information, and others. I received numerous items of information from people throughout the country in regard to the Bill.</P>
      <P>I want to express my sincere appreciation to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, the Minister of State, Deputy Power, and the Registrar General who will be dealing with this particular issue. This Bill is a move in the right direction as far as Members of this House, as legislators, are concerned. It will provide an opportunity where a need arises. Ministers are extremely busy but this Bill gives us an opportunity to identify a void in the market and the way people can be best served by bringing forward legislation. I have been given a unique opportunity, as a member of the Fianna F&aacute;il Front Bench in the Seanad and of the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party, because the Bill was approved unanimously by the Fianna F&aacute;il Senators and the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party at a meeting attended by the Taoiseach, and all Ministers, including the Chief Whip, Deputy Tom Kitt. This is a legislative measure agreed by our Government which is going through the process of Private Members&rsquo; time. I am delighted to have the opportunity to present the Bill with the assistance of many people who have worked with me on this legislation. I commend the Bill to the House and hope it will be accepted unanimously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill brought forward by Senator Leyden brings into focus the worth of this House as a House of legislation. Many people have said in the past, unjustly and unfairly, that this House is a talking shop. This Bill puts the lie to that pronouncement.</P>
      <P>The Registration of Wills Bill is short but it is important. It regularises a whole area of life that has not been regularised heretofore. As everybody knows, where there is a will there is a way but I remind Members that, invariably, where there is a will there is a relative, and that is where the problems start.</P>
      <P>I recall a family situation where the owner of a farm died intestate. For many years the family squabbled over who should or should not have the farm but in the end nobody got it. The farm was in debt. There was interest and compound interest owed to the banks and it was good to nobody. That is a clear example that if legislation of this nature was in operation, that situation would not have obtained.</P>
      <P>The legal profession can play a pivotal role in ensuring that people make wills. We do not know the day or the hour, as we were told by the great man from Nazareth, when death will come like a thief in the night. It can befall any of us at any time. It is only proper and responsible, therefore, that people would have their affairs in order and family lawyers and people of that nature have an important role to play in exhorting people to make a will. That is very important.</P><Col N="1273"/>
      <P>Another area where the Bill will be of tremendous help concerns people in long-stay care institutions who have property. Senator Leyden will agree that is an aspect we may have to examine in the context of the Bill. Having worked in the health services for many years, I have a great deal of experience of people in long-stay institutions, whether it is geriatric or psychiatric hospitals. Some of these people are there voluntarily and are not wards of court. Therefore, they are in a legal position to determine what should be done with their property. That is an area I would like to see addressed in some shape or form but &ldquo;will&rdquo; is the operative word because it comes down to the will of the person and what he or she wants to do.</P>
      <P>Senator Leyden referred to people who had bequeathed their property to A, B or C but in some cases that did not happen. For example, some years ago, as a member of Westmeath County Council, my assistance was sought in regard to getting a local authority loan approved for people who wanted to extend their house. A will was made but it was made in a slip-shod way. It was witnessed but the saga went on for over two years. It cost the person concerned a lot of money and it cost the lawyer concerned a great deal of time. This measure proposed by my colleague, Senator Leyden, will go a long way to resolve that difficulty.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I am pleased to note that under section 12, An Ard-Chl&aacute;raitheoir or a member of his or her staff authorised by him or her can search the register of wills and provide a certified copy of an entry in such register at the request of an applicant on payment of the appropriate fee, provided the death of the testator has been registered or the applicant is the testator. This means that a copy of the register entry is only available to the testator or to someone else on the death of the testator. That is an important provision because it protects the privacy of the person who made the will.</P>
      <P>To return to my earlier comment to the effect that where there is a will there is a relative, one does not have to be a rocket scientist to know what has happened when the appropriate will was not made but natural justice was not done. People will say that one will not get justice in a court; one has to go to Heaven. That is a viewpoint held by many but my point is that wills have been contested by people who were motivated by nothing other than greed and the people who had the moral entitlement to the property did not get it. However, morals have no basis in law. The law comes down to what is written on pieces of paper such as this one. That is the law when we pass a Bill in both Houses and when the President signs it into law. If a person wants to leave their property to somebody when they pass from this life, or in the course of this life, it is important that the spirit and the detail of that person&rsquo;s wish is <Col N="1274"/>upheld and administered. That is why this Bill is important.</P>
      <P>Much of what I want to say about the Bill has been said by the initiator, Senator Leyden. I look forward to Committee Stage. Some amendments may be exercising the minds of Members of this House, the public or the legal profession. When this Bill is enacted, I ask the Minister to initiate a public awareness campaign to ensure that every citizen is made aware of it. This is one of the most important pieces of legislation that has come before this House. It is a small Bill, but is worth its weight in gold. Once enacted, the State and the public will save money. While members of the legal profession like to make money, which they will do and are entitled to do, it will save legal time that could be spent in a more fruitful way.</P>

	<P>Due to confidentiality I cannot say.</P>

	<P>I could do with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked the lady who made the will with me the procedure solicitors follow. After making the will, they learn of the deaths of clients by reading the death notices in national newspapers. They then contact the family of the deceased. Given that many people do not put death notices in the newspapers, but rely on local radio, solicitors may miss deaths. After a person makes a will, 30, 40 or 50 years may pass before his or her death. Law firm staff change, law firms may be dissolved and files can be lost. When a person dies, a relative may report the death to a solicitor and ask if a will exists. If no will was made with that solicitor, he or she may write to other solicitors in the county inquiring whether a will exists. If that yields no result, the solicitor advertises in the <i>Law Society Gazette,</i> which usually gets a result. There is scope for a person&rsquo;s will to be missed if relatives are not aware that it has been made.</P>
      <P>I do not have full confidence in solicitors. There has been the recent disgraceful cases of overcharging abuse victims and, unfortunately, all professions have the potential for corruption, greed and human error. Therefore, the Bill makes perfect sense. Central registration of wills would allow the relatives of a deceased person to be <Col N="1275"/>notified and to know where and when the will was made and the name of the solicitor.</P>
      <P>Senator Leyden raised the important point of the issue of the legibility of wills. I am aware of many wills that contained illegible writing and signatures. This causes even more confusion and distress at the time of death. It is important that we have a central registration office and wills can then be clearly read and understood.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the confidentiality of wills. We must ensure that copies of wills kept in the central office remain confidential. There will be some risks. One disadvantage of a central registration system would be that relatives would know if a person has made a will. For example, nieces and nephews might suspect their unmarried aunt or uncle has cut them out of the will. This could cause resentment in families. I recently attended two very sad funerals in Carlow. An elderly man died intestate and due to a family disagreement his land was sold. The person who bought the land was shot dead and the killer then committed suicide. This shows the importance of making a will.</P>
      <P>The State should take an active role in encouraging people of all ages to make wills. People often think they have nothing to leave, but even if they have no property they may own items that can cause division in their families after their deaths. I am amazed in particular by farmers who do not make wills. I am aware of a recent case of a farmer who died suddenly intestate. His wife inherited everything because the property was held jointly, but had it not been, she would have inherited only two thirds while the remainder would have gone to his family. The main difficulty in the division of property is not with brothers and sisters, although that can cause problems, but occurs when what may be described as &ldquo;in-laws and outlaws&rdquo; are involved. Rumours of unfair treatment lead to the horrible stories such as the one I mentioned.</P>
      <P Just="Left">On the question of a fixed fine, we should move towards index linking fines. A fixed fine goes out of date quickly. The solution is to index link the fine so that it increases each year. I understand the maximum fine for using fireworks is IR&pound;5, which shows the danger of setting a fixed amount, unless the amount is reviewed annually. Perhaps we could use this Bill as an example of an index linked fine.</P>
      <P>What will be the fee for using this service? Most solicitors do not charge for making a will, but for discharging it. Will there be a maximum or minimum charge? Perhaps this will be discussed on Committee Stage. If signed into law, will the Bill apply only to wills made from that date onwards or could it include recently made wills?</P>

I am one of ten children and grew up in a home where one cow, two pigs, a calf and perhaps some hens were kept.

    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Members referred to the necessity of people taking responsibility and making a will. If this debate serves only to encourage people in this regard it will have done some good. We have all heard of cases where enormous difficulties have ensued when a person died without making a will. We will look at the idea of a campaign to encourage people in this regard. Members of the legal profession are generally helpful to people who propose to make a will. The Government will examine how this may be developed.</P>
      <P>Senator Leyden has given a thorough exposition of the aims and provisions of the Bill and I do not propose to go through them in detail. The Bill, which touches on a most important and sensitive aspect of peoples&rsquo; lives, is welcome. There is a strong case to be made for a system whereby the interests of citizens can be further protected in terms of making provision for family after one&rsquo;s passing.</P><Col N="1277"/>
      <P>The Bill proposes that the General Register Office, GRO, will have responsibility for the registration of wills. Civil registration was introduced in 1845 for the registration of non-Catholic marriages and expanded in 1864 to births, deaths and Catholic marriages. Thus, a comprehensive registration system has been in place since 1864. The data form a basic, continuous source of information about the population by providing a record of vital events relating to people and satisfying the need for evidence that has a bearing on rights, entitlements, liabilities, status and nationality.</P>
      <P>Civil registration is relevant to each of us at important stages in our lives, beginning with the registration of our births and ending when our deaths are registered. Between those events, civil registration affects us directly, as in the case of marriage, and indirectly, when certificates are required for many of the services available in society, such as enrolling a child in school, obtaining a passport, taking up employment and claiming a social welfare payment. While there has been little change to the basic registration procedures since 1864, there have been many changes in society, including major developments in technology and increased expectations on the part of citizens as to how public services should be delivered.</P>
      <P>Recognising the importance of civil registration and acknowledging the changing needs of society, the Government approved a programme of work to modernise the civil registration service. The civil registration modernisation programme is a joint initiative between my Department, which oversees the administration of the registration service, and the Department of Social and Family Affairs which processed the new legislation. This is a major undertaking involving the following: the introduction of modern technology providing on-line registration; electronic certificate production and the capture of digitised signatures; redesign of business processes and procedures; capture and storage in electronic format of all paper-based records from 1845; and reform of legislation.</P>
      <P>There will be substantial benefits, both tangible and intangible, arising from the modernisation programme. These include the following: improved service to customers, including extended opening times; greater efficiency in the use of resources and a reduction in red tape; nationwide standards for registering life events; the registration of divorces and civil annulments on a central register; the electronic capture and transmission of all vital statistics on life events to the Central Statistics Office, CSO; the sharing of data with designated Departments and Government agencies; and reducing the demand for paper certificates for the purposes of Government services.</P><Col N="1278"/>
      <P>Until now, the registration and certificate production processes were manual, time consuming and location dependent. The modernisation programme marks a fundamental change in the way the civil registration service operates and is delivering significant improvements in operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. The new computer system is fully rolled out across the country, with electronic registration and certificate production available in all registration offices. It has been recognised nationally and internationally as an example of excellence in e-government and service provision.</P>
      <P>The modernisation programme aims to deliver a high-quality, proactive service to customers. Since September 2003, all new birth registration data is transferred electronically to the Department of Social and Family Affairs from the civil registration computer system. This facilitates the following: the allocation of a personal public service number to a child at registration; the establishment of a child&rsquo;s public service identity and the creation of family links on the national central database for all citizens &mdash; the client records system which is administrated by the Department of Social and Family Affairs; and the initiation of a child benefit claim for first-born children and the automatic payment for second and subsequent children in a family. Thus, payment of child benefit in respect of a baby born and registered by the civil registration system on Monday is made immediately or, alternatively, the mother is contacted by Thursday without any manual intervention. This is a prime example of Departments working together to provide more convenient access to services for citizens through e-government.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the new civil registration system is a flagship initiative in providing life-centred services to customers. The visible improvement from the customer perspective is that a single interaction with a public service agency, such as the registration of a birth, not only achieves its original purpose but also triggers a series of related services by another agency, in this case, the Department of Social and Family Affairs. Customers availing of the e-enabled service no longer have to source and complete a multi­paged paper application form and supply a paper birth certificate. They simply register the baby&rsquo;s birth to set the process in motion.</P>
      <P>In many cases, the birth notification is passed electronically from the hospital to the registration computer system, and this facility will be implemented for all maternity hospitals in the future. In this case, the birth details are captured just once, at the earliest point in the process, with seamless electronic data transmission from hospital to registration to child benefit and back again to registration with the PPS number. In conjunction with the GRO, the Reach agency electronically publishes deaths data and makes it <Col N="1279"/>available to all Government agencies. This is of particular importance for the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Health Service Executive in terms of the efficient management of their services. Vital statistics are transmitted electronically to the CSO. This greatly reduces the amount of manual intervention involved in such exercises, improves the quality of data and enhances the ability of the CSO to manage the data.</P>
      <P>The capture of historical data in electronic format has been a central element of the modernisation programme. This has been a mammoth task, involving the digitisation of more than 27 million records and registration images. The technology used in the process is first rate. I commend all staff on their efforts over the years in what has been a difficult and painstaking task.</P>
      <P Just="Left">With all these developments now in place, it will soon be possible to begin commencing parts of the Civil Registration Act 2004, which was passed by both Houses and signed into law in February 2004. I will briefly remind the House of the purpose of this Act. The main objectives of the Act are as follows: to rationalise and modernise the procedures for registering births, stillbirths and deaths; give An tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir responsibility for the overall policy for the civil registration service, including maintaining standards of service; assign responsibility for the management of the civil registration service at local level to the Health Service Executive; streamline the procedures for the registration of adoptions; establish new registers of divorce and civil nullity; reform the procedures governing the registration of marriages; and facilitate the linking of life events.</P>
      <P>Parts 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8 of the 2004 Act relate to the administration of the civil registration service and to the registration of births, stillbirths and deaths. Preparatory work is at an advanced stage and it is hoped to commence these provisions reasonably shortly.</P>
      <P>The new procedures for marriage are set out in Part 6 of the Act and include universal procedures for notification, solemnisation and registration of marriages, as well as a choice of venue for civil marriages. Before these provisions can be commenced, a substantial body of work needs to be completed, including the following: drafting and publication of regulations, guidelines and detailed procedures; establishment of a register of solemnisers in consultation with religious bodies; establishment of a register of approved venues for civil marriages; and the further development of the computer system to facilitate the administration of the new marriage provisions introduced by the Act. Implementation of the other provisions, relating to registration of adoptions, divorces and civil nullity, will follow commencement of the marriage provisions.</P><Col N="1280"/>
      <P>A significant investment will be made in bringing genealogical research facilities up to modern standards. Discussions are under way with the OPW with a view to procuring new premises and facilities for research. The research facility will remain in Dublin and will be supported by a dedicated staff of eight. It is also intended to introduce electronic research in the new location and those with an interest in tracing their roots will be able to search through records much faster and will be able to view the original register entries which have been digitally scanned onto the system. It is hoped eventually to introduce Internet based research which will be available to a worldwide audience.</P>
      <P>I hope I have given an indication of the progress that has been made to date in the civil registration modernisation programme. I commend Senator Leyden on his initiative. The Bill attempts to reduce the risk of the existence of a will remaining unknown after the death of the person who made it. While we cannot give a guarantee as to the success of this measure or the numbers that will be involved, given that registration will be voluntary, it will reduce the risk of the existence of wills remaining unknown.</P>
      <P>It might be a little early to discuss amendments but I examined the Bill and the explanatory memorandum. I assumed we had gender proofed our legislation but the introduction of the explanatory memorandum states: &ldquo;This Bill will enable a testator or his solicitor to register the name and address of the custodian...&rdquo;. Perhaps the word &ldquo;testatrix&rdquo; should be added to include the other gender. It is unfortunate that when a Bill is published, the first thing people try to do is find fault with it. That is the reason for amendments. I presume the Senator will be open to accepting amendments.</P>

Section 10(3) in Part 3 states: &ldquo;One or more wills, including codicils, made by the same testator may be registered or re-registered under this section.&rdquo; Even if one or more wills are made, the last will is the important one. Will all the wills remain registered or just the last one?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The last is the one that applies. It is clarified in detail elsewhere in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Okay. I thank the Senators for contributing to the debate and I thank Senator Leyden for his work on this initiative. It is nice to see Senators take up matters on their own initiative. This obviously has much support. I wish the <Col N="1281"/>Senator and the Bill well and I hope the Bill has a safe passage through both Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this initiative. I thought it was a good idea when Senator Leyden first raised it in the House. However, he went further and took the trouble to draft a Bill, which is very welcome. The Minister appeared to put this matter on the long finger when he said much work must be done to modernise the entire process and that consultation would be required on the Bill. However, relatively simply legislation such as what has been introduced by Senator Leyden is what is required. No doubt it will be examined in detail on Committee Stage but I hope the legislation is not put on the long finger by the Government.</P>
      <P>Another issue that came to mind when I saw Senator Leyden&rsquo;s proposal is the need to establish a register of people who have guardianship of children. I refer to unmarried fathers. If the father has an agreement with the mother of the child that he is a guardian, they can swear an affidavit to that effect. However, there is nowhere to register that evidence of guardianship. That is another system of registration that must be put in place. Other states have a registration system for proof of guardianship and so forth. This issue should be examined but that is another day&rsquo;s work.</P>
      <P>The proposed system is voluntary. It must be made clear in the legislation that it will not be a system of validation of the will and will not affect wills that are not registered. Many people will still choose not to register their will and that is their entitlement. It would be hard to put in place a system that compels registration of wills as it would give rise to a number of problems.</P>
      <P>I am not sure if the Fine Gael spokesman realised that whatever is in this register will not be definitive in terms of determining whether somebody has a will. As I understand it, one will not be able to examine the content of the will. That would not be appropriate anyway. The amount of detail provided for in the Bill is probably sufficient. What is required is something that will assist people in finding out if a relative who has died left a will and where it can be found. It can often be difficult to locate wills. I am sure that people have sometimes secured a grant of administration on the basis of there not being a will where, in fact, there was a will but nobody could find it or wanted to find it.</P>
      <P>There are other issues that must be examined. An issue emerged concerning individuals with several wills, all of which are registered. The law stipulates that the later will is the one that takes effect. It must be taken into account that an individual may register a will and then change it without re-registering it. The registry, therefore, would not in any way be definitive. An individual is not obliged to register a revocation of a will and <Col N="1282"/>a system where the registry is definitive cannot be introduced. People must be advised and educated about this in some way.</P>
      <P>Many Members argue people must be encouraged to make wills. As a solicitor I agree with this and often encourage people to do so. If an individual makes a will, there is control over what happens to his or her estate when he or she dies. However, it is not so bad if an individual dies without a will. People often believe that by not having a will, fate dictates what happens to their estate. A Fine Gael Senator pointed out that when a married person who has children dies, leaving no will, two thirds of the estate goes to the spouse with one third to the children. The Succession Act introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il was good legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>It was introduced by Charlie Haughey.</P>

	<P>Senators should make their contributions through the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>While it is good legislation, it needs to be reviewed and updated. Safeguards are in place if an individual dies without leaving a will.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that when an individual registers a will, he or she may be more reluctant to change it later. One role of a solicitor is to advise clients on the importance of frequently reviewing their wills. Two years after drawing up a will, family circumstances may have changed or the inheritance tax threshold may have gone up or down, requiring the will to be changed. If a registry of wills is established, people must know that they should review their wills. It must be made clear that the registry is not definitive and wills may have been altered since they were first registered.</P>
      <P>The Bill must be examined closely on Committee Stage to ensure all possibilities are covered. Simple legislation is required as it is only a voluntary register for facilitating people to find a will. While various issues need to be explored, we must not get too bogged down. From the reply of the Minister of State, I feel his officials may be getting bogged down.</P>
      <P>The Bill refers to the definition of signatures, particularly an electronic signature. The testator must consent to the will being registered. Is an electronic signature sufficient in this regard? My understanding is that under this Bill one could register a will in a local authority area. However, I believe one should be able to do a search in a central registration office, as this can be done with other legal certificates. If this body is established, good information leaflets in user-friendly <Col N="1283"/>language must be published to explain the register and definitions.</P>
      <P>Section 10(1)(<i>b</i>) states that an individual must give &ldquo;to the registrar, to the best of his or her knowledge and belief, the required particulars of the will,&rdquo;. I originally read this as the contents of the will. However, it actually means the required particulars as per the Schedule. The language used in this section must be clarified.</P>
      <P>I have often come across cases where, for example, a house was put under the joint names of husband and wife but no will was made. The family must then go through probate and obtain a grant of administration which is costly and complicated. One can go to the probate office without a solicitor but the system needs to be more user-friendly and the costs involved must be reviewed. I see no reason wills already made cannot be registered, once a testator has not died. Is the Bill retrospective on this issue?</P>
      <P>Husbands and wives often put their dwelling houses under joint names, which is helpful in the event of one of the spouses dying. Recently, I dealt with a case where a husband and wife wanted to put their house under joint names. However, as they had bought their house from a local authority, they required the consent of the relevant council to transfer the ownership. This is one consent that should be removed. It is ridiculous that an individual who bought a house from a council must later get its consent if he or she wishes to transfer it to joint ownership. This transfer process must be encouraged because it avoids individuals whose spouses have died being forced to get probate on their dwelling house. This process should be made as uncomplicated as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Registration of Wills Bill and congratulate Senator Leyden on its introduction. I consider it a modern and practical Bill which would provide a service to everyone. As Senator Tuffy pointed out, the service is voluntary which is crucial. As there are issues around privacy and the validity of some wills, the voluntary aspect of the proposed system must be welcomed. The purpose of a will is to provide for one&rsquo;s loved ones and next-of-kin. As one American wit put it, the two sure and certain matters in life are death and taxes. In other cases, people wish to leave either assets or moneys to charitable organisations, many of which depend heavily on such bequests. This is a matter that could be open to abuse. I know of cases where vulnerable elderly people were taken advantage of in the drawing up of their wills. The registration of a will could avoid such situations arising.</P>
      <P>The executor plays an important role in carrying out the terms of a will. I had the responsibility of administering the estate of my late father who <Col N="1284"/>died intestate. I went through the whole process without legal assistance. I found it intimidating but once I understood it, it was not too difficult. In the case of large estates in particular, if a will is registered it will avoid much conflict because some families have been split beyond repair as a result of problems with wills. There are particular problems with land, especially farming land. This Bill will ensure that where there is a question as to whether somebody made a will it can be easily verified.</P>
      <P>In the modern economic context assets can be a complicated area. We are all conscious of the importance of pensions, superannuation schemes and the myriad saving and share schemes which can form part of a will. Debts can also play a large part in a will, whether in the form of tax liabilities, outstanding loans or salaries owed to employees. It is a complicated area which gives rise to problems if somebody dies intestate or if a will cannot be found. The legal profession plays a significant role in encouraging people to make a will and maintaining it once it is made. A register is vital so that the next of kin can be sure a will is registered, available and in the safe hands of a solicitor.</P>
      <P>The fabric of our society is also changing. Divorce, legal separation and cohabitation are all issues which must be taken into consideration because they complicate succession rights and the transfer of property and assets. Anything that makes the process simpler for a person or family can only help. The framework of family life in Ireland has changed so much that this Bill can only make life easier for people at what is a stressful and confusing time. From personal experience of the process it would have been much easier if, in the immediate aftermath of my father&rsquo;s death, there had been a register to check.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that Part 1 includes a reference to an electronic signature. The Minister of State went through in detail the great technological strides that have been made and the resultant ease of registration in all areas. Any use of technology is to be welcomed. Part 2 states that a register of wills may be maintained in any legible form or any other form capable of being converted into a legible form. This involves using the available technology. It is to be welcomed that a person can be registered from birth and given a PPS number.</P>
      <P>I also welcome that there will be a yearly report to the Minister on the effectiveness of the registration of wills. That is important because the register must be updated regularly and constant pressure applied to improve the system. Part 3, section 11, states that no person other than An tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir or another person authorised in that behalf shall be entitled to search the register or an index relating to the register. This is crucial from the point of view of privacy. Making a will is probably the most private thing a person <Col N="1285"/>or a couple will do and privacy must be guaranteed. For births, deaths and marriages the issue of privacy must be kept to the fore.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate Senator Leyden on its introduction. It is a modern, effective piece of legislation. It is a short Bill but an important one and should be given full consideration. I wish it well throughout the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>With the agreement of the House I wish to share time with Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;.</P>
      <P>I am delighted Senator Leyden has brought this Bill forward and congratulate him on doing so. It is unique and historic that a Senator from the Government side has a Bill before the House. As the Minister of State said, much data are available on computer, such as PPS numbers for children, but we need to do much more on wills and this Bill is a step in that direction. It might not be the answer to everything but it provides a way to find out where a will is, if one has been made. As public representatives we are all aware of situations that have arisen, some of which have been mentioned in this debate.</P>
      <P>As a rural Deputy I am familiar with issues surrounding land. Often when people die difficulties arise within families and among relatives over the disposal of the land. Since we introduced single farm payments under decoupling in the Common Agricultural Policy there have been problems with land entitlements which are worth a significant amount but to which title cannot be established by young farmers without a will. Under the rural environment protection scheme, people expected to receive benefits deriving from the family farm after the owner of the land passed away but if no will had been made some of the schemes fell by the wayside. In many situations, land is sold that should not be sold. If industrious farmers in Galway built up their estates when alive, buying parcels of land or getting them from the Land Commission, we found that the next generation had great difficulty finding out where title to the additional holding originated. That is a concern.</P>
      <P>The newspapers, in particular on Sundays, interview celebrities, although I am not sure what a celebrity is these days. Maybe it is somebody from showbusiness or sport. When asked if they have made a will most say they have not but will get around to it soon. It reminds me of a tradition in our diocese, Elphin, which may also exist in other parts of Ireland. The Bishop announces a &ldquo;make a will week&rdquo; every year. The charge for making a will is already small but local solicitors reduce it for that week. It is a tradition I would like to see encouraged and promoted in every diocese.</P>
      <P>Senator Brady touched on the issue of an increasing number of legal firms merging, even in smaller towns and villages. This practice is beneficial in one respect, as legal firms become <Col N="1286"/>more viable. However, smaller legal firms are also being taken over. I experienced the effects of this some years ago, when a solicitors&rsquo; firm wrote to me stating that it had taken over the small practice holding my will. Thankfully, the letter indicated that the bigger company had possession of my will, which was good to know.</P>
      <P>I worry about a similar case coming about, or of a situation in which a person makes a will in County Galway, for example, before moving to Dublin for alternative employment. The person may forget where the will is or the document may be mislaid. Although this should not happen, there are instances where it has occurred. The notion of registration would be beneficial in this regard. Solicitors have given a positive response to Senator Leyden&rsquo;s Bill. Some solicitors have made the point that the scheme is voluntary, which people will generally welcome. Senator Tuffy alluded to this point. It is good that solicitors are also welcoming the scheme.</P>
      <P>Many houses are now being built, both private housing and housing supplied by local authorities. We must be clear that the traditional family is not as prevalent as it once was. We should bear in mind that if a number of people living together wish to leave the property to another person in the house, they should be entitled and encouraged to do so rather than leave uncertain circumstances. This Bill has an air of certainty which appeals to me, and I hope that some of the points I have made will be taken on board. I thank Senator Leyden and the Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Kitt for sharing his time and I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I wonder if the offer of cut-price wills for the duration of a week in Senator Kitt&rsquo;s diocese might extend to other areas. We may all be travelling to Senator Kitt&rsquo;s area otherwise, as it appears to be a great idea.</P>
      <P>I compliment Senator Leyden on tabling this Bill. Many of us are probably kicking ourselves, wondering why we did not think of it because of its relevance and importance. Senator Leyden initiated the idea and put much time and research into it. He spoke to many people within the Houses, in the legal profession and in the general public. The Bill has been exceptionally well researched, and many questions that may arise on issues such as confidentiality have been examined in great depth. Senator Leyden has been able to allay many fears about the Bill and I commend him on doing an exceptional job. We are particularly proud that the Bill is with us in the Seanad, and that a Senator initiated it.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that a most traumatic time for people is when they experience a death. This is particularly true if the death is sudden. There is a period of time when people do not focus on the realities of life, and it can be some months later before people think of the matters of prop<Col N="1287"/>erty, legacies, wills, etc. Most people do not know where to start, although it may be possible if they know the deceased was a client of a particular solicitor. In that case, information may be sought. However, that would not happen in the majority of cases, as they do not necessarily have any paper trail.</P>
      <P>People tend to be sensitive about these types of issues and tend not to publicise difficulties that are experienced or ask questions. Several months may pass before any guidance is received and even then it may be difficult to start the process. One does not even have to go to a solicitor to make a will, as it can be made privately or a format for a will can be bought. As a result, such a document could be anywhere, not even necessarily where the deceased had lived.</P>
      <P>We have all heard many unfortunate case histories involving the courts and the media, thus increasing trauma. Many families have been divided for generations because of difficulties and differences, or worse still, suspicions and innuendo arising from an inadequacy. Everyone is aware of difficulties of this type in every community. I am pleased that the legal profession is mainly welcoming the registration of wills, as it is particularly important. The Bill would provide a location where information can be sought. The contents of a will will not be available to everyone, but it is important that one will know where to start.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt this Bill will be enacted. I hope it will be well publicised and advertised. Having the legislation is a major step forward, but it is important that it is highlighted among the public. Senator Kitt mentioned the concept of making of a will, which is an extension of the concern Senator Leyden has taken on board in initiating this legislation. This concern goes hand in hand with this legislation, as many people have not made a will. It may not have entered these people&rsquo;s minds or they may not be aware of the advantages and disadvantages. It is important to highlight the necessity of making a will. Senator Kitt&rsquo;s comments may be an aside from the central debate, but he is to be commended for publicising the issue. If the new legislation can be used as a vehicle for highlighting the ways and means of encouraging people to consider making a will, it is important to do so.</P>
      <P>Senator Leyden has done a great job for the Seanad, the Houses of the Oireachtas as a whole and, more importantly, the general public. I understand why the legal profession welcomes this Bill, as it must have experienced significant difficulties through the years involving people attempting to get their affairs in order. That profession would also have experienced difficulty in being certain that the wishes of the deceased were being honoured and complied with. Senator Leyden is to be congratulated. I hope the Bill will <Col N="1288"/>be passed expeditiously by both Houses so we can look forward to it being enacted without any great delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I would be forgiven for believing that I am back in the role of Minister. I am shepherding this Bill through the Houses and it is my job to respond to questions raised. I am thankful for the excellent contributions made by all sides of the House. I thank Senator Glynn, the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on health and children in this House, for seconding the Bill and making an excellent contribution. He outlined many issues which have been brought to his attention and which will be noted by those involved in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Senator Browne made worthwhile contributions to this debate, including a number of issues and points about charges. These issues will be addressed by regulation based on the viability of the service, namely, that it would not cost the State anything and would be self-financing. Other issues the Senator raised were also worthwhile and, as his party&rsquo;s spokesperson, I thank him for his support for the Bill. I appreciate this as we are taking an all-party approach to an issue that addresses an anomaly. One registers one&rsquo;s car, dog or television but, although they are important to each and every one of us, there are sometimes no records or registrations. There is a shortfall in the system.</P>
      <P>The Senator made a point about the retrospective aspect. This would be by voluntary disclosures and would be a matter for each legal practice. It would be in the best interests of the practices to complete a system of filing old files and to have their books centrally registered. They have individual registers of wills but having a central register for all the old wills would give them some security. I have encountered cases where the books have been destroyed or lost, leaving no records. It is a frightful responsibility for any legal firm. For this reason, I have consulted with the Law Society, which has generally welcomed the Bill. The society is currently examining it and I will ask it to suggest amendments.</P>
      <P>This Bill will be passed by consensus. It will be an unusual situation as the Minister of State and each Member of the House will table amendments, which I would welcome. We can have an open debate on these issues. We should take into consideration a good point made about British residents, namely, including a provision whereby they could register the fact that wills had been made. This is outside our jurisdiction but could be worth examining.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for contributing as I know the speech was provided by the Department of Health and Children. Having worked in that Department for a number of years, we could say that this matter is not viewed with enthusiasm by the officials. They will grow more enthusiastic <Col N="1289"/>as we do, so as to ensure the Bill becomes legislative reality. Ultimately, Ministers and Ministers of State are elected to govern and it is the responsibility of public servants to follow their lead, which is a reminder to the Department&rsquo;s officials.</P>
      <P>I know of the negotiations that took place to have this matter on today&rsquo;s Order Paper but that is for another day&rsquo;s discussion and we will not go into it now as we wish to maintain as great a degree of good will from those in the public service dealing with this issue as we can. I am impressed by the Minister of State&rsquo;s identification of important issues in the reading of the Bill, issues that will be dealt with on Committee Stage. Any matter that he or his Department feels should be included will be done so by consensus. I thank him for his enthusiasm in respect of the Bill, as I am aware of the situation that has risen in the Department due to it.</P>
      <P>Senator Tuffy is a practising solicitor and has been extremely helpful. She spoke about voluntary registration, which is quite correct. It is important that the Law Society comes on board and it would be good practice to have registration on a voluntary disclosure basis initially. I foresee a day when there will be a central depository for copies of all wills that have been registered properly and held confidentially. At present, the situation is very lax. Wills are held individually in the registers of over 2,100 offices. In many cases, one cannot determine whether certain wills exist, which is not good enough. Senator Tuffy made a number of good points about the information process once the Bill becomes law and about encouraging people to make and update wills.</P>
      <P>Senator Brady also made a number of good points. He has taken an interest in the Bill and I thank him for his help. I welcome his point about voluntary services. Death and taxes are indeed inevitable. He spoke about executors of wills. The procedure is that a will should go to probate within one year of the death of the person but it is not necessarily followed. In many cases, executors are being pressured. They may be beneficiaries of the will but so may others, such as nephews and nieces. Often, they are not enthusiastic to have a will go to probate. When we have studied the situation, we may table an amendment to tighten the Bill in this area.</P>
      <P>It has been brought to my attention that solicitors are often the sole executors of wills. This is not a good practice as, in many cases, the person in question may have no other relations. In one instance, a person left £50,000 for the saying of masses. I hope God is being good to the person but I am uncertain who ensured the masses were said. The will in question had no other executor and it was up to the solicitor to ensure the wishes were carried out. In another instance, a man who was one of the last of his family alive and lived alone decided to leave all of his land and property <Col N="1290"/>to the poor. The solicitor, who was the will&rsquo;s executor, said &ldquo;Who is poorer than myself?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Since I brought this issue into the public forum, it is unbelievable how many cases have come to my attention. People are angry about being deprived of their rights. I wish to ensure that wills are made but are also recorded and executed in proper ways.</P>
      <P>Senator Kitt has taken a great interest in the Bill and I congratulate him on having made a will. That he went to the trouble to do so is an example to everyone in the House and beyond, as is the fact that his legal firm has amalgamated. This is a good point as, in some cases, practices are sold on and none of its staff remain, meaning the new practice has no idea where a certain will has gone. Storage is a significant problem in Dublin and companies are entering into contracts to store documents.</P>
      <P>Finding a document is now very difficult, as is determining which legal firm has it. I have encountered cases where people have searched for wills in Dublin but could not find them. One sad situation involves a father who has Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and cannot make a will. He and his family are convinced that his will was made and registered with a reputable office in this city but they do not have a record of it. It is sad that his last wishes will never be honoured.</P>

I came across this anomaly over a lengthy period and found it difficult to believe. My personal assistant and backup staff researched this matter effectively and examined each situation. We brought good people on board and spoke with solicitors, including a number in Roscommon and other legal practices, and realised that there is no central registration of wills, for which reason I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I received many submissions. One person who is in the Visitors Gallery, Mrs. McCluskey, made the point that in the leaving certificate home economics course, it is stated in the family law section that people buying houses should have their wills included with the deeds. It is worthwhile to encourage awareness of wills among young people. A point Mrs. McCluskey also made that should be put on record is that where people are buying houses jointly, a will should be made on the day. In some cases, people may have previous marriages and their original spouses could have claims on that property.</P>
      <P>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for his co-operation and assistance. I thank the Minister of <Col N="1291"/>State for remaining in the House for the full length of the debate.

      <P>The social welfare system must recognise gender equality and provide economic independence for men and women. It must recognise women&rsquo;s participation in the labour market, which has <Col N="1292"/>changed significantly in recent years. In the wider context it must address matters such as enhancing work-life balance and the prevention of adult and child poverty. Unfortunately, despite our good economy we have a very high incidence of poverty among women and children.</P>
      <P>The main gaps in the social insurance system involve people working full time as homemakers, relatives assisting and atypical workers. The Minister is aware that women make up 95% of qualified adults. In 2000, approximately 28,000 women were qualified adults of spouses or partners on pensions. I do not have current figures, perhaps the Minister can assist me in that regard. The 2002 programme for Government made the following commitment, &ldquo;We will introduce a personal pension entitlement for pensioner spouses currently in receipt of qualified adult allowance set at the level of the full non-contributory pension.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Reform of the qualified adult allowance rates for pensions is critical for older women who at the age of 65 have a 41% chance of being below the 60% poverty line. The low number of people on social welfare means that the forthcoming budget is an ideal time and a great opportunity for the Minister to honour the 2002 commitment to increase the qualified adult rate to 100% of the personal payment for all payments. I will remind the Minister of that again and I will be extremely disappointed if he does not deliver on it.</P>
      <P>Regarding direct payments, where a woman is dependent on her husband for income, her vulnerability to abuse and violence is increased. In order to shift this power dynamic and increase the economic independence of women, qualified adult payments must be paid directly to the qualified adult. I recognise that since October 2002, qualified spouses and partners of people entitled to a retirement or old age pension have been given the choice of having their part of the payment paid directly to them. However, an extremely small proportion of people have opted for this, and those who did apparently acted in response to problems in the internal household distribution of income. Thousands of others must be afraid to opt for it because it would cause household tension. To eliminate that possibility we should bring this about as a right rather than an option. That matter could be easily addressed by the Minister in the forthcoming budget.</P>
      <P>The system of disregarding years spent working in the home devalues the work of homemakers and does not allow parents or carers working in the home sufficient entitlement to contributory pensions. By giving credits to homemakers with children up to the age of 12 for a maximum of 20 years, the Government will give recognition to the importance of parenting. Potentially, this affects 531,000 women officially designated as on home duties in Ireland. That is an extremely large number. Applying this measure retrospectively <Col N="1293"/>would allow women who have been carers from 1973 onwards the maximum 20 years credit for time spent caring, which could have positive implications for eligibility for a pension at the age of 66. This would include women required to give up work due to the marriage bar, which operated until 1973. The National Council on Ageing and Older People supports this measure.</P>
      <P>It is vitally important that we respect traditional choices and do not force change on women and men who have made valid life choices. Concerns have been expressed that women over the age of 55 should not be forced into the labour market. The National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland in its publication entitled <i>A Woman&rsquo;s Model for Social Welfare Reform</i> stated, &ldquo;these women should be facilitated towards independent entitlement through the use of pre-retirement allowances or credits&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>What are the Minister&rsquo;s views on making voluntary work subject to PRSI? This type of work includes parenting and caring and would allow people in this area to build up an independent social insurance record. I wish to bring to the Minister&rsquo;s attention the plight of so-called &ldquo;relatives assisting&rdquo; and farming women. The relatives assisting are often spouses of business owners and usually women. It is suggested there should be at least obligatory insurance of all workers in family businesses. Legislation could be changed to enable self-employed people to ensure their spouses and relatives assisting are fully insured.</P>
      <P>Farming women constitute a category of women working in family businesses who may face specific difficulties in arriving at self-employed status. Only 3% of farms are in joint ownership and men own 93% of farms. I was stunned to learn of this figure. While 50% of farm women have independent income and social insurance, the Irish Farmers Association has identified that the remaining 50% have no independent pension rights. This group should also be covered by social insurance.</P>
      <P>Facilitation of what is termed the &ldquo;buying a stamp&rdquo; model, by which people could self-insure with administrative ease could be useful for localised purchase of social insurance and would also facilitate women who work in the informal economy. I await the Minister&rsquo;s response to the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland&rsquo;s recommendations which I would also like to see implemented. The recommendations include the introduction of a part-time unemployment benefit and assistance for parents with children aged one to 12, so that women seeking part-time work would have their part-time unemployment recognised; a change in the S57 SI 312 1996 rule in respect of eligibility for credits to enable a re-entry credit for home-makers re-entering the system; and the abolition of the limitation rule. The rationale behind these recommendations is that part-time work is closely correlated with the <Col N="1294"/>age of school-going children rather than young babies. Women with older children are more likely to enter or re-enter the workforce when they can work part time. Over one third of unemployed women say they are seeking part-time work. Consequently, a social welfare system that only recognises availability for full-time work clearly cannot accommodate all women.</P>
      <P>To facilitate women&rsquo;s transition from care work and parenting to paid employment, the introduction of part-time unemployment assistance and benefit is necessary. The two-year rule, whereby a person with no social insurance record for more than two years must have 26 paid contributions before credits can be awarded, is particularly unfair to women as it prevents those women with interrupted employment patterns from accessing benefits. By allowing homemakers to maintain a link with the labour market through entitling them to avail of labour market supports in their own right and by abolishing the two-year rule, the Government would facilitate the transition from home-making to paid employment.</P>
      <P>The limitation rule limits the amount of benefits that two adults who are eligible for social assistance payments can receive. It assumes that two people can live more cheaply than one, thereby saving up to 15% of costs between them. Research highlights practical difficulties in determining actual economies as they differ from household to household and there is a question whether they exist.</P>
      <P>The limitation rule has led to a greater number of women being classed as adult dependants. It also affects lone parents considering living with or marrying an unemployed man. Changes in society must be acknowledged and an effort must be made to address new issues. Women must be provided with choice and barriers must not be put in their way.</P>
      <P>The inequalities and discrimination against women that I have outlined must be addressed by the Minister. Sufficient action has not been taken by the Government to address these matters. I hope the forthcoming budget and the healthy state of the Government&rsquo;s coffers will enable the Minister to address many of them. Women&rsquo;s economic independence must be increased, older women&rsquo;s poverty should be addressed and women&rsquo;s care work and access to employment should be facilitated.</P>
      <P>The Minister has admitted that the present social welfare system is unfair. I compliment him for that statement. However, I remind him that actions speak louder than words. I hope following the budget he will take the necessary action to ensure that the social welfare system is modernised and that it is not unfair.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the motion. I thank Senator Terry for tabling it and consistently raising this matter on behalf of the Fine Gael group. <Col N="1295"/>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Brennan, to the House. He is aware that the Department over which he has control rarely initiates legislation; the significant Bill every year is the Social Welfare Bill which follows the budget. It is difficult for Members on both sides to cram everything into one Bill every year. I welcome the opportunity to debate with the Minister many of these anomalies highlighted by Senator Terry in her motion.</P>
      <P>I was very encouraged by the Minister&rsquo;s remarks since becoming what used to be called the Minister for Social Welfare. He has shown an ability to think outside the box. Speaking as a former spokesperson in this area I am aware the Department is an administrative one. The Minister&rsquo;s job is to administer schemes that have been built up over the years since the first Social Welfare Bill went through the Houses. A change in one part of the social welfare code has a knock-on effect on other parts of the code. In this regard the Minister has spoken bravely about the problems for lone parents and poverty traps. In the context of preparing the budget I ask him to deal with the issues raised by Senator Terry.</P>
      <P>It is a disgrace that older women who were forced out of the public service workforce by the marriage bar are not entitled to a pension in their own right. The State forced these women out of jobs. In many cases they might have gone on to become assistant secretaries and Secretaries General of Departments. Some 40 years on, these women have no recognition by the State of that great injustice done to them. The group is getting smaller each year because of the age cohort. This is a matter which should be addressed.</P>
      <P>A more modern issue which affects both men and women is the choice made for one spouse, usually the woman, to leave the labour market for a period of approximately eight or nine years in order to work at home raising their children. This is a conscious choice made by parents. We are often told that every modern couple has a double income but that is not the case. Approximately 50% of such couples choose to have a spouse stay at home. The financial consequences of such a decision are that one cannot move to a more well-to-do area, go to the Canaries three times a year or put money aside for the children to go to private schools, if these are the choices. The State needs to recognise that not all households have two incomes. When families decide, for whatever reason, that one spouse will stay at home for eight or nine years to raise children, the State has a responsibility to recognise their decision. In this scenario, the person who stays at home should be entitled to continue to make contributions to the PRSI system. I do not suggest they get something for nothing but that they be allowed to contribute to the social insurance fund, which is, at any rate, enjoying a massive sur<Col N="1296"/>plus. Perhaps the Minister will inform the House as to the current position of the fund, which I understand has been healthy for some years.</P>
      <P>If women who look after children during their formative years were allowed to contribute to the PRSI system, they could perhaps pay a higher stamp if they subsequently choose to return to the labour market. It is immoral that eight years spent at home caring for children can be considered irrelevant in terms of reckonable pension contributions. This approach prevents people from making choices and fails to recognise families who decide to rely on one income. Those who stay at home, the vast majority of whom are women, must be facilitated. This group is not confined to women aged in their 50s or 60s but includes women with children who consciously decide that they may be able to afford to stay at home and look after their children. The families in question do not always have large incomes.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In introducing tax individualisation, the former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, also established the home carer&rsquo;s tax credit to recognise those who choose to stay at home to care for a child or dependent relative. This credit has not been increased in five years. While there is no doubt, as the amendment notes, that every family has benefited from increases in personal and PAYE tax credits, two-income couples have fared much better proportionally from these annual increases than one-income families. If it was correct to introduce a tax credit as a means of recognising home carers, why has the Government failed to increase the home carer&rsquo;s tax credit in any of the five years since Mr. McCreevy&rsquo;s third budget which introduced tax individualisation? The Government, if it is sincere in supporting all income and family types, must address this issue.</P>
      <P>I welcome the decision to cease using the despicable phrase &ldquo;adult dependant&rdquo; in the social welfare system and replace it with the term &ldquo;qualifying adult&rdquo;. Senator Terry made a valid point in this regard. Although persons receiving the qualifying adult rate can obtain the payment directly, one could argue that they should receive it automatically and as of right. Relationships being as they are, a woman who receives this payment on a weekly or monthly basis through the social welfare code has a right to it. I do not suggest that the State should act as the eyes and ears of families but if a person is entitled to a payment, he or she should receive it as of right. The low take-up referred to by Senator Terry is a matter of concern.</P>
      <P>While I welcome the continuing reduction in the once significant disparity between contributory and non-contributory old age pensions, much of it can be ascribed to the fact that women were forced out of work.</P>
      <P>If one group of women has been badly let down by successive Governments, it is widows, particularly young widows. The provisions made for <Col N="1297"/>women who find themselves widowed are appalling. Like me, the Minister will have encountered numerous tragic cases in which a husband has died prematurely leaving a young widow at the head of a family. Much more needs to do done for widows and I ask the Minister to ensure action is taken when the social welfare provisions of the budget are being framed. It is often argued that the level of paid contributions will have been insignificant and having a differential scheme would, therefore, be wrong. However, losing a spouse at a young age is an unexpected, albeit infrequent, event.</P>
    <?oasys _dc20-?><P Just="Left">I welcome the opportunity to discuss these issues with the Minister before he frames the social welfare package. I ask him to consider the points raised in this debate and deliver equity, fairness and decency in the social welfare system while ensuring it does not discriminate against women.</P><?oasys _dc0-?></Speaker>

	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P LI="1">To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>

        <?oasys _is1p8-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p2-?><?oasys _ix?>notes that child benefit is the main social welfare support paid in respect of children, that this is in most cases paid directly to the primary carer and commends the Government for the very significant progress made in improving this payment in recent years; and</P>
      <P FLI="0" el="5">
        <?oasys _is1p8-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p2-?><?oasys _ix?>notes that couples to whom the home carer tax credit applies have benefitted from all the increases in personal and PAYE tax credits in the years since its introduction&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0" el="5">I welcome the Minister to the House. I propose to address a couple of social welfare related issues referred to in the motion and amendment, focusing specifically on child benefit. There is no doubt <Col N="1298"/>the Government is delivering the largest ever sustained increase in social welfare services. Social welfare benefits and vital supports have increased by three times the rate of inflation and since 1997 all the main social welfare benefits have increased by at least twice the rate of inflation.</P>
      <P>As the Minister has stated on numerous occasions, including when he appeared before the House after last year&rsquo;s budget, Ireland spends more than &euro;12 billion on welfare entitlements, double the figure spent just four years ago. This means that for every &euro;3 of taxpayers&rsquo; money spent by the State in 2004, &euro;1 was allocated directly to child support. The rate of child benefit, which makes a significant difference in the lives of 550,000 people on lower social welfare rates, has increased fourfold in just over ten years.</P>
      <P>The Government decision to increase rates for a single payment which goes straight to the heart of the issue of child care and addresses child poverty is a tremendous achievement and a reflection of its caring focus on children. In recent years, the increases in child benefit rates have helped address the unresolved issue of child care, on which the Minister is aware of my views. Having fulfilled its primary purpose, however, it is now time to consider child benefit anew. We must ask what was its original objective, what has been achieved and what still needs to be done to address the issue of child care. Is it time to introduce a different child benefit or an additional child care cost payment? Should a new benefit be made payable on the basis of the number of children in a family? Perhaps we should consider taxing any such additional child care payment and stop increasing child benefit once the forthcoming increases to which the Government committed itself in the programme for Government are made in the budget.</P>
      <P>We should consider introducing a payment model focused on individual children. It could, for example, be set at a certain level for a child&rsquo;s early years, reduced from the ages of four to 13 years while the child is at primary school and perhaps further reduced during second level and stopped at university-going age. An alternative would be to stop payment once a child leaves national school. This model is fair because the payment would be universal. While it should not be means tested, those on high salaries who do not need it as much as others could have the payment taxed. In addition, tax credits or equivalents could be given for vouched child care expenses. In this way, those who choose to stay at home will receive a universal, non-means tested child care payment focused on the individual child and have the cost of child care addressed. The hard part is that for any child care payment to make a difference, it must be equivalent to 25% of the cost per month, which is approximately &euro;150 per child. If we provided that in the next budget or even started the process, building up to its full <Col N="1299"/>implementation in the budget after next, we would be taking the single most fundamental and radical initiative on the issue.</P>
      <P>There is also the question of disregarding income. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs will recall that we talked to him about the importance of building into the social welfare system a disregard for income earned by stay-at-home child carers. Those men and women &mdash; mostly the latter &mdash; constitute an untaxed economy of looking after children. They provide a valuable social service by caring for two, three or four children in their own home to earn a weekly income that in many cases is not declared for taxation purposes. That income should be disregarded. Taking the social welfare and taxation systems together, we can use this opportunity to make radical differences in how we address child care and its cost, which, as has been said many times here, in some households is more than what is spent on the mortgage. That is not sustainable and cannot work.</P>
      <P>Within the same ambit, I would like to deal with paid maternity leave, which is capped at a maximum of &euro;249 per week. For many people, particularly those paid a great deal more, that &euro;249 reflects nothing of the cost of living in their household. They have mortgages to pay and costs associated with insurance, VHI, car loans and other general living expenses. If a woman takes maternity leave and receives no top-up from her employer, something not all companies can afford, the family suffers a significant loss in the money it takes home to pay its monthly bills.</P>
      <P>I am not pleading that we increase that money for those 18 weeks. Instead, I am asking that the Minister for Social and Family Affairs consider extending the number of paid maternity weeks from the current 18. I am happy to accept its rising in two-week stages from 18 to 26 weeks as part of an overall child care strategy. In such a manner, between two and four years from now, paid maternity benefit would be available to women for 26 rather than 18 weeks. In conjunction with that, we could introduce paid parental leave. We have carer&rsquo;s benefit and leave, and we addressed taking time off from work to look after people with disabilities or special needs and old or sick relatives. We must pay for carer&rsquo;s leave. We should plan that, by the end of 2008, we will have a full 52-week year of paid maternity and parental leave, the latter to be taken by either the mother or the father. In that way, if people so chose, they could spend the first year of every baby&rsquo;s life at home. If we could do that and make our contribution, it would be the most radical thing ever done in the history of the State.</P>
      <P>I have very little time left, but regarding the Department of Social and Family Affairs, an MRBI customer survey in 2001 showed that 90% were satisfied with the information they had <Col N="1300"/>received from it and the services provided. The Minister ought to be proud of that level of satisfaction. It has been my experience that the information and assistance provided by the Department of Social and Family Affairs to those with whom it has dealt are something of which it should be proud and with which it should continue to follow through. I wish I had more time, but I wanted to acknowledge that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought for a moment that the motion concerned child care. However, I compliment Senator Cox on outlining areas where the Government has failed, which include that sector. She spoke in great detail and acknowledged the fact that very little has been done in the area by the current or previous Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not say or acknowledge any such thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>No major review of the social welfare system has taken place since the establishment of the Commission on Social Welfare in 1983. That contrasts poorly with other areas, such as health and education, in which we know that there has been an embarrassment of riches when it comes to reviews and reports. Unfortunately, as we know only too well, there has been very little Government implementation. During my term as a member of the Midland Health Board, approximately 128 reports were presented by the Government, with little or no action.</P>
      <P>While it has lacked the periodic review common in other areas, social welfare has seen three official reports on the system. The first, published in 1949, was a White Paper on social security. There were also two Green Papers, on a national income-related pension scheme in 1976, and on social insurance for the self-employed in 1998. I am sure that the Minister would agree that an update is overdue.</P>
      <P>The first of the three reports appeared five years after publication of the 1942 Beveridge report, which revolutionised the British social welfare system. That report had an impact on Ireland and led to a children&rsquo;s allowance being established here in 1944, one year ahead of Britain. The main vehicle for social reform has traditionally been pre-budget submissions, with the most important concern being payment rates. It was through such a submission in 1982 that the National Social Services Board called for the establishment of a commission to carry out a fundamental review of the system. The commitment to establish such a review was part of the programme of the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government that entered office in December 1982. The commission&rsquo;s main terms of reference were &ldquo;to review and report on the social welfare system and related social services and to make recom<Col N="1301"/>mendations for their development having regard to the needs of modern Irish society&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister will agree that modern Irish society has changed and evolved since 1983, but the Government has failed to modernise the social welfare system. Fine Gael calls on this lame duck Government to address and amend social welfare provisions in the upcoming budget in the light of current needs and entitlements. The main aim of social policy and social welfare is the alleviation of poverty, although Charles Murray sounded a note of caution regarding anti-poverty policy in the US when he wrote that &ldquo;we tried to provide for the poor and produced more poor instead&rdquo;. This Government is certainly guilty of producing or permitting poverty among its citizens, and we are currently second only to the United States with regard to the relatively high proportion of the population living in poverty.</P>
      <P>For example, as we approach this House each morning and leave each evening, we see people sleeping in appalling conditions in doorways, something mirrored in every town in the country. That must be a great embarrassment to a Dublin-based Minister for Social and Family Affairs and the current lame duck Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government. They should be named and shamed as the Government responsible for our spending much less on social protection than other European countries, with the greatest gap between rich and poor of any member state.</P>
      <P>Let us recall the millions of euro of taxpayers&rsquo; money wasted on aborted schemes such as e-voting, PPARS, Abbotstown, the faulty port tunnel and, last but not least, the website that never saw the light of day. It is the Minister&rsquo;s job to deal with that, but year after year nothing happens. The gap widens, and successive social welfare and pension Bills fail to rectify the problem. According to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, more than 50,000 householders are on the waiting list for social housing, and the estimated number of homeless households remains high, in 2002 totalling 3,773, compared with 3,743 in 1999. The number of children living in overcrowded, damp houses that are in disrepair has more than doubled between 1991 and 2002.</P>
      <P>President McAleese is quoted in today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> as saying at the Filling the Vacuum conference that Ireland is at a crossroads where it could seek to become an equal society in which there was compassion for others, or a State wrapped in individualism, deaf to the voices of the excluded. We know this Government is deaf and blind when it comes to the marginalised in our society. My colleague, Senator Terry, outlined the ways in which this Government has deliberately fostered social exclusion and the areas most affected. Why has the Minister turned his back on families and individuals who are struggling to survive on inadequate social welfare <Col N="1302"/>provision while the rich get richer with the assistance of this shameful Government?</P>
      <P>The Minister must give serious consideration to the fuel allowance for the elderly and less well off. That has not been addressed by the Government although it has been in power for eight years. The neglect of our elderly, some of whom in rural areas are living in cold conditions, is shameful.</P>
      <P>The Government has cut the essential repair and disabled persons grants for the elderly. When I was a councillor ten years ago, an elderly person could get up to £22,500 under the disabled persons grant, and £16,000 under the essential repair grant. The maximum elderly people are getting now in the disabled persons grant is &euro;12,000 and the essential repair grant is a maximum of &euro;5,000. It is a pittance compared to what the Minister should be paying to the elderly and less well off.</P>
      <P>In a time of plenty, the elderly, sick and less well off are suffering most. That is the reality. The Government can have as many spin doctors as it wants but I am talking about the reality, something I know about as a person on the ground in touch with the community, as are all my colleagues. People on the Government side of the House turn a blind eye to reality but come the next general election, the people will be waiting in the long grass to give the Minister their answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate the Government on the progress made to date. The Government will spend more than &euro;12 billion on welfare entitlements, double the figure of only four years ago. For every &euro;3 of taxpayers&rsquo; money spent by the State in 2005, &euro;1 will go to welfare support. This year, welfare benefits and vital supports have increased by three times the rate of inflation. Since 1997, all the main benefits have increased by at least twice the rate of inflation. Every week, almost 1 million welfare payments are made to 1.5 million men, women and children. Child benefit has increased fourfold in ten years. Almost 550,000 people on the lower welfare rates have received a sizable lift. The respite grant has been increased and extended, benefiting 30,000 carers. The Government is committed to increasing the State pension to &euro;200 by 2007 and to increasing the lowest welfare rates to &euro;150 by 2007. The Government is currently working on pensions, an issue I have often discussed with the Minister and to which he will refer when responding to the motion.</P>
      <P>It is useful that we are having this debate today instead of after the budget when discussing the Social Welfare Bill. I do not have in-depth knowledge about how the system works. The Department of Social and Family Affairs operates a cumbersome system and its administration is difficult for me to understand. I have to read and <Col N="1303"/>re-read some of the legislation passed dealing with the respite grants offered. That is not to say that great work is not being done but the Department is not connecting with the public. The Minister referred to that himself and it is important in the modernisation of the structure and the implementation of benefits that will arise. The system should be simplified to allow the public to get on with commending the Government on its work to date.</P>
      <P>The motion refers to personal pension entitlement for pensioners&rsquo; spouses. I commend the Government on that concept; it is good that we should introduce it. The Government has introduced measures to extend the level of social protection and enhance social inclusion through the social insurance system and that is also very good &mdash; more people will have access to social welfare benefits.</P>
      <P>Child benefit has improved. It is now paid to the mother or primary carer for the benefit of the child. Child benefit delivers a standard rate of payment in respect of all children in a family regardless of income levels or employment status without any PRSI conditions and it is not means tested or taxed.</P>
      <P>The Minister should consider giving people the option of staying at home to mind their children. If I had my choice, that is where I would be putting emphasis. I would love to see women who want to stay at home being able to reach an arrangement with their employers where they could retain their career prospects when they decide to return to the workforce after four years. Child care must be more than that but I would like to see the Government making it easy for a mother to stay at home if she thought she could return to the workforce. That is where I would like to see children &mdash; in their own environment, rather than in cr&egrave;ches, which I have seen and am not happy with.</P>
      <P>There are anomalies in administration and implementation. There are women who had to leave the public service because of the marriage ban. Many of them have not had their cases addressed and the Minister should examine this area.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister on the work he is doing. He has a grasp of this area, develops concepts clearly and delivers on them. I wish the Minister well in the budget. He has an important role because a great deal of money is allocated to his Department and it is only with the expertise of the Minister can we bring about a system that will be understood by the public at large.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I want to comment on the general topic of the motion without going into some of the specifics.</P><Col N="1304"/>
      <P>This is an important area. It touches people&rsquo;s real, lived experience and it is not appropriate for any of us to engage in a polemical, partisan series of attacks. What we must do in this House is urge the Minister to take as constructive a role in this area as possible and to be as helpful as possible.</P>
      <P>I want to raise a number of issues that may, apparently, be marginal but at the same time are very important. When I first read the motion I was struck by the use of the word &ldquo;spouse&rdquo;. I would make a serious point to the Minister, namely, that I abhor the way the Government behaved with regard to a case in the past few years that came before the Equality Tribunal established by the Government. This case involved a same-sex couple, one of whom felt that he should have been entitled to the same travel privileges as other employees&rsquo; spouses. The Equality Tribunal found in favour of this couple but the response of the Government was not to move to redress the inequity or the discrimination but to move legislatively to copperfasten it by redefining the word &ldquo;spouse&rdquo;. I know the Minister is a decent, intelligent and compassionate man but it is not appropriate in this day and age that people like me should be defined by legislation into second-class citizenship of this country. It is simply not acceptable any more and I regret very much, as an Irish citizen and as a representative in the Upper House of Parliament, that this Parliament processed and passed the only discriminatory legislative measure in this area that I know of in any European country over the past ten or 15 years. I hope this will be examined again because it is no longer acceptable that people are regarded, simply on the basis of sexual orientation, as being second-class citizens.</P>
      <P>The other aspect I want to examine is a very specific area in which I know the Minister can have an impact. I am aware that things are moving and improving but I refer to the question of the social welfare appeals system. I raise this matter because I was asked during the week to launch a report on this by the Northside Community Law Centre. These are the most vulnerable and marginalised people. Most of the people who go through the appeals system have an income of less than &euro;15,000 a year and are therefore on the margins. Many of them are people who have a disability and so on.</P>
      <P>The first point that is made in this report, and it is a useful one, is that there is at least a perception of lack of independence because the appeals board is within the Department. In the course of preparing this report an internationally comparative survey was undertaken, which looked at the experience of other countries, including the United Kingdom. The point was made that where people who are civil servants are hearing appeals on decisions taken by their senior fellows, there may be very high levels of integrity but there is at least the perception of a lack of independence. <Col N="1305"/>What is needed with an appeals board is guaranteed independence and the perception of that independence.</P>
      <P>There were a number of practical suggestions in the report. As some of these claimants, or appellants, do not have the highest levels of social skills or educational attainment they, as indeed many of us, and I include myself in that, are easily intimidated by the need to fill in forms, which can be a little bewildering. The point was made that as in some other countries, it might be possible to examine the situation where the initial claim could be registered either electronically or by telephone to make it as consumer friendly as possible.</P>
      <P>The research groups indicated that officials of the Department went out of their way to be courteous and co-operative and to give as much information as they could, without which this report could not have been compiled. It is important to put that on the record in case it is perceived I am criticising for the sake of criticising but they did make the point that figures are not always available in areas where they would be useful. I will give one example of that. Many of the claimants or appellants felt that they would have had a much better chance if they had been legally represented. There are no figures available on this and I urge the Minister to continue to co-operate with these research groups because there will be further research programmes to ascertain these figures and to make them available. A clear view would then emerge from these figures because although we do not have figures within this jurisdiction, we do have them from the neighbouring jurisdiction, the United Kingdom, and in particular from the North. The figures in the North show very clearly that the success rate of appellants under their appeal system is actually doubled where they have legal representation. That suggests to me that there may be a significant number of people who have their appeals disallowed, not because of the invalidity of their claim but because of the lack of expertise or polish with which that claim is presented; that could be looked at if they had legal representation.</P>
      <P>I understand that the situation in law is that there is no absolute statutory requirement that legal aid be given but, on the other hand, opinion has been sought and has stated that whereas this is not mandatory, at the same time if it was decided to refuse or to deny legal aid, a court might regard that as being <i>ultra vires</i> and it might then hold that the appellant was entitled to legal representation. In terms of fairness, decency and justice, when a situation arises where it seems obvious from figures from the other part of the island albeit in the absence of our own, it seems clear that legal representation does lead to success.</P><Col N="1306"/>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure it will be an expanded half minute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;or 30 seconds if the Senator prefers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like another minute and 30 seconds. I hope the Minister has received a copy of this report and that he will read it. It contains many graphs and so on, which I do not particularly like, but there is also the human face. There are six case histories in the report. One, for example, concerns a woman who applied for a one-parent family payment. She was denied on the grounds that she had made insufficient attempts to get maintenance. She did not know what that phrase meant. She felt she had done everything she could. It turned out that they wanted her to get a court order for maintenance but she did not want to do that for the very human and understandable reason that her husband was violent. He was still in the home and she was afraid that if she applied for a court order she would be whacked again. It is not right that she should be forced to do something that would jeopardise her well-being.</P>
      <P>Problems sometimes arise as a result of a conflict between the claimant&rsquo;s own medical opinion and the opinion of the medical assessor. In one case, a woman turned up three times for a medical assessment. The first time the medical assessor did not turn up. The second time he turned up but he did not have the necessary equipment to measure her disability. The third time he gave her a cursory examination. That is not appropriate.</P>
      <P>I ask the Acting Chairman to allow me to mention the final case. I raised a similar case some years ago in the Seanad successfully and the Minister at the time was compassionate. It is about the way in which one entitlement is subtracted from another so that people get the minimum payment. The case concerns disability allowance.</P>

	<P>The Senator has taken a flexible approach to 30 seconds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am just finishing. This woman was claiming disability allowance. She then took up a F&Aacute;S course and was denied the disability allowance. She was also a lone parent. Had she claimed the lone parents allowance, which she did not, she could have kept that payment and taken up the F&Aacute;S course. It seems daft to me that because she did not claim the right one she was denied a payment the Department had been paying.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It looked for a repayment of &euro;3,000 and took away the payment, which I am glad to say was restored on appeal. I raised the issue of a blind student.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator, 30 seconds is not 2 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am only on 25. The blind student got a scholarship to do a PhD in history. By way of reward they subtracted the value of the scholarship from the blind allowance. That is mean and penny pinching. Somebody with a disability who has the gumption to do something for themselves should be encouraged and supported, not penalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and support the amendment. I do not know any Minister for social welfare who has done as much work and spoken as much on pensions as Deputy Brennan. As the Minister has pointed out, we have a serious problem. Of the 2 million people in the workforce 900,000 have no private or work pension and a high proportion of those are women. I would like the Government to do more on the issue of pensioners&rsquo; spouses. When one refers to the qualified adult portion of a pension it generally refers to situations where the payments are split among family members due to disharmony. Although the Department of Social and Family Affairs is good at doing that there should be an administrative and legal basis for the direct payment of those payments rather than the Department having to intervene.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Senator Cox proposed the amendment on the question of social inclusion and the social insurance system. I asked farmers in 1998 why they would not join that sort of scheme. There was strong resistance against it at the time, but people later regretted that they had not taken the opportunity. We have resolved that issue for self-employed people.</P>
      <P>It may not be fair to blame the issue of local authority members on the Minister. I find it hard to understand. I was in a local authority for 17 years and received a gratuity, but I was also a Member of the Oireachtas. Councillors who have been with a local authority for 20 years wonder why they cannot get a social welfare payment &mdash; like local authority staff &mdash; when they leave or lose their council seats. The Seanad has been supportive of those councillors but the D&aacute;il and the Ministers who have spoken on the matter have not. Whether it is the responsibility of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs or the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government we must address this issue. Whether one is a county councillor or a local authority <Col N="1308"/>staff member, one makes a contribution to the people and that should be recognised. I hope the Minister can examine this issue.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I welcome what has been said about child benefit, which has increased four-fold in the last ten years. I saw a debate on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; last night about the child care package in the forthcoming budget. Expectations are high. I support what has been said on giving parents choice on child care and I reject any suggestion that there may be no increase in child benefit. Child benefit has done much good and while other ways may be examined it must be maintained.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris pointed out that the Department sometimes gives support with one scheme and takes it away with another. I have spoken previously to the Minister on this. We have improved the farm assist to small farmers. This has not been referred to recently. I was glad to see the carers&rsquo; allowance improved in the last budget but I have seen a farm assist recipient who applied for the carers&rsquo; allowance losing out. Although the Department gives a person in this situation the better option, it is amazing to see it happening.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The issue of lone parents must be examined and I hope the Minister will do his best. When a recipient of the lone parents&rsquo; payment enters part-time employment, it is ludicrous that he or she loses the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance, as happened in August and September this year. This should not happen. When the community employment scheme began approximately 15 years ago a person with a medical card who joined a F&Aacute;S scheme was allowed to keep his or her medical card. This must be addressed seriously.</P>
      <P>Some of these many issues are not exactly the Minister&rsquo;s responsibility but they affect the elderly. We are going to talk about the elderly and qualified adult pensions. Other Senators spoke on the central repairs grants and housing repairs for the elderly. The Minister should look at this situation, or one Minister should examine all the schemes for the elderly. The funding must be provided for all those schemes. I hope the fuel allowance for the elderly will be increased in the budget as energy cost have increased. Many pensioners have mentioned that those living alone have increasing expenses and people on those pensions should be supported.</P>
      <P>The respite grant is one of the best grants I have seen recently. It benefits 30,000 carers. Many people do not realise that it is paid irrespective of whether a person receives carer&rsquo;s allowance; that is unique. No other country has a system like it. I hope it will continue and the benefits will be increased. The Minister is committed to increasing the pension to &euro;200 by 2007. The Minister is working towards that and hopefully the next budget will include another step.</P><Col N="1309"/>
      <P>Social welfare schemes should try to improve situations and not, as Senator Norris said, give with one hand and take with the other. It is not intentional but it happens and the means tests are the problem. Although the income disregard has been increased in every budget, I would like the means test to be abolished for some of those schemes, in particular the carers&rsquo; allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and I thank Senator Terry for placing this motion before us. It is traditional that the Opposition place a motion, the Government tables an amendment and we have a political debate. That is part of the political discourse, but social welfare and policy is important. Regardless of the results of the inevitable vote, I hope the Minister will take on board the statements by both sides of the House. During the last Cabinet reshuffle it appeared that the Minister was unwilling to move to this Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>That was a media comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has done a fine job. His is one of the major positions within Cabinet and a role of great importance to every family. Almost everybody must liaise with the Department of Social and Family Affairs at some stage. Those issues that come under the aegis of the Minister are ones that require ongoing investigation, debate and dialogue. I am aware he is committed to change within the Department, some of which has already happened. To make use of Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s election phrase, there is a lot done and a lot more to do. I hope this work will continue. The issues outlined in the motion and articulated by Senator Terry must be taken on board.</P>
      <P>The budget for which the Minister has responsibility is enormous, comprising a sum of money on which the entire State was run some years ago. This budget encompasses a great number of schemes in respect of which there are significant anomalies that cause difficulties for many people. This issue was raised by Senators Norris and Kitt and is worthy of ongoing debate. It is a feature of our unusual political system that all Members must keep in regular contact with constituents. Every day, each of us speak to people who have queries in regard to the various social welfare schemes. It is important that we try to address the anomalies that exist. The Minister is working in this direction but there is a long way to go.</P>
      <P>Other Members raised the issue of pensions, both contributory and non-contributory, and the question of PRSI contributions. Recent remarks from the Minister indicate this area is to the fore in his policy considerations. The next Taoiseach and Government, no matter the make-up, must give consideration to the creation of a Depart<Col N="1310"/>ment of pensions, as is the case in many European states. An administrative weakness of this State is that we have more or less the same Departments that were in place 60 or 70 years ago.</P>
      <P>Social welfare in its broadest sense is a major challenge and new challenges are emerging in this area. Within the ambit of social welfare, the issue of pensions is, as the Minister and other Members have said, a time bomb waiting to go off. In the course of the next five to ten years, we must demonstrate our serious intent in this regard by establishing a dedicated Department charged with the responsibility of tackling the pension issue. This is something the next Administration must take on board.</P>
      <P>The child benefit payment, one of the traditional means of helping families, has been a great success. One can present all types of ideological arguments as to different ways of approaching it but, ultimately, we should not attempt to fix what is not broken. Child benefit is an effective measure. All we ask is that the Minister should continue to ensure there are realistic and meaningful increases. Child benefit has a role to play in our collective endeavours to devise an effective solution in regard to child care, which is akin to a large jigsaw encompassing different problems and requiring various solutions. Child benefit has an important function in this regard. I hope next month&rsquo;s Budget Statement by the Minister for Finance will include significant increases in this allowance. Such increases are necessary not only in the context of child care provision but also in terms of the broader good of society.</P>
      <P>The farm assist scheme to which Senator Kitt referred is a useful provision. From my knowledge of the farming community and the queries I receive, however, it seems many of those entitled to this benefit do not claim it. There is a responsibility on us to ensure, through increased advertising and other means, that all those in rural areas entitled to partake in this scheme will benefit from the meaningful assistance it provides to low-income families. In addition, the Department of Agriculture and Food has introduced a social scheme in rural areas which allows people to work with their communities and receive a social assistance payment. This also has a role to play in keeping rural communities alive.</P>
      <P>I support what has been said about the carer&rsquo;s allowance. Senator Terry has put forward Private Members&rsquo; motions on this topic in the past. It is an outstanding scheme for those who receive benefit from it. Unfortunately, however, the means testing requirement ensures the majority of those who provide full-time care for elderly relatives do not receive financial support. With the introduction of last year&rsquo;s respite grant, the Minister moved towards a type of universal payment and recognition of care in the home or community. As a policy statement, we should have <Col N="1311"/>no hesitation in offering financial support to any person, poor or slightly richer, who looks after a relative or neighbour on a full-time basis.</P>
      <P>The cost to the State of providing for a person to be looked after in his or her home is far less than that involved in placing the person in a community facility, district hospital or private nursing home. For every &euro;250 or &euro;300 the Department pays in carer&rsquo;s allowance, hundreds of euro are saved from the weekly budget of the Department of Health and Children. I appeal strongly to the Minister, who I know is examining this issue, to consider dropping the means test for the carer&rsquo;s allowance. It would transform the way the elderly are looked after and would be worthwhile from both an economic and social perspective.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Terry&rsquo;s comments in regard to the extension of PRSI support for those who work in the voluntary sector. Volunteerism has disappeared. An international effort last year to stem the tide, the International Year of the Volunteer, was insufficient. We must show practical support for the volunteer effort. The Minister should, through the various schemes in his Department, try to ensure that those who give voluntary help and support to their communities, to the great benefit of society at large, are given some type of PRSI recognition.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the political divide that will take place in an hour&rsquo;s time, I hope the Minister will take on board what Senator Terry has said. The issues she has raised point to the practical, necessary components of an effective social structure to underpin our economic growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister. Senator Bradford is wrong about the lack of volunteers. Dr. Mary Redmond pointed out to us last year that at least 250,000 people do some voluntary work. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, large numbers of people, from all walks of life and of all ages, engage in voluntary work. They are unsung heroes.</P>
      <P>Yesterday morning, the Carers&rsquo; Association, led by its chief executive officer, Mr. Enda Egan, presented an excellent outline of its pre-budget submission and, in so doing, provided an insight into the massive contribution made by home carers to our health service and society. According to the most recent census results, 150,000 people are family carers, of whom 50,000 work in a full-time capacity providing at least 42 hours of care each week. In many instances, full-time caring involves a commitment 24 hours a day, seven days a week. These 150,000 carers together provide 3 million hours of care each week, saving the State an estimated &euro;1.5 billion annually in comparative health service care. Combined, they provide 90% of community care. They are responsible for caring for some of our most vulnerable citizens. Being a family carer means car<Col N="1312"/>ing for a child with a disability, an adult with a disability, a terminally ill spouse or child or an older relative.</P>
      <P>One in six of the 150,000 carers receive a carer&rsquo;s allowance of &euro;150,000 per week. Compare this with the cost of providing formal residential care, which ranges from between &euro;600 and &euro;1,300 per week. The carer&rsquo;s allowance amounts to just under &euro;8,000 per annum for providing full-time care. These people provide this massive service on behalf of the health service.</P>
      <P>Carers are on constant call due to the high levels of social and health care required. Many carers are in poor health as a result of the physical, social and emotional effects of providing long-term, high level care without basic supports. One of the speakers yesterday, Ms Anne Hughes, a single mother, spoke of her full-time care for her 26 year old child who suffers from an intellectual disability. She said that the strain of full-time caring without support left her suffering from depression and insomnia.</P>
      <P>In this context, the pre-budget demands of the Carers&rsquo; Association are far from unreasonable. It listed nine objective areas where it wishes to see progress in the budget. A national strategy for carers should be developed as a priority and should consist of the following important components: comprehensive services and support for family carers; enhancing and supporting carers&rsquo; health and well-being; an adequate and fair system of remuneration for carers; education and training for carers; and work-life balanced policies that support carers. Full-time carers should be entitled to a medical card and a comprehensive health check each year to ensure their physical, social and mental well-being is protected. After all, they provide 3 million hours of care every week, a substantial contribution to the care of others.</P>
      <P>Full-time carers deserve fair remuneration. As part of a national strategy, the allowance should be increased to &euro;190 per week, which is equal to the nursing home subvention grant the Government gives to private nursing homes to care for disabled people. This allowance should ultimately be increased and linked to the levels of pay of the labour market equivalent within three years. A problem for many family carers caused by current social welfare rules is that a person in receipt of widow&rsquo;s or widower&rsquo;s pension, old age pension or lone parents allowance is not entitled to apply for, or to receive, carer&rsquo;s allowance. The social welfare system only allows a person to receive one benefit. The sum of &euro;153 per week or under &euro;8,000 per year for carers must be re-examined.</P>
      <P>Finally, I wish to refer to work-life balance. This issue is of great importance and interest for me. As part of my new approach to child care, I propose to introduce a Bill in the Seanad, the flexible working Bill. If I can get the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy <Col N="1313"/>Martin, and the Cabinet to agree, it will be introduced in the next couple of months.</P>

	<P>We will support the Senator anyway. The Senator might not be able to support it herself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Ross told me last week that the Independent Senators would look after it for me. He said they would take it over and deal with it. However, I had better be diplomatic. I have a hill to climb.</P>
      <P>The flexible working Bill is one of the propositions in my child care document. As happens in the UK, we should have legislation whereby a parent with a child under six years old or a disabled child under 18 should be entitled to negotiate special flexible working arrangements with their employer. The employer should have a statutory obligation to negotiate. That does not mean the employer must accept the proposition but this is part of 21st century working. With the availability of e-mail, laptop computers, broadband and teleworking, there is no reason that people must be under the same roof from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The flexible working Bill will not only be a contribution to child care but also be helpful for a parent with a disabled child.</P>
      <P>Recently, <i>The Irish Times</i> published an article on research that was carried out into flexible working. Despite the fact that Irish management is supportive of the concept of flexible working, only 11% of Irish companies allow it, compared with 55% of European companies. The research showed that the management of Irish companies is more inclined to utilise flexible working itself rather than allow the staff to do so. Even though a new document published yesterday by IBEC and ICTU promotes the concept of work-life balance and flexible working, I intend to go further and introduce a Bill in the Seanad to enshrine it in legislation. I hope the Members will support me in that.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I have said on many previous occasions that I will support the Minister&rsquo;s suggestion in that regard, although I suspect he is not getting enough support for it. I believe in the concept that a year&rsquo;s work should have a year&rsquo;s pension contribution or entitlement attached to it. Even if that requires legislation which people from my side of the labour spectrum or people on the other side do not like, it would be the most important decision on pensions in the history of the State. It is crucial.</P>
      <P>There is much talk about the European exposure or liability with regard to pensions. As bad as it is here, we are much better off than countries such as Italy and Germany. However, that is no reason to rest on our laurels. The Minister should push forward with his proposal. I hope there will be a move towards that objective in the next budget. IBEC is correct that it will impose costs on employers. The organisation will have to deal with that. Some of the unions will oppose it because they do not want their members paying into it. We should take them all on about this. As a union member and general secretary I have tried to push that concept, unsuccessfully, on many occasions. I still believe in it. It would be a revolutionary change and I compliment the Minister on raising it. I would be delighted to support it wherever the Minister can do it, even if we can only move forward step by step.</P>
      <P>I strongly support Senator Bradford&rsquo;s comment that this is not really a party political issue. It always upsets me that social welfare issues become caught in party crossfire. There is a broad consensus on social welfare but there are issues <Col N="1315"/>that must be addressed. The carers&rsquo; issue, which has been mentioned by all speakers in this debate, is hugely important. Everybody supports carers.</P>
      <P>I wish to link this to the broader societal shifts that have occurred. The major societal shift is in the structure of our communities. We now have nuclear families and units. When I was a child, if somebody on the street had a serious illness or a family had suddenly fallen into bad times or had some difficulty with a son or daughter in America or in the UK, everybody on the street knew about it and there was a support structure.</P>
      <P>If someone was not working for a week due to an aspect of his or her job, some level of support came through at the local shop and various other places. In many areas, these societal and community structures are gone. In towns and cities, particularly Dublin, one could be living next door to a family trying to cope with an extraordinary problem, such as separation, a bereavement, a child with a difficulty or a problem in the extended family, without knowing and with no supports available as a result. This is an additional reason as to why the carers&rsquo; issue is important.</P>
      <P>This motion has to do with the redistribution of society&rsquo;s wealth. The Minister&rsquo;s job in Cabinet is to fight for a fairer redistribution. If benchmarks are to be placed on our society and democracy, one must be how well the disadvantaged, not necessarily economic, and those with dependencies are cared for. I hope that gives grist to the mill, strength to the Minster&rsquo;s elbow. No one must apologise for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs demanding a greater share of the wealth cake when it is redistributed. On the other hand, the Minister and his departmental Accounting Officer have a duty to ensure that money is not wasted. This debate must be about how best can we direct and focus social welfare spending.</P>
      <P>The contradictory issues in this debate, such as a lone parent losing certain allowances, gives out the wrong message when we want to have an energetic and buoyant economic community. We must support people who have what is termed a &ldquo;get up and go&rdquo; attitude. Similarly people with disabilities, such as the example given by Senator Norris, must not lose out because they take on extra responsibilities and improve themselves. I hope the Minister shares this view.</P>
      <P>All dependants, whether they are unemployed, for whatever reason, aged, which we are all facing if we live long enough, people coping with disabilities or their extended family supporting someone coping with a disability, need to have their share. I support the point made by Senator Bradford on the social capital of volunteers. As a large number is involved in voluntary caring, it is important that they are in a structured process, <Col N="1316"/>entitling them to build up contribution records through stamps or other appropriate methods. I ask the Minister to bring forward such a system in the forthcoming budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator O&rsquo;Toole for sharing his time. The Minister knows in his own heart that those who are so disabled that they need personal assistance have the greatest difficulty in getting care. To date, we have relied on community employment schemes to provide personal assistants for this group. They have been doing a very good job. However, as soon as they are trained to be useful to the person to whom they are assigned, they are frequently at the end of the scheme and must be moved on. This area must be mainstreamed. Core funding must be introduced so that those who have been trained as personal care assistants can continue to be employed in 19 hours a week care. They help to give those they care for lives outside of homes, independence and the chance to socialise. Introducing such funding in the budget would do a tremendous service, not just to them, but to the community itself. All Members want to see people who are not able to partake in society have that opportunity to become integrated into it.</P>
      <P>The first time I went to Russia, I never saw anyone in a wheelchair. This was not because there was no one in Russia in a wheelchair but because no facilities or thought were given to ensuring wheelchair-users could become involved in social life. No matter what my complaints may have been about American society, one always saw people with disabilities getting a chance to become involved in society. I would be most grateful if the Minister could ensure these paid carers, at &euro;12 an hour, are considered to be professionals in their jobs and allowed to continue in the positions they have been placed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Terry and those on the Opposition side of the House for putting down this motion. Members are correct that it is good to discuss these issues before the budget. That is why I listened carefully, taking detailed notes of those practical suggestions on which I can move. I agree with most of them, quibble with others, but by and large support their direction. I thank both sides of the House for their contributions which will not be lost as I have listened carefully to what has been said. I can put these alongside what I have heard in the D&aacute;il, from the various associations and from my officials and experts.</P>
      <P>This is an important debate, the timing of which could not be better. Hour by hour we are working on these issues in preparation for the forthcoming budget and the social welfare and pensions Bills. Many issues were raised on how the social welfare system works for women. Senator Terry quoted me as saying the system <Col N="1317"/>was unfair. I do not believe I meant to say that for the whole system. However, I believe the social welfare system is not fair to women. It has gone some distance with some improvements but in matters such as pensions, including those for former civil servants, child care, qualified adult status, men have done far better from the system than women. I am determined to reverse this situation in my time in office. The first step is to acknowledge it and then resolve it.</P>
      <P>My top priorities are to make progress on combating child poverty and the reforms of allowances for lone parents. I believe the social policies in the latter area are not progressive. I have proposals, particularly concerning cohabitation and the encouragement to work which I will introduce presently. I have a passionate belief that everyone must have a decent pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>What pulling and dragging we must do between us to provide this is part of political business. As long as I have the honour to hold this ministerial post, I will fight tooth and nail to ensure everyone has a decent pension. It may not be a &ldquo;one-size-fits-all&rdquo; answer. We must examine both the non-contributory and contributory pensions.</P>
      <P>We must also do more in that area, particularly on the issue of disregards. A non-contributory pensioner is allowed to earn &euro;7 or &euro;8 per week but anything above that starts to eat into the pension. I will return to that area at another time.</P>
      <P>Next week I will launch the report from the Pensions Board which I have now received. I will put it up for debate for a short period before we bring proposals forward for action in this area. The Pensions Board has grappled with several issues and the answers are not simple. Perhaps, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole suggested, we should sweep aside all the complexities and deal with it in a simple but courageous way. Those are words politicians often must eat afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Like the famous line in &ldquo;Yes Minister&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge the points made about the role of women in the welfare system, the requirement to reform the pension system, the lone parent system and particularly child poverty. I also acknowledge the work of carers. We introduced a &euro;1,000 respite grant to help make the jobs of carers easier and enable them to become more professionally involved, on which I have had a number of meetings with the Carers&rsquo; Association. The Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and I recently met with the association and discussed many of these issues. I support the association&rsquo;s determination to have a national carers&rsquo; strategy and promise to work with it on this.</P><Col N="1318"/>
      <P>I also acknowledge Senator Bradford&rsquo;s point that when there are 53 or 54 different schemes there are bound to be anomalies. Similarly when one spends &euro;12.5 billion. Senator Bannon pointed out, as did other Senators such as Senator Norris, that if people move from one scheme to another they can lose out. They might have not enough stamps for one or the thresholds may be different for another. It can be a nightmare to negotiate one&rsquo;s way through. My responsibility is to remove those anomalies. We removed some last year and we will remove more in the period ahead. If suggestions made here today can be carried out we will do so but when there are rules people fall either side of them.</P>
      <P>The system is there for the individual, not <i>vice versa</i>. It must be tailored to the needs of individuals because individuals do not think departmentally. They have needs, whether they be in the field of health, education or welfare and we must design our systems so that they can be tailored to meet the needs of the individual at the time, rather than a one size fits all hand down, whereby if people do not fit a particular size and shape of scheme they do not qualify. Clarity is important on the way forward.</P>
      <P>On the motion itself, Irish society was based on the traditional family unit, which gave rise to the marriage bar. The bar was removed in 1973 but structures remained whereby women were largely dependent on their husbands from a financial point of view. This has had an effect on the number of women who qualify for pensions in their own right and successive Governments have sought to introduce greater flexibility in that area. In 2000 a special half-rate pension was introduced.</P>
      <P>I will clarify entitlements under the homemakers&rsquo; scheme. The scheme allows up to 20 years spent on caring duties to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s insurance record is being averaged to assess entitlement for contributory pension purposes. This set of measures is of particular benefit to women who may have less than complete social insurance records due to working in the home. At present, approximately 87% of women over 65 years of age resident in Ireland receive social welfare support, either in their own right or as qualified adults. With improved social insurance coverage, easing of qualifying conditions and improved workforce participation more people, particularly women, will qualify for contributory payments in the future. Despite these improvements, there are some people who cannot qualify for a pension in their own right. In the motion Senator Terry has drawn attention to a number of those.</P>
      <P>Qualified adult allowance rates are now 66% of the main rate and there is a commitment to raise it to 70%. Senator Terry&rsquo;s motion calls for it to be paid directly and brought up to the level of the contributory pension. She pointed out that <Col N="1319"/>it is in our programme for Government. I have costed it and it is extremely expensive but I support the idea of paying the qualified adult allowance directly to the person involved, which is usually the woman. It is possible to do that and 7% of new pension claimants have opted for the arrangement. The fact that it is not widely taken up suggests two conclusions. Either there is no demand for it or there is a demand but, given the nature of Irish society, that demand is not effective. I incline to the latter. There are a number of difficult issues to be resolved in deciding that it will not be paid to the man but in a separate cheque to the woman. However, I am attracted to the idea and will try to make progress.</P>
      <P>A number of other issues were raised and with permission I will not go into them all in this debate. The script I have circulated deals with many of the issues raised in the motion. Perhaps the Senators would agree to take the contents of the script as part of my response. I wanted to make general personal comments and the script deals with the details of many of the issues which have arisen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for his comments. The issue of carers in the home was referred to earlier. I worked with the Carers&rsquo; Association for over 12 months and I am aware of the work that spouses, children and others in the home carry out. It is work that needs every assistance from Government, including regular respite care. Home help workers and home carers from the health boards from another part of the community who do not get the credit they deserve. They do tremendous work in helping families cope with family members that are infirm, elderly or unable to care for themselves. We should do everything we can to help these people. We have an increasingly elderly population and that trend will continue in coming years so we need to have a policy in place to cater for them in the future.</P>
      <P>As well as the voluntary sector, farmers&rsquo; wives are a group not covered by PRSI contributions. They work in the home and on the farm but are not entitled to a pension in their own right. It is necessary to work outside the home to get stamps or pay PRSI to qualify for a pension. The Minister said he hoped everybody in the country would be entitled to a pension.</P>
      <P>Another group not covered by PRSI are councillors. Councillors throughout the country are paid a representational allowance, which is taxed, but they are not allowed pay PRSI. This is discrimination, as many of these people work full-time as public representatives but are treated differently than any other section of the community, or any section within the public service. This should not be tolerated, and councillors should be allowed or be required to pay PRSI <Col N="1320"/>contributions. This would put them into the social welfare system.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of principle, justice and equity that these people be included in the social welfare system. They give many hours working to represent their communities throughout the country. Although they receive a representational allowance, they never qualify for a pension. It is within the aegis of the Minister&rsquo;s Department, as well as that of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government that due consideration be given to this issue. People who have served 20 or 30 years on local authorities will only receive an allowance or some benefit from the years after representational allowances came into being. People who spent 20 years on a council prior to 2000, for example, are not entitled to any benefit for the service. If this happened in any other section of the public service it would not be tolerated. In view of this I ask the Minister to investigate the issue of pensions and PRSI payments for local authority members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue of home care packages has been mentioned on several occasions. We must beef up this entire area, as the amount of work carried out by people coming into homes to help families is rewarded by a pittance. These people are very important to families throughout the country. In his speech the Minister covered many areas relating to dependent allowances. The issue of caring in particular is one where enough funding cannot be given, as the people working in the area deserve every bit they get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House. The Minister&rsquo;s speech and key points were well constructed. He has covered all the salient points and difficulties that are being experienced. Many of the speakers have also made very important points and the Minister has recognised the importance of listening when making pre-budget decisions. He is working very hard at the moment.</P>
      <P>We must recognise the improvements that the Minister has introduced to the social welfare system during his term, as well as improvements that have taken place during the Government&rsquo;s term. Many people have welcomed improvements in child benefit and old-age pensions. As prices increase, people will always want more no matter what they receive. That is human nature. However, we should recognise what has been done to date. Senator Bannon mentioned housing aid, disabled persons&rsquo; grants, etc., and large amounts of money have been placed in and spent on these schemes. Significant developments have also taken place.</P>
      <P>Senators Kitt and Cummins mentioned representational allowance. My opinion as a Senator <Col N="1321"/>elected by those councillors, and as a councillor who spent 27 years on a local authority before walking away without benefit or pension help, is that the matter should be examined. Perhaps the issue cannot be investigated immediately, but we should ensure that those people serving the public in a voluntary capacity &mdash; although they receive a representational allowance which is taxed &mdash; are included in future in some form of pension scheme.</P>
      <P>I wish to discuss difficulties that arise in social welfare payments and appeals officers. Appeals are taking far too long and action must be taken in respect of people who are for some reason cut off. As it can take so long for an appeal to be made, these people are put under extreme strain. Often forms that are received from the Department are difficult to complete, and people may get a public representative to do it or go to their solicitor. This was commented on earlier. The issue should be examined and the process streamlined. Social welfare officers should make themselves available to assist these people in filling out such forms.</P>
      <P>There is an anomaly in farm retirement pensions, which a number of farmers signed up to. I blame some of the farm bodies which advised farmers to take up these pension schemes, which were not index linked. The farmers affected are serious losers, although they took their decision to enable their offspring or younger well-qualified people to take over the farms. These people were left with a pension that was not index linked and has been of little value to them over the years. The farm assist scheme was commented on and more publicity is required, as it is an excellent scheme which is working very well. A number of farmers have not signed on to it for some reason, and more help must be offered.</P>
      <P>Although the system of people with disabilities and personal assistants has been working, there is a time limit in which people who qualified through F&Aacute;S, for example, work as personal assistants for particular people. This should be examined and the time limit extended, as when people with serious disabilities are helped by such assistants a professional approach is built between them. They must be afforded the opportunity of continuing. I am aware of instances where a disabled person&rsquo;s assistant must finish and somebody else must come in to be trained. The time limits must be extended.</P>
      <P>I wish to discuss people with disabilities purchasing specialised adapted vehicles. An anomaly exists within the relevant programmes, as people can qualify if they lose a leg, for example, but not if an arm is lost. Action must be taken on this issue. More seriously disabled people should qualify for these schemes, as it would make a major difference to their livelihoods.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated that the social programme must be about empowering, liberating, <Col N="1322"/>actively creating opportunity, tackling the causes of poverty and bringing people from welfare dependency to welfare independence. He has summed the issue up well in that comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for staying for the entire debate and for his presentation. I also thank the Senators who contributed to this worthwhile debate. While I recognise that many Senators concentrated on particular areas that were of more concern to them than others, sharing our views is still valuable.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement that he is examining how to make the payments directly to the qualifying adults and would be happy were he to find a mechanism to do so. We must ensure that the adults in question, usually women, have economic independence. We must get away from the type of dependency on the bread winners, usually men. I would welcome any improvements the Minister could make in this area.</P>
      <P>Concerning the homemakers&rsquo; scheme, I recognise that it is worthwhile in its current form but it will not come into effect or cost the Government anything for many years. Will this scheme be made retrospective to 1973 in order to recognise and acknowledge the work that has been done by the hundreds of thousands of women who, in many cases, were forced to stay at home and those who chose to stay at home and rear their children? We should make it retrospective and the Minister should examine the matter again.</P>
      <P>I look forward to the report that will be published by the Pensions Board next week. When Senators spoke about pensions, they were obviously speaking about the social welfare pension, the old age contributory or non-contributory pension. Of course, there are other pensions, namely, occupational pensions, in which the Minister knows I have a great interest. The social welfare pension is in a complete mess and I would welcome any suggestion by the Minister to scrap the occupational pension schemes and place money in the social welfare pensions instead. The Minister knows there are many people who have paid into occupational pension schemes for all of their working lives but are today dependent on their old age contributory pensions, which comprise the greatest portions of their overall pensions.</P>
      <P>The social welfare pension works very well. While it provides a pension I would like to see it increased as it remains low compared to other countries. The occupational schemes incur significant costs on the State, particularly in respect of tax exemptions. If money were redirected from tax exemptions and put into social welfare pensions we could create a better pension for every worker in this country than is the case. I hope the Minister is examining such a suggestion. I believe it is how he would like to deal with the issue but it will be difficult and the amount of work large.</P><Col N="1323"/>
      <P>I also hope the Minister will examine the suggestions I have made and the pre-budget submissions he has received from the many organisations that wish to rid this country of poverty, particularly among women and children. There <Col N="1324"/>are many good suggestions that should be implemented and I hope the Minister will see his way to doing so in the forthcoming budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am pleased to have the opportunity to bring this matter to the House. I am particularly pleased that my friend and colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Gallagher, is taking this Adjournment matter because we come from the same region. We could discuss the quality of reception in our part of the world. However, this matter is not only about the quality of reception, it is about whether the Irish in Britain will get any reception.</P><Col N="1324"/>
      <P>For a number of years the Irish in Britain have had a growing desire for increased access to RTE&rsquo;s radio and television services. This desire was exacerbated by the collapse of Tara Television in 2001, prior to which it re-transmitted RTE television services to a large number of people in the Irish community in Britain. Those people were extremely happy with the service. Sadly, economic and commercial interests prevailed. Tara Television is no more and for the past number of years any Senator or Deputy, and particularly any Minister, who travels to England will find that people inquire as to when RTE television services will be restored to the Irish community in Britain. I am sure the Minister of State will allude to that point. It is in that context I gave notice of this matter.</P>
      <P>During the past number of months, developments have taken place on this matter. RTE is engaged in on-going discussions with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources on the provision of the service. I understand a question of money is involved. It is seen as a public service obligation rather than having commercial potential. I would argue whether that is absolutely true. More important are the legal dimensions surrounding the question <Col N="1325"/>of transmitting RTE services outside the State. I hope the Minister of State clarifies that situation in his reply and explains what action will be taken.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The original Broadcasting Authority Acts, which established Radio Telef&iacute;s &Eacute;ireann, placed legal constraints on RTE broadcasting outside the jurisdiction of the State, and these constraints remain in place. Unless the primary legislation is changed, it is well nigh impossible for RTE to accelerate any plans it may have to extend existing television services to the United Kingdom. The same would be true of radio and it also applies within the island. There is a legal limbo which needs to be clarified. Does the Minister intend bringing forward a suitable amendment in his proposed broadcasting Bill which is currently being drafted?</P>
      <P>It is vitally important that the Irish community in Britain remains engaged and connected to the mother country. In this era of modern communications there is no better way than through the provision of RTE radio and television services. RTE is the State broadcaster and as a public service it acknowledges the importance of the Irish community in Britain and beyond.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that I derive some of my income from RTE and therefore anything I say in this regard will need to be interpreted in that context but I make no apologies for that. I am very proud of my connections with RTE. I am currently preparing a series of programmes which will be transmitted prior to Christmas and which are being recorded at Irish centres in the UK, in Leeds, Nottingham, Milton Keynes and Portsmouth. This is another indication of the importance which RTE attaches to the Irish community in Britain.</P>
      <P>As a broadcaster I have been identified to some degree with Irish interests in Britain. This issue will not go away and it has been a constant with the various Irish communities throughout the UK. It has been articulated by the Federation of Irish Societies which is an umbrella body funded directly by DION, to the tune of almost &euro;1 million annually. It represents over 100 affiliates across the United Kingdom. Along with a colleague of mine in RTE, Paddy Glackin, I attended its conference last June to hear at first hand the priorities of the Irish community in broadcasting terms. The message was loud and clear that they wanted more programming from RTE and in particular, they wanted to be able to turn on their television sets and pick up RTE television services, especially news and current affairs. I thank the Minister of State for his attention and await his reply.</P>

	<P>On behalf of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, <Col N="1326"/>Deputy Noel Dempsey, I thank Senator Mooney for raising this important issue, the provision of Irish television services to the Irish community in Britain. RTE&rsquo;s mandate to provide radio and television services is defined in section 28(1) of the Broadcasting Act 2001. This Act states that the national television and sound broadcasting service required to be maintained by the RTE Authority under section 16 of the Act of 1960 shall have the character of a public service, continue to be a free-to-air service and be made available, in so far as is reasonably practicable, to the whole community on the island of Ireland. RTE&rsquo;s statutory mandate is quite clear in that RTE is obliged to endeavour to make its services accessible to all of the people living on the island of Ireland.</P>
      <P>As RTE&rsquo;s statutory mandate is specifically focused on the provision of services on the island of Ireland it follows that its mandate could not be interpreted as extending to RTE taking any action which had as its sole objective the delivery of a radio or television service in the UK. The debate about RTE providing a service to the Irish in Britain should, in the first instance, focus on RTE&rsquo;s statutory mandate and how it would need to be redefined. More practical issues could then be considered such as, who would pay for the cost of RTE delivering a service in the UK, whether RTE would own the broadcasting rights for programmes transmitted in the UK market and on which platform such a service would be made available.</P>
      <P>At present some of RTE&rsquo;s services are available to the Irish abroad. In addition to being available in Ireland, RTE&rsquo;s long wave and medium wave radio services can be received in many parts of the UK. The voice of one Paschal Mooney who has raised the issue, was heard on RTE radio for many years. I have heard many people say that during the 1970s he was a contact between Ireland and Britain. In those days many people were forced to emigrate. His voice kept them company and they looked forward to his programme. On behalf of all those people, I thank Senator Mooney. There was no information technology available in the 1970s.</P>
      <P>The value attributed by the Irish audience in the UK to RTE&rsquo;s long wave radio service was evidenced earlier this year when a scheduling decision by RTE gave rise to a major public debate. It was very evident from that debate that the Irish community in the UK placed a high value on the programming they accessed via RTE&rsquo;s long wave radio service.</P>
      <P>The Internet is a vital tool for the communication of information in the modern world. RTE&rsquo;s stations, RTE 1 and 2, Lyric FM and Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta are available on the Internet. Some of RTE&rsquo;s television programmes can also be accessed on the Internet. RTE&rsquo;s on-line services are a very good example of a service that <Col N="1327"/>can be availed of by Irish audiences in Ireland and by those living abroad.</P>
      <P>In the past a private subscription television channel, Tara Television, also provided a means for the Irish community in parts of the UK to access some of RTE&rsquo;s television programming. This was not an RTE service but a private company in which RTE had used its programming to invest in a commercial venture that resulted in a new and valued service being offered in the UK. Tara Television did not manage to attract sufficient subscribers and ceased to broadcast.</P>
      <P>The task force on policy regarding emigrants was established by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in 2001 and published its report in 2002. The report contained many detailed recommendations relating to a range of stakeholders, including a number of State bodies. It recognised the value to emigrants of being able to access Irish radio and television services and noted that throughout its discussions with the Irish abroad, a constant theme was the issue of contact with Ireland. It stated there was a great desire for information about contemporary Ireland and a wish to stay in touch with developments in this country.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, has asked me to state he fully recognises the value to the Irish abroad of being able to access Irish radio and television services and I concur with that view. In the broadcasting Bill under preparation the Minister is considering how RTE&rsquo;s public service mandate needs to be amended to ensure that it remains appropriate and relevant to the needs of the audience as the digital-only era approaches. Advances in technology will continue to offer new opportunities for broadcasters to meet the needs of their audiences.</P>
      <P>In bringing forward his new legislative proposals the Minister is committed to considering the recommendations of the task force on emigrants in the context of any amendment to RTE&rsquo;s existing statutory mandate. I fully appreciate the importance of the Irish community of whatever generation or the many others in Britain who are anxious to keep in touch with Ireland. There is a strong ethnic connection between Ireland and the UK. It is important they have access to the Irish language on Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta and by means of other programmes in Irish on RTE and TG4. Our language, culture and heritage are important.</P>
      <P>When we meet first, second and third generation Irish people at feiseanna and Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; events in other parts of the world we sometimes view them as more Irish than ourselves. We have a duty to try to allow this group to keep in touch with home. Bearing in mind the Minister&rsquo;s desire to take action on this issue and the digital era in which we live, I hope there will be developments on the issue in the future.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply, particularly his gracious remarks about my modest contribution to broadcasting. I am also pleased he will consider the recommendations of the task force report on emigration. I hope the Minister of State will return to the Minister with the message that the question of money should not arise on this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, to the House. I raise a pertinent matter regarding the provision of sports facilities. I represent the Roscommon constituency, which benefited from significant Government investment in a leisure centre three years ago. This was money well spent on a facility which has been a major source of enjoyment and health benefit to the population of the county, including me. It is encouraging to see so many school children, young people and elderly people from my constituency using the swimming pool. We often discuss the need for preventive medicine but the provision of a leisure centre with excellent facilities, including a swimming pool, encourages people with arthritis and other conditions to engage in sport.</P>
      <P>More recently, a swimming pool which opened in Carrick-on-Shannon has been a tremendous success. This leaves only one area, the west of the County Roscommon, lacking a facility. The people of Ballaghaderreen have collected a vast sum of money, approximately &euro;270,000, towards the provision of a swimming pool and are anxious to have similar facilities developed in their area because they live approximately 30 miles from the nearest leisure centre in Roscommon town. A new swimming pool would cater for the area extending from Ballaghaderreen and Castlerea into counties Mayo and Sligo. As a sufficient number of people in the area are willing to use a swimming pool and all the required criteria have been met, I am anxious that the Minister provide the required funding as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister again for the funding his Department has invested in leisure centres around the country, which is money well spent. We should consider developing co-operation with the Health Service Executive and Department of Education and Science to ensure further vital leisure facilities are developed and properly financed. I pay tribute to Roscommon County Council for stepping in to assume control of the leisure centre when the previous operator withdrew from the project. The council has made an excellent investment in the community by spending some &euro;150,000 on new sports equipment, including running machines, cross-trainers and weights. I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s reply.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1329"/>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Feighan for raising this matter and providing me with an opportunity to outline the current position regarding both the local authority swimming pool programme and the Ballaghaderreen swimming pool project under the programme. Under the local authority swimming pool programme, there are four principal stages in a swimming pool project. These, in order of progress, are feasibility study-preliminary report; contract documents; tender; and construction. The Department and its technical advisers, the Office of Public Works, evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed from one stage to the next without prior approval from my Department.</P>
      <P>Grant aid is not allocated until the tenders have been approved for a project. The maximum grant available under the programme is &euro;3.8 million, subject to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost.</P>
      <P>Applications are dealt with on a case by case basis and consideration is given to issues such as whether the area is classified as disadvantaged, the number and geographical spread of projects within and between counties, the viability of the project, particularly with regard to operational and maintenance issues, the overall funding package for the project, technical details and the Department&rsquo;s annual Estimates provision for the swimming pool programme.</P>
      <P>As regards the proposed Ballaghaderreen swimming pool project, Roscommon County Council submitted to my Department an updated feasibility report in July 2002 in respect of a project which had been initiated by the local community group. It is a requirement of the programme that projects not being developed directly by a local authority must be submitted through, and have the full support of, the relevant local authority. This is particularly important in the context of financing the capital and ongoing costs of such projects.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Arising from the assessment of this feasibility report by our technical advisers, the Office of Public Works, the county council was asked in June 2004 to prepare a more detailed feasibility study. The project will be considered further when this updated material is received. The updated study is expected to focus on the viability and sustainability of the project, having regard to current demographics and other public swimming pool developments since the preparation of the earlier study. For example, a public swimming pool has been constructed in Carrick-on-Shannon on the edge of the northern part of County Roscommon. It is understood this pool opened earlier this year.</P>
      <P>I have also received a copy of a submission made by a community group, Ballaghaderreen <Col N="1330"/>and Districts Development Limited, on the subject of a public pool for Ballaghaderreen. I have recommended that this submission be presented to Roscommon County Council and the Roscommon County Development Board to ensure their support for the project.</P>
      <P>Moving to broader but related sporting and recreational issues, the Senator will be aware that earlier this year I approved a grant of &euro;120,000 under the sports capital programme for the improvement of sporting facilities in Ballaghaderreen. The grant application was made by another local community based organisation, Ballaghaderreen Community Park Company Limited.</P>
      <P>Overall, 55 projects are included in the local authority swimming pool programme. Since 2000, nearly &euro;58 million has been spent on public swimming pools and 18 projects have been completed. These have included the provision of grant aid for the refurbishment of the swimming pool in Roscommon town, which reopened to the public in 2002. A further eight projects are at construction stage, in Ballyfermot and Jobstown in Dublin, Drogheda, Youghal, Cobh, Letterkenny, Monaghan and Ballybunion, and 29 other applications are at various stages in the process. Of these, eight are at tender stage, 13 are at contract document stage and eight, including Ballaghaderreen, are at preliminary report stage. It is clear, therefore, that significant progress is being made in implementing the programme.</P>
      <P>My Department is carrying out an expenditure review of the swimming pool programme which will examine, among other matters, how the programme has worked to date and the benefits which have accrued to the areas where pools have been built. It will also suggest amendments which may be required to ensure effective and efficient delivery of the programme. It is vital that the promotion of sport generally and the development of facilities such as swimming pools is carried out in a strategic and focused way. This means establishing priorities, avoiding overlaps and ensuring maximum public access to available facilities.</P>
      <P>The Government is anxious to ensure that the investment of taxpayers&rsquo; money provides value for money by ensuring that attractive, viable facilities are built. The level of funding provided in 2005 by my Department, at almost &euro;62 million in respect of the sports capital programme, &euro;34 million in respect of the Sports Council and &euro;32 million in respect of the local authority swimming pool programme, including &euro;3.7 million allocated to St. Michael&rsquo;s House for a swimming pool project to cater for persons with special needs, demonstrates that its commitment to sport and leisure is being sustained and enhanced annually.</P>

	<P>I seek an update from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the <Col N="1331"/>application by a person, whose details I have supplied, for leave to remain in Ireland on humanitarian grounds, including the person&rsquo;s medical condition. While I do not propose to dwell on the woman in question&rsquo;s medical condition, the Department will have access to the relevant information, including that she suffers from diabetes and has had a heart attack. This woman from the Congo is in her 50s and has substantial links with this country, having been here for two years. She has family members living in Ireland who have been given leave to remain in the State. I strongly urge that the Minister and his Department grant her leave to remain in Ireland as soon as possible. I would like an update on the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank Senator Tuffy for raising the matter. The person referred to in the matter is a woman born in the Democratic Republic of Congo who arrived in the State on 6 January 2003 and claimed asylum. Her claim for refugee status was examined by two independent statutory offices established to consider applications for refugee status and make recommendations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on whether such status should be granted. Those two offices are the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, ORAC, which considers applications for the declaration of refugee status in the first instance, and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, which considers applications for a declaration on appeal.</P>
      <P>The woman&rsquo;s application was refused by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and she was notified of that recommendation by letter on 9 January 2004. Her subsequent appeal was refused by the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, and she was notified of that recommendation by letter on 21 April 2004. She was notified of the Minister&rsquo;s decision to refuse her refugee status by letter on 31 <Col N="1332"/>August 2004, in which she was informed that she had three options open to her at that point, namely, to leave the State before her case was considered for deportation, to consent to the making of a deportation order in her respect, or to make written representations within 15 working days to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform setting out the reasons that she should not be deported, that is, why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.</P>
      <P>She lodged an application for leave to remain in the State. Her case file, including all representations submitted, will be considered under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and under section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, which deals with prohibition of <i>refoulement</i>. The safety of returning a person, or refoulement, as it is termed, is fully considered in every case when deciding whether to make a deportation order. That is done under section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996. That means that a person should not be expelled from the State or returned in any manner whatsoever to a state where, in the Minister&rsquo;s opinion, the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.</P>
      <P>The Minister must also consider 11 factors under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, when considering whether to deport a person. Those factors include considerations relating to the common good, the person&rsquo;s individual family and domestic circumstances, and humanitarian considerations. All representations regarding the individual&rsquo;s medical condition will be taken into account in the Minister&rsquo;s considerations. Various representations have been received by him on behalf of the person concerned, including some from Senator Tuffy.</P>
