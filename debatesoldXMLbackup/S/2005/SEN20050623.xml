    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business today is No. 1, a referral motion whereby the subject matter of Nos. 18, 19 and 20 on today&rsquo;s Order Paper are being referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights for consideration, to be taken without debate; No. 2, a referral motion whereby the subject matter of No. 17 on today&rsquo;s Order Paper is being referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, the Marine and Natural Resources for consideration, to be taken without debate; No. 3, Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (Amendment) Bill 2004 &mdash; Committee and Remaining Stages, to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business until 1.30 p.m.; and No. 4, Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Bill 2004 &mdash; Committee and Remaining Stages, to be taken at 2.30 p.m. and to conclude not later than 5 p.m. There will be a sos from 1.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m.</P>
      <P>I wish to explain the motions being referred to joint committees. No. 18 relates to support for the efforts made by member states to improve the management of the return of illegal migrants, including the enhancement of co-operation between EU states in this area; No. 19 relates to the establishment of the third phase of the European refugee fund in order to continue to support the development of a common EU asylum policy through the provision of support for projects in the areas of reception of asylum seekers, integration of refugees and voluntary return of refugees; and No. 20 relates to the establishment of the European fund for the integration of third country nationals for the period 2007 to 2013 and is to support the efforts of member states to enable legally resident third country nationals to integrate and take an active part in European society. I understand the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights will sit next Wednesday to discuss these motions, which will return to the House the following Friday. We will endeavour to allow at least one hour to debate the issues. I would expect Members of this House who are <Col N="2054"/>members of the committee to attend the meeting and be here if and when we get to debate those issues on Friday, 1 July.</P>
      <P>Following the <i>Prestige</i> disaster off the coast of Spain in November 2002, a number of initiatives on maritime safety and the protection of the marine environment were proposed and-or undertaken at EU and international level. Among these was a proposal on ship source pollution and on the introduction of sanctions, including criminal sanctions for pollution offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>In last December&rsquo;s budget the Government finally relented and gave some small measure of relief to first-time house buyers in respect of the stamp duty they must pay. As you know, Sir, under Standing Order 30, I have raised a matter upon which you will rule soon. However, it is a very urgent issue, which I would like to raise on the Order of Business. It now seems that under guidelines issued by the Revenue Commissioners to the financial institutions last month, if the name of a parent or family member is on the mortgage application document on behalf of the first-time buyer, or if any moneys have been given to the first-time buyer from a family member or other party, the buyer will automatically lose the stamp duty relief.</P>
      <P>This is a very serious matter. The Finance Act rightly gave an advantage to first time buyers on stamp duty. Now, however, Revenue is reinterpreting guidelines on an Act of the Oireachtas in a most arbitrary and unfair way to first time buyers. The story is in today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times </i>and I have had cases where people have been stung for between &euro;9,000 and &euro;10,000. These are people who are not on the housing ladder, but want their first opportunity to buy a house. Now they are being taxed despite the wishes of these Houses.</P>
      <P>I am raising this issue under Standing Order 30 and I will return to it. I ask the Leader to seek immediate clarification from the Department of Finance and from the Revenue Commissioners on the issue. We all recognise the right of people in this country to buy a house. First time buyers have been squeezed out of the market. Why penalise them further when the Houses of the Oireachtas have passed legislation to help them? I ask for the support of the Leader on this matter.</P>
      <P>Over ten days ago the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform announced that he wanted to liberalise licences for restaurants in Ireland. I refer to the bold, radical measure which the Vintners Federation of Ireland has been seeking for the past ten years. Will this be done by regulation or legislation? When are we likely to see these radical changes, which have been sought by the vested interests?</P>
      <P>Approximately 160 new amendments are to be made to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill in the other House, following an extensive examination of the Bill in this House a few months ago. The Bill is due to return here next week and in view of this <Col N="2055"/>will the Leader organise a briefing in advance with justice spokespeople to ensure the Department will at least allocate more time to this House for deliberation than was allocated to the other House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week, we had a discussion on whether consideration of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill should be deferred for a period. I was of the view that it would be better to deal with it, but that was before the State added more than 100 amendments to the Bill in the Lower House. I am certain that as the legislation is being rushed through the Houses we will get it wrong. I heard the Minister last night and I see the logic of his position in trying to deal with the issues to be announced in the final part of the Morris tribunal report. That is understandable but it is not understandable that we should rush the Bill through at this stage. It will be a mistake. There is too much to take in and in that context the row in the D&aacute;il last night was understandable.</P>
      <P>During the course of the debate last night on prisons we became aware that the Prison Service had published a new set of prison rules. It was unfortunate, or less than coincidental, that we were not made aware of that before the debate began. It was difficult for everyone to prepare speeches for it and it was unfair that we should deal with it in that way. Be that as it may, the recommendations of such a report would normally go through by regulation without debate. The report is a huge document &mdash; it contains approximately 200 sections &mdash; and it deals with significant issues. We should agree to hold a debate on it. The previous arrangements have been in place for 100 years, therefore, there is no immediate rush to deal with them. However, it is important to note that there are major changes in areas other than corporal punishment and other penal elements so there is a need to consider the issue.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Cathaoirleach, as a nominee of the agriculture panel, is aware of developments in agriculture. It gives me a sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i> when I see the way Irish farmers are to be kicked around again by all sides. We saw this 15 years ago. Every person with any bit of logic knew that at some stage, Irish farmers would be hit with world beef prices as the norm in this country. Despite knowing this farmers were made to suffer for ten long years. Their representative body and successive Ministers for Agriculture and Food were fighting an unwinnable battle, leading them up the hill, giving them hope, only to be followed by disappointment, and reaching a conclusion which we could all foresee.</P>
      <P>The then EU Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr. MacSharry, brought in reforms to the CAP which had to be done. In fairness to him, he got the very best deal possible for Irish farmers. At the time I was the only person in the House to defend the Commissioner&rsquo;s proposals.</P><Col N="2056"/>
      <P>A similar process will now happen with regard to sugar beet. Irish farmers are now being given hope that this battle can be won. It cannot be won and I would prefer if they were honestly told that. We could then get together and see what levels of support, money and investment can be given to those farmers who are currently relying on beet production. The whole sugar industry is changing world-wide and it will be of no use to us in a very short time. We have known that for a long time and I do not believe that everyone was taken by surprise by the announcement of the current Commissioner two days ago. The Minister has to fight the fight and the House has to say the predictable things. However, we also need to lace this debate with honesty and directness and we must seek solutions which are realistic, possible and in the best interests of Irish agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The one thing of which I am sure is that the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners will not be meeting any first time house buyers to discuss their tax positions with them, thereby defining the nature of Irish society fairly well. I agree with the issue just raised by Senator O&rsquo;Toole. Too many people have been conning Irish agriculture for far too long. The CAP, as Irish farmers came to understand it, was never going to last indefinitely. A great part of the effort made in doing a wonderful imitation of King Canute would have been better spent on trying to build up a way of life for rural Ireland to enable a viable lifestyle to continue. It is a great pity.</P>
      <P>However, simply changing the conditions in which sugar can be sold in the European Union will not do much for poor workers on sugar producing estates in the developing world. Unless we tie that development to proper working conditions we will simply make richer the already filthy rich sugar barons of Brazil and similar countries. It is a wonderful opportunity for the EU to use its leverage to ensure that there is a just regime in those developing countries to match the justice of the trading conditions.</P>
      <P>I do not have any great faith that the present EU Commissioner for Trade, the doctrinaire free marketeer from the British Labour Party, Mr. Peter Mandelson, will be prepared to make those conditions. I would like the Government to demand justice at international level, for farmers at home and for sugar estate workers in developing countries. On those conditions, the Government should be prepared to take its share of the sacrifice but, without such a deal, we will simply transfer more riches to already disgustingly rich people in countries that are profoundly unequal.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ascertain &mdash; she is good at this when nobody else is &mdash; the position on the debt of Aer Rianta? Will it be a debt on Dublin, Shannon or Cork airports? These debts have huge implications for these airports. We were given categorical assurances which now appear to be far from categorical.</P><Col N="2057"/>
      <P>I am horrified at the way officials from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform have yet again used public concern to slip clauses into the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill that fulfil their wildest dreams. They can now demand every single document in the possession of the Garda without any justification to any external body. This is just one of the 116 amendments introduced by the Minister to the Lower House yesterday. Someone suggested that fax machines were overheating due to the amount of printing of late amendments from a Department which, as was said on yesterday&rsquo;s Order of Business, is a model of obscurity, secrecy and of all that is wrong with the worst kind of public service. We will have a very difficult session next week if we have to deal with such a mass of amendments within four days. I put the House on notice that the Labour Party will not be prepared to accept the kind of rush job imposed on the D&aacute;il against the wishes of the majority of its Members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>While I frequently disagree with him, Senator Ryan hit the nail on the head in discussing the sugar regime within the European Union. He is absolutely right that it is obvious the EU has responsibilities to the ACP countries and poorer regions of the world but it would be completely erroneous to believe those obligations would be fulfilled and the lot of growers in poorer parts of the world improved by the implementation of the Commission&rsquo;s proposals. It will not help other people to wipe out many farmers from a quite profitable enterprise. We must make our views on the matter well known.</P>
      <P>There is a wider question involving the Common Agricultural Policy and the suggestion by Mr. Blair that it is up for renegotiation. As we explained last week, a very long and painful process was undergone by which prices were decoupled. The price of a product will no longer be the source of the revenue for farmers, which is appropriate as we must be competitive. If, however, we move towards world prices, a mechanism must be put in place whereby people in rural Ireland and rural Europe in general are protected. There is much more to the issue than the price of the product and the income of farmers. It is a question of the nature of rural society as a whole.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Taoiseach stated that the Common Agricultural Policy is not up for renegotiation. It would be a matter of entirely bad faith by the European Union to try to unravel a deal which has been concluded for several years into the future. We must be explicit as to our views. It would be appropriate, if possible, to provide even one hour to debate these matters in the coming week. I suspect it would be too late if we were to hold a debate when we reconvene for the new session. While the programme is crowded and legislation must be dealt with first, I ask the Leader to provide time to discuss this matter of great significance. The European Union must be made aware of the consequences for the ratifica<Col N="2058"/>tion of the constitutional treaty in Ireland if agriculture is not protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to make an immediate request to the Minister for Finance to call on the Revenue Commissioners to indicate clearly the reasons they issued guidelines to lending institutions recently which constitute what can only be described as an assault on first-time buyers. It is difficult for young people to provide for their own homes without assistance from parents or other family members. It is most important for the Revenue Commissioners to indicate why they believed they had to issue their guidelines. Was there a breakdown in the provisions of the last budget on stamp duty as implemented in the Finance Act 2005?</P>
      <P>It is an unfortunate coincidence that on the day the Taoiseach is in Northern Ireland where he will make an announcement on affordable housing, another arm of Government is denying the opportunity to young people to provide a home for themselves with some assistance from family members. I ask the Leader to do what is necessary, whether it is to ask the Minister for Finance to ask the Revenue Commissioners to explain or have the matter dealt with by a committee of the Houses as a matter of urgency, to protect young people who will lose from &euro;10,000 to &euro;15,000 on average from the stamp duty relief benefit.</P>
      <P>As we finish the primary cycle academic year, many national schools are to lose teachers simply because of a statistic while educational need is overlooked. The Minister for Education and Science suggests she will have solved the matter in September, which is of very little use to national school management and principals who are trying to organise their staffing arrangements for the new academic year between now and then. It is unbelievable that being one pupil short of the quota means the loss by a school of one teacher. I ask the Leader to make a formal request to the Minister for Education and Science to deal with the matter urgently and to notify all school boards of management within a month of her findings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I would welcome a debate on the recently issued guidelines of the Revenue Commissioners to lending institutions. It is often necessary for young people to have a parent supply some of the money required to purchase a property, notwithstanding the two possible arrangements which may obtain. If a parent in such circumstances becomes part-equity owner of the property, the decision is a commercial one and it is proper to aggregate the relief. If, however, a parent does not take an interest in the property, it is entirely correct for the young people buying it to claim in full the available relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="2059"/>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Common Agricultural Policy is changing significantly as it is bound to in the context of world trade agreements and the stretching of the EU to the Russian border. While some very positive developments have resulted, there are a number of issues to address. If we support Third World countries, we must ensure the people in those countries benefit rather than the companies which own the land, sugar and means of production. Similarly, any compensation must be provided to farmer producers on a <i>pro rata</i> basis because it is European taxpayers&rsquo; money. It should not be the case that hundreds of thousands if not millions of euro is paid in compensation to some individuals while others who depend on production for their livelihood receive paltry sums. I would like to see equity in compensation.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, there was a power cut in part of the complex, which raised a couple of issues. While one could hear division bells, unless one could distinguish the sound of each bell, one did not know for which House they were ringing. None of us took the risk and we all turned up here to vote. It would be very simple to send a group text message to Members&rsquo; phones to notify them of a division.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>We will take responsibility for sending it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The power cut also meant the lifts were out of order, which could have caused the Government to lose a vote. Emergency power should be available to the lifts in the event of a failure of the electricity supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, the audit committee of the commission, believe it or not, addressed the possibility of a power cut last week. I will bring the idea of a text message and other matters to the attention of the committee next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>A person in the lift could become hysterical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I reiterate the request I made yesterday for a full debate at the earliest possible opportunity on the future of the sugar industry. When I spoke yesterday, the House was not aware of the full extent of the Commission&rsquo;s proposals. We know now that what is proposed would have the effect not only of wiping out the Irish sugar industry, but would have a profoundly negative impact on the entire Irish tillage industry and put thousands of jobs at risk. I disagree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole on the future of the industry. We should not throw in the towel. The industry will have a future if a strong and effective political fight is put up in Brussels.</P>
      <P>I remind the House of the action which had to be taken 20 years ago in the face of a similar crisis in the Irish dairy industry. On that occasion, the Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald, and his Minister <Col N="2060"/>for Agriculture toured every single EU capital to strongly press Ireland&rsquo;s case. We must take the same hands-on political approach on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture and Food must refuse to sign away the future of the Irish sugar industry. It has played a part in the development of rural Ireland for almost 80 years and we must ensure it has a future on this island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, appeal to the Leader to do the best she can to ensure there is full debate on the Garda Bill, even if it means late sittings or pushing business into the following week. It is very difficult to deal with that volume of amendments but I share the Minister&rsquo;s view that we should press on as there is a need to modernise the management of the Garda as soon as possible. We all know the value of scrutiny in committee, particularly in detecting what might well be the unintended consequences that lurk behind an amendment or the Bill as drafted. Senator Ryan pointed out such a case. If that could be managed it would be to the benefit of all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with other Senators who have expressed concern about the announcement yesterday on the sugar reforms. I support Senator Dardis&rsquo;s appeal to the Leader for a short debate next week on this issue, and perhaps on agriculture in general.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I also join with Senators who have expressed dismay at the interpretation the Revenue Commissioners appear to have put on legislation passed by the House which exempted first-time buyers from stamp duty if the property they were buying was under a certain value. We should invite the Minister for Finance to the House for a debate on this matter which would allow us to express our views on this important subject which could then be conveyed to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>I wish to ask the Leader about the status of the primary school medical examination. When I was in primary school, which is not that long ago, there was a medical examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Senator was lovely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>When the Leader was Minister for Education there was a medical examination, at least in my part of the South Eastern Health Board area. I do not know the status of the medical examination at present but it does not appear to take place any longer. A number of people involved in the medical profession have raised it with me recently. It is an area of preventative medicine where we could do something for the health of younger people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week was cystic fibrosis awareness week and most of us met members of the Cystic Fibrosis Association in Buswells Hotel. I accept I am a little late with my request for a debate on cystic fibrosis and the lack of services for sufferers, which I regret will have to wait until the autumn.</P>
      <P>We are all aware that cystic fibrosis is a terrible disease that affects many young people who carry it into their early adulthood. A report was carried out in recent months by a physician in the UK. The number of people affected with cystic fibrosis in Ireland would suggest we need 25 consultant respiratory physicians when currently we have 3.3. I request the Leader to fit a debate on this matter into the autumn schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with colleagues in calling for an urgent debate on the sugar beet industry. Fine Gael tabled a Private Members&rsquo; motion on this matter in January and, unfortunately, our worst fears have been realised. It is time we had an urgent debate on the matter.</P>
      <P>It is worth pointing out that the sugar beet industry is a very lucrative one which made profits of over &euro;10 million last year. I wish to put that on record as the impression has been created that sugar beet was making a loss. This is an example of the worst form of corporate greed. It is time to take a tough stance on this issue and work with our European Union colleagues to ensure we have a long-term, sustainable sugar beet industry. The treatment of people involved in the industry, especially in Carlow, has been disgraceful. Carlow no longer has a beet factory and it appears there will be no beet growers in Carlow either. Greencore has made an application for a rail depot but from what the company has said in the past I do not think the rail depot will ever become a reality. I do not believe the company wants a rail depot but maybe I will be proven wrong.</P>
      <P>A report recently came out in the UK about the MRSA superbug which revealed that one in 11 patients there has contracted it. I presume we would have a similar figure here or perhaps it is even worse. I am amazed that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, has finally decided to do an audit of hospitals, but she has chosen the months of July and August to do it. Traditionally those months are the quietest in hospitals. I am not too sure how much we can read into the findings of such an audit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>When the report is published we should remember the time of year it was carried out.</P>
      <P>I seek a debate on the announcement yesterday on child care by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. As a former teacher I do not believe it is possible to use schools in the way the Minister outlined. It is a good idea in theory but a bad one in practice. It could be done if schools had spare rooms but on a practical level a school room would have school books on tables and property belonging to teachers and pupils. It would be a recipe for disaster. It would result in teachers spending the first half hour of every day finding out what property was missing and relocating it.</P>
      <P>We must have a proper and sincere debate on child care as highlighted by Senator White on numerous occasions. We must provide proper, dedicated child care places independent of schools. Society appears to blame school for everything. It is time we moved on. Schools are places of learning and it is not possible to use them for child care purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have noted a matter of concern from Senator Brian Hayes under Standing Order 30:</P>
      <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann notes with concern the fact that many first-time house buyers cannot avail of stamp duty relief on the basis that they have received a small part-payment from their family towards the cost of their home.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I have another commitment at that time but Senator Dardis has agreed to be present in the House. Recognising the serious nature of the stamp duty relief for first-time buyers I telephoned the Taoiseach's office this morning. The officials I spoke to were very alert to it and find it extremely strange - as do we all - that Revenue would seek to frustrate the Government's stated policy as evidenced in the last Finance Act. That is how the matter is being treated in the Taoiseach's Department. It is not for Revenue to frustrate the Government's stated policy. </P>
      <P>The Taoiseach&rsquo;s office and the office of the Minister for Finance are in discussion on the matter. Nothing definite was agreed as the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; was used. The Government sought to do something about the abolition of the first-time buyer&rsquo;s grant through this mechanism. We have already spoken to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department on the matter and I hope something positive will emerge.</P>

	<P>Senator Brian Hayes asked if there would be separate liquor licensing legis<Col N="2063"/>lation or if it would be done through the Garda Bill. We will know that very soon, as the Senator requested a briefing for Senators prior to the Bill coming to the Seanad. The Garda Bill will come to the House next week and we are seeking to have adequate time to discuss some 140 new Report Stage amendments to it. It is practically a new Bill. As Senator Maurice Hayes said, we should not put it in cold storage. We should deal with it and provide adequate time to discuss it.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole said rushed legislation would be wrong legislation. As a general principle that would be correct but I hope that the briefing we will get and the time we will be able to devote to it will mean it will not be rushed here. The prison rules book became available last night after the debate in the House. It was a very fortuitous piece of work. I agree we should debate the matter after the recess.</P>
      <P>The Senator also raised the matter of agriculture and asked if we would all be kicked around again. The strangest part of this debacle &mdash; I refer not so much to the debate on the sugar industry but to that on agriculture in general &mdash; is that the United Kingdom signed up to the agreement in this regard some years ago and now wants to decouple itself from it.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan said that, over the years, too many people were guilty of conning in agriculture. He referred to the changing conditions under which sugar can be produced. He stated the sugar barons will just get richer and that a just regime should obtain among sugar producers internationally.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan also asked about Aer Rianta&rsquo;s debt. On the last occasion this matter was raised, I made inquiries and was told that, according to the legislation, the debt of Aer Rianta is to be taken on by Dublin Airport Authority and that the Minister stated this in the House. The disquiet is arising because Shannon and Cork airports have debts and Dublin Airport Authority does not want to take them upon itself. The authority could not wait to be set up so it will have to live with this.</P>
      <P>On the timescale pertaining to amendments to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill, we are endeavouring to allow a decent amount of time for the debate. We will not allow ourselves to be given the bum&rsquo;s rush.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis referred to the sugar regime and the Common Agricultural Policy. He implied it is much more than a question of money for farmers as rural policy must also be considered. He stated we cannot unravel a deal that has been made. The Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, will be in the House next week to consider amendments made to the Veterinary Practice Bill in the D&aacute;il. We will ascertain whether an hour can be allowed, either before or after the taking of that Bill, to debate the sugar industry and agricultural in general.</P>
      <P>On Senator Ulick Burke&rsquo;s point on mortgages, I did not answer it but stated the up-to-date posi<Col N="2064"/>tion. The Senator asked about schools. There are 12 primary schools which are one pupil short of the quota. As I understand it, in each of the 12 schools, the deficit of one pupil will be made up in the following year and other requirements will be met. The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, stated this issue will be considered in September, but this is too late for principals arranging timetables for September. One can imagine the mayhem that will be caused with a three teacher school being reduced to a two teacher school. The Minister is very alert to the problem and we will endeavour to make progress on the matter next week. Just 12 primary schools stand to lose a teacher because they are one pupil short of the required number.</P>
      <P>Senator Hanafin also referred to mortgages and presented the legal case in this regard. He stated equity should be the order of the day in agriculture. He also raised the matter of the lifts and the bells. The Seanad bell is distinctly different from that of the D&aacute;il. We go &ldquo;cuckoo&rdquo; and they go straight forward.</P>

	<P>It is a different bell. I would be very worried about the lift not so much because one might be late for a vote but because one could get stuck in it. I know there is a panic or emergency button but it would not work if there were no electricity.</P>
      <P>Senator Bradford said the sugar industry could be wiped out. He apologised for having to leave. He is gone to tell his constituency in Cork what he said in the Seanad. I am delighted to hear this. He also said Garret FitzGerald and Austin Deasy toured Europe to ensure we were subject to correct treatment at a particular time in our agricultural history.</P>
      <P>Senator Maurice Hayes said sufficient time should be allowed for a full debate on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill and he shared the Minister&rsquo;s view that we should press on with it. My job is to ascertain whether a decent amount of time can be allowed for considering it. We are trying to achieve this. I reiterate that I would not have it on my conscience that we rushed the Bill in the House.</P>
      <P>Senator John Paul Phelan called for a debate on the Common Agricultural Policy and the sugar industry next week. He expressed dismay at the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; interpretation of legislation exempting first-time buyers from stamp duty if the property they are buying is under a certain value. He asked about the status of the medical examination in primary schools. I did not know it is no longer carried out. One used to get one&rsquo;s injections in school. Maybe someone with children of a schoolgoing age will tell us rather than having the Senator look back with fondness to his time in school.</P>
      <P>Senator Feeney called for a debate on cystic fibrosis. I would very much like this and I will create a slot therefor in the autumn.</P><Col N="2065"/>
      <P>Senator Browne called for a debate on the sugar industry and referred to corporate greed. He does not believe Greencore&rsquo;s protestations over a rail depot. On the question of MRSA, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, is set on dealing with the audit of the hospitals. We are now told there many other bugs that one could contract, some of which sound very exotic.</P>
      <P>Senator Browne also called for a debate on child care. Yesterday Senator O&rsquo;Toole asked me if we could have such a debate quite soon after the recess. I know many other Senators want such a debate. I agree with Senator Browne regarding schools. The challenging environment of school, in which a child might be from 9.30 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. or 2 p.m., may not be the correct environment in which a child should remain. I accept this point very strongly. I believed from the beginning that the approach the Senator described was an odd way to deal with the matter. We will see how the debate develops.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 6, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;3.&mdash;References in the Principal Act to the Minister for Education and Science shall be construed as references to the Taoiseach.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister to the House. On Second Stage yesterday, I acknowledged the fact that she had a very difficult task in taking over at a time when great difficulties were identified in respect of the commission and its workings. This was particularly the case following the resignation of Ms Justice Laffoy and the problems that created. They were not imaginary difficulties and the frustration clearly identified in her letter of resignation highlighted for many that the whole area of responsibility should be taken away from the Department of Education and Science. It was highlighted by way of saying that the Department of Education and Science was investigating itself through the commission. In other words, the commission was investigating the Department and it would be far more appropriate if the investigation was under the auspices of the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>Initially, it was the Taoiseach who offered the apology. He has given his opinion on the whole matter on various occasions and has indicated his support for the commission. It is necessary to break the link between the Department of Education and Science and the commission because of the track record and the difficulties shown up.</P><Col N="2067"/>
      <P>When people say that the Department of Education and Science stymied progress and did not co-operate with the commission, these are very serious charges. No doubt they had weight and truth in them. For that reason it is important that this concern, which is shared among the various parties, is addressed and that there should be a change from the Department of Education and Science to the Department of the Taoiseach. The complainants who have come before the commission have serious concerns about the way the Department of Education and Science handled their individual cases. There are questions to be asked about what the Department knew, in certain cases, in the past. There are also issues concerning incorrect information being given in the D&aacute;il in response to parliamentary questions as far back as the 1980s. Questions arise as to what the Department knew, how it reacted and what information was given. Somebody knew.</P>
      <P>Many personnel in the Department of Education and Science today had nothing to do with what had happened in the past. The charge I am making has nothing to do with the current complement of professional people in that Department. I fully support whatever action they are taking now so that this situation never happens again. That is probably why we are here today, to put in place a framework that will ensure nothing like this will ever happen again and that Departments and Ministers will never have to deal with similar occurrences. It is imperative, therefore, that responsibility be transferred from the Department of Education and Science to the Department of the Taoiseach. This should be a fundamental part of the legislation. It would change it, without any aspersions being cast on the current Minister or her actions and what she intends to do.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that progress has been made in recent times and that is welcome. Many complainants have been satisfied, to a degree, in the fairly recent past under the current workings of the commission. Nevertheless, in the interests of the many people who have expressed concern about the Department&rsquo;s inability in the past, allied to the breakdown in trust that exists, this matter must be seen to be rectified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to say to the Minister that while I had some sympathy in the early stages with the sentiments expressed by Senator Ulick Burke &mdash; although I would not have supported his amendments for the reasons I will give &mdash; I have little sympathy, if any, for the point he makes at this stage. I said yesterday that justice delayed is justice denied. To go down the road the Senator proposes would cause further significant and perhaps enormous delay. That is the last thing the victims of abuse want at this stage. God knows they have waited 30, 40, 50 years and sometimes a lifetime for justice. Now it is within their grasp and it is our duty to give it to them.</P><Col N="2068"/>
      <P>There was a case, at the outset, in that some difficulty existed within the Department of Education and Science. There were delays and that is accepted. The then Minister put his hands in the air when he became fully aware of the delays and acknowledged that they were serious and not acceptable. However, we have moved a long way from there and there is now considerable and very satisfactory engagement with the Department of Education and Science. No victim support group has brought this to my attention in recent times as an issue. If they had I would acknowledge it today. I cannot support this amendment, because it is not a live issue and also because enormous delays are inherent in the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment. I will not repeat what Senator Ulick Burke has said, but I support the points he has made. The purpose of tabling the amendment is that apart from the fact it was recommended by Ms Justice Laffoy, it should be a matter of principle and fair procedure that a body does not investigate or sponsor a Bill to investigate itself. That is the case here where the Minister for Education and Science is the Minister referred to in the legislation. For those basic reasons, which are fundamental to how anything that involves legal import is carried out, the body being investigated should not be the one to carry out the inquiry. That is the basis of our support for the amendment. I suggest it is also the reason why Ms Justice Laffoy recommended that this change should be made.</P>
      <P>I do not see why it should cause any delay. It is up to us how we deal with matters and whether there are delays in making changes. It is a fundamental recommendation made by Ms Justice Laffoy and it is fundamental to how the Act is implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>No one has any criticism of the Minister or her Department. I am quite sure that Senator Ulick Burke does not intend any either in putting forward this amendment. However, we all know by now the little we can do to actually heal the hurt experienced by the victims of child abuse. We are all trying to do the best we can. If it would help them at all to have the references made to the Department of the Taoiseach rather than the Department of Education and Science, I suggest we proceed on that basis. It would not cause delay, as Senator Fitzgerald has argued. That is the last thing we want.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach did a magnificent job in the apology he gave on behalf of the State in 1999. I only wish more fulsome apologies had been proffered since from some of the other parties who were involved in this. I know that the orders have made apologies, but in some cases it was dragged out of them. If there is anything we can do that stops this focus on the Department of Education, as it was then known, it should be done. Complaints were ignored and even comprehensive inspectors&rsquo; reports were shelved simply because <Col N="2069"/>it was considered unsuitable to bring such matters forward. I urge the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms M. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The important issue for the survivors is, as everybody says, to have an efficient process and to be able to help them, as far as possible, in this way. There is currently no demand from the victim support groups to move from the Department of Education and Science to the Department of the Taoiseach. It is typical of other tribunals that the relevant Department is the sponsoring Department. To date, the Department has invested considerable manpower and resources in ensuring all the needs of the commission are met. The Department and the commission have a strong, positive relationship and any information sought by the latter has been provided.</P>
      <P>The Department takes on board the comments and criticisms of Ms Justice Laffoy. It is interesting to note, however, that the third interim report of the commission included a comment which reflected favourably on the Department. It noted that some of the requests submitted had lacked clarity and that the Department was given insufficient time to deal with some of them. Nevertheless, the Department accepts that relations were not as good as they should have been. This has been rectified and all concerned are now happy with the current working relationship.</P>
      <P>Acceptance of the amendment would cause delay because it would require a whole new set of officials to start again from scratch. The system is working well and dedicated staff in the Department are working well with the commission and groups. I do not propose to accept the amendment because it is not necessary and would not assist the survivors in the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not fair to draw parallels between the commission and other inquiries and commissions because all the others are dealing with external matters. The difference in this case is that the Department is investigating itself, whereas the cases with which the Minister drew parallels do not involve internal investigations.</P>
      <P>The Minister has repeatedly stated that marvellous progress has been made and I welcome that fact. Does she envisage establishing a mechanism by which progress could be verified on an ongoing basis, for instance, in terms of the number of cases the commission has concluded? On Second Stage yesterday, I expressed frustration that when the Fine Gael Party tried to elicit information from the commission on the number of outstanding cases, it refused to provide it because communications were still being received. I accept, however, this is a legitimate reason for withholding information. Will the Minister establish a mechanism to report on the progress she has outlined?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms M. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I can provide the Deputy with a statement of the amount of resources, documentation and so forth the Department has provided. For example, approximately 1,700 responding statements have been made in respect of 1,380 complaints. The Department has complied with earlier discovery directions issued by Ms Justice Laffoy when she was chairperson. It had also complied with a further 23 discovery directions by 30 September this year. The total estimated cost incurred by the Department as a respondent was &euro;1.89 million, which consists primarily of staff costs but also includes IT software costs, etc.</P>
      <P>By September 2005 the Department was working on four discovery directions of a general nature and ten institution-specific directions. In total, it has provided 150,000 pages of documentation. This information shows that, notwithstanding the difficulties encountered in the past, the Department is providing all information sought in an efficient and much more organised manner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 7, line 9, after &ldquo;period&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;including in particular the adequacy or otherwise of the manner in which responsibilities were discharged by persons in authority, including judges&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The amendment provides that the matters to be investigated by the commission should include, in particular, the adequacy or otherwise of the manner in which responsibilities were discharged by persons in authority, including judges. Children were placed in institutions by courts but whereas the role of other bodies is being examined, the role of courts and judges has been excluded from the investigation. This will create a gap in terms of the outcome of the process.</P>
      <P>It has been argued that the amendment would somehow constitute interference by the Legislature in the workings of the Judiciary. This is not my intention. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the history of the matters under investigation is examined in full. The role of the courts and judges in making decisions to place children in institutions will be an important element of this process.</P>
      <P>Although I do not claim to know a great deal about the issue, I suspect that some children were placed in institutions for no good reason and that the decisions made at the time may have been totally inappropriate. For this reason, an examination of the role of the courts and judges in the events of the period should be part of the process <Col N="2071"/>of finding out the truth and getting to the bottom of what happened.</P>
      <P>The sole purpose of the amendment is to build up a correct picture of what happened and ensure all aspects of the background to the events under investigation are examined. It is intended not to interfere with the Judiciary, the courts system or the role of judges in society but to examine the historical role of the courts in the matters into which the commission is inquiring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the Minister is present because I recall the great care she and all Members took when the House passed the Children Act, to ensure children were not slapped in and out of institutions. The insertion of subparagraph (i<i>a</i>) goes a long way towards improving the original Bill.</P>
      <P>Senator Tuffy made a good point; people want to try to discover why they were placed in institutions and what went wrong. As she stated, children were placed in institutions for very little reason on occasion. Recalling the Minister&rsquo;s commitment during the passing of the Children Act, I suggest the amendment is worthy of acceptance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not see much difference between subparagraph (i<i>a</i>) and the wording of the proposed amendment and have few quibbles with Senator Tuffy&rsquo;s comments, as supported and amplified by Senator Henry. All of us, including the Minister, approach this issue from the same perspective. My only reservation relates to the issue of crossing the line in terms of judicial independence, to which Senator Tuffy referred. The reference to &ldquo;judges&rdquo; in the amendment may create a difficulty. In elaborating on this issue, the Senator noted that the purpose of the amendment was to ensure the role of the Judiciary as opposed to individual judges is examined in an historical context. Nevertheless, I respectfully suggest, notwithstanding our anger and disgust, that particular sensitivity may be required to ensure the line is not crossed in terms of judicial independence and the role of the Judiciary at the time.</P>
      <P>Senator Tuffy referred to the need to investigate the circumstances which gave rise to each individual case, an important requirement. The wording of subparagraph (i<i>a</i>) makes a significant contribution to addressing this issue in an historical and individual context, without referring to the decisions of individual judges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I support this highly relevant amendment. Last night on &ldquo;Tonight with Vincent Browne&rdquo; there was a very good example of what we are discussing. A woman on the programme told how she was put into an institution as a child. She did not know why she was put into the institution at seven years of age or why she was then transferred from one institution to another. She had no idea of the reasons. She was abused in all of the institutions in which she was placed. Her <Col N="2072"/>horrific experience makes these amendments relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms M. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the main aims of the commission is to find out exactly why children were placed in these institutions. Many were put in for very spurious reasons and ended up with criminal records as adults for something they may or may not have done as children. That is why we have included subparagraph (i<i>a</i>) in section 4(1)(<i>a</i>)(i), which states, &ldquo;to inquire into the manner in which children were placed in, and the circumstances in which they continued to be resident in, institutions during the relevant period,&rdquo;. We are satisfied, as is Mr. Justice Ryan, that this allows him to look at the operation of the courts and the Judiciary in a general sense to see how this came about.</P>
      <P>The amendment, however, specifically mentions judges, thus crossing into their constitutional independence as individual judges, which is not the intention. We cannot look into individual cases to ask why a particular judge placed someone in an institution. We need to know the general circumstances of the time and how the courts worked in a way that allowed this to happen &mdash; that will be the focus of the commission of inquiry &mdash; rather than looking at the individual. We are satisfied that what we want is provided for in section 4(1)(<i>a</i>).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I respect what Mr. Justice Ryan has said but I am unhappy with the wording of section 4(1)(<i>a</i>). If it is implicit that decisions by judges which caused children to be sent to institutions can be looked at in the general sense, I do not see why it cannot be expressed explicitly in the legislation. The wording of the amendment will not lead to an examination of the role of the courts.</P>
      <P>Inquiring into the manner in which children were placed in institutions avoids what we want to achieve, it is too vague. If we are to look at the generality, we must also look at specifics and examine the role played by judges at the time. If we cannot do that, it will place a major obstacle in the way of our work as legislators.</P>
      <P>We are not interfering with the independence of judges. The courts implement the law that we make but we must look at its implementation to see if it must be reformed at a future date. This amendment would not interfere with the independence of the Judiciary and would improve the Bill. The amendment would clarify the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is not disposed to accepting the amendment but section 4(1)(<i>a</i>) allows for inquiry into &ldquo;the role of the courts in the manner in which children were placed in, and the circumstances in which they continued to be resident in, institutions during the relevant period&rdquo;. Would that allow the role of the courts to be investigated?</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="2073"/>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms M. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 4(1)(<i>a</i>) allows the commission to inquire into the manner in which children were placed in institutions. The vast majority of children were placed in institutions by the courts. The section allows the commission to inquire into the system &mdash; the courts and the Judiciary &mdash; but not to look at individual judges. I appreciate fully what the Senators are trying to achieve but we are satisfied that we can achieve it without compromising the independence or constitutional position of the Judiciary as a separate entity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 7, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;(iii) where cases do not proceed to full inquiry this shall be on the basis of clear and objective criteria, decided in consultation with representative groups,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">These amendments seek to secure clear information for the public. The Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse must give victims the greatest possible opportunity to have their cases heard and the public must be informed regarding the operation of the commission. Amendment No. 3 attempts to achieve that objective.</P>
      <P>The Act is being amended to remove the obligation on the investigating committee to hear all complaints and it gives discretion as to which witnesses it considers should be called to a full hearing. If there is discretion over why they should be called to a hearing, we want to know the criteria used. Where cases do not proceed to a full hearing, it should be on the basis of a clear and objective criteria decided in consultation with the representative groups. This is the rationale behind the amendment. The criteria on which the decisions may be based is not outlined in the legislation and it is important that it is made clear.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 4 would allow the criteria for deciding which cases may not proceed to full inquiry to be published and made available to the public. This seeks to throw more light on the proceedings of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse. In seeking to ensure that the criteria for deciding which cases proceed to the full inquiry are published, and thereby made available to the public, either in print or electronically, this amendment seeks to ensure that the victims and the wider public are informed as to how decisions are being made by the commission. Currently it is unclear how these decisions are reached.</P>
      <P>In the other House, the Minister indicated why Mr. Justice Ryan deliberately avoided imposing selection criteria in the cases that would receive a full hearing before the investigation committee. He felt it was not possible to develop specific <Col N="2074"/>criteria. This was made on the basis that no two situations are the same. Conversely, is the same not true? I ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 6 proposes that the criteria for deciding which meetings shall be held in public, shall be agreed with representative groups and made available to the public. This amendment, as with the earlier ones, is submitted in the interests of victims of past abuse and the general public who should have information on the operation of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 8 seeks a clear definition of what is meant by the term &ldquo;reasonably practicable&rdquo; as was agreed in the consultations with the representative groups and that it shall be published and made available to the public. The Oireachtas has been asked to prepare legislation which includes the term &ldquo;reasonably practicable&rdquo; without any proper definition. It is evident that what is reasonably practicable to one may not be to another. The definition of what is meant by this term must be included.</P>

	<P>I am sure the Minister wants the workings of all committees involved to be as transparent as possible. However, there are justified complaints that people do not know how cases will be chosen to come before the committees. I am still not sure if people who wish to go before the committees will be definitely allowed to do so. On Second Stage yesterday, the Minister stated: &ldquo;It will reduce the likelihood of people who are less able for adversaries hearings being subjected to examination and cross-examination before gatherings of lawyers and other interested parties&rdquo;. The Minister is correct because we have heard dreadful stories of how some people felt either before, during or after attending these committees. I was delighted that yesterday the Minister mentioned counselling is available for people before and after going before the committees. I found many people did not know this was available. It may explain why few offers of counselling have been taken up.</P>
      <P>It is important for those coming before the committees to know the criteria under which they have been brought forward. It is important the general public also knows these criteria. Otherwise, we will only end up in a situation, which I believe the Minister does not want, where the committees&rsquo; workings are accused of not being transparent. I accept they cannot all be totally open to the public as many committees will deal with subjects requiring them to sit in private. However, the public must know as much as possible about what is happening with these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sympathetic to most of what has been said. However, these concerns were elaborated on by the Minister yesterday on Second Stage. She made it clear that the individual applicant&rsquo;s case that will be called will be the one deemed by the committee to be the most rep<Col N="2075"/>resentative of what happened at a particular institution. I am happy from what she said yesterday and from her contributions on the Bill in the Lower House that she is all for transparency. I am glad that has been acknowledged by Members.</P>
      <P>One can raise too many technical arguments as to what the criteria should be. One could engage with representative survivors&rsquo; groups as to the widest possible set of criteria. However, given the strong arguments made for the changes the Minister has proposed in the Bill, I believe the criteria she articulated are as good as any. After all the applicants from that institution have been reviewed, if an individual&rsquo;s case is as fair and as widely representative of what happened in a particular institution as one can determine, I believe it will be adequate to meet the requirements and concerns set out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms M. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The confidential committee has already heard 1,060 witnesses. It has heard everyone who seeks to give his or her story. Everyone who wishes to go before the investigation committee is interviewed and a decision is then taken as to whether he or she goes to a full hearing. The way in which that decision will be taken will be to ensure the commission can get as full a picture as possible of all the complaints, circumstances and timescale being examined. As we are looking at a 30 year timescale, it is important for the commission to get a flavour of each of those three decades, rather than taking all from one and none from another. This is why Mr. Justice Ryan deliberately avoided imposing selection criteria for cases because it may be different for each individual institution, times or the circumstances being examined.</P>
      <P>In the majority of cases, all complainants will get a full hearing. There are five homes where the number of complainants is too large to enable the commission to hear them all to collate the information for a report. These are the boys&rsquo; industrial schools, Fairyhouse, Upton, Letterfrack and Artane and Dangan, a boys&rsquo; reformatory school. Every witness in every school the commission investigates will be heard, except those five. The majority of people will go to full hearing. The idea is that the investigation committee&rsquo;s legal team will be able to give a full picture of life in those institutions over the 30 years. By first interviewing the people affected, the team will be able to determine if there is duplication of evidence or if a new story is emerging that may be valuable to be heard. It is important the team has the flexibility to do this. If the team finds, even after inviting people to a full hearing, that it still does not have as broad a picture as needed, then more people can be invited to the committee. It is not too strict a system but allows the flexibility for the team to work. Fixed criteria are not wanted as there may be differences between individual institutions.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 6 proposes the holding in public of meetings and joint hearings which can <Col N="2076"/>be attended by survivors, their representatives, respondents and their representatives. In both cases the investigation committee will be entitled to work in this way whenever it considers it appropriate. Again, tying it down to agreed criteria would limit the committee&rsquo;s discretion. The committee is the only one to decide whether to have a hearing in public, based on the information it has on the content and purpose of the hearing. Like a tribunal of inquiry, it will hear evidence on oath from witnesses who have relevant testimony to give and collect documentary material which it can analyse. Only then, will it be able to assess the material and come to conclusions. This can only be done according as the hearing process progresses. It will be different for individual institutions.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Regarding amendment No. 8, section 7 is intended to allow the investigation committee to call before it people whose accounts it considers will provide it with the greatest possibility of arriving at the truth of what occurred. It is important the commission has appropriate discretion in carrying out its functions. There are likely to be complainants whose allegations are incapable of leading to a finding of abuse. We need the commission to work on the evidence to allow it to find out the truth of what happened. Requiring the investigation committee to agree in advance with representative groups the circumstances in which this would arise would be an impossible task and would hamper its work and independence. It is important to allow the commission the flexibility to obtain as full a picture as possible of what took place over many years so it can produce a report that is valuable to society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendments were never intended to stifle the commission in its work. They are intended to provide criteria whereby one can identify why certain people were called before it. There is a vagueness about the vast majority of the Minister&rsquo;s words and the terms used by Senator Fitzgerald like &ldquo;most representative&rdquo; and &ldquo;allow the commission discretion&rdquo;. The complainants and the general public will want to know why these criteria are not there and what determines if somebody is called before the commission. That is the kernel of the proposed amendments. They are not intended to stifle the progress of or to restrict in any way the workings of the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms M. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>There may be general circumstances where the commission may decide it does not need to hear further evidence because it already possesses a substantial body of evidence enabling it to produce a report. There may indeed be circumstances where it is felt that putting an individual through an adversarial hearing may be too much for that person, though the commission may not wish to say that to him or her. If the criteria are too tight and pre-ordained it does not allow the commission the flexibility to do its work <Col N="2077"/>properly which is why we do not propose to accept the amendments.</P>
      <P>I return to the important issue of the counsellor. The facility at the redress board, which Mr. Justice O&rsquo;Leary pointed out to me and which I explained yesterday, whereby a person may at the board&rsquo;s expense have present a counsellor with whom he or she has built up a relationship is also available at the commission. If the individual&rsquo;s own counsellor is not available he or she can indicate that in advance and a counsellor can be provided. That extra support is not being taken up as much as it should so it is necessary to highlight it.</P>
      <P>The commission needs to get as full and accurate a picture as possible of what happened to enable it to produce a report without being too confined by these criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 7, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;but&rdquo; in line 42 down to and including &ldquo;abuse&rdquo; in line 44.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The Bill provides that an alleged abuser will only be identified if he or she has been previously found guilty in respect of an offence involving abuse. I ask the Minister to outline carefully the reasoning behind this change. The amendment will limit the commission&rsquo;s discretion in respect of naming persons who have been convicted of an offence of child abuse in a case being heard before it or otherwise.</P>
      <P>While I acknowledge that Mr. Justice Ryan is of the view that the commission of inquiry should focus primarily on malfunctioning in the system rather than on individual wrongdoers, I request additional clarification on how the needs and wishes of victims will be assured under the terms of this legislation. There are some 1,300 cases before the commission at present. The representative groups of the victims are hopeful that individual findings will be made. It was clear from last night&rsquo;s radio programme that the person being interviewed could name neither her abusers, of which there were many, nor the institutions in which she had been abused. She would have been relieved to be able to name the institutions and her abusers but was prevented from doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms M. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>This goes to the core of what the commission is trying to achieve and what it <Col N="2078"/>can and cannot do. It has been examined in considerable detail by Mr. Justice Ryan in his review of the commission. He looked at other child abuse inquiries in other countries to see how they had dealt with the issue. His views on the subject, which are reflected in this legislation, have been published. The purpose of the Government in setting up the commission, and indeed that of Mr. Justice Ryan, was that it should determine what happened and what was so wrong in society and in its institutions at the time that allowed it to happen. It does not focus on individual wrongdoers to discover cases of abuse but on the general situation. If it were to seek to discover cases of abuse then that would involve criminal trials. We would end up turning 1,300 cases into mini-trials and that is not what the commission is being established for. If it names individuals it would have to deal with people trying to defend themselves and clear their name regarding events over the past 40 years. He has said he will stick to naming people who have already been found guilty. It is important to separate the criminal from the commission. It is not necessary or desirable, from the point of what this commission is trying to achieve, to start naming individuals. We want to know what happened, why it happened and how we can make sure it does not happen again. If people wish to take criminal proceedings, the courts are the place for that, not the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The main thing many of the abused persons wanted was a situation where the people who abused them had no hiding place but were brought out into the open and identified. At the time the Bill was on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il I heard people making submissions to the effect that they were frustrated and aggrieved that there was somebody out there who had abused them savagely but was still somehow protected. While they cannot ever have satisfaction in their lives, on account of what they endured, they want it made public who their abusers were and the institutions in which the abuse took place. They want to know where their abusers are, because many of them are still alive. That is what they hoped for from the Bill and that is why I tabled the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms M. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>It might be helpful to outline for Senator Ulick Burke, Mr. Justice Ryan&rsquo;s position in his paper explaining why he does not wish to go down this road. He stated that a policy of identifying individuals may inadvertently have a number of negative implications for victims &mdash; which is not what anyone would wish &mdash; for several reasons. First, the policy of identifying and apportioning responsibility holds open the possibility of some abusers being exposed and might victimise those whose abusers are not exposed. Second, some victims might feel rejected and discriminated against by virtue of the fact that their abusers were not named while others were, despite the fact that the abuse perpetrated against the unnamed victims was far more heinous than <Col N="2079"/>that perpetrated against those who were named. Third, as the committee has the discretionary power to identify individuals, every person whose good name or reputation may be infringed by such identification has the right to the full range of constitutional protections, thus transforming each case before the investigation committee into a mini-trial.</P>
      <P>That is Mr. Justice Ryan&rsquo;s position as set out in his paper on this issue from May 2004. He is attempting to protect the victims so one category is not treated differently to another and to avoid turning everything into a mini-trial. I respect that as well as the manner in which he is attempting to do his work efficiently.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Although I accept the ruling on amendment No. 7, how can Members get confirmation regarding the resources made available under section 6? What guarantee is there that the resources which are required in many different ways will be made available and the frustration of the past will not recur? That was the sentiment behind the amendment. It specifically mentioned the Taoiseach to reflect the desire to transfer the commission from the Department of Education and Science to the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms M. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>As I stated earlier, the Department of Education and Science has provided the commission with all the resources it has sought. A total of &euro;10 million has been given to the commission for administration costs. In the Estimates process, a total of &euro;21 million has been provided for administration to cater for this year and the following two years. The commission has a staff of 53 and any resources requested by it have been put in place as quickly as possible. These are the figures sought by the Senator to show how good the relationship is between the Department and the commission as well as the level of resources which have been provided to it.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 14, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;(3) The Commission or a Committee may invite a person who has given evidence or made a submission or statement to or before it before the passing of this Act to supplement that evidence, submission or statement having regard to changes made to the functions or procedure of the Commission or a Committee by this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This amendment is to provide for the fact that previously the commission&rsquo;s procedure was different. My understanding is that the system calling people to give evidence before the commission differed. It is now grouped under institutions whereas there was a different procedure before this. The section as a whole pertains to transitional provisions and the amendment attempts to ensure that someone who gave evidence under the previous procedure can be recalled to give further evidence or clarifications and can be fitted in with the new procedure, if appropriate. I will be interested to hear the Minister&rsquo;s comments on the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms M. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The commission and each of its committees have the power to recall further evidence from someone who has already been before them or who has made a submission to the commission. This amendment is unnecessary as they already have that power.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 14, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;<?oasys _is0p2-?>&lsquo;educational service&rsquo; means a service provided by a recognised school or centre for education (within the meaning in each case of the Education Act 1998) or by a person or body specified by the Minister who provides a programme of education, training or instruction;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The Labour Party felt it would be helpful to define what is meant by educational service, so the parameters would be set out as to what could be funded under the legislation. It would be helpful to have that issue clarified so people would know where they stood. Although the amendment does not refer specifically to the issue, someone mentioned to one of my Labour Party colleagues that child care could also possibly be <Col N="2081"/>funded. If someone took up education as a result of this legislation, the cost of child care could be prohibitive for that person. This is merely an aside. Perhaps the Minister will clarify whether child care might be provided for under the funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms M. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Tuffy&rsquo;s second point negates her first point. If the term &ldquo;educational service&rdquo; was restricted in the way outlined by Senator Tuffy, it would probably remove the board&rsquo;s flexibility to cater for something like child care. When I heard that one person opted for driving lessons, I realised that while driving lessons can open up many opportunities for people to secure employment, they would not be taken in a school recognised by the Department of Education and Science. We must have this kind of flexibility. Other people opted for apprenticeship courses, dance lessons, grinds, bus driving, music lessons and swimming lessons. As each individual application comes in, one must examine the circumstances of the person to see how he or she might benefit from it.</P>
      <P>I know it was not Senator Tuffy&rsquo;s intention to narrow the options and I accept there must be some guidelines or criteria as a substantial amount of money is involved. However, with the establishment of an independent board, it will be able to outline the criteria for payments of grants and will also be obliged to publish a report every year, which will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas so it can be monitored. However, it is important not to be overly restrictive for the very reasons mentioned by Senator Tuffy.</P>

      <P LI="1">In page 15, line 4, to delete &ldquo;one year&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;three months&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The sentiment behind this amendment is to get the education board up and running in the shortest possible time. While certain steps must be carried out to facilitate its proper establishment, when the Oireachtas dealt with the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004, it agreed to pass an order establishing a special education council prior to the passing of the Act to allow for its speedy implementation. All agree that it is important that this particular board be established and put into operation as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms M. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not intend to delay the establishment of the education board as it is important. Equally, however, a period of three months will be too tight. An <i>ad hoc</i> committee already administers the scheme and it has taken <Col N="2082"/>applications for the coming school year, 2005 to 2006. It is important that this group should be allowed to continue with its work as it deals with the applicants. The interim period would allow the board to look at the criteria, procedures and the application process. As soon as that board is set up, the <i>ad hoc</i> group would end its work. However, the <i>ad hoc</i> group is in the middle of very valuable work dealing with the next academic year. I propose to allow it to get through that period and then set up the board immediately.</P>

	<P>I received a considerable amount of correspondence, as I am sure the Minister did, from people who are concerned about the constitutionality of setting up the board and the fund because the agreement between the Conference of Religious in Ireland and the then Minister for Education and Science was reached after the Bill went through the Houses of the Oireachtas. No more than anyone else, I am sure the Minister <Col N="2083"/>would not want anybody to challenge the fact this board is being set up in amending legislation. I note the Minister said that &ldquo;relevant deed&rdquo; means the deed made on 5 June 2002 between the Minister for Finance of the one part and the persons listed in the First Schedule to that deed of the other part. I gather the Minister has executive powers whereby she can settle claims. It might have been better if this had gone before the D&aacute;il but it may be perfectly all right. I would be grateful if the Minister would indicate that she has been assured it is all right so that the trust is on a statutory basis and will allow for the money to be used.</P>

In recruiting and employing employees, the education finance board will, like any State board, be expected and required to operate according to best practice in this regard and the legislation will not preclude the board from holding open competitions to select and appoint the staff it needs. However, I do not believe it would be appropriate to tie the hands of the board unduly in the way the proposed amendment would. For example, it may be to the board&rsquo;s advantage to appoint a person with relevant experience and expertise in adult education on a secondment basis.</P>
      <P>While the Departments of Education and Science and Finance will have to assess the staffing needs of the board, the recruitment and appointment of staff will largely be a matter for the board itself using, where appropriate, the services of the Public Appointments Service. At the end of the day, it will have to get the best qualified people for the job while ensuring that legislative requirements in regard to equality and non-discrimination are complied with. I do not believe the amendment tabled by Senator Ulick Burke is necessary or appropriate because it may unduly, or unintentionally, limit the flexibility of the board in the appointment of staff.</P>

It is very much a general permission to disclose information as opposed to one being able to be specific about what happened at the board, naming people and so on.</P>
      <P>People are going through a very difficult process in terms of what they have experienced and the fact they must go before the board. I hope the process will result in people feeling some relief afterwards but if they are not able to talk about it in the way we have outlined, it would not be helpful to them. We do not see the harm in allowing what we have provided for in our amendment.</P>
      <P>There has been correspondence in the newspapers on some people&rsquo;s experience of going before the board. Obviously, certain things must be kept confidential but people should be able to talk about their experiences in a restricted way so that they get the closure required. That is what we are trying to allow for in our amendment which is very restrictive in terms of what it allows.</P>

	<P>It is very hard to understand why people should be criminalised for disclosing that they were abused. I support this amendment because from what one reads in the newspapers and hears victims who have been before the redress board say, people would like to be able to say they were justified in making their complaint and that the State recognises this and has done something to try to give them some recompense. It is difficult to understand why another shameful secret should be made of this procedure. It was put to me in the case of the original abuse that sometimes people were given sweets or money to shut up. For them, to give them a few euro to keep quiet is the same thing happening again. It is important that the amendment be accepted.</P>

	<P>Section 28(6) of the Residential Institutions Redress Act prohibits the publication of information concerning an application or an award made under the Act that refers to any other person, relevant person, or institution by name or which could reasonably lead to the identification of any other person, relevant person, or institution. This is important because the redress board does not operate like a criminal court. It operates on a much lower threshold of proof. It does not make any finding of guilt in regard to any individual or institution. It is a confidential process held in private. Were one to allow people to start talking about names and institutions there is no doubt that many of these cases would end up going before the courts and compromising the whole process.</P>
      <P>Many people want the process to be private and prefer it to be private. It offers them an alternative to pursuing civil or criminal court cases, certainly civil court, cases in seeking compensation for their injuries. The confidentiality provision protects the victims but it also protects the <Col N="2086"/>good names of other people who may not have been investigated <i>per se</i> or have had the right to clear their good name while the names were mentioned at the commission.</P>
      <P>That a person has applied for or been granted redress does not stop them from criticising or publicising any wrong suffered. It is only the disclosure of the fact of the application to the redress board and any award or the name of any institution or person in the context of the application that they cannot speak about. A person may speak about his or her experiences in an institution but he or she cannot include any information relating to the fact that he or she made an application to the board. It does not prevent them speaking about their experiences, as many have done. If it were to be opened up so that names, institutions and so on could be mentioned we would end up trying to protect the good name of everybody. That is not what this is about.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 34 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>All the institutions and the residents of those institutions over the years have the opportunity, through this legislation, to tell their stories. Will the Minister agree there are other children who have been abused who do not have access to this structure to tell their stories and have redress? It is important that provision be made for day schools. I hope the Minister will see the merit of allowing that facility to be extended to them and, likewise, those who took part in clinical trials.</P>
      <P>For those who took part in clinical trials in those institutions the sad reality is that they did not have a choice, they were forced into a situation of involvement. I do not know why clinical trials in the institutions were not included as an integral part of the process. I appreciate it is a particularly difficult area and I hope that short of including it in this instance, the Minister would indicate that the issue of clinical trials will be dealt with in due course because there are victims. Perhaps the Minister will indicate how this particular group will be dealt with in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms M. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The inclusion of day schools has been discussed a number of times. The Residential Institutions Redress Board was established as an alternative mechanism to the courts to allow people to get redress. These were people who were former residents of institutions. The key point is that the State had a significant supervisory or regulatory responsibility. The same is not true of day schools. The children who were in institutions were separated from their parents and did not have the care and protection that families would usually enjoy. They were in the <Col N="2087"/>care of those institutions 24 hours per day, seven days per week. The State was responsible for putting them there and the institution was responsible for caring for them. However, the statutory duty was not met. The same cannot be said of the day cases. The commission deals with day school cases and has indicated that it intends to interview each of the day school applicants. It can then make recommendations on the issue of the day school cases should it so wish.</P>
      <P>Vaccine trials will not be dealt with by the commission because the courts have already ruled that the investigation of these children under the commission legislation is <i>ultra vires</i> and cannot, therefore, be allowed to continue. It is primarily a matter for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children. I understand procedures are being put in place to revoke the statutory instrument which provided for the additional function of investigating the vaccine trials as part of the task of the commission in line with the judgment of the courts. The courts have decided that because vaccine trials do not comply with the description of abuse under the legislation they will not qualify for redress.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister and her officials for the time and effort they have put into this delicate issue. All of us want the best possible outcome for those who were so sadly abused in Ireland for decades. Apologies have been made and that is all any of us can do. It is important that the board be as fine-tuned as possible to enable those who wish to do so to tell their stories and that the public also has a knowledge of what happened. It is important also that those who can be indemnified are indemnified.</P>
      <P>The educational aspect is extraordinarily important because some got little or no education. It is important that they and any relatives who may have suffered because of the lack of education are in a position to avail of it now. I thank the Minister and her officials for all the help they have given to all of us who have taken part in the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I too thank the Minister and her officials for the work they have done over such a long period. Since 1999 when the Taoiseach made the apology, the Department officials and various Ministers have worked hard to bring to a con<Col N="2088"/>clusion the hardship and the terrible trauma that so many people in this country experienced in the care of the State and in particular under the auspices of the Department of Education as it was then called.</P>
      <P>What happened was a tragedy. The State was negligent in not having inspection mechanisms thereby allowing the abuse in those institutions to continue. As has been said in both Houses on a number of occasions the covering up that went on to justify a continuation of the most horrible tragedies ever known was unbelievable. A number of lives and families were destroyed. The presentations by the victims were horrifying. We must have the utmost confidence in the current Minister for Education and Science and her officials that everything that can possibly be done will be done and that the opportunity to commit such terrible crimes will never arise again.</P>
      <P>As I have said on many occasions in this House, I regret that we lost the former chairperson of the commission, Ms Justice Laffoy. She expressed regret at having to resign because of issues that were badly handled by the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey. I say this with no recrimination towards the present Minister for Education and Science or her officials. If there had been greater understanding and greater visible support for Ms Justice Laffoy at the time, much of the recrimination that has taken place from 1999 to today would not have been necessary. What happened during that period gave the wrong message to many people who had been hurt. Thankfully all of that has been redressed and I look forward to the Minister returning to the House on a regular basis to indicate the progress made in terms of satisfying, if possible, those seeking redress so that they can return to some sort of normal lives for themselves and their families. I hope the Government will not be found wanting in the future.</P>

	<P>I concur with the comments of Senators Henry and Ulick Burke. I thank the Minister and her staff for their work on this legislation. The education finance board is a very worthwhile initiative and I hope it will be successful. It is a very positive way to help compensate the victims of abuse and to help them in their future lives. I agree with Senator Ulick Burke that it would be useful to get further updates on how the process is working.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I endorse the sentiments expressed regarding the Minister. I compliment her on the manner in which this Bill has been taken in both Houses. It is no great surprise to me that the Minister is a person of great clarity, as I have come to know over the years in her work in other areas. I am delighted that she has piloted this Bill through the Houses. It establishes a further milestone in the learning curve for us all.</P><Col N="2089"/>
      <P>Along with other countries we have been on a learning curve as to how to deal with these most horrible experiences, the detail of which we will not mention now. I congratulate the Minister for the accommodating and understanding manner in which she has steered the Bill through the other House and particularly this one. She has clarified all the issues brought to her attention. I also thank the Department officials for their helpful and accommodating assistance.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11.7-?>
      <P>I refer briefly to a reference made to one of the Minister&rsquo;s predecessors. In fairness to all concerned at that time we were at a very early stage and I do not want to dwell on the matter. The Department of Education and Science had sought to learn from the experiences in other countries. Some of the decisions at the time could have been made with greater enlightenment. However, it is not for me to criticise anybody. When mistakes were made these were acknowledged. We can learn from mistakes and make improvements, and we are seeing the improvements.</P>
      <P>I am very heartened by this Bill, which addresses head-on the principle that justice delayed is justice denied.</P>

Many views have been expressed on the abuse that took place and it was important for this Bill to be quickly passed by both Houses. While some people were responsible for serious misdemeanours in the past, we must also recognise that thousands of others did an excellent job in many of those institutions. I compliment all involved and I thank the Opposition spokespersons for their co-operation on this important legislation.</P>

	<P>I thank the Senators for their co-operation and commitment to the work of the commission. Senator Henry used the word &ldquo;delicate&rdquo;. This is a very sensitive issue. We all want to do as much as is possible for the survivors and to ensure that the processes we introduce are speedy, efficient and get the desired results for them. In my work I am very fortunate in having the support of a tremendous group of officials as has been recognised by the Senators. They are dedicated to their work and give it considerable time and commitment, which is not always easy when dealing with such a sensitive matter.</P>
      <P>Any difficulties that may have arisen in the past did not arise out of any maliciousness or bad faith on the part of anybody. Nobody could have anticipated the number of applications that were made. The whole country was surprised and officials were overwhelmed by the way applications were made so quickly, which gave rise to considerable documentation. We must remember <Col N="2090"/>that they needed to find relevant documentation going back over 40, 50 or even 60 years. In so far as information was not provided quickly it was because of an inability to do so in the timeframe provided. Everybody worked in good faith. We are now making progress building on the apology made in 1999.</P>
      <P>I have been very fortunate in working with Mr. Justice Ryan and also with Mr. Justice O&rsquo;Leary on the Residential Institutions Redress Board, both of whom have given great commitment to the process. With the passage of this legislation I hope that we can be satisfied that we are doing our bit as legislators to redress some of the wrong inflicted on people on the watch of previous administrations in an earlier generation.</P>

    <Title>Matter raised under Standing Order 30.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Government Whip for standing in to replace the Leader during discussion of this matter raised under Standing Order 30, which I also mentioned on the Order of Business. As the Senators are aware, vast sums of money are raised by the Revenue Commissioners through stamp duty as a result of the significant increase in house prices in recent years. In recognition of the way in which first-time buyers have been priced out of the housing market, in December&rsquo;s budget the Government finally moved to introduce some relief for first-time house buyers. That was something we called for on this side of the House, along with many others outside the House.</P>
      <P>It is with alarm that I discovered that the Revenue Commissioners have issued guidelines to the financial institutions stating that to qualify for the relief, the entirety of the purchased moneys, including any borrowings, must be provided by the first-time buyer. Any person who provides part of the purchased moneys, or who is party to any borrowing relating to such purchase is also regarded as a buyer of the house and relief will not be available, unless that person is a first-time buyer.</P>
      <P>It is the case that many financial institutions are demanding that first-time buyers have a guarantor and a co-lender in the name of a family member or a guardian. This is now being interpreted by the Revenue Commissioners as meaning that the first-time buyer is not entitled to the full relief on the duty.</P>
      <P>This is an abominable situation and it means that first time buyers are now being hit unknown to themselves for a bill of &euro;9,000 to &euro;15,000, as Senator Ulick Burke informed me this morning. It is a deliberate attempt by the Revenue Commissioners to misinterpret and misread an Act of the Oireachtas, the Finance Act, which was <Col N="2091"/>passed by both Houses earlier this year, as a means of giving some help and relief to first-time buyers. I am glad to hear that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance will meet with the Revenue Commissioners about this point. If it requires the introduction of additional legislation, let us have it by the end of next week to clarify the matter.</P>
      <P>Financial institutions demanding additional verification on the part of family members and friends to ensure that the first-time buyer is given the full borrowings to allow him or her to buy the house is not the same as suggesting that the family member or friend owns a part of the asset. That is the crucial point which has to be clarified as soon as possible. I thank the Acting Chairman for allowing me to raise this matter under Standing Order 30.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 7, which was, I understand, discussed in some detail on Committee and Report Stages in the D&aacute;il, empowers the Minister to employ people on a contract basis in the public service. Deputy Bruton raised a number of issues on Committee Stage on the Quigley report which dealt with the appointment of an individual to advise on public relations in the Office of Public Works and the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. According to my reading of section 7, Mr. Quigley&rsquo;s recommendations have not been taken on board. Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, has a few remarks to make on the matter and can advise me differently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 7 inserts a new section 5(<i>a</i>) into the 1956 Act to provide clarification on the initial appointment of persons as civil servants. It provides that persons may be appointed as established civil servants on contract in a probationary capacity. Currently, when officers such as executive and administrative officers enter the Civil <Col N="2092"/>Service, they are employed in an unestablished capacity on a probationary contract for the first year of service. Following the satisfactory completion of the probationary period, the officers may be appointed on an established basis. It was proposed to change the procedure to provide that instead of being unestablished for a year, officers could be appointed in an established capacity while on contract in the probationary period. The change would resolve current administrative difficulties associated with the transfer from unestablished to established status, including the need to move to an established pension scheme.</P>
      <P>The Office of the Attorney General advised that it was not possible under the 1956 Act to employ an established officer on a contractual basis as established civil servants are employed at the will and pleasure of the Government, which is relationship of a non-contractual nature. As new officers are appointed on a probationary contract, they can only be appointed in an unestablished capacity which may lead to establishment following satisfactory completion of probation. To clarify the position and reduce the administrative burden associated with the practice, the Bill amends section 5 of the 1956 Act to provide that officers can be appointed in an established capacity on entering the Civil Service on the basis of a probationary contract. The section, which was amended in the D&aacute;il, provided originally that a person could be engaged as an established civil servant for a specified period or the duration of a particular project or requirement. As the provision was removed, the section deals solely with civil servants serving during probationary periods.</P>
      <P>In light of the foregoing and in view of the fact that the Bill no longer deals with appointments for a specified time or particular project, the amendment offered on Committee Stage was not accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>As an aside, I note the Minister of State referred to the &ldquo;will and pleasure&rdquo; of the Government.

    <P LI="1">In page 13, line 20, to delete &ldquo;or&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendments in the grouping relate to the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission. Most of the amendments are technical and arise on foot of amendment No. 4. The purpose of the amendments is to clarify the dismissal arrangements for the staff of the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.</P>
      <P>Currently, section 14 of the Bill amends section 20 of the Staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas Act 1959. As drafted, the section provides that the dismissing authority for all officers at principal officer level and above in the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas shall be the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission. The dismissing authority for all officers below principal officer level will be the Secretary General of the office, which is in line with the general principles of the Bill. Section 14 does not currently amend the provisions in section 20 of the 1959 Act, which provides that the dismissing authority in the case of the Clerk of the D&aacute;il, Clerk Assistant of the D&aacute;il, Clerk of the Seanad, Clerk Assistant of the Seanad, the Superintendent and the Captain of the Guard is the Government, following a process of consultation with the relevant chairman of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission. This provision is not fully in line with the central principles in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Following discussions with the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas and on the advice of the Office of the Attorney General, I propose a new Part 3 of the Bill to address the matter by bringing together a number of amendments on the Houses of the Oireachtas and the commission. In light of the devolved dismissal arrangements envisaged in the Bill, it would be inconsistent with the independence of the Houses to have the Government as the appropriate dismissing authority for the officers in question. The amendment will not result in a significant change in the current policy in the Bill, but will retain certain protections set out in the 1959 and 2003 Acts which relate to the dismissal of Clerk of the D&aacute;il, Clerk Assistant of the D&aacute;il, Clerk of the Seanad, Clerk Assistant of the Seanad, the Superintendent and the Captain of the Guard.</P>
      <P>The effect of the amendment I am proposing will be to retain the current safeguards set out in the 1959 and 2003 Acts, which provide that the dismissal of these officers can only take place after a process of consultation while at the same time linking the principle of devolved authority, which is one of the central provisions of the amendment Bill. In line with the provisions of the Bill, the responsibility for dismissal will be devolved to the Minister responsible for appointing a successor, who in the case of these officers is the Taoiseach. The practical effect of the <Col N="2094"/>amendment will be that the Government can assign the authority to dismiss the Clerk and Clerk Assistant of the Seanad and of the D&aacute;il to the Taoiseach, who may act on the recommendation of the Cathaoirleach or the Ceann Comhairle, as the case may be, following consultation by him with the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.</P>
      <P>In the cases of the Superintendent and the Captain of the Guard, the dismissing authority will again be the Taoiseach, after consultation with the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach and consultation with the commission. The rationale for assigning the responsibility to the Taoiseach comes from the fact that the Taoiseach, following a similar process of consultation, is also the appointing authority for each of these officers. This is consistent with the provision in section 7 of the Bill where the Government can assign the dismissing authority to the Minister who has the power of appointing a successor to that civil servant.</P>
      <P>No change is proposed in regard to other officers within the Oireachtas, other than that the arrangements for them will reflect the new devolved management structures elsewhere in the Civil Service. This will mean that officers at principal officer level and above will be dismissible by the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission &mdash; the relevant &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; for the purposes of the Act &mdash; on receipt of a recommendation from the Secretary General of the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas, while officers below that level will be dismissible by the Secretary General of the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>A consequential amendment arising out of the new part in the Bill is to ensure that the Secretary General of the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas is treated in the same way as other Secretaries General for the purposes of the Act. Section 10 of the Bill currently amends section 15(6) of the Civil Service Regulation Act 1956 to provide that officers either holding a position to which they were appointed to by the Government or holding a position as a Revenue Commissioner, are not subject to the disciplinary sanctions set out in section 15.</P>
      <P>Under the Staff of the Houses Oireachtas Act 1959 and the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Act 2003, the Secretary General of the Houses of the Oireachtas is appointed by the Taoiseach on the recommendation of the Chairman after consultation by him with the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission. The office holder is therefore not automatically excluded from the provisions of section 15 in the way other Secretaries General are.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 3 are technical amendments which provide in section 15(6) of the Act for the explicit exclusion of the Secretary General of the Office of the Houses of the <Col N="2095"/>Oireachtas from the measures set out in that section. This provision will ensure that all Secretaries General are treated in a similar manner. Amendment No. 4 will give effect to the arrangements for dismissals in the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas that I have just outlined. This amendment will insert a new Part 3 to the Bill. The remainder of the amendments in this group are technical and are needed to give effect to the provisions which I have set out.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to delete section 14 of the Bill. This section provides that the dismissal of a member of staff at the grade of principal officer or above shall only be on the recommendation of the Secretary General. This provision is now replicated as part of the new Part 3 of the Bill. It is proposed to delete section 15 of the Bill in order to move it to the new Part 3 of the Bill. Amendment No. 5 replicates the exact text contained in section 15 and moves it to the new part of the Bill which deals specifically with the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas. Similarly, I propose to move section 16 of the Bill to the new Part 3 of the Bill. Amendment No. 6 is required to replicate the provisions of this section in the new part to the Bill. I propose amendment No. 7 to provide for the amendment of the Staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas Act 1959 in the Long Title of the Bill. I propose amendment No. 8 to provide for the amendment of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Act 2003 in the Long Title of the Bill.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State and his officials for bringing this Bill to the House. It is important legislation and a great deal of work went into it. I apologise on behalf of our spokesperson, Senator Mansergh, who was unable to be present. It is most important that the Bill would be passed by both Houses. I thank the Opposition spokespersons for their help and co-operation with the Bill in this House. We will never achieve perfect legislation but it can always be revisited and updated or improved. The Bill we are about to pass is an improvement on existing legislation and I thank the Minister of State and his officials for bringing it before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State and his officials. I share Senator Moylan&rsquo;s sentiments but I cannot agree that it was speedily done. The Bill&rsquo;s passage through this House might have been fast but an eight year delay in passing legislation is hardly desirable. However, the Bill is to be welcomed by and large although it does not go far enough in certain areas.</P>
      <P>I said on Second Stage that the next opportunity which arises, be it in the form of a benchmarking II or some new form of benchmarking, should be grasped by the Minister to ensure a real reform agenda in the public service. There is a feeling among the general public, who are the consumers of public services, that they are not getting value for money. We missed opportunities before now and I hope that when we get another opportunity to deal with this matter, the Minister of State and officials will be able to ensure we have a truly progressive reform agenda for the public service. Despite what was said by some Senators on Second Stage about money not being the be-all and end-all, public servants should be and should expect to be suitably rewarded for excellent performance. This is the one missing factor. We need to incentivise people to perform well but we have not been doing so.</P>
      <P>Senator McDowell made a very good point on his Second Stage contribution to the effect that it only takes one person who is not performing to the best of his ability to have an effect on or infect the others in the office. In view of this we need to ensure that those who are performing to the best of their ability are suitably rewarded, as they would be in the private sector. If we use the next phase of benchmarking to achieve this, we will improve the standard of public service and improve the environment in which people in the public service work. It would make the public service more attractive to people leaving education such that they would regard a public service job as a perfectly legitimate occupation.</P><Col N="2099"/>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State and his officials. Perhaps the Bill does not go far enough but it is welcome none the less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank everyone involved with this Bill. It marks a major progression in terms of encouraging civil servants. As Senator John Paul Phelan stated, it is very important that public servants be encouraged and rewarded for working to the best of their ability. The Bill is also important in terms of discipline and dismissal, which it addresses very strongly. Some of the areas with which the Bill deals are very technical. <Col N="2100"/>It outlines what would happen in the highly unlikely event of someone such as a Captain of the Guard having to be dismissed and nominates who should do this. It is important that the provisions in the Bill be very clear. This is the case.</P>
      <P>We have had a very good debate. I thank Senators Moylan and John Paul Phelan and, in particular, the officials from the Department of Finance, who have worked long and hard in bringing this Bill through the Houses.</P>
