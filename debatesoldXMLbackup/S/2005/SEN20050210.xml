	<P>I have received notice from Senator Quinn that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to place an obligation on local water treatment schemes to put in the public domain at regular intervals a full technical analysis of the water provided, such as is provided to French consumers.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Ulick Burke of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to extend medical card coverage to cover cancer sufferers, asthmatics and coeliacs under the GMS.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, a procedural motion agreed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges regarding the printing of Bills to facilitate the Opposition or any party &mdash; it allows for three Seanad Bills to be presented by any group within the Seanad as currently it is only possible for one Seanad Bill to be presented by a group &mdash; to be taken without debate; and No. 2, Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Bill 2002 &mdash; Report and Final Stages, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 1.30 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>We read in the newspapers today of the success of the Garda in targeting criminals in parts of Dublin, for example, in flashpoints like Finglas and Blanchardstown. The Garda success can be attributed to the additional manpower put in place. Some 300 suspects have been arrested and gangs that were operating <Col N="554"/>against ATMs in Dublin and throughout the country and that were importing mock arms from the US have been broken up. That news is very welcome.</P>
      <P>The downside, however, is that this report is a clear indication to the Government of the inadequacy of Garda numbers. Where extra garda&iacute; are provided, they can achieve tremendous success. Another downside is, as has happened in the past, that when criminals are marginalised in Dublin, they decide to go to the country because they are well aware of the inadequacy of Garda numbers in certain urban and rural areas. I fear that Garda numbers are inadequate to combat the hordes of criminals that will drift to the country to continue their crime cycle. Operation Crossover Two, as it is known, is targeting criminals in those areas in Dublin. It has been a tremendous success and the garda&iacute; involved are to be commended on their success.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader request the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to immediately put in place adequate Garda numbers to tackle the increase in headline crime, especially in the counties surrounding Dublin? Headline crime in Meath has increased by 21%. There has been a corresponding increase in crime as the population in counties Meath and Kildare has increased. Will the Leader ask the Minister to increase in a focused way the number of garda&iacute; on the beat in those areas?</P>
      <P>In recent months many Senators have called for a debate on the BMW region. There is a clear deficit in Government policy in this area. A total of &euro;640 million was unspent in this region in the past year. This clearly shows a lack of Government effort and concentration on the development of a proper regional policy.</P>
      <P>When the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, was in the Department of Transport he indicated that &euro;300 million would be made available for the provision of a rail link between Sligo and Limerick. At the same time, &euro;3 billion was allocated for the provision of rail and infrastructure in the eastern part of the country. There is inadequate provision for roads, water and sewerage schemes in the west of Ireland. Given the infrastructural deficit in the BMW region, it is galling that the Government would leave &euro;640 million unspent. Will the Leader ensure the Minister with responsibility for this area comes to the House to debate the reasons behind this apparent lack of policy in order that we can bring about an improvement in infrastructure in the western region?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Seeing as the matter was first raised in this House, we should note the copious apology from Kevin Myers in today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>. The matter is dealt with now. It is over and we should accept the apology in the spirit in which it was offered.</P>
      <P>I am sure both Mr. Ed. Walsh and Mr. Kevin Myers would be very pleased to see from this morning&rsquo;s news that two high-profile single parents on the other island have done their best to reduce the number of single parents. We should add our congratulations to the decision of Camilla Parker Bowles and the Prince of Wales to tie the knot&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The question was raised yesterday with the Leader about the importance of having another transport debate. I am sure she will confirm that prior to Christmas we decided to have two debates on transport; one on transport in the Dublin area, which we had and the other on transport issues elsewhere in the country. We should have that as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>A report was carried out on the Dunboyne rail link, which most of us believe should be the Navan rail link. We should make clear our position on that issue. We also await a report on the <Col N="556"/>western rail corridor. This ties in with the point made by Senator Burke on the BMW region. It is an important issue. The Shannon rail link also needs to be debated.</P>
      <P>Senator Morrissey raised the important issue yesterday of an outer ring road for Dublin, following on from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s reference to such a proposal. This would be of great importance for transport to and from the city and the matter should be discussed. We have a good opportunity to discuss these projects now before they move on and wrong decisions are taken, for example, on the western rail corridor, ending the train line at Dunboyne or in regard to an outer ring road around Dublin. These are crucial issues on which there is a significant degree of consensus on both sides of the House. I ask that we would deal with this promptly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Ryan should be allowed to speak without interruption.</P>

	<P>The party opposite me made its own wonderful gesture towards reconciliation between the traditions when a former Senator moved from Fianna F&aacute;il, the republican party, to take the whip of the Ulster Unionist Party in the House of Lords. It was a fine gesture of reconciliation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>This morning on the radio the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment spoke about labour inspectors who are supposed to enforce the rights of migrant workers. After much humming and hawing he conceded that they only carry out inspections after a complaint has been made. Let us remember about whom we are speaking. We speak about people who are here on temporary work visas in the gift of their employers. A person can be let go and sent home if his or her employer is unhappy.</P>
      <P>These people do not speak English and in many cases do not speak any European language that somebody in their vicinity might speak. They often live in isolation. It is left to them to make a complaint about being badly treated before the industrial inspectorate takes action. This hardly suggests a great enthusiasm for protecting the rights of these people. It suggests a certain level of indifference. A member of SIPTU made the point on a few occasions that more people are employed to look after dog licences than after the rights of migrant workers. We will create enormous problems for the future if we do not protect the rights of migrant workers from the beginning.</P>
      <P>Some of these problems extend to migrant workers who come from other EU countries. Due to changes in social welfare legislation, if they are not here for a reasonable period of time their employer can offer them the option of leaving their job for a life of destitution, as they would not be entitled to anything, or staying in the job and putting up with abuse. These people will be abused if we do not have a vigorous industrial inspectorate.</P>
      <P>In the context of abuse, I refer to a report this morning about a very well known hotel, one which claims international prestige, that is partly owned by a family which also has a great interest in the media here. The Labour Court has recommended pay increases of between 15% and 20% which will give a receptionist &euro;350 per week after the increase and give somebody working in the kitchen &euro;337 per week. This is a non-union hotel where the Labour Court decision, as of now, has not been accepted. The case may have to go to the Circuit Court. The issue of the rights of ordinary semi-skilled and poorly-skilled workers is not just one about migrant workers, rather it is about attitudes in Ireland. When a hotel, which can charge up to &euro;1,000 per night for a suite, <Col N="558"/>objects to paying its receptionist &euro;350 per week, a fundamental moral question must be asked, particularly when those involved own media organs which give us lectures about right and wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>It regularly appears to be the case that when this House debates media issues, the media&rsquo;s interest in the Seanad expands exponentially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>One need only mention a newspaper, RTE or any other organ of the media for it to receive widespread interest and coverage. Nevertheless, it is important we acknowledge the fact that <i>The Irish Times</i> in its lead article and in Kevin Myers&rsquo;s &ldquo;Irishman&rsquo;s Diary&rdquo; column gave a comprehensive apology for the use of a word in that column. However, Kevin Myers confirms his detachment from reality when he states in the course of his column: &ldquo;I deliberately used the word &ldquo;bastard&rdquo; because I genuinely feel that the word has no stigma attached to it.&rdquo; That is a cogent confirmation of Mr. Myers&rsquo;s detachment from reality. The final word on the matter might be best left to a correspondent to the letters page in <i>The Irish Times</i> who suggests that when Mr. Myers was looking for a word to describe the offspring of unmarried mothers he could have used the word &ldquo;children&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I commend the national pensions reserve fund commission on securing a 9.3% return on the fund in 2004. Any fund manager or asset manager in any of the large brokerage houses in this country would look enviously at that figure. It is a very good performance by the fund which brings its value to almost &euro;12 billion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>One cannot beat State enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The Irish stock market was up 26% last year. In that context, 9% is not much of a return&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Dardis without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash; especially considering that we are paying these guys big money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>The fund might be very wise in one year to have all its assets in Irish equities but it would not be a very wise course of action on a long-term basis; it is wise to have a basket of investments. By the standards of the industry, the return is a good one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>That is as much a comment on the industry and how poor the returns are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>That the fund has now grown to &euro;12 billion confirms the wisdom of the then Minister for Finance, former Deputy McCreevy, when he introduced it. It is confirmed by the statement <Col N="559"/>that five people are now working for every one pensioner, which ratio will have fallen to two to one by the middle of the century. Many people who are now working will be very grateful for the fact that the Minister for Finance at the time introduced the fund because money will be available to meet those pension needs. In that context, I request a debate on pensions in general and how people need to provide for their needs, rather than one specifically about the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Several Senators have indicated so I ask that they be brief as the group leaders have taken up a considerable amount of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the comments made by Senator Ulick Burke in regard to the success of the garda&iacute; in west Dublin in tracking down the number of criminals in the area and confiscating a huge number of illegal weapons held by them, evidence of which we saw on our television screens last night. I received figures from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform this morning which demonstrate that in Dublin 15 last year, some 79 crimes were committed using firearms. This high number of incidents represents an increase of more than 20 on the previous year and indicates we have a major problem. There have been several deaths as a result of violent and criminal activity. I welcome that the number of garda&iacute; in the area has been increased, although we need more there and elsewhere. We know that the provision of additional garda&iacute; and resources results in a reduction in crime. If the garda&iacute; are given all the help and resources they need, we will see the benefits. I welcome the progress made in west Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday and last week I raised the question of pedestrians and joggers wearing reflective vests in the context of safety on the roads. In order for people to use the roads safely, particularly cyclists, pedestrians or joggers, they must be seen. There is growing evidence to suggest that people do not consider motorists and, when an accident occurs, they are very often demonised &mdash; sometimes rightly but sometimes wrongly. In that context, will the Leader invite the Minister for Transport to come before the House for a debate on road safety so that my point and those of others can be made?</P>
      <P>There is growing evidence to suggest that our inland waterways, rivers, lakes and canals are being denuded of fish by anglers. I do not refer to the traditional game anglers or course anglers because in many cases, even in competition, game anglers will return fish &mdash; even salmon &mdash; to the water. However, in other cases that is not happening, especially in our canals and rivers. Fishermen are taking everything out and not putting anything back in. Will the Leader and our spokesperson, Senator Kenneally, invite the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources <Col N="560"/>to come before the House to debate the matter and take action on it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Our economy has been doing very well in recent years and one of the reasons given for the investment from abroad is that Ireland is one of the English-speaking nations in the European Community. However, figures published today suggest we have a long way to go and cannot become complacent because Ireland is the only country in Europe which does not teach a foreign language at primary school level. The figures also suggest that Ireland is one of two countries, with Scotland, which does not provide for a compulsory foreign language at second level. The Minister for Education and Science should come before the House and tell us if she has plans to do something about these two particular areas because the complacency which could develop about our economy could be damaging.</P>
      <P>Senator Ulick Burke referred to today&rsquo;s crime figures. The Oireachtas passed legislation on taxis in 2003 and I am glad that the National Taxi Advisory Council now has a taxi regulator who is developing a charter for taxis. However, we have not yet established a ban on criminals obtaining a taxi licence. If a charter for the control of taxis is imminent, we should ask the taxi regulator to move immediately on that particular aspect of it. If criminals are still able to get taxi licences, even though we passed the legislation two years ago, we should not delay trying to achieve that ban.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan"><NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday morning, many Senators spoke in anticipation of the apology to be offered by the British Prime Minister to the concerned families. I acknowledge the fact that he offered that apology and express appreciation for it. It is the first of many steps the British Prime Minister could take in regard to Ireland. For example, he could agree to participation in a proper public inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings to bring closure to those unfortunate families. This would be very welcome.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Glynn&rsquo;s request for a debate on road safety, particularly in regard to road users other than motorists such as pedestrians, cyclists and joggers. If they were properly clad, it would help motorists who are blamed for everything.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the requests by Senators Ulick Burke and Terry in regard to the Garda. As we know, it is a very fine force which has shown what it is capable of in dealing with crime once it is let at it properly. Given the way some segments of society have become reckless, criminal and lawless, the hands of the Garda cannot be tied. The force must be better resourced and properly funded. As Senators Ulick Burke and Terry pointed out, a more focussed approach can bring better results in dealing with criminality.</P><Col N="561"/>
      <P>I also support Senator Glynn&rsquo;s comments on reflective garments for other road users so that more lives can be saved. Will the Leader arrange a debate on this issue? As we are in the Chinese year of the rooster, will the Leader give the House an update on what is happening with the Great Southern Hotels Group?</P>

	<P>I support Senator Glynn&rsquo;s calls regarding road safety in so far as it applies to other road users such as pedestrians and joggers. Those who travel on rural roads at night know well the grave dangers involved. We have all had near misses involving pedestrians. Those dangers need to be highlighted and people must be encouraged to wear clothing that will make them conspicuous to other road users. Senator Glynn often raises this issue on the Order of Business. Can it be broadened into a main debate because of all the horrific accidents involving pedestrians? By having such a debate, a list of suggestions could be drawn up to be put forward for wider public debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Callanan&rsquo;s comments on yesterday&rsquo;s apology by Prime Minister Blair. Apologies are usually facile and redundant. I agree that it should be followed up with some action, particularly in regard to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. The appropriate papers should be made available and individuals made responsible and accountable. It is dreadful to imagine that agents of governments could have colluded in the massacre of innocent citizens. It is the Government&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure the rights and lives of its citizens. Every facility should be made available to those inquiring into this dreadful situation. I welcome the Taoiseach&rsquo;s indication yesterday that he would facilitate the relatives of the Omagh victims who are seeking papers in this State. I hope it will be done speedily.</P>
      <P>The matter of Prince Charles&rsquo;s engagement to Camilla Parker Bowles was raised with some frivolity. While I am not against frivolity, I believe any decent person would wish these people every happiness.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>There was a certain sneering tone in some of the contributions. I wonder if Members realise how that may be regarded in the sister isle, if they ever heard of it, or in the North of Ireland. We are always cosying up to the North of Ireland, saying how nice we want to be to the Unionists. Let us really show it then.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, the House debated the tabloidisation of news and Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles are real victims of it. We should <Col N="562"/>be supporting them against people like Rupert Murdoch and <i>The Sun</i>. There were the &ldquo;Camillagate&rdquo; tapes, where a newspaper listened into a private conversation between them and published it. Those responsible should have been sent to jail. At the time, Camilla Parker Bowles behaved with great dignity and graciousness by never responding. She is a remarkable woman. Prince Charles, an intelligent and decent man, is a friend of this country. When he visited Ireland, he was made welcome. He visited here despite the fact that his great uncle was blown to smithereens by the armed wing of a political party that sits in the Lower House. Most of its activists, like their leaders are, unlike Prince Charles, descendants of the Cromwellian planters which one can see from looking at their names. Prince Charles, on the other hand, is a direct descendant of Hugh<?oasys [jy?>O&rsquo;Neill and Brian Bor&uacute;.</P>

      <P>When suggestions are made in the House that require considerable Government investment, Members should be conscious of existing assets. I welcome the completion of the transport debate and the rail links mentioned such as Dunboyne and Shannon. However, it is forgotten that there is already a railway line to Navan from Dublin. When the Spencer Dock rail station is opened, the people of Navan should demand a share in the line capacity into Dublin, rather than waiting 15 years for a line to be re-opened to Navan. This can be done quickly. Members should recall the example of the late Brian Lenihan and Albert Reynolds re-opening the Maynooth line.</P>
      <P>When visiting County Kerry last week, I noted with some distress that the road signs were removed from a place that is one of our national treasures.</P>

	<P>I thought Senator Coghlan would have raised the matter as to who could be making a profit from the road signs in County Kerry. It is a matter of equal distress to me that the sign on the Urlingford side of the County Tipperary border proclaiming &ldquo;The Premier <Col N="563"/>County &mdash; Home of Hurling&rdquo;, has also disappeared.</P>

      <P>Recently, the Stewart report on telephone usage highlighted the dangers to children of using mobile telephones. An Irish doctors&rsquo; group has also expressed its concerns.

    <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Senator Ulick Burke in calling for a debate on the BMW region. The underspend of &euro;600 million is a disgrace, particularly when there are still many infrastructural deficiencies in the region. In line with this, it would be appropriate to have a debate on the progress of the national spatial strategy. To make it a success, legislation must be introduced to get all State and semi-State arms to respect the aspirations of the strategy as this has not been the case in the past. Recently, when Bord G&aacute;is was before an Oireachtas committee, it proudly showed a map of the country with no Bord G&aacute;is infrastructure and no plans to put it in the BMW region, almost like a gaping wound in the north west. Like the great British colonialists of old, it has no difficulty in stealing the west&rsquo;s resources from the Corrib gasfield and bringing them back to the motherland in Cork.</P>

	<P>Yesterday, people picketed the gates of Leinster House seeking radiotherapy services for the south east.

Debates on the BMW region and the national spatial strategy would be worthwhile as we plan for the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>Last night, I watched with great interest a television report on the massive Garda operation, and its unprecedented success, against organised crime. While I am delighted with such <Col N="564"/>an outcome, I must ask how this criminal activity evolved. How did the Garda and the authorities allow organised criminals, thugs and gangsters in west Dublin to become established? It happened because the Garda did not have the resources to deal with the symptoms of organised criminal activity. Drugs and the smuggling of counterfeit goods are fuelling the activities of these organised gangsters.</P>
      <P>Recently, a tanker with false numberplates, bearing the Shell logo and carrying customs non-approved fuel, was involved in a road accident. The only reason it was caught was that the poor driver crashed it. What is happening in this country?</P>
      <P>I have complained all along that the resources are not present in the north west to tackle illegal dealing in drugs. The Customs and Excise boat in that area has now been sold and because of downsizing and reducing costs, the five people involved in the work will now be paid for doing nothing. Anyone who would like to bring drugs into this country is therefore advised to bring them in by the north west and then by rail to Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Ulick Burke in calling for a second debate on transport outside Dublin in particular. It is critically important in light of the Government policy on balanced regional development that we have a full discussion in this House on all aspects of transportation infrastructure outside the capital. Great deficiencies exist, particularly on the western rail corridor and down to County Clare where the problems affect us with regard to the Shannon rail link. That has been proposed for some time and is vital for the future development of Shannon Airport together with the road infrastructure right across the west of Ireland, in terms of creating a balance with Dublin. The only way to deal with the growing congestion in Dublin city is to create somewhere else for people to live and work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>The only way to address that at this stage is through a debate in this House.</P>
      <P>Regarding the removal of signage in counties Tipperary in Kerry, as noted by Senator Mansergh, we have a similar problem in County Clare where the sign at the Spancel Hill cross is regularly removed by tourists. I would like to see proposals for more permanent signage to prevent this sort of tourism vandalism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The signs should all be electrified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I too support the call for a debate on transport, and call for a Luas connection from Abbey Street to St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green. I am also conscious that our third city, Belfast, does not have a direct rail link to Cork, our second city. That is a glaring anomaly. I also welcome devel<Col N="565"/>opments such as the opening of the Midleton line and the proposed Shannon link. Development also follows the rail link. I note that in the Cork development plan, the new developments will take place along the rail line. The place chosen was Monard, which is north of Cork, because the rail line was already there. Would it make sense if we are looking at a spatial plan, which we are, and the projected population increase in this country over the next few years, to put the rail line in places which need to be developed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I wonder if Senators noted that we are all in a skitty mood today? The Leas-Chathaoirleach encouraged this mood initially.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not mean to be disrespectful.</P>
      <P>The Acting Leader of the Opposition, Senator Ulick Burke, graciously acknowledged the success of the Garda in west Dublin and its strategy of targeting areas and in bringing in extra manpower. That strategy has generally worked, which is gratifying. The Senator also noted that this showed up the inadequacy of Garda numbers in other areas of the country and he expressed the wish that the targeting strategy would continue outside Dublin, especially into Meath and Kildare.</P>
      <P>Along with other Members, Senator Ulick Burke also asked for a debate on the BMW region. Senator Bannon has also frequently raised that issue. We will endeavour to have that debate. Senator O&rsquo;Toole acknowledged the apology from Kevin Myers. I agree that the apology was most contrite, as was the editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> today, and I hope that is the end of the matter. Senator O&rsquo;Toole also referred to Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles. I think the reason for our skittiness today is that we are coming up to St. Valentine&rsquo;s Day.</P>
      <P>As the last transport debate focused on Dublin, Senator O&rsquo;Toole asked for the next such debate to focus on areas outside the city. Senator Ryan referred to the labour inspectorate and migrant workers. I had occasion to check on a certain matter and could not understand that a worker must make whatever complaint he or she has in person and in writing. The worker first has to find out all about the inspectorate and where it is. A very good report on the migrant situation in Westmeath was launched last week which made a similar point, namely, that migrants should have help in making their cases and appeals. Senator Ryan mentioned a hotel but I do not know where it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will tell the Leader later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The staff in that hotel are not unionised and while small increases in pay are warranted for them it seems to be difficult to get them.</P><Col N="566"/>
      <P>Senator Dardis said in a wry voice that the level of interest in the Seanad rises substantially when we talk of the media. I suppose people like to hear about themselves. Senator Dardis also noted how well the national pensions reserve fund has performed. He pointed out that it was the previous Minister for Finance who introduced that fund.</P>
      <P>Echoing what Senator Ulick Burke said, Senator Terry praised the Garda activity in west Dublin. Senator Glynn suggested that joggers and pedestrians should wear reflective vests and called for a road safety debate. He also referred to the inland waterways, saying that fishermen are not returning the fish they take from those waters. There is no law in that area, apart from the regulation that pike under a certain size must be put back in the water.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>The rod licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>This has nothing to do with the rod licence. It has to do with the greed or otherwise of the fishermen. We should have a debate on that issue.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn said that foreign languages are not being taught in primary schools but I have come across a few where they are teaching either French or German in fifth or sixth class and doing so very well. No doubt there is a lack of resources involved in most primary schools but in Europe we are possibly the only country in which foreign languages are not taught on a structured basis in senior grades in primary schools.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn also said rightly that the taxi regulator should now insist that criminals be refused taxi licences. Senator Callanan praised Tony Blair for his generous apology to the Conlon and Maguire families. He also raised the issue of the Barron report which should also be acknowledged.</P>
      <P>Senator Coghlan supported Senator Ulick Burke and Senator Glynn regarding reflective vests. Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; called for a road safety debate. Senator Norris raised the matter of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and said he was glad the Taoiseach would facilitate the relatives of those who died in the Omagh bombing. Senator Norris stood up strongly for Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles. I am glad to hear they are going to tie the knot. St. Valentine&rsquo;s Day is approaching so that is useful.</P>

	<P>That is a shame. They are all gone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I have heard no reports of thefts. Senator Mansergh is worried about disap<Col N="567"/>pearing road signs in Tipperary. Senator Cummins referred to the Garda activity in west Dublin and asked that the strategy be extended. He also called for guidelines for young people under the age of 12 using mobile phones.</P>
      <P>Senator MacSharry made a passionate case on behalf of the BMW region and also spoke of the national spatial strategy. Next week&rsquo;s agenda is almost full but the following week we will try to arrange that debate. Senator Feighan asked how organised crime developed in the north west and referred to the loss of the Customs and Excise boat. Senator Dooley called for a transport debate to focus on areas outside Dublin as well as for a Shannon rail link. Sign posts are disappearing in his area too. It is very significant. Senator Hanafin also called for a debate on transport. He spoke of the opening of the Midleton line and the need for a direct rail link from Cork to Belfast. It is clear there is a need for a debate on transport and on other matters. I hope the sign post thieves do not head for Mayo.</P>

    <P LI="1" el="5">In page 51, between lines 42 and 43, to insert the following:</P>
    <P LI="2" el="5">52.&mdash;Section 38 of the Act of 1939 is amended by adding the following subsection:</P>
    <P LI="3" el="5">&lsquo;(4) For the purposes of this Act, a Special Criminal Court is in existence if it has been established under this section and has at the relevant time not fewer than 3 members appointed under section 39.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P><Col N="568"/>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P el="0">This is a technical amendment to section 38 of the Offences against the State Act 1939. It adds a new subsection (4) to section 38 of the 1939 Act, providing that, for the purposes of the Act, a Special Criminal Court is in existence if it has been established under that section and has at the relevant time not fewer than three members appointed under section 39.</P>
      <P>Section 49 of the 1939 Act provides that if two or more Special Criminal Courts are in existence at the time of sending forward a person for trial, the Director of Public Prosecutions must apply to try the case in the court that he selects. The Government established a second Special Criminal Court last December, but the judges have not yet been assigned to it. As such, the court is not able to hear cases. To ensure absolute clarity regarding the operation of this provision, the proposed amendment makes it clear that a court established under the Act is in existence only if it has not fewer than three members appointed to it. In other words, it is only from the time that the second court has at least three judges that the director must make the necessary application under section 49. This amendment is being tabled as a precautionary measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Government amendment No. 2:</P>
    <P LI="1" el="5">In page 51, between lines 42 and 43, to insert the following:</P>
    <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;53.&mdash;Section 49 of the Act of 1939 is amended by renumbering it as section 49(1) and adding the following subsections:</P>
    <P LI="3" el="5">&lsquo;(2) A trial that is to be heard before a Special Criminal Court may be transferred by the Court, on its own motion or on the application of a triable person or the Director of Public Prosecutions, to another Special Criminal Court, but only if the first Court decides that it would be in the interests of justice to do so.</P>
    <P LI="3" el="5">(3) In deciding whether it is in the interests of justice to transfer a trial, the Special Criminal Court may consider any factors it thinks relevant, including&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P LI="4" el="5">(<i>a</i>) whether the transfer would be in the interests of the expeditious administration of justice, and</P>
    <P LI="4" el="5">(<i>b</i>) whether the transfer would prejudice the triable person or persons or the prosecution.</P>
    <P LI="3" el="5">(4) A trial may be transferred under this section notwithstanding that an order has been made under subsection (1)(<i>e</i>) in relation to the triable person or persons.</P>
    <P LI="3" el="5">(5) Where 2 or more triable persons are to be tried jointly, the decision of the <Col N="569"/>Special Criminal Court to transfer the trial applies in relation to all of them.</P>
    <P LI="3" el="5">(6) Subsection (5) does not affect the right of a triable person to apply for a separate trial and, if the application is granted, then to apply for a transfer of that trial.</P>
    <P LI="3" el="5">(7) The decision of a Special Criminal Court to transfer a trial is final and unappealable.</P>
    <P LI="3" el="5">(8) In this section &ldquo;triable person&rdquo; means a person sent or sent forward for trial to, or charged before or transferred under this Act to, a Special Criminal Court.&rsquo;<?oasys [is0p2]?>&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment also deals with the Special Criminal Court, amending section 49 of the 1939 Act. One of the factors behind the Government&rsquo;s decision to establish a second Special Criminal Court was the need to avoid any difficulty or challenge on the basis that persons are held on remand for undue periods pending trial. Currently the earliest available date for a hearing in the existing Special Criminal Court is the end of this year. It is to reduce that delay in cases coming to trial that this amendment is tabled to section 49 of the 1939 Act, providing for the transfer of cases from the existing Special Criminal Court to which they have been returned for trial to the newly-established court. The provision will also permit the transfer of cases from the newly-established court back to the existing Special Criminal Court.</P>
      <P>Legal advice has been received that there is no existing statutory basis for such transfers. Accordingly, it has been decided to provide such a mechanism by legislation. Therefore, section 49 of the 1939 Act will be amended by being renumbered as section 49(1) and having several new subsections added.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) will provide that a trial to be heard before a Special Criminal Court may be transferred by the court on its own motion or on the application of a triable person or the Director of Public Prosecutions to another Special Criminal Court, though only if the first court decides that it would be in the interests of justice to do so. In other words, it would be open to any interested party, including the defence, the prosecution, or the court itself on its own motion, to seek to have a trial transferred. That will, of course, happen only if it is in the interests of justice so to do.</P>
      <P>Subsection (3) will provide that, in deciding whether it is in the interests of justice to transfer a trial, the Special Criminal Court may consider any factors it thinks relevant, including whether the transfer would be in the interests of the expeditious administration of justice and whether it will prejudice the triable person or persons or the prosecution. That means that the court, in examining any application for a transfer of a trial, will have to take into account whether it would <Col N="570"/>result in a speedier hearing of the case and whether it will prejudice either party &mdash; the defence or the prosecution.</P>
      <P>Subsection (4) will provide that a trial may be transferred under this section, notwithstanding that an order has been made under subsection (1)(<i>e</i>) regarding the triable person or persons. Subsection (1)(<i>e</i>) provides that if two or more Special Criminal Courts are in existence, the DPP can apply to a court to have the trial before it. In simple terms, the fact that the DPP has selected a particular court to hear a trial does not, under this amendment, prejudice the right of an interested party subsequently to apply to have the trial transferred to another court.</P>
      <P>Subsection (5) provides that where two or more triable persons are to be tried jointly, the decision of the Special Criminal Court to transfer the trial applies regarding them all. The reason is to avoid the position where a single trial of several defendants being tried jointly can be split and the same cases heard in two different courts so that one court tries one defendant and another court the same case against another.</P>
      <P>Subsection (6) provides that subsection (5) does not affect the right of a triable person to apply for a separate trial and, if the application is granted, to apply for a transfer of the trial. This is to safeguard the right of any defendant to apply for a separate trial. That right remains and subsection (5) cannot diminish it in any way.</P>
      <P>Subsection (7) provides that the decision of a Special Criminal Court to transfer a trial is final and unappealable. The court must be free to organise its own internal affairs. After all, one of the primary reasons for transfer is the expeditious administration of justice.</P>
      <P>Subsection (8) is a technical provision setting out the definition of a triable person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I am completely dissatisfied with the way in which the Minister of State has brought the amendment to the House. He expressed his intention to establish a second Special Criminal Court some time ago. Why are we seeing the amendment only now, on Report Stage in the Seanad? That is treating this House with contempt, something we have seen several times. It is unacceptable that last minute amendments are being introduced on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>The thrust of the amendment is to lend a statutory basis to the Minister&rsquo;s announcement that he is setting up a further Special Criminal Court to speed up trials. I have no problem with that initiative, which I fully support. It is perhaps a sign of the times that we must set up more. I am sure the Minister of State will agree that we would have hoped that circumstances today would be such that we would not need another Special Criminal Court &mdash; or any such court. I recall that the Hederman report favoured the winding down of the Special Criminal Court. However, it should continue to exist as long as it is needed.</P><Col N="571"/>
      <P>The Minister is establishing the second court in a very roundabout manner. Perhaps he might clarify why he has gone about it in this way. For example, why will the case have to be transferred from the first court to the second? Why can it not simply be initiated in the second court? The new subsection (3) sets out two criteria for the court to consider. Undoubtedly, the transfer of all cases will meet the first criterion, that of the speedy administration of justice. Since both grounds must be met, I am concerned that the second requirement might give rise to trouble. A person on trial could argue that the transfer of his or her case to the second court, resulting in an earlier trial, would prejudice the defendant. He could argue that his legal team may not be ready for the earlier trial, that his defence has not been fully prepared or that witnesses or evidence may not be available for an earlier trial but would be available for a later trial in the first court. If the Minister were not establishing the second court in such a roundabout way, we would not need to address the hurdles set out in subsection (3).</P>
      <P>Given that in subsection (7) the decision of the Special Criminal Court is final and has no avenue for appeal, are we likely to see defendants traipsing off to the European Court of Human Rights to fight their case and ultimately delay the trial here for years? These are pertinent points which should be addressed. We support the initiative of setting up the second Special Criminal Court if it is deemed necessary but the points I have made should be addressed. I repeat my dissatisfaction with the tabling of amendments of this importance on Report Stage. It is a practice which has been creeping into debates over the past year or so and I ask that in future the Minister desist from tabling amendments of major importance on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>There was nothing underhand in the way the Government arrived at a decision in this matter. The Government decision was made on 14 December and it made the necessary proclamation under the 1939 Act, as was made in 1972. The basis of the Government decision was that trials are taking an increasingly long time in the Special Criminal Court and it is important that the court do its business expeditiously. I am glad the Senator agrees with me that it is important we have that facility because anyone who has observed the events that have given rise to such controversy in recent times will have noticed that one particular witness has already retracted his story. The ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice when that level of intimidation of witnesses can exist in any part of Ireland. It is a very serious matter and I am glad the Senator supports the existence of the courts in the current circumstances.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the reason the Senator raised the issue of these amendments, which will copperfasten the position of the court, being intro<Col N="572"/>duced in the House this morning but the fact remains that the Government has followed all the correct procedures under the 1939 Act in the establishment of this court. A great deal of water has flowed under the legal bridge since 1939 and having examined the matter, the Government decided it was essential, if this second additional court is to function in an efficient way, to move these essentially technical amendments in the House this morning. There is nothing in these amendments that prejudices the rights of any accused person. They are simply designed to facilitate the efficient operation of the court.</P>
      <P>Senator Cummins raised the issue of an accused whose legal team was not prepared or whose witnesses were not available. As to whether such a person would be prejudiced through having an earlier trial by virtue of the establishment of the second court, the court would take all those factors into account in coming to a final decision on whether a trial was ready to proceed. That is written into this legislation. The Senator must remember also that justice delayed is justice denied, and there is a public interest in the efficient administration of criminal justice. That is an important deterrent for the offender and it is important that we get on with the business of the courts.</P>
      <P>As a matter of pure abstract reasoning, there is nothing improper in endowing a court with the facility of transferring from one panel of judges to another or from one court to another. After all, in the commonest of legal actions, when a litigant seeks to litigate a personal injuries claim in the High Court, there is a list of such claims and the cases are distributed between different judges. Equally, when persons are returned for trial in the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court, a number of judges are available to hear those trials and the accused may not know until the morning of his or her arraignment, or indeed later, which judge will preside at the trial.</P>
      <P>In the case of the Special Criminal Court it is important, now that we have two courts, that we have a proper statutory basis for the efficient conduct of business between the two. I take Senator Cummins&rsquo;s point about the new court dealing with new cases but we will shortly be in a position to have two Special Criminal Courts and there is little point having the members of one Bench sitting on their hands while another Bench hears lengthy cases. It is important we put this legal machinery in place so that the fullness of the jurisdiction of the Special Criminal Court can be exercised where appropriate and where the director returns a case to it. That is the basis of these amendments.</P>

    <P>Government amendment No. 3:</P>
    <P LI="1" el="5">In page 63, to delete lines 18 to 26, and substitute the following:</P>
    <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;<?oasys [is0p2]?>&lsquo;22.&mdash;(1) In this section, except where the context otherwise requires, &ldquo;offence&rdquo; means, in relation to a person to whom a European arrest warrant applies, an offence (other than an offence specified in the European arrest warrant in respect of which the person&rsquo;s surrender is ordered under this Act) under the law of the issuing state committed before the person&rsquo;s surrender, but shall not include an offence consisting, in whole, of acts or omissions of which the offence specified in the European arrest warrant consists in whole or in part.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment relates to the application of the rule of specialty in respect of persons surrendered by Ireland. It entails amendments to section 69. The rule of specialty provides that a person may be proceeded against only in respect of the offence for which he or she was surrendered. Article 27 of the framework decision provides that the rule shall generally apply under the European arrest warrant arrangements except where a member state declares that, as an executing state, it shall not require its application or where any of the exceptions in Article 27 apply. Ireland has not made a declaration on this matter so as an executing state, we apply the specialty rules. Specialty means that a person can only be tried in respect of the offence for which he or she is extradited.</P>
      <P>The amendment seeks to ensure that this rule will not operate to prevent the conviction, sentencing and detention by the issuing state of persons surrendered by Ireland in respect of an alternative but lesser offence within the same group of offences, murder and manslaughter being the most notable. To achieve this end, it is necessary to amend the revised section 22, inserted by section 69, to allow that the prohibition on proceedings for other offences &mdash; the normal effect of the specialty rule &mdash; does not go so far as to prevent a conviction in the issuing state for an alternative but lesser offence where that offence arises from the same facts or circumstances that gave rise to the charge for which the person was surrendered. The amendment has the effect of restoring the provision that applied under the extradition laws in place prior to the European arrest warrant provisions coming into force.</P>
      <P>The intention of the amendment is straightforward. We accept the specialty rule but it does not apply in the context of a murder case, for example, where there is a lesser conviction for manslaughter, in the case of assault occasioning serious bodily harm where there is a lesser conviction for common assault or in the case of a burglary or robbery where there is a conviction for theft. That is the effect of the amendment.</P>

    <P>Government amendment No. 4:</P>
    <P LI="1" el="5">In page 65, to delete lines 26 to 32, and substitute the following:</P>
    <P el="5">
      <?oasys [is1p0]?>
      <?oasys [ix?>&ldquo;<?oasys [is0p2]?>&lsquo;offence&rsquo; means, in relation to a person to whom a European arrest warrant applies, an offence under the law of a Member State (other than the issuing state) committed before the person&rsquo;s surrender to the issuing state under this Act;&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment amends the current text of section 23(1) of the European Arrest Warrant Act, as inserted by section 70 of this Bill. Section 23 deals with the question of onward surrender to a third member state of a person surrendered by Ireland to the first member state. It gives effect to Article 28 of the framework decision.</P>
      <P>The essential position under this section is that a person must not be surrendered to another member state without the first executing state consenting to that onward surrender. Subsection (1) of section 23 provides a definition of &ldquo;offence&rdquo; in respect of which a person may be subject to onward surrender to another member state.</P>
      <P>The new definition simplifies the current definition in section 23(1). It provides that an offence for which the person may be surrendered must be an act that was committed before the person surrendered to the issuing state pursuant to the original or European arrest warrant and that it was for an offence at that date under the law of the member state now seeking his or her surrender. In particular, it guards against any possibility of retrospective penalisation. It prevents a position where the third state might try to pursue a person for an act committed before the original surrender but where that act was not an offence at the time of that person&rsquo;s original surrender but was subsequently criminalised.</P>

    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Government amendment No. 5:</P>
    <P LI="1" el="5">In page 67, after line 23, to insert the following:</P>
    <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;72.&mdash;The Act of 2003 is amended by the substitution of the following section for section 42:</P>
    <P LI="3" el="5">&lsquo;42. A person shall not be surrendered under this Act if&mdash;</P>
    <P LI="4" el="5">(<i>a</i>) the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General is considering, but has not yet decided, whether to bring proceedings against the person for an offence, or</P>
    <P LI="4" el="5">(<i>b</i>) proceedings have been brought in the State against the person for an <Col N="575"/>offence consisting of an act or omission of which the offence specified in the European arrest warrant issued in respect of him or her consists in whole or in part.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The essence of this amendment is to provide for the deletion of section 42(<i>c</i>) of the European Arrest Warrant Act. Section 42 sets out one of the grounds for refusal to surrender a wanted person. It provides that a person shall not be surrendered where the DPP or the Attorney General is considering a prosecution for any offence or where proceedings are being brought in the State in respect of the offence set out in the warrant. Neither of these grounds is being changed. However, the director has sought a review of section 42(<i>c</i>) which provides that where there has been a decision to enter a <i>nolle prosequi</i> or a decision not to bring proceedings in respect of the offence in the warrant, the person may not be surrendered. The director is concerned that this could have undesirable results where the decision not to bring proceedings or to halt any proceedings arises due to insufficiency of evidence or lack of evidence in this jurisdiction, although such evidence or witnesses may be available in the state that has requested the person&rsquo;s surrender.</P>
      <P>The existing provision would be workable in a case where all the evidence had been known and available to the Irish authorities when the decision was taken not to bring proceedings or to enter a <i>nolle prosequi</i>. However, a number of circumstances can arise where this is not the case. As a result, an accused person would be able to evade justice in circumstances where there is no good reason, in principle, that he or she should not be surrendered. The most obvious case where this can arise is where there is no evidence available in this jurisdiction or insufficient evidence to warrant the case proceeding. In these circumstances, a decision may be made not to prosecute the person concerned. As currently worded, the paragraph could operate as a bar to a person&rsquo;s extradition for the same offence to a jurisdiction which has the evidence to deal with that person. The provision, as it stands, also creates a difficulty if a decision is not taken to prosecute here because of a lack of evidence without any knowledge that said evidence is or might be available in another jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>It might be useful to refer to some examples of the type of circumstances about which the director is concerned. Offences relating to sex tourism or trafficking in persons are among the most notable of these, as are those relating to torture, war crimes or similar offences arising under international conventions. In such cases, Ireland may have jurisdiction to try the offences but the best evidence and witnesses may be located elsewhere. We must not prevent the effective prosecution of such offences. Amendment No. 5 will ensure that a potential barrier to effective prosecutions will be removed.</P>

	<P>In refuting criticisms of the Bill and fending off Opposition amendments, a Minister or Minister of State might often indicate that something does not come within the bounds of a framework decision, that it was not agreed, that their hands are tied or whatever. Was the proposed new section 72 agreed as part of the framework decision? Was a provision of this kind envisaged? It seems that this is a radical departure from that which is central to the Bill, namely, the agreement to transfer requested persons from one jurisdiction to another. The section states that individuals will not be surrendered if the State is considering prosecuting them here. Was that agreed as part of the framework decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>No, this was a matter which was left to us under Article 4 of the framework decision. It is an option we are allowed to exercise. Having listened to the concerns of the director, the Minister has decided to exercise the option.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment sets out the circumstances in which a person will not be surrendered. Let us consider the example of a person being sought by a third state for a serious crime committed in that jurisdiction which would lead to the imposition of a serious sentence if he or she was subsequently found guilty. The offence committed by the person in this jurisdiction and being examined by the DPP might be much more minor in nature. In such circumstances, justice would surely be best served by the person having to face justice in the jurisdiction in which the more serious crime was committed. Will the Minister of State clarify the position in that regard, particularly as the amendment appears to indicate that in circumstances such as those I have outlined, a person would not be surrendered and perhaps be charged here? If such an individual was subsequently and successfully charged here and given a short sentence, what would be the position as regards him or her having to face charges in the third state?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>On the issue of serious offences, express provision is made for that circumstance and a list of such offences is set out in the legislation. Dual criminality does not, therefore, arise in those circumstances. The person must face the music in the jurisdiction where the more serious offence was committed.</P>

    <P>Government amendment No. 6:</P>
    <P LI="1" el="5">In page 67, to delete lines 24 to 28.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment proposes the deletion of section 72, inserting a new section 36(<i>a</i>) in the European Arrest Warrant Act. The current section 36(<i>a</i>) states that Ireland, as an issuing state, will observe Articles 27 and 28 of the framework decision in respect of persons sur<Col N="577"/>rendered to this jurisdiction. This would or could require strict observance of Article 27 of the framework decision. That article could be seen as being extremely restrictive in its terms because it permits proceedings, sentencing and detention only in respect of the offence for which the person is surrendered. In the murder-manslaughter example, it could be cited as grounds for preventing the sentencing and detention for manslaughter of a person surrendered on a murder charge. Such an outcome would be unacceptable and would give rise to a position which would not have arisen under the previous regime that held sway under the Extradition Act 1965.</P>
      <P>Section 36(<i>a</i>) was initially felt to be useful as an indicator to other states seeking to establish Ireland&rsquo;s position on specialty and onward surrender. However, the realisation that it could have the effect I have outlined makes its retention more problematical and hence the Minister proposes to delete it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy McDowell, on the introduction of this Bill. It is important legislation, particularly in an era when terrorist offences are more common than people would desire. Only earlier this week there was a bombing in Madrid. It is important that this type of framework for co-operation between states is put in place. I am a member of the sub-committee on the Barron report and I am aware that practically no co-operation has been received from the British authorities in respect of the inquiries into the terrible atrocities that occurred here in the early 1970s. Anything which places a greater onus on states, and which does so in a structured way, is welcome.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister of State on this Bill and on the large volume of other legislation emanating from his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the legislation which will help us honour our commitments to the EU and the UN. This is an important Bill and my party fully supports it. However, I must refer again to the practice of introducing important amendments on Report Stage. It was clearly evident during the debate that I was unable to discuss matters I wished to tease out. Not allowing Members to tease out amendments such as those tabled this morning is bad practice, particularly as we are only allowed to speak once. If the Minister of State had wanted to introduce special criminal courts &mdash; something which had been envisaged for some time &mdash; why could the amendments not have been tabled on Committee Stage <Col N="578"/>in order that Members could have debated and, perhaps, improved them? The practice to which I refer, which is creeping in on a regular basis, must be discontinued. Through the Minister of State, I ask that this practice be discontinued and that we be allowed to debate legislation in the manner the public envisages we do, by teasing out issues rather than putting them in at the last minute on Report Stage. I commend the Bill as it was introduced and the officials, while asking that consideration be given to ensuring that nothing of this nature occurs again on Report Stage when amendments are submitted.</P>

	<P>I congratulate the Minister of State for getting this Bill through. I know I did not play a part in the proceedings. I just want to add my words to what has been said.</P>
      <P>The tradition of having a First Stage, a Second Stage for general debate, a Committee Stage and then a Report Stage is to enable a full debate to take place. What happened regarding this Bill was a pity but it is unusual and there were good reasons on this occasion. It was not the original intention. I congratulate the officials as well as the Minister and Minister of State who were involved. It is pity we have to have such legislation as this, but it is necessary.</P>

      <sTitle>Medical Cards.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. All of us are fully aware of the trauma and anxiety undergone within a family when one of its members has been diagnosed with cancer of one type or another. While many health board CEOs in the past have used their discretion to grant medical card services to identified cancer sufferers, anxiety could be allayed at what is a difficult time for families if the Minister for Health and Children would grant access to full medical card services for all cancer sufferers. There is often a delay in processing an application, which may or may not be successful. The anxiety undergone by cancer sufferers in those situations is unacceptable and can be easily remedied. Unfortunately and tragically, many people who have been identified as cancer sufferers tend to have a short life expectancy beyond that point. While there is improvement in the overall cure rate, statistics clearly indicate that by and large people tend to survive for only a relatively short period after diagnosis. For that reason it would <Col N="579"/>not be costly to the Exchequer to give such cover to this select group of patients.</P>
        <P>The same applies in the case of asthmatics. The Minister of State will be aware of the concern within the medical profession over the increasing number of people suffering from asthma. Whether it is lifestyle, food, the environment or whatever, greater numbers of young people are now suffering from asthma. It is most important that they have readily available to them the medicine prescribed by their general practitioners. Very often they need inhalers and these can be and are becoming increasingly expensive. Due to the concern of parents for their asthmatic children&rsquo;s welfare and the need for constant access to inhalers, this group would benefit enormously from the extension of the medical card service. I am sure the Minister of State will agree that preventive medicine is always better than the cure. If asthma is allowed to develop there can be serious consequences for the sufferer, which could be far more expensive, whereas constant control and monitoring is much better than allowing a chronic condition to develop.</P>
        <P>Finally, I want to raise the matter of coeliacs. Again, because of the nature of their condition, an expensive individualised diet must be provided. Whereas an ordinary loaf of bread costs approximately &euro;1, the cost for coeliacs is &euro;4 and more, and likewise in the case of other food they may require. Once a person is diagnosed a coeliac he or she must be constantly vigilant as regards food intake, whether in the home or outside. They are under constant threat giving rise to enormous expense in some cases.</P>
        <P>I am suggesting to the Minister of State that these groups be identified as people who automatically merit medical cards, whether cancer patients, asthmatics or coeliacs. Such an initiative would eliminate the need for far higher costs when their conditions reach a chronic stage and hospitalisation is required, as is the norm.</P>
        <P>When one considers the statistics on people admitted to hospital through accident and emergency units with chronic illnesses for lack of access to inhalers, in the case of asthmatics, or proper diet as regards coeliacs, this is far more expensive for the Exchequer than issuing medical cards. In the case of cancer sufferers, I reiterate and emphasise the importance of alleviating the suffering of patients and their families. The situation for those concerned is sufficiently traumatic without adding to it. For that reason I ask the Minister of State to request the Minister for Health and Children to grant automatic entitlement to those particular categories. We do not begrudge access to medical cards for people over 70. However, many people in that category have sufficient resources to avail of private medicine if they so wish. In the categories I have mentioned, undue hardship and anxiety may arise, to add to the trauma of the particular condition.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Ulick Burke for raising this matter. Eligibility for health services is primarily based on residency and means. Under the Health Act 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is now the responsibility of the Health Service Executive, other than for persons aged 70 years and over, who are automatically eligible for a medical card.</P>
        <P>Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the HSE, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants, without undue hardship. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief officer of the relevant HSE area for health services if they are unable to provide these for themselves or their dependants without hardship. The setting of income guidelines is a matter for the HSE.</P>
        <P>The HSE has discretion as regards the issuing of medical cards and a range of income sources is excluded when assessing eligibility. Despite some persons having an income that exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may be awarded if the HSE considers that a person&rsquo;s medical needs or other circumstances justify it. It is open, therefore, to cancer sufferers, asthmatics and coeliacs to apply to the HSE for services if they are unable to provide them for themselves or their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The sum of &euro;60 million was provided in the 2005 Estimates for health to improve access to primary care by providing for up to 30,000 additional persons to become eligible for a medical card, and free access to GP visits for up to 200,000 additional persons on low incomes through the introduction of a GP visit card. Parents on low incomes should no longer have to worry about the cost of bringing their child to a doctor. The estimated full-year cost of this initiative is &euro;50 million. My Department is currently considering the nature of the legislative changes required to enable effect to be given to the decision to introduce &ldquo;doctor-only&rdquo; medical cards. Legislation on this will be introduced as soon as possible, with the view to the cards being made available in April. The additional funding provided enabled the former CEOs of the health boards to agree new medical card guidelines which came into effect on 1 January 2004. The guidelines were increased by on average 7.5% and for those on low income, the income allowance for each of the first two children was increased by approximately 20% and approximately 30% for the third and subsequent child. Medical card holders are entitled to a full range of services including general prac<Col N="581"/>titioner services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all inpatient public hospital services in public hospitals including consultants services, all outpatient public hospital services including consultant services, dental, optical and aural services and appliances.</P>
        <P>For those who do not qualify for a medical card, there are a number of schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of medication. I am sure Senator Burke is familiar with the terms of the long-term illness scheme. Non-medical card holders can also avail of the drugs payment scheme. This scheme protects such individuals from excessive drug costs. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;85 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</P>
        <P>Since 1997 there has been a total additional cumulative investment of approximately &euro;710 million in the development of appropriate treatment and care services for people with cancer. This investment has enabled the funding of an additional 109 consultant posts in key areas of cancer care such as medical oncology, radiology, palliative care and general surgeons with specialist interest in breast surgery. The funding has provided for the appointment of 245 cancer care nurse specialists across the regions. Approximately &euro;90 million in capital funding has been invested in oncology infrastructure, including specialist equipment in radiation oncology, mammography, radiology and pathology.</P>
        <P>The health strategy includes a whole series of initiatives to clarify and expand the existing arrangements for eligibility for health services, including recommendations arising from the review of the medical card scheme carried out by the health board CEOs under the PPF. These recommendations include: streamlining applications and improving the standardisation of the medical card applications process; providing clearer information to people about how and where to apply for medical cards; and seeking out those who should have medical cards to ensure they have access to the services that are available.</P>

    <Title>Water Quality.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. This matter is about the need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to place an obligation on local water treatment schemes to put a full technical analysis of the water provided in the public domain, on the same lines as is provided to French consumers. This issue arose when I saw the water bill of a person who has a house in France. The back of the bill was given over to a list of results for the latest scientific evaluation of the water supplied to the customer. The details included covered matters like the bacteriological state of the water, its hardness and the presence of fluoride, nitrates and pesticides. The figures were followed by a summary paragraph setting out their significance. The total effect was that <Col N="582"/>each individual consumer was given a scientific evaluation he or she could understand about the recent quality of the water received.</P>
      <P>In Ireland, we do not charge residential households for the water they consume, although the EU is pressurising us to do so in the interest of conserving an increasingly scarce resource. However, even in the absence of bills, this idea of giving regular feedback on water quality to customers is something we should think about emulating here. The quality of water we use is an issue about which people feel very strongly. Water quality is not something that can be judged subjectively by the customers when they turn on the tap. Water that looks and even tastes alright might not be alright. On the other hand, water that looks or tastes a bit off may in fact be pure by scientific standards and perfectly suitable to use and to drink.</P>
      <P>In many of the water schemes installed around the country over the past decade, we have heard that the water quality did not come up to scratch. Given the amount of money invested in the schemes by our Government and by the EU, this is simply not acceptable. I suggest that customers themselves have a role to play in raising the standards of water quality. The first step towards such an involvement is to provide them with the scientific information on which they can judge the quality of the water they get. Every operator of a water scheme should be required by the Department to put a public information system in place that would regularly inform all of its customers on the ongoing state of the water they receive. A website could be used for this, backed up by press releases to the local media. It would not cost very much, especially since I assume that all this scientific information is already available to the operators of every water scheme. If it is not available, then we are really in trouble.</P>
      <P>When people are better informed on the issues of water quality, they can play a more active role in exerting pressure to raise standards where that proves to be necessary. In the absence of such information, people do not really know where they stand and must rely on others to watch over the quality of the water for them. That is an unsatisfactory situation. I commend this approach to the Minister and I look forward to hearing his comments on the issue. I brought along the French water service bill with the information provided on the back. I found it fascinating to read. Since I assume the information is available, there should be no cost to this. In Paris, there are parallel water systems &mdash; one for drinking water and one for non-drinking water. They have put much effort into this and have had much success. I am sure more could be done here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Quinn for raising the important issue of keeping the public informed about the quality of the water supply. Delivery of a quality customer service has been a <Col N="583"/>central objective of the modernisation programme that has been under way in the local government sector for a number of years. A customer service group was established in May 2003 as part of the overall process. A list of 42 service indicators was published in January 2004 under the title Delivering Value for People &mdash; Service Indicators in Local Authorities. I am committed to the service indicators initiative because it will identify good practice and under-performance across the range of local authority services. It will allow for good practice to be shared and under-performance to be addressed. In essence, it is a management tool with a very public face.</P>
      <P>All 34 city and county authorities have been asked to measure their performances against the 42 indicators which span all the main service areas. There is a specific indicator on drinking water quality which requires local authorities to report on the percentage of drinking water analysis results in compliance with statutory requirements with regard to both public and private schemes, where appropriate. These figures are derived from the sampling results local authorities are obliged to submit to the EPA. In turn, the EPA publishes an annual report on the quality of drinking water nationally. The report is available to the public directly from the EPA and may be downloaded from its website.</P>
      <P>The performance results for each year, starting with 2004, must be sent to the Local Government Management Services Board by the end of March of the following year. The board will report directly to me on the 2004 results by June 2005, including the outcome of a verification process, under which an independent assessment panel will examine and assess a number at random.</P>
      <P>Local authorities will be expected to publish performance results in their annual reports and any other appropriate medium to allow all stakeholders to gauge performance. They are also being encouraged to post them on their websites. Any other local initiative to further publicise the results will be very welcome and encouraging.</P>
      <P>I am glad to note that the latest Environmental Protection Agency report, which focuses on drinking water quality in 2003, has confirmed the fundamentally good quality and continuing improvement of standards in Ireland. The report is based on the results of 235,042 individual tests on 26,987 samples of drinking water which were taken by local authorities and the EPA in 2003. The tests demonstrated a compliance rate of 97.7% in public water supplies which is an increase from the 2002 rate of 97.4%. There was <Col N="584"/>further welcome improvement in the overall compliance rate among group water schemes which rose to 91.8% from 91.5% in 2002. The Senator will be aware of the major programme of targeted investment by my Department to ensure that group water scheme supplies will soon be of the same quality as their local authority counterparts. Many of the major schemes have come to an end and there is a greater focus on local schemes to ensure they meet the required standard.</P>
      <P>Under the drinking water regulations which came into force in January 2004, a local authority must ensure there is no potential danger to human health in the event that it discovers a water supply to be non-compliant with a prescribed standard. The regulations require the provision to consumers of information on the precautionary measures and remedial action to be taken in such cases. My Department completed recently a drinking water national monitoring study to assist local authorities to implement the requirements of the drinking water regulations. The implementation programme is intended to ensure uniformity of sampling, testing and reporting of drinking water quality. It is expected to result in the provision of more robust and accessible data for comparison and analysis than has hitherto been available. In addition, the Water Services Bill 2003 will, when enacted, enable me to provide where necessary for the general availability of records of monitoring and inspection of water supplies.</P>
      <P>It is clear from the foregoing that a substantial amount of information is accessible by the public on the quality of the water supplied by local authorities. Nevertheless, the Senator&rsquo;s contribution has been significant. I will certainly bear it in mind and consider it carefully to ensure local authorities are more proactive in making detailed analytical data available in the context of the forthcoming report of the Local Government Management Services Board and any future revisions to the indicators.</P>

	<P>I appreciate the information. Interestingly, my daughter told me that in France the price of houses in certain areas are increasing and decreasing solely on the basis of the quality of the local water supply. The designation of a &ldquo;defined area&rdquo; is very useful. When is the Bill likely to be processed?</P>
