	<P>I have received notice from Senator O&rsquo;Rourke that, on the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister of Finance to outline in respect of the towns of Athlone, Mullingar and Longford when the planned decentralisation of Departments will take place, the numbers involved; and if he will provide all up-to-date details on these decentralisations.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Quinn of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs, on behalf of the Government, to promote a national minute of silence to be observed at 11.02 a.m. on 9 August, the 60th anniversary of the last major catastrophe of the Second World War, the bombing of Nagasaki city, so Ireland may join in similar commemorations across the world.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Paddy Burke of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to indicate the plans for local authorities in view of the regulations governing employers to provide pension arrangements for local authority members, whose local authority work is, in some cases, their full-time employment.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Finucane of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Sciences to allow Raheenagh, Ashford, Broadford and Templeglantine schools in County Limerick to retain the present level of teaching resources to cater for the special education needs of the pupils of these schools.</P>

      <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matters raised by Senators O&rsquo;Rourke, Quinn and Paddy Burke and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, motions referred to the Joint Committee on Health and Children, which has completed its discussions thereon, to be taken without debate; No. 4, motion re the inclusion of additional institutions to the Schedule of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002. The inclusion of additional institutions will enable persons, who in their childhood were abused at those facilities, to submit an application for redress to the Residential Institutions Redress Board. Additions made to the Schedule as soon as possible will allow applicants a reasonable period to submit their applications before the closing date of December 2005. The Minister for Education and Science briefed the education spokespersons on this matter following completion of the Grangegorman Development Agency Bill 2005 on Tuesday. The motion will be taken without debate; No. 5, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill 2005 &mdash; Report Stage (resumed) and Final Stage, to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business until 1.30 p.m.; No. 6, the Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2005 &mdash; Committee and Remaining Stages, to be taken at 2.30 p.m. and to conclude not later than 5 p.m.; No. 7, motion re Planning and Development Regulations 2005, to be taken immediately on the conclusion of No. 6 or at 5 p.m. if No. 6 has not concluded earlier. The contribution of each group or spokesperson will be ten minutes; and No. 8, the Civil Registration (Amendment) Bill 2005 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and All Stages, to be taken on the conclusion of No. 7, or at 6 p.m. if No. 7 has not concluded earlier, and to conclude not later than 8 p.m. The contributions of spokespersons on Second Stage will be ten minutes and those of other Senators will be six minutes with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children to be called on to reply not later than five minutes before the conclusion of Second Stage. There will be a sos between 1.30 p.m. and 2.30 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that No. 1 be discussed for a period of one hour. I put the Leader on notice on Tuesday of the intention of my party and other colleagues to debate risk equalisation. The Leader is aware that whenever a report returns from a committee, she regularly asks the members of the committee who wish to lead a debate in this House to inform other colleagues about the committee debate. My party&rsquo;s spokesperson on health, Senator Browne, would like to lead such a debate with other colleagues today for one hour. I would have liked the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children to come into the House to outline her views conclusively on risk equalisation but that does not seem likely today. Nevertheless, we should debate the issue rather than nodding it through.</P>
      <P>In May 2005 the Health Insurance Authority made a recommendation to the Minister in respect of triggering the risk equalisation argument within health insurance. The Minister should at least publish that report. The House should have the opportunity to debate with the Minister the rationale of her decision on this issue. The House would do itself a service and in view of this I seek cross-party support for the amendment.</P>
      <P>Many Members and the wider public were dismayed at the imprisonment of five people yesterday in County Mayo. I do not underestimate the seriousness of contempt of court and understand why the High Court made the decision to imprison these people. Discussions are under way to resolve this issue but there should be some compromise from Shell, which is a large multinational.</P>
      <P>I do not know anyone in the west or throughout the country who opposes bringing gas onshore but the issue is the way in which it is being done in a small community and the consequent risks to that community. Calm, reasonable minds should be brought to bear on this issue. That five law-abiding, decent people had to go to prison last night and will remain there indefinitely until the issue is resolved is quite appalling. I urge the powers that be to broker a deal in this situation before it gets worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>All sides of the House would welcome a discussion on the risk equalisation proposal because it has been discussed here twice in the last week. Several Members have raised it time and again and it would be helpful to allow people go on the record on this. Many of us do not understand the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s reasons for her decision and she has said that we have not fully understood her explanation. There is an issue we could profitably discuss.</P>
      <P>I wish to propose a minor amendment to the Order of Business, namely, that No. 14, in my name and the names of Senators Coghlan and Norris, a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Official Languages Act 2003, be introduced as the first item for debate today, with the approval of <Col N="2404"/>the House. I have deliberately put it down as a First Stage debate rather than a Second Stage one because it is important that the House be involved as it moves through all Stages. The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs invited Senator Coghlan and I to bring forward a Bill to amend the Official Languages Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I second Senator Brian Hayes&rsquo;s proposal for an amendment to the Order of Business. It is increasingly clear that the concept of a regulator was introduced to pursue not the well-being of consumers but an ideological agenda. In this instance the regulator has recommended the opposite of what the ideology demanded so the regulator is ignored.</P>
      <P>There is a strong case for an intelligent discussion about the sorts of competition that work well in health care and those that result in the inflated health budget of the United States, leaving it with the worst infant mortality rate in the developed world and a lower life expectancy than most of the developed world. The objective evidence is that brutal market forces do not work in the health system. We are entitled to know why we are being driven in a direction opposed to the interests of most people.</P>
      <P>In the case of what has happened to the unfortunate people from County Mayo, the law must be upheld because poor people would have no rights without it. Repeatedly, however, the use of injunctions resulting in imprisonment is almost inevitably a case of the powerful against the powerless which raises fundamental questions. The multinational involved in this case has an unsavoury reputation as anybody from Nigeria can confirm. It also attempted to dump its waste rigs in the North Sea.</P>
      <P>There is a serious issue about disproportionate power and how it is used. We have seen the most appalling abuses by powerful people of planning and other regulations, but few of them are punished. Five people want only to prevent somebody using their land.</P>
      <P>As an engineer I can say there is no such thing as an absolutely safe process least of all where the risk is taken not by the company but by the people through whose land this pipeline will run. I am not scaremongering but if anybody says this is absolutely safe he or she is telling a lie. There is no such thing as absolute safety, therefore, these families are entitled to whatever reassurances they need or to be left alone if they wish. That they should end up in prison is a disgrace.</P>
      <P>I deliberately paused for three seconds to remind the House that in those three seconds a child died somewhere in the world from poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator knows there is a decision regarding time in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>There will be a protest rally this evening and I wish to repeat the words of the former Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="2405"/>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator may not announce a protest rally in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>We need a thorough debate on our overseas development aid and a decision from the Government to get back to a decent agenda and timescale for our achievement of the UN target. The Department of Finance wants to push it so far into the future that it will have plenty of opportunities to sabotage it again. We can afford to do this by 2007. We can definitely manage to do it by 2010.</P>
      <P>I wish to echo the words of the former Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, a member of the Progressive Democrats, that this was a Government commitment which was broken by the Government. I appeal to and expect the Progressive Democrats to remind Fianna F&aacute;il that the country has a conscience, whatever about Fianna F&aacute;il.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be desirable for the House to debate the risk equalisation amendment scheme 2005 but it is essential that the T&aacute;naiste is present for such a debate. She has always shown herself to be very amenable to attending this House and to debate any issues the House wishes to debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>We gave her notice of this on Tuesday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>She is unusually amenable, in my experience of Ministers. Perhaps the Leader knows whether she is available but I suspect that she may not be. If we are to have the debate however, the T&aacute;naiste should be present.</P>
      <P>This is not a question of ideology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>The only time I hear about ideology is when Senator Ryan repeats the word every week. This is a question of trying to do what is best for patients and consumers of the health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator may know what is best but the people do not agree with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no question, to use Senator Ryan&rsquo;s phrase, of &ldquo;brutal market forces&rdquo;. They have nothing to do with the health service, as the Senator knows. In addition, the T&aacute;naiste is on record as saying that she favours risk equalisation and community rating which will happen eventually.</P>
      <P>I share the views of Senator Brian Hayes on the imprisonment of the unfortunate people from Mayo. We cannot intervene in the decision of the court because these people are in prison for contempt, which is a serious matter. A large multinational corporation such as Shell, however, has wider responsibilities. A spokesman for the company said that it had tried to approach the people who refused to be approached. I do not know <Col N="2406"/>whether that is true. We might do best to give the people seeking a solution some space and hope that will be achieved speedily and the people released.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Before I call Senator Finucane I wish to inform the House that 14 Senators have indicated they want to contribute on the Order of Business. I ask them to be brief because a decision has been made as regards time limits on the debate on the Order of Business. Some Senators may be disappointed if we do not secure co-operation on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2002, I was Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, at which time the National Aquatic Centre was in its formative stages. There were concerns regarding the contract and an investigation carried out for the Comptroller and Auditor General. Following media revelations, the then Attorney General, Deputy McDowell, issued a very critical report that led to the resignation of a prominent person involved.</P>
      <P>Now the National Aquatic Centre is in the news for a different reason altogether. The cost overrun has reached &euro;62 million. This week the Taoiseach flippantly said that what blew down the roof was the wind. Since last January the Taoiseach has been in possession of a report from the Board of Works, which states there are serious structural deficiencies in the building. As such, it was rather trite on his part to make such a simplistic statement. What has gone wrong with this, the Taoiseach&rsquo;s pet project, is that there are structural difficulties. Senators will have seen the media revelations and the photographs. It is time we had a proper presentation of the whole sequence of events regarding the National Aquatic Centre. It would appear that many things have gone wrong with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan"><NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
	<P>In deference to the Cathaoirleach, I will be as brief as possible in raising two matters. Perhaps the House will join me in commending the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, on her endeavours in promoting beef and other food in Russia over the past few days. We hope for a very successful outcome, bearing in mind that Russia is our biggest market outside the EU.</P>
      <P>I am somewhat reluctant to raise the second matter, but it is with total respect for those Members who asked last week for a debate on the sugar industry. We might have a better, more informed and more substantial debate if we awaited the outcome of the meeting of the Council of Ministers next month. Those of us engaged in growing sugar beet could have a better debate upon our return after the break. It would be a higher-quality and better-informed debate, and I hope those farmers involved in the sugar beet industry would come with a united voice. We are aware of the meetings they held this week, at which there was unfortunately grave <Col N="2407"/>division. The sugar industry is worthy of protection, and I am certain we will all stand by the Minister in her statements and pronouncements in this regard. We will give her our full support, and I ask that it happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Brian Hayes and those others who expressed their concern at the situation regarding the five Mayo farmers who have been jailed. There should be no criticism of the judge, who has simply implemented the law as he is required to do. However, the history of Shell certainly gives us a great deal about which to be concerned. I was one of several people in this House who raised concerns at the time that this deal was struck; we thought there was something very fishy about it. It was not in the interest of the people of the west of Ireland and was an extremely bad deal from a rapacious multinational company with an appalling environmental history.</P>
      <P>As Senator Ryan said, one need only go to<?oasys _jy?>Nigeria and ask the Ogoni people. We saw what happened to Ken Saro-Wiwa and how Shell drove pipelines over the Nigerian countryside, devastating it with complete disregard for all environmental concerns. Then it tried to buy its way out of it with a PR campaign, and we were foolish and gullible enough to accept that. We should support the farmers. One must remember that it is their land, and the Constitution recognises rights to property. Historically, the Government has been extremely reluctant to intervene using the public good criterion, yet this bullying multinational can do it.</P>
      <P>The final matter I would like to raise is the question of blood transfusions. We are once again being told there is a quite critical difficulty in the blood supply. A constituent has written to me to say that the authorities refuse to take blood from gay people, an entire section of the population, because they suspect there is an increased risk of hepatitis, AIDS and so on, something that may or may not be true. In Britain, however, they do not have that prohibition but test the blood. It is therefore rather foolish of us to complain about a lack of blood resources, which are very necessary for operations and so on, yet reject a section of the population that might be prepared to volunteer such resources, simply because we do not apply the same systems they do on the neighbouring island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I support what Senator Brian Hayes has said regarding the jailing of five people from Mayo. As a large corporation, Shell has responsibilities other than its own corporate image. It should engage in talks regarding this project, which is very important to the west of Ireland. I fully support it, having met both sides in the argument.</P>
      <P>The debate on Sellafield has become more worrying with the report that there was an undetected leak at the plant for nine months. It started <Col N="2408"/>last July and was not discovered until April this year. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, has described the skills of management there as worthy of Homer Simpson, which is not fair to that character. I hope the Minister&rsquo;s efforts to meet representatives of the British Government will succeed. I know from Senator Brady that the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is going to Sellafield in the autumn. I very much welcome that, but it is important the issue be pursued by the Minister. I am sure he has the support of this House. The incompetence of BNFL must be exposed, and in future it must not conceal information about leaks in the manner seen hitherto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I second Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s proposal regarding No. 14 on the Order Paper, the Official Languages (Amendment) Bill 2005. The House will recall that it voted down a stage payments Bill approximately a year ago. I accept the Senators opposite were under instructions and agreed with it. However, the Minister stated it was anti-consumer and that he would, within six months or so, introduce his own measure. As we know, first-time buyers are now being discriminated against. They cannot secure their stamp duty relief until after completion, and as we know, they have incurred significant site and other development costs. This is discriminatory. Not alone is this anti-consumer; it is total discrimination, and I would like to give notice of our intention to reintroduce that Bill if the Minister does not act promptly in accordance with his undertaking given to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>The House will be aware that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will meet the Prison Officers Association tomorrow to attempt yet again to inject some reasonableness into the ongoing dispute. It is now almost two years since my colleagues and I heard a briefing from the Minister regarding the difficulties in the operation of the Prison Service, especially regarding its budget. I raise this in order to ask the Leader to convey the real sense of outrage in my part of the country, which is close to Loughan House. In correspondence with me and several colleagues, the union branch secretary has pointed out that over 99% of the non-Dublin-based prison officers, which includes the staff of Loughan House and Shelton Abbey, which are the two prisons now threatened with privatisation, voted overwhelmingly for the Minister&rsquo;s proposals.</P>
      <P>It is an outrage that a group of protected, privileged people in this part of Dublin &mdash; prison officers who, according to today&rsquo;s newspapers are operating a sick leave scheme for their own benefit &mdash; should put the lives of families in my part of the country, whose members will have to relocate or take early retirement, at risk, destroying its rural fabric along with that of<?oasys _jy?>Shelton Abbey. It is an outrage and a disgrace, <Col N="2409"/>and there is a moral imperative on the executive of the Prison Officers Association, when it meets the Minister tomorrow, to end its navel-gazing and look at the national picture, appreciating the damage it is doing to families in my part of the country.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s indulgence, but this is an important matter. Today&rsquo;s edition of the <i>Irish Independent</i> carries a comment by a spokesman for TV3. I ask the Leader if she might ask the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, when he comes before the House in the autumn regarding a proposed broadcasting Bill, once again to clarify public service broadcasting. TV3 is making an incorrect assumption. The spokesman&rsquo;s comment was to the effect that market forces rather than public service obligation should regulate the market.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I ask those in TV3 management who, like the prison officers, are pursuing their own agenda to look at the charter devised by the British Government for the establishment of ITV. That television station has a remit to produce programming that is concerned with providing a public service. Perhaps TV3 might strive to produce this type of programming instead of the pap it currently offers on a daily basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>Ethiopia is one of the priority countries for aid from Ireland and those of us who have visited it are proud of the progress that has been made. Some Members of this House were there as observers during the recent elections. Unfortunately, there have been disputes in many areas in regard to the results of those elections. Opposition members there have asked Members to protest about the number of prisoners, mainly members of the opposition, who are imprisoned in Ethiopia. Some 4,000 have been incarcerated without trial. There were initially 7,000 in prison but following protests, 3,000 were released.</P>
      <P>It must be made known to Prime Minister Meles Zenawi that our support for his country is not unconditional and that we were dismayed by the display of violence in Addis Ababa and elsewhere which resulted in the death of 36 civilians and a member of the opposition. I hope the Seanad will protest in this regard and ask the Department of Foreign Affairs to let the Ethiopian Prime Minister know that our support depends on his protection of democracy. The important issue in this regard is not the concerns of citizens of this country about the aid going to Africa but rather the welfare and treatment of that country&rsquo;s citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with others in expressing concern for the five people in Mayo who have been imprisoned as a consequence of their protest at the construction of the onshore gas pipeline. I ask the Leader to organise another debate <Col N="2410"/>on this matter in the next session because the message has not been received by the Minister that direct intervention is required to prevent the major crime that is being perpetrated on people in the west. Shell, with Bord G&aacute;is as its partner, is taking an important resource out of the west and putting it into the east and south.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the concerns expressed by Senator Finucane in regard to the National Aquatic Centre. It was brought to my attention this morning that Fingal County Council has confirmed that 3 million litres of heated and chlorinated water are leaking from the plant room in the centre. There is a cost implication in this as well as the issue of the damage that is being done environmentally. As I said earlier this week, it is urgent that a team of independent engineers be put in there and that a report be presented to the Oireachtas. I am not satisfied with the points made by the Taoiseach and Minister in regard to the faults found with the aquatic centre. This is an urgent matter. A considerable amount of taxpayers&rsquo; money has been invested in the centre and we should be concerned about how that money has been spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been a member of the Automobile Association for many years. Some years ago, that association ceased to be a members-owned organisation and became a commercial company. I was stunned last week to discover that it has published information in Britain on the location of every speed camera in that country. When asked if it planned to do the same here, the response was that no decision has been made in this regard.</P>
      <P>We must send a clear message to the Automobile Association that the prevention of deaths on the road is an issue of high priority for us. That there were no deaths on our roads the weekend before last was an occurrence that warranted a newspaper headline. However, several more people lost their lives in road accidents last night. A message must go out clearly to the Automobile Association that it has an obligation to encourage motorists to slow down. Incidentally, we should not attempt to emulate the approach taken in Budapest where a nudist colony has apparently been built along the motorway in the hope that this will slow drivers down. That venture has been somewhat successful in this regard but it has also had the effect of distracting motorists&rsquo; attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The far-reaching consequences of the Higher Education Authority&rsquo;s proposals to <Col N="2411"/>change the funding methods for universities and other third level institutions will have serious consequences for those institutions. In this context, I call for a debate in the autumn on the issue of funding for third level institutions. There has been a serious decline in the funding provided by the Government and the Department of Education and Science to the universities.</P>
      <P>There is a serious note of warning to be heeded when we hear it said that funding must be related to the output of particular categories of graduates to accommodate the needs of the economy. We must acknowledge that in the past we have had great support from industry for research and development in third level institutions. The latter have responded excellently to that support by producing the leaders of industry and the economy. However, this proposed change will mean that third level institutions lose their independence.</P>
      <P>It is important that we have the opportunity to state clearly that our third level education system has been second to none and that any interference from outside will not be tolerated. Many Members have referred to the interference of multinationals in regard to other issues. I ask for a debate on this matter because the proposed changes to our education system will mean we all lose out.</P>

	<P>I support Senator Brian Hayes&rsquo;s proposal for a discussion on risk equalisation and the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s order in this regard. I cannot understand how an issue of such controversy could be put on the back-burner and discussion stifled. It is an issue of great importance to anybody who has health insurance. It is also an issue that is incredibly confusing and which most people do not understand. It would be useful if the T&aacute;naiste, who is the person in possession of all the information on this matter, could come to the House to explain it to us.</P>
      <P>I do not understand what seems to be horror of an ideological debate on the part of some. Why can we not have an ideological debate on this issue?</P>

	<P>This is a great opportunity for such a debate. Everybody knows VHI and BUPA are at each other&rsquo;s throats, not only for commercial reasons but because there is a clash of ideology between the semi-State and private sector. This topical issue presents an ideal opportunity for us to thrash it out in this House. Even if the T&aacute;naiste cannot come, I ask the Leader to accommodate a debate with a Minister of State in order to make this House more relevant on an immediate issue.</P>

	<P>I support what has been said in regard to Ethiopia. Senator Henry, some other colleagues and I met yesterday with representatives of the opposition parties in that country who strongly suggested to us that the Minister and Government should protest more strongly to the Ethiopian authorities about what has happened since the general election.</P>
      <P>We in the Oireachtas demonstrated a commitment to democracy in Ethiopia by sending election observers last May. Unfortunately, once the election was over, the Ethiopian Government has tried to fiddle the results in order to retain power. As we contribute quite significantly to the Ethiopian economy, we must make strong representations and protestations to the authorities there in demanding that the will of the people be respected and that those opposition candidates, supporters and party workers who have been jailed in the aftermath of the election be released forthwith.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Brian Hayes proposed that we would seek to have the T&aacute;naiste here after the Order of Business to debate item No. 1. Earlier this week, he said that a debate should be held on the matter. I made inquiries but the T&aacute;naiste is taking the Order of Business in the other House and it will not conclude until<?oasys _jy?>12 o&rsquo;clock at the earliest. We will endeavour to have the T&aacute;naiste here later today or tomorrow. I also think the matter should be debated. Everyone received notes by e-mail or post but I would like to hear her speak on it. As I cannot guarantee that she will attend, the Senator has every right to propose his amendment.</P>
      <P>With regard to the jailed farmers from County Mayo, Shell claimed this morning to have asked <Col N="2414"/>to speak with them but the people in question would not attend a meeting. It is sad that they are in prison. Nobody can blame the justice system. The judge must do whatever is laid out or put to him. I hope and believe that Bishop Jones and representatives will use their good offices to broker a suitable arrangement.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole also wants a debate on risk equalisation. He asked for a First Reading, that is, the printing of the Bill he prepared jointly with Senators Coghlan and Norris. It is a good idea to have it printed for a First Reading and we will have the Second Reading as soon as we return. I commend the industry of Members in bringing forward legislation.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan seconded the motion proposed by Senator Hayes and referred to the issue of Shell in County Mayo which, he said, concerned disproportionate power. He said that a safe process does not exist when transporting chemicals through lands. He also discussed child poverty and today&rsquo;s protest rally and wants a thorough debate on overseas development aid.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis said that risk equalisation is not a question of ideology. He went on to talk about the unfortunate jailing of the people from County Mayo and expressed the hope that a solution would be forthcoming.</P>
      <P>Senator Finucane said that when he was Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, the matter of the National Aquatic Centre was fully discussed. Regardless of the structure of the roof, a violent wind blew on the days in question. He wants the report brought forward.</P>
      <P>Senator Callanan praised the Minister for Agriculture and Food on her work in Russia in terms of selling Irish produce. He called for debate on beet sugar and the Council of Ministers. A better opportunity will arise later to hold a decent debate.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris had no criticism of the judge presiding over the jailing of the people from County Mayo. I concur with him on this. He commented on the history of Shell and what he described as the rapacious way in which this multinational company has conducted its business. He also noted the shortage of blood for use by the health services.</P>
      <P>Senator Kitt commented on the jailing of people from County Mayo and the debate on Sellafield, in which leaks remained undetected for nine months. That such a situation obtained is amazing.</P>
      <P>Senator Coghlan commented on No. 14 on the Order Paper. He also wanted the restoration of his stage payments Bill to the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister made a promise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>He made a promise that it would be brought forward. We now have three Private Members&rsquo; matters to address when we return.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney referred to the situation involving prison officers. I received correspon<Col N="2415"/>dence from Loughan House, where 99% of officers voted in favour of the Minister&rsquo;s proposals. A small percentage will wreck the homes and careers of many prison officers. The Senator also referred to the public service remit of RTE and the opinion of TV3 that the remit should not be a high priority.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry raised the issue of Ethiopia. Senator MacSharry commented on the imprisoned people from County Mayo. He wants direct intervention with Shell and Bord G&aacute;is, which bypasses the part of the north west that owns the gas reserves.</P>
      <P>Senator Terry remarked on the 3 million litres of water which are leaking from National Aquatic Centre and called for an independent engineer&rsquo;s report. Senator Quinn discussed the AA and speed cameras in the UK. He asked why could they not be pinpointed on a map here. He pro<Col N="2416"/>posed the novel solution developed in Budapest. I will not comment further on that because it is laughable. I hope that everybody on display is perfectly formed. They would slow traffic.</P>
      <P>Senator Ulick Burke noted the far-reaching proposal that third level funding be matched to output, which would reduce the independence of third level colleges. Senator Ross asked why we do not hold ideological debates and what would be wrong in so doing. Senator Bradford commented on Ethiopia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Two amendments are proposed to the Order of Business, which I will address in the order in which they were proposed. Senator Brian Hayes proposed amendment<?oasys _jy?>No. 1: &ldquo;That No. 1 be debated for a period of one hour&rdquo;. Is the amendment being pressed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the statutory review suggested by my colleague, Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe, in the other House has been accepted. As the Minister stated, it makes sense to have such a review in place.</P>
      <P>I am not convinced that the professional standards unit proposed by the Minister will go far enough to address the concerns outlined by Mr. Justice Morris. It is not sufficiently transparent and independent as envisaged by him. There is a definite need to promote a positive image of the force and the unit outlined in the legislation does not go far enough in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 35, which deals with the three year review, is welcome. The professional standards unit is welcome in itself but as Senator Cummins said, it does not go far enough. If we want a review, it should be an independent review. We are still perpetuating the practice of the garda&iacute; reviewing their own performance. There is nothing wrong with that. It is welcome that people would review their own performance but an independent review would be much better.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement when speaking on these amendments that he would consider the Labour Party&rsquo;s idea of a commission to review policing as a whole. I hope he does that in the near future. We need to examine statistics, performance indicators and so on. Many bodies carry out that type of internal review but the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which is involved in detecting crime as well as all the other various functions garda&iacute; perform, must be independently reviewed. The ideal way to do that, from the Labour Party&rsquo;s point of view, would be an independent policing authority which could initiate such reviews. Such an independent body could monitor the performance of garda&iacute; in addition to the Garda doing that also. The Police Service of Northern Ireland carries out its own reviews but a review is also done by the independent policing board.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 56 and 63 are welcome in that they remove certain functions from the Garda Commissioner and give them to the Minister. That is probably welcome in terms of accountability but it would be better if that type <Col N="2419"/>of exercise were done by an independent policing authority, with an overview by the Minister. It is still centralised Executive control whereas many sound commentators, including Denis Bradley when he attended the joint Oireachtas committee, argue that we must remove the Executive control and put in place an independent body that would be between the Minister and the Garda. Such a body could do many of the functions the Minister is providing for in this legislation. There is no major issue in the amendments, which are generally welcome, but they do not go far enough in terms of reforming the Garda structures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome certain aspects of the amendments before us but the question of a review of the effectiveness of management, the deployment of resources and so on is a matter for the Commissioner. To refer back to the hearings we had on the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, having read the Morris tribunal report it was a case of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i>. Many shortcomings were identified in the Barron report and by the sub-committee which led to a commission of investigation being established to examine various issues but we must await the outcome of that investigation before reaching definitive conclusions. There was sufficient information in it, however, for us to be concerned about weaknesses in procedures and so on. There was a gap of 20 years between the two occurrences, the one on which Mr. Justice Barron reported and the one on which Mr. Justice Morris reported.</P>
      <P>I have said previously regarding the debate on the Morris tribunal that the fact that an internal grouping is doing an analysis and reporting to the Minister on a three year basis is welcome but what is needed at this stage is a root and branch analysis of the strength and weaknesses of management and of the structures and procedures within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. That would be positive and healthy. The inspectorate could play a role in that process and I urge the Minister to take a close look at the matter. When all the Morris reports have been published, the case for that may be even stronger than at present. This measure is a major improvement when compared to its absence in the past.</P>
      <P>Self-analysis is healthy in that it would encourage the Garda Commissioner and his senior officers to focus on the absolute effectiveness of the management systems in place. Obviously, the necessity to report on a three-year basis to the Minister will ensure the analysis is fairly thorough. However, it is often the case that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, like other public bodies and most people &mdash; it is a personal characteristic &mdash; tends to be defensive rather than self-critical when writing reports. What is needed is a critical appraisal of the quality and effectiveness of the management structures in place. Often, such an appraisal will not come from an internal review.</P>
      <P>I was minded of this when the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s <Col N="2420"/>Rights had senior garda&iacute; before it in regard to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. I would have been encouraged if there had been an acknowledgement of the deficiencies at the time of the bombings but that did not happen. To some extent, those deficiencies were excused. I was concerned by this and retain those concerns.</P>
      <P>With regard to the professional standards unit and the reports, the Minister should examine whether some overall independent body, perhaps arising from the Morris tribunal report, is required or would be beneficial at this stage. I am mindful of a comment by Mr. Justice Morris in his report that given the situation which was the subject of his tribunal investigations, he did not believe the deficiencies were a Donegal blip. He pointed out that garda&iacute; came to Donegal from other areas and that the situation there would be reasonably indicative of possible failings elsewhere. I am sure the Minister, more than any of us, wants to see that rectified as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Senators for their contributions on this issue. Frankly, I have sympathy with all the views expressed because root and branch change is needed in the way in which the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is run. A Bill does not bring about root and branch change by itself. That process must follow in the wake of the Bill and will require a considerable degree of commitment from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
      <P>An important point is that in the wake of the Morris tribunal report I do not want the members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to lapse into passivism or passivity in regard to all these issues, or to ask: &ldquo;What are they going to do to us next? Who will be appointed from the outside to do this, that and the other to us?&rdquo; I want to encourage them to face up to the challenge that this new situation creates. For example, I could have located the professional standards unit in my Department but, in that event, it would be another body that would visit the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and act on its members from the outside.</P>
      <P>It is important garda&iacute; take ownership, at least in part, of the process of change. They have very serious issues to deal with. However, I would not like garda&iacute; in the Phoenix Park to feel they are in some fortress and that agencies keep descending on them, telling them this and that new idea from the outside. If the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is to undergo change &mdash; I am very confident Garda Commissioner Conroy shares my view on this &mdash; I want its members to play a constructive part in that change, not to see it resentfully as the backwash of Donegal or to believe that all these things happen to them rather than being done by them.</P>
      <P>I want to strike a balance, with an independent inspectorate looking in from outside and with the internal audit unit now being appointed by the Minister. I do not want every single mechanism in the new package to be external to the force. It must have responsibility in some of these areas.</P><Col N="2421"/>
      <P>To turn to Senator Tuffy&rsquo;s point on an external review of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I share the view that it will be necessary to have a broad review of where policing in Ireland is going. However, I could not accept the Labour Party Private Members&rsquo; motion in the D&aacute;il which effectively stated I should put everything on hold for 18 months before coming back to the Bill. The need for reform in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is immediate, as is the need for an ombudsman service.</P>
      <P>If there is an incident the day after tomorrow in which somebody is injured or killed by garda&iacute;, do we want an ombudsman service as an automatic response to investigate that incident in the coming weeks or whenever we get the service up and running, or will we postpone it for 18 months and have worse events happen in the meantime? From a frankly political perspective, how would my position be sustainable if I suggested another 18 months were to elapse because I wanted to think in broad terms about this issue yet again, some two years after the heads of the Bill were published for consultation? Would the public accept it was reasonable to suggest the process of reform was to be extended to three and a half or four years? I do not think so. It would not be sustainable.</P>
      <P>A point that should go on the record of the House is that I expect the next modules of the Morris tribunal will produce even worse news. What am I to do about that? Should I sit and wait passively for worse news to arrive or set about the process of reform now? I reiterate that if something is missing from this package, we will discover it. These measures are not the Ten Commandments; they are not there for all time. However, they are intended to get the process running, at least on all of the areas of reform I can identify as necessary. If some serious issue which requires change is missed by the Bill, I would be happy to make further changes to the package. There is no reason to postpone the process of change.</P>
      <P>Senator Maurice Hayes made a good point in his contribution to the debate and in a letter he sent to me. He stated that the wind is now in the sails of reform and we should not let it evaporate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That concludes the discussion on the amendments in group 7. We will now discuss the amendments in group 8.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>In chapter 9 of the second report of the Morris tribunal, the tribunal refers to the absence of structures for dealing with corruption at a most serious level. The tribunal also referred to the proposals of Garda headquarters to set up a body to which, on a confidential basis, difficulties and possible irregularities could be reported. The tribunal suggested this particular initiative should be seen as a means of removing corruption but pointed out that it should be supported and strengthened.</P>
      <P>I referred earlier to my proposal for a professional standards unit. This is part of my effort to support Garda management in identifying new structures that would make it more difficult for such scandals of corruption as appeared in Donegal to reoccur in the future. This particular proposal was brought forward in light of the recommendation in the report of the Garda Commissioner following the publication of the first Morris tribunal report. I mentioned this earlier in the context of amendment No. 36, which provides for the establishment of a professional standards unit within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on a statutory basis. In that same report, the question of anti-corruption and whistleblowing charters was also addressed. The report recommended that a whistleblowing charter should be introduced to provide a forum for the reporting of corruption and malpractice within the organisation.</P><Col N="2423"/>
      <P>In meetings between my officials and the Garda Representative Association on the Bill, the question of a whistleblowing charter was also discussed. This arose in the context of the association&rsquo;s request that members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be able to avail of the services of the ombudsman commission for the purpose of making complaints about members of more senior rank. The association took the view that members would be very unlikely to make a complaint against a more senior officer using the internal grievance procedure as there would be concerns for the member&rsquo;s future career prospects within the force in the event of their complaint not being upheld. As an alternative to the ombudsman commission, the association suggested the establishment of a whistleblowing charter.</P>
      <P>Throughout the debates in the D&aacute;il, the Labour Party has also been very strong on the need for a whistleblowers charter within the force. I reflected on the matter and on the concerns expressed by the Garda Representative Association, which represents the most junior rank in the force and where concerns are most sensitive. Following the debate on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il, I decided to include a new provision in the Bill dealing with regulations relating to reporting corruption and malpractice in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
      <P>The details of how the charter will operate have yet to be worked out by Garda management and the Department. However, the inclusion of this provision in the Bill will ensure that the necessary arrangements are put in place at the earliest time possible. Determining how to implement this will be part of the programme of work that Senator Maurice Hayes&rsquo;s implementation committee will undertake.</P>
      <P>It is important that considerable thought is put into this as people must have confidence that matters will be dealt with confidentially. It must also be a system that cannot be abused in an utterly malicious way. The exact tweaking of those two opposite considerations will require a good deal of thought.</P>
      <P>This provision will be given priority by the Department and the implementation oversight group of Senator Maurice Hayes. We will come up with a decent arrangement to deal with problems and corruption that cannot be dealt with by an ordinary report or a grievance report. This will apply to any member of the force who believes there is something seriously wrong further up the pyramid or at his or her own level. Members of the force will not feel their careers are at risk by ventilating in an appropriate manner to someone in a position to do something about it, if the information shows there is corruption or malpractice in the force.</P>
      <P>I am supportive of this proposal and I favour giving it a statutory basis. We could have attempted to proceed without a statutory basis but it is now a major item on the agenda because it is in statute form. This also pulls the rug from <Col N="2424"/>under someone who claims that the provision is contrary to the proper discipline of the force. If this measure did not have a statutory basis I can imagine someone arguing that it subverts the authority of the Garda Commissioner and that there is no implied authority for it in the Act. Now there is express authority for it.</P>
      <P>Critics may ask to be shown exactly how this will work. Although I cannot demonstrate how, I am confident it will work and that the system will deliver to ordinary members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the proper means to blow the whistle on reasonable suspicion of corruption and malpractice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>This issue goes to the heart of the Morris tribunal report. I raised this matter in the House during the passage of this Bill, prior to the revelations in the second Morris tribunal report. The ordinary garda must have the opportunity to contact someone if he or she sees a superior doing something wrong. A garda should be able to contact the ombudsman at this stage. The Minister is referring to a different system, the whistleblower&rsquo;s charter. This may be the correct vehicle to deal with this but a garda should be able to go to the ombudsman.</P>
      <P>Consider the case of corruption in Donegal. I am sure there are many decent, hard-working garda&iacute; in Donegal. If an ombudsman or an independent body had been in place at the time they could have revealed what was happening. However, this could not happen as superiors were involved in this debacle. I welcome anything that will allow ordinary garda&iacute; to air grievances about superiors but I cannot see why a garda cannot contact the ombudsman. Everyone else has the opportunity to do so. I think this is a step in the right direction and I will welcome the report from Senator Maurice Hayes&rsquo;s group when it appears. It will be an important part of the system and of this Bill. I look forward to the proposals when they become available.</P>
      <P>The Minister has moved on the whistleblower&rsquo;s charter although it seems very convoluted. The simpler the process of a garda making a complaint against a superior, the better. Without this process we could have many other situations similar to what occurred in Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I share Senator Cummins&rsquo;s view that this measure is welcome. The Minister mentioned that the Labour Party raised this issue and I believe Senator Cummins raised the question of garda&iacute; complaining to the ombudsman. He has made the same point again today.</P>
      <P>Senator Cummins has pointed to a possible flaw in the provision. Although it gives statutory basis to the concept of whistleblowing, it is very indirect. While it allows for a charter and regulations to be drawn up, there is no explicit right for a garda to make a complaint or to report allegations of corruption. This amendment refers indirectly to the right but there is no explicit provision. I am not critical of the amendment but this <Col N="2425"/>area may need review because when the Minister looks at the regulations with the Garda Commissioner, the inspectorate and the ombudsman commission, he may have to consider the necessity for an explicit provision for a garda to make a complaint to the ombudsman commission, as Senator Cummins suggested.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I also want to make a political point. This sort of issue could have been teased out more if we had more time. If the D&aacute;il had got the opportunity to debate these matters on Committee Stage, we would not have the problems the Minister identified in terms of how they were debated because the select committee would have had a different approach and debated the issues differently. In addition, I presumed the House would sit next week because we generally sit into the first week of July. There is no reason we could not have an extra week so that both Houses could examine the issue in more detail, particularly since the publication of the second Morris tribunal report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not convinced by the Opposition arguments in this regard. If there is malpractice or corruption in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it is not for the ombudsman commission to resolve it. That is an issue that should be resolved by the force. It is important, however, that a garda who reports suspicions should not subsequently incur sanctions. There is a kind of <i>omerta</i> or sense of identity in any group or team. Inherent in our culture, probably because of our history, is the sense that we should not squeal on each other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not always right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I know it is not right. It is important that there would be healthy and receptive acceptance of any suspicions people might have and that these should be investigated. However, there should be no subsequent recrimination. Matters should be conducted in a way that does not lead to that type of culture creeping into the Garda. The force must deal with the issue. If a garda passed on suspicions and felt they were not being dealt with properly for some reason, he could take another course of action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Not in Donegal. To where could the garda&iacute; in Donegal have passed them on?</P>

	<P>Senator Walsh, without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Morris tribunal has dealt quite thoroughly with the Donegal issue and it is not for me or Senator Cummins to reinvestigate it. The deficiencies there and the findings and recommendations of the report have led and instigated this change to provide a format within the force to deal with such issues, which is welcome. I listened to some of the debate in the D&aacute;il and as far as I am aware, there was unanimous support for this measure in the Bill. We should fully support it.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="2426"/>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>If we had said that one of the functions of the ombudsman commission was to entertain complaints by garda&iacute; against other garda&iacute;, the force would be mud-wrestled to the floor as an institution and would become an arbitrator and industrial relations kind of theatre of war. I do not want to go down that road. I want the commission to be one that deals with the public&rsquo;s complaints about garda&iacute;.</P>
      <P>There is provision in the ombudsman commission terms for it to investigate matters off its own bat. If material came to its intention that it believed to be within its remit, it could act on it. The Minister is also in a position to provide the commission with material and to ask it to investigate a matter. I did not want it to become the ordinary course of events that garda&iacute; having rows with each other and arguments about whether somebody was dealt with appropriately would contact the ombudsman commission and invoke its aid. That would collapse the effectiveness of the commission. However, the representative association asked for that.</P>
      <P>The representative association also asked that every complaint, no matter what, against a garda should be investigated by somebody who is not a garda. Does it believe I am about to establish a body 1,000 strong to deal with all complaints made by garda&iacute; against garda&iacute; and to provide that no complaint made to the ombudsman commission could be investigated by a member of the Garda? That is not practical. It is not the law in Northern Ireland and nor is it the practice in most countries that complaints being investigated by force members should not proceed.</P>
      <P>Many prosecutions are brought against garda&iacute; by garda&iacute;. The notion that it is impossible for garda&iacute; to deal fairly with other garda&iacute; is untrue. Garda&iacute; have been prosecuted for corruption, drunk driving, theft and other offences. Unfortunately, there are always a few people in a group of that size who infringe criminal law and the offenders are vigorously prosecuted in the majority of cases.</P>
      <P>The situation in Donegal was different. It must be conceded, however, that the report of the assistant commissioner, Kevin Carty, recommended a raft of prosecutions, some against fellow members of the force. The situation is not unprecedented.</P>
      <P>With regard to how this will work in practice, it is important that we build into the regulations a mechanism whereby a complaint can be made in confidence to somebody who will be a confidential barrier against it leaking to others, except where it becomes necessary for the identity of the complainant to come into focus. For example, in a case where the complainant is the key witness, if somebody confesses to the complainant that he has acted corruptly, the case will never be pressed home unless the complainant is willing to say the person told him he had done such and such. Otherwise, it cannot work.</P>
      <P>There must be some degree of reassurance in these cases that where confidentiality is due, <Col N="2427"/>there is an element of the seal of the confessional about the matter. Likewise, we cannot allow a situation where a complainant can just say anything he or she likes because that would expose members of the Garda to appalling victimisation by anonymous informants who could act from motives of malice, competitiveness, jealousy, etc., or simple retribution; we cannot have an absolute in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I now call the Minister to address the amendments in group 9.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators will recall that I brought forward an amendment in this House on Committee Stage which inserted a new subsection (2) into section 114. This amendment provided as follows: &ldquo;Regulations under <i>subsection (1)(i)</i> shall include provision for the establishment of promotion boards comprising 3 members, one of whom (but not the chairperson) shall be a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rdquo;. I decided to amend this provision further on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il. I am now providing for the establishment of a panel of suitably qualified persons to be appointed by the Government from which the Minister will appoint the two non-Garda members of the promotion board, including the chairperson.</P>
      <P>I said earlier in this debate that I have encountered on many occasions the wholly misguided notion that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has some part to play in the process of promotion of members within the force. I want it to be very clear that the process is totally transparent and fully in accordance with regulations to be made under section 114. I also provided in amendment No. 123 that no person can be a member of the panel if he or she is, or ever has been a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
      <P>In the reports of the Morris tribunal, no recommendations were made as to how the matter of Garda promotions should be looked at in the future. However, the tribunal observed that &ldquo;the system of promotion, in its experience, too often produces people who do not bring to the task the requisite level of enthusiasm, commitment and ability&rdquo;. That is a fairly hefty criticism of the system of promotion that exists at present. The tribunal suggested that this matter be examined by the Department, in consultation with the Garda Commissioner. While the tribunal did not make a specific recommendation in this regard, it is clear from the general thrust of a number of its recommendations that an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na needs to look outside the force for new ideas and a fresh impetus on many fronts. I introduced amendments Nos. 123 and 124 for this reason.</P>
      <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be well served by people with proven expertise in promotion techniques and succession planning within other organisations. The retention of a single representative of Garda management on promotion boards is sufficient to ensure that account is taken <Col N="2428"/>of the core requirements of the position in question and the &ldquo;person specification&rdquo; appropriate to that position. I have spoken to the Commissioner about the amendments I made in the D&aacute;il in this regard. He has indicated that he has no difficulty with the provisions. It is obvious that it is useful, in many cases, to have a member of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on a promotion board. Unlike outsiders, who may not have service experience, such a person can comment on the requirements of a position and the qualities which are necessary in the person filling it.</P>
      <P>I have been contacted privately, for example during social occasions, by members of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who believe that some groups within the force are on the inside track when promotions are being allocated. They do not allege that party political favouritism is displayed within the force when promotions are being decided. Just a few people hold that erroneous opinion. I am aware that there has always been a belief within the uniformed branch that detectives are on the inside track in respect of promotions. While I cannot make a useful comment on whether that perception is right or wrong, I want to make it clear that all members of an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are entitled to the psychological assurance that they will be assessed fairly, not by reference to some internal, unspoken, hidden or secret agenda or prejudice, when they put their names forward for promotion. That is what this set of proposals is all about.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that people will argue that the Government is interfering in some way when it appoints promotion panels. They might suggest that the panel system is liable to abuse. We cannot extend the concept of transparency to a ridiculous length, however. There will be a sufficient level of transparency if, as I have proposed, the names of the persons who are placed on the promotion panel are the subject of public knowledge, debate and scrutiny. The regulations will provide that canvassing will, in effect, disqualify. Approaches which are made behind the scenes to either of the independent panellists or the Garda representative will be disclosed and discounted. We can deal with all such issues in a fair manner.</P>
      <P>People are appointed to virtually every senior position in the Civil Service following an interview by a panel of outsiders, accompanied by a person from the Department who is expected to bring some reality to proceedings by giving an indication of the Department&rsquo;s view of the matter. Such a person is required to be present to ensure that applicants cannot get away with a complete bluff by misleading outsiders who have no idea what they are doing. Nobody has alleged that the system will be less fair because outsiders will be involved. This is a significant advance. We can ensure, by regulation, that any deficiencies which appear in the promotion process are remedied.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>We need to ensure that the best people are doing the work of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as the Minister said. I agree with his comments about transparency and fairness, which are of paramount importance when promotions are being made within the force. We all want the best people to be promoted. I intended to make the point the Minister made about the promotion panels. People who are above reproach should be appointed to such boards. I agree that a member of the force should be on each panel to deal with practical issues and the requirements of the job. I hope canvassing will disqualify in the manner outlined by the Minister. Appointments are often made on the basis of who one knows, rather than what one knows. I agree with the thrust of the changes made as a consequence of amendments Nos. 123 and 124. We all want to get the best people for the job.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to speak about amendment No. 123. Although I could be mistaken, I understand it introduces a new subsection (2) in this section of the Bill.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>Okay, I did not notice something that nobody else had seen. It is obvious that amendment No. 123 makes a change by clarifying that the two non-Garda appointees to a promotion panel cannot be or have been members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Amendment No. 124 alters the wording of this section of the Bill slightly, but it does not make much of a difference to the existing provisions. It states that the two non-Garda appointees should be &ldquo;suitably qualified persons appointed to the panel by the Government&rdquo;. That is something that could have been referred to in the regulations anyway. It does not make a major change to what was already in the legislation.</P><Col N="2430"/>
      <P>I would like to make a general point about the section of the Bill being amended by these amendments. Senator Maurice Hayes made a point about the training of garda&iacute; when the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, was in the House. He asked why garda&iacute; cannot be trained alongside trainee social workers and other professionals. That point was also made by other commentators, such as Professor Dermot Walsh, who said that one way to tackle the inward-looking culture in the force would be to train garda&iacute; outside Templemore, for example in universities.</P>
      <P>The Minister, who made a comment about this matter when it was raised the other day, needs to listen to people like Senator Maurice Hayes and Professor Dermot Walsh, who know a great deal about this area. Their argument makes a great deal of sense. I read the Minister&rsquo;s comment about trainee garda&iacute; sitting around on beanbags, but that is not what has been suggested. It might be no harm for them to engage in a small amount of such activity. If trainee garda&iacute; discuss issues with people who are studying other disciplines, they might get a broader perspective on the role of the force. UCD has initiated the &ldquo;horizons&rdquo; programme, under which people studying engineering, for example, can study alongside arts undergraduates, for example. It is a good thing to encourage people to have a broader outlook on their professional activities. I hope the Minister will provide for such a change, which a brave independent police authority might have considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want the Minister to take my remarks personally. I am a very straight and direct person. I really think we are missing an opportunity by failing to establish an independent police authority. I can give many examples of cases in which such an authority would have been of use. As someone who is completely supportive of departmental officials, I do not think the advisers and policy-makers in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform act in an executive manner by taking action and making changes. We are missing an opportunity to set up a police authority.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Tuffy, I said recently that the Garda training depot in Templemore is too remote. I attended a conference recently in a hotel in north Tipperary and the Garda had to hire rooms to teach garda&iacute; because there is not sufficient accommodation for them. It would be much healthier if garda&iacute; studied with other groups in colleges and universities. With all due respect, they forget that the public are the customers. There is a little bit of arrogance involved. In other countries in Europe, they look like they are on the job, so to speak. I do not want to say much more than that because I might get into trouble. Garda recruits should be in mainstream education because their present education system is old-fashioned.</P>
      <P>We are all optimistic about the increase in numbers to which the Minister referred last night. <Col N="2431"/>I said to him at a conference in Dundalk that I want to be free from fear of being attacked. As I have got to know the Minister&rsquo;s constituents in Dublin South-East, one of the great fears of old people in the area is being alone at night. I was shocked to learn that community garda&iacute;, who do great work in the community, must retire at the age of 57. The Minister is talking about recruiting new people and promotions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like the Minister to let me know about this aspect. If we had an independent police authority, it would be recommending that we hold on to good people aged 57. Why should a young sergeant have to retire at 57 and why should a young superintendent have to retire at 60? I just learned of this last week, and I never heard such nonsense. It is so archaic that people who are healthy and dedicated to their job should have to retire. If a semi-State organisation had its own authority it could make changes as it goes along. I am sorry to have to say so, but Departments do not make changes in this way. They do not react quickly to changes in society. I have the highest regard and respect for public servants, but they are not able to make quick changes. Why does a sergeant have to retire at 57 years of age in this day and age?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>That is obvious. I just want to ask the Minister a couple of questions and I would like to get a straight answer. Where is the common sense in making a sergeant retire at the age of 57 if he or she is doing a great job in the community? When I was told this in Kevin Street station last week, I could not believe it, and I said I would ask the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>This board is a key factor in the effective running of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. If one promotes good people with the necessary skills to do the job, the factors that must be addressed will be overcome. The Morris tribunal highlights a litany of poor management. I was recounting to the Minister last night that my wife visited a friend recently. Her friend&rsquo;s husband spent his career in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. He said everything I had been saying about the garda&iacute;, namely, poor management has given rise to many of these problems and garda&iacute; are not living in the locality. Obviously he served at a time when garda&iacute; lived in their locality. I do not know how this aspect can be tackled. I know people have a fundamental right to live where they wish, and no one wants to interfere with that. However, if some positive <Col N="2432"/>incentives were introduced, it would be beneficial to the overall operation of the Garda.</P>
      <P>The Boston police commissioner, Kathleen O&rsquo;Toole, said that good cops do not necessarily make good managers because different skills are required. I noted that comment because it is quite perceptive and true. There needs to be criteria for promotion. I welcome that people from outside will be involved, which is essential. The criteria for promotion should be examined closely.</P>
      <P>I am pleased the Minister mentioned the Local Appointments Commission, which is made up of people within the public service and is seriously flawed. I discussed the issue recently with people in other positions who would use more pejorative language in that regard. While there is no political interference, and probably not much canvassing going on, the commission is seriously influenced by the county managers&rsquo; association. There is a resonance in what some garda&iacute; say, namely, that good people have been passed over, while people who are on the inside track have got through. Unfortunately, people on interview boards tend to be influenced by people they like or whatever. However, it is fundamental in the Garda or any other business to get the right people into the right positions. There are currently many round pegs in square holes in local government, which is a monument to the &ldquo;old boys&rdquo; network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I say this because it is imperative this does not happen here. The Minister must put in place safeguards to avoid this happening. If he wants to substantiate what I am saying, he should speak to his colleague, the Minister in charge of that area. Anyone who has gone through the local government system would not have failed to notice what is going on. The system needs to be overhauled radically.</P>
      <P>I have noticed in the public service that promotions boards are very much interview-driven. There have been examples of people who interview very well but may not have the skills to deliver on the job and responsibility they are given subsequently. Equally, there are people who would be well equipped to do the job but, because of their temperament or whatever, they do not perform well at interviews. The interview process is an important component of selecting people but there must be other ways of doing the assessment.</P>
      <P>To some extent, an analogy could be drawn with examinations, where the discussion evolves around people studying hard for examinations and getting points on that basis. Other criteria need to be added to the melting pot to assess people&rsquo;s attributes and capabilities. The only sensible suggestion I can make is that the promotions board should be made subject to the inspectorate, from the point of view of the inspectorate having a specific remit to periodically <Col N="2433"/>examine if the promotions board is being unduly influenced by people who for one reason or another may have an interest in it. This is an area that needs to be examined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>In regard to members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we are in danger in this House of operating on the basis of outdated stereotypes. One of the great pleasures of my job is to visit Templemore to see the passing out parades. The notion that these are young farmers&rsquo; lads, with the leaving certificate sticking out of their breast pocket, who have no experience of the broad wide world, which may have been correct at one stage, is no longer the case in Templemore. Nowadays the majority of them, or at least a large number, are third level graduates. There is a notion, dating back to when the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was male dominated, that strapping farmers&rsquo; sons enter the force without any experience of the world other than the preparatory course to get into Templemore. I assure the House that the diametric opposite is the truth now. Senators should see the citations and experience of those who are there now. The breadth of their experience amazes me. Some are former accountants and secondary teachers. People are coming into the force now who have third level qualifications right across the board. Some have engineering degrees. It is regarded as a good job that is much sought after.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>It is well paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is well paid.</P>
      <P>The notion that the education of garda&iacute; involves a group of people, who have no experience of the broader world and no other education, attending a kind of monastery in Templemore is not true any more. Anybody who wants to leave their prejudices aside should go to Templemore to learn the truth because the situation is radically different from the picture being portrayed of young garda&iacute; as inexperienced introverts being inducted into some monastic order in a former barracks. Nothing could be further from the truth. In the course of their training they spend a considerable amount of time on the streets with community garda&iacute; getting involved in social projects and gaining a broader view of the world. The training is not an intensive programme that cuts them off from the world. It is important to stress these points as we are in danger of debating this on the basis of an impression formed 15 or 20 years ago.</P>
      <P>It was as big an eye-opener for me to see in Templemore the type of people becoming garda&iacute; now, and to realise how wrong that stereotype was, as it would be to anybody else. A huge number, I believe a majority, have third level experience of some sort and have sat on bean bags with social science students discussing their philosophy of life. It is not the case that they are raw recruits with no view of the world outside what they learn in Templemore.</P><Col N="2434"/>

	<P>It surprises me that Senator White objects to the retirement age of 57. This has been debated for many years and there are two sides to the argument. It is easy to ask why somebody should be let go at 57 when he or she is doing a good job. On the other hand, do we want people between 57 and 60 who, getting on in years, are not in a position to hop over walls and chase burglars? I am 54 and I would not be happy jumping over eight foot walls.</P>

	<P>Members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are entitled to a full pension after 30 years service, although this is changing for new recruits.

I cannot force a garda policing Donnybrook to live in Donnybrook, or one policing Ringsend to live in Ringsend. I can, however, encourage reservists to enlist so that there are members of the broader force in every community. For the information of Senator White, people who reach the age of 57 or who retire a few years earlier should be entitled to become reservists so their experience is not thrown away and their links with the force are maintained. It is a practical solution.</P>

	<P>If there were a system whereby everybody could serve until they were 60 or 65 it would only be for members who were still firing on all cylinders from a fitness point of view so that they could take on the onerous duties of garda&iacute;. If a selection system were introduced it would give rise to significant industrial relations problems because the process would be open to charges of favouritism, as some were selected and others deemed to be past it, so to speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Minister to speak on group 10, amendment No. 25.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment arises out of a key recommendation of the second report of the Morris tribunal. In essence the amendment inserts a new section 14 in the Bill, which in subsection (1) governs the appointment, subject to appropriate regulations, by the Garda Commissioner of persons to the rank of garda, sergeant and inspector respectively.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) is more or less the same as that in section 13(2) as passed by the Seanad.</P>
      <P>The rest of the section, dealing with a new summary power of dismissal of such members by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, is new. This part of the amendment will enable the Garda Commissioner to dismiss a member of the force where the Commissioner has lost confidence in the capacity of that member to discharge his or her duty and where the dismissal is considered necessary to maintain public confidence in the force. The member in question will be informed of the reasons for the Commissioner&rsquo;s opinion and given the opportunity to argue against dismissal. The consent of the Minister will be necessary before the Commissioner actually dismisses the member.</P>
      <P>The strength of this power has caused controversy. It provides for exactly the same situation that exists for senior officers. I cannot allow a situation where, if a sergeant and a superintendent or chief superintendent are, for example, engaged in corruption together, for which there is precedent, one of them can be dismissed by the Government but the other can go on sick leave and demand a tribunal of inquiry or appeal his dismissal and take the case to court. If, in the rare cases where it is necessary, a senior officer must leave to maintain public confidence in the force then the same should apply to lower ranks. What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. It will not become the norm because it is not a substitute for the disciplinary process. However, members whose continued presence in the force causes public outcry and debate cannot remain in it. There is no reason the position of members of lower rank should be stronger than that of higher rank.</P><Col N="2436"/>
      <P>The new power of dismissal will be separate and distinct from the disciplinary regulations, which will continue to apply in cases of specific allegations of misconduct. It is analogous to the existing broad power of the Government to dismiss a member of superintendent rank or higher where it has lost confidence in the member. The extension of this power to the Garda Commissioner in respect of less senior ranks is a significant change in the overall structure of the force. Essentially, therefore, the provision will enable the Commissioner to dismiss members of the ranks named in broadly the same way the Government can dismiss members of more senior rank using its powers under section 10(4) of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act 1925.</P>
      <P>Currently, the Commissioner has no equivalent power and a dismissal can only come about after a full disciplinary inquiry and, in all likelihood, an appeal. The only exception to this is regulation 40 of the Garda&rsquo;s disciplinary code, which provides that, in certain circumstances, the Commissioner can, with the consent of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, dismiss a garda, sergeant or inspector without the need for a disciplinary inquiry provided the Commissioner is in no doubt the dismissal is merited and the holding of an inquiry could not affect his or her decision.</P>
      <P>While regulation 40 provides for accelerated dismissal, it is part of the disciplinary process and has limited application. The purpose of the new provision is to enable the Commissioner to act outside of the disciplinary regulations in circumstances where he or she no longer has confidence in the capacity of the member to discharge his or her duties and where dismissal is necessary to maintain public confidence in the force. I have received extensive advices regarding this power from the Attorney General and the section has been drafted strictly in accordance with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a strong section. Dismissal will occur if a member undermines public confidence, which is subjective. Who defines &ldquo;public confidence&rdquo;? Summary dismissal should be the last resort and all disciplinary procedures should be exhausted before it takes place. I agree with the Minister that what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander but dismissal must be handled delicately. The section cannot be used as a big stick to sack a member because of X, Y and Z and, therefore, proper reasons must be given. Powers of dismissal should be provided but I am concerned that the powers envisaged are over the top.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>The section is strong of necessity. The ultimate sanction of dismissal must be available in both public and private employment. Labour and employment legislation contains safeguards against travesties of justice.</P>
      <P>Natural justice dictates that a member facing dismissal should have the right of representation when he or she makes his or her case. The <Col N="2437"/>member must be informed of the basis for the Commissioner&rsquo;s opinion and he then has the right to respond. Can he respond orally or can he only respond in writing? The Commissioner is only one person. Normally employees have the right to appeal to a third party when facing dismissal.</P>
      <P>The Garda is a structured force. Ultimately, the Commissioner is responsible and accountable for what happens within the force and, therefore, he must have powers such as this. Will an appeals system be provided? I acknowledge the Government&rsquo;s consent to the member&rsquo;s dismissal is required but I cannot envisage a scenario where the Commissioner would make a decision to dismiss a member only to be overruled by the Government. That would be tantamount to a resigning matter for the Commissioner because it would be an implicit statement of no confidence in the decision. It would be difficult for him unless a vexatious reason were provided.</P>
      <P>It is highly undesirable to impose the ultimate sanction of dismissal. The section addresses the appointment of members by the Garda Commissioner to senior positions. However, the Garda does not provide ongoing training or refresher courses for members, especially those in management positions. Recently, I was part of a delegation which visited the London Metropolitan Police and the Boston police. We were impressed by much of what we heard and much of this information could provide the content for Garda training seminars. Members of those forces could be invited to such seminars so that information is disseminated throughout the force and not only senior management. Refresher courses on management skills could be provided using members of other forces to give seminars.</P>
      <P>Complaints and tribunals should not occur because of the failure to retain files and records properly. That is an elementary function of a police force. Such seminars and courses could be usefully introduced into the system. I appreciate that can be done without legislation through the regular interaction between the Department and the force. Many well qualified and well educated people are being recruited by the Garda. Commissioner O&rsquo;Toole in Boston said the force&rsquo;s system operated on a seniority basis but the force was trying to identity younger members with the necessary management skills to promote them so that they can implement their ideas when they have the energy and drive to do so rather than holding them back because of the seniority track. This should be examined by the Garda and other police forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I recognise the need for such a provision but I am concerned that it could be heavy handed. The Minister stated he received advice from the Attorney General that it is in order. I wonder whether fair procedures will be followed through the use of such a provision. The type of hearing provided under standard disciplinary procedures is not provided for. Can somebody speak on behalf of a member whom it is proposed to <Col N="2438"/>dismiss? There is no provision for appeal. The Minister points out that the Government has control over more senior positions such as the Garda Commissioner, who can be dismissed, but that is different because those people are Government appointees. A person of the rank provided for here goes through different public service procedures to be appointed. The comparison cannot be made. These people are not appointed by the Government.</P>
      <P>The Government appointment process is more transparent and accountable. Under the legislation the Government can decide to dismiss a person of a particular rank but it must account for this to the D&aacute;il and the Seanad. Section 14(2)(<i>d</i>) refers to an indirect accountability. The Government must to an extent trust the opinion of the Garda Commissioner.</P>
      <P>Senator Jim Walsh made a general point about the promotional ladder in the force but Senator White referred to members retiring at the age of 57. That will have to be reviewed because retirement age will be reviewed in every other profession. We cannot start to discuss abolishing compulsory retirement in other areas and not look at this provision.</P>
      <P>The Minister brought ageism into the discussion. While he is not malicious he referred to the physical attributes of a 57 year old. A 40 year old might not be able to jump over walls but a 57 year old might. When one removes people from any job at a particular age one loses wisdom and experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>This power will be used sparingly but it is wrong that a senior officer of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can be removed on grounds of loss of confidence while somebody junior to him or her, and guilty of the same conduct, is excused from a summary dismissal and goes through a lengthy process. There are three limits to this power, namely the individual&rsquo;s conduct triggers it &mdash; this is not a matter of public perception or three bad newspaper editorials that shook public confidence; the conduct must be of a kind that undermines public confidence in the force and the dismissal must be necessary to maintain public confidence. These are not trifling conditions.</P>
      <P>This power can be exercised only in a constitutional manner. Whatever the Constitution requires must be done. Likewise, it can be exercised only in compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights. If the convention provides for anything over and above the requirements of the Constitution that too is implicit in this power.</P>
      <P>This requires the Government&rsquo;s consent. Senator Jim Walsh asked if the Garda Commissioner went through this process and the Government disagreed, whether that would be a resigning matter for the Commissioner. I hope and assume the Commissioner would not do something lightly but that does not mean the Government would be embarrassed in refusing to <Col N="2439"/>give its consent if it doubted the wisdom of the Commissioner&rsquo;s decision. The Government&rsquo;s role is not that of a rubber stamp; it would give this the same kind of consideration it would give to a proposal by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that a particular superintendent be removed.</P>
      <P>The Government acts as the final arbiter in the matter by reference to constitutional values and with the Attorney General sitting at the Cabinet table. This is not a case of the secretary to the Government ticking a box and dismissing a person. It is quite the reverse; this would be a serious process requiring a decision of the Cabinet, informed by legal advice, in the presence of the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>The courts would ensure that any deviation from what was fair or necessary in the circumstances would be available if there was any such deviation. This is not a gung-ho provision. It merely puts everyone in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on a level playing field with more senior officers and as such it is a desirable change.</P>
      <P>I am not engaging in ageism. There is a package here, part of which is that after 30 years service one walks away with a full pension entitlement. If one joins the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at the age of 21, by the age of 51 one has the right to leave with half of one&rsquo;s salary for life and a large gratuity. That is a generous deal which is not open to secondary school teachers, nurses or many others. The <i>quid pro quo</i> is that the Government by regulation, not statute, provides the retirement age for garda&iacute;.</P>
      <P>Several times since becoming Minister I have considered the point Senator White raised. It is a perennial issue. I have discussed it with two commissioners and officials in my Department. If I were to raise the age from 57 to 60&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister dealt with that point in a previous group. He should stick to the issue of summary power of dismissal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;it would be wrong and if I were to introduce a selective system it would be open to abuse. There are many people in their 50s who regard the age limit of 57 as opening up promotional opportunities that might disappear if we changed that.</P>

	<P>I ask the Minister to address the 11th group of amendments, regarding appointment of garda&iacute; from other jurisdictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The 11th group of amendments consists of amendments Nos. 121 and 122. In its second report the Morris tribunal referred to the plan being implemented by Garda management to strengthen the Garda internal audit section and noted it was a matter of worry that the internal audit section had not been strengthened by the presence of officers from outside police forces.</P><Col N="2440"/>
      <P>The tribunal acknowledged it would be reasonable to argue that those who do not have an intimate working knowledge of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would be unlikely to know where internal problems can arise and where embarrassing details, lies and controversies can best be hidden. Nonetheless, its investigators found that a combination that works well is that of experienced Garda personnel and those with service at commander level in a foreign police force. The tribunal added the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na needs a combination of experience, dynamism and honesty which is best achieved through allowing a combination of a fresh approach from outside the force and internal experience based on a long service to synergise.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for the appointment and secondment to superintendent rank and higher of members of the PSNI to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the secondment to the PSNI of members of ranks not above inspector in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. In these respects the Bill restates the provisions in the 2003 Act which implements the Patten report.</P>
      <P>The tribunal observed that the transfer of personnel at garda, sergeant and inspector level is not provided for and referred to the various treaties of the European Union which promote the notion of the movement of goods and workers. While the tribunal acknowledged that this ideal must give way to practical problems where knowledge of local languages, conditions and problems is concerned, it took the view that it did not seem right that a person applying from an equivalent police force, with appropriate qualifications in language and expertise, from within the European Union, or from friendly countries such as Canada, needs to be inducted into the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na trainee rank while at the same time losing significant salary and pension benefits by virtue of a desire to transfer to Ireland to serve the people of this country. While the tribunal acknowledged that the ideal must give way to practical problems where knowledge of local languages, conditions and problems is concerned, it took the view that it did not seem right that a person applying from an equivalent police force and with appropriate language qualifications and expertise from the EU or a friendly country such as Canada should be inducted into the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at trainee rank, while at the same time losing significant salary and pension benefits, by virtue of a desire to transfer to Ireland and serve the people of this country. The tribunal referred to the fresh infusions of energy and enthusiasm in young recruits almost yearly and stated that fresh ideas and personnel as well as fresh approaches to problems through the experiences of other police forces might usefully be introduced to the benefit of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and those it serves.</P>
     
      <P>The tribunal recommended the strengthening of the Garda internal audit section through the induction of officers of experience from Canada or an equivalent force or the revision of the Civil Service entry requirements to allow the transfer <Col N="2441"/>in appropriate cases of persons below the rank of superintendent and under appropriate conditions of service and retraining into the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from the EU or from friendly countries outside it. Further on, in chapter 9 of its report, under the heading of &ldquo;ethnic diversity&rdquo;, the tribunal stated that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should have more confidence in its ability to train and equip its recruits and actively seek its intake from a wider and more diverse ethnic and religious mix than at present.</P>
       <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>This area was also brought up during debates in the D&aacute;il, when the Fine Gael spokesman on justice asked why the Bill was limiting the appointment and secondment arrangements to members of the Police Service of Northern Ireland. Many of the points raised by Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe echoed those of the tribunal. I undertook to re-examine the provisions. Having done so and in light of the Morris tribunal observations and recommendations in this area, I have tabled amendments Nos. 121 and 122. The former provides for the recruitment by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of members from police services of other states and members with diverse ethnic or national origins or different religious beliefs and backgrounds. Amendment No. 122 provides for the secondment of members of other police forces to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The suggestions and proposals are sensible and strengthen the Bill. We must respond to the major changes in society that we have witnessed in recent years, and this goes some way towards achieving that goal. Regarding members on secondment from other police forces, the Minister is right that we must have people with dynamism and fresh ideas and approaches to dealing with matters. I fully support this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I too support this section, with which I have no problems. Regarding a similar provision in the legislation for the secondment of members of police services outside the State to assist the ombudsman commission, I made inquiries with the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland and was told that she did not use members of the PSNI to carry out her work. She uses only members of other police forces. Our legislation provides that we may use members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, allowing them to be seconded to the ombudsman commission. That should be reviewed since, as much as possible, we should ensure that the ombudsman commission does not use members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to carry out its work. They should come from other police forces, since that is best practice. I know it is related only indirectly to this amendment, but I felt this was the best juncture at which to make that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome these provisions, in particular the ethnic diversity to which the Mini<Col N="2442"/>ster referred and which is mentioned in this amendment. In that regard, there should be some sort of positive campaign to recruit people, particularly from our large eastern European population, along with those of Chinese or black backgrounds. We should now be thinking of recruiting from those groups. It establishes a connection with communities once they see people involved in the police. It would be good for the integration of those people, who are coming in and will be part of Ireland in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I fully echo what Senator Jim Walsh has just said. I intend to fast-track the ethnic diversification of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, since we know that in Britain youths from racial minorities in particular saw a police force in the 1950s and 1960s which did not reflect their community at all. It indelibly marked the relationship between those minority communities and the force. Now is the time for us to be thinking about this rather than struggling to deal with it when many of the toddlers in prams from minority ethnic communities are young teenagers who see no echo of their own background in the police force that serves their community. I am very anxious that we fast-track that process now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Minister might turn to group 12, concerning the searching of designated Garda stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>By way of background information, I can inform Senators that section 91 is one of the most important in Part 3 of the Bill, dealing with the powers of the investigation staff or ombudsman commission to search Garda stations. It is a carefully worded provision in all respects, particularly in the case of certain Garda stations with sensitive material, written, tangible, or computer-based, relating to the State&rsquo;s security.</P>
      <P>The Bill&rsquo;s provisions, as passed by this House, envisage that the regulations be drawn up with the approval of the Government by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Commissioner. They would specifically designate those Garda stations in which such material, in the form of information, documents or things, would be stored. If the ombudsman commission wished to search those stations, the Minister and the Commissioner would have to be notified, and a search could not proceed, except to the extent specified by the Minister under section 91(3) of the Bill. The Minister&rsquo;s decision in that respect would be subject to review by a designated judge of the High Court. In accordance with section 92 of the Bill, he or she would have the necessary powers relating to access and production of documents in that regard. He or she will make a report to the Taoiseach on the operation of the provisions, and the Taoiseach is obliged to ensure that a copy of the judge&rsquo;s report be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, sub<Col N="2443"/>ject only to the exclusion of any matter relating to the security of the State.</P>
      <P>I emphasise that my objective is to keep to an absolute minimum those areas that are off-limits to ombudsman commission investigations. I took great care with the drafting of this provision to achieve a balance between the ombudsman commission&rsquo;s need for the fullest access possible and the requirements of State security. Unlike police forces in many other jurisdictions, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in addition to its normal policing functions, is also the security arm of the State. In the UK, that role is separate from the ordinary police force, being in the hands of MI5 and MI6, while in France the organisation is the <i>s&ucirc;ret&eacute;</i>. I have always maintained that such procedures are necessary in our case to protect sensitive intelligence sources, for example.</P>
      <P>I considered possible alternative approaches, and my good friend, Senator Maurice Hayes, who is very familiar with this area, suggested that one way out of the problem would be to allow the ombudsman commission access to all areas, including those sensitive locations and material, and provide that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform might prevent the publication of any sensitive security-related material in any subsequent report. That would affect neither the conclusions nor recommendations in that report. Such a provision would operate in conjunction with the agreed protocols on such access drawn up between the Garda Commissioner and the ombudsman commission.</P>
      <P>In the final analysis, however, I have decided to stick with the Bill&rsquo;s basic approach, but with some modifications. That is the purpose of the amendment that I tabled on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il. I will return to that point. If, as Senator Tuffy maintains, the ombudsman is to use outsiders only in such instances, that creates a problem. Who are those outsiders who are to root through the deepest secrets of our State? No other security service anywhere in the world says that a group of outsiders may knock on the door and ask to see one&rsquo;s most secret files, including on IRA informers and touts in criminal gangs, where it relates to the security of the State. No other security service is subject to that provision.</P>
      <P>I therefore decided to place a positive duty on the Minister of the day to issue directions specifying the part of the document storage facility or Garda station in question that may be searched. A new subsection (6) provides that any ministerial direction may contain such conditions or restrictions as considered necessary in the interests of the security of the State. I also took the opportunity of providing by way of amendment No. 130 that any abuse of the procedure by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regarding a search under section 99 of a document storage facility will be a serious disciplinary offence. That will also be inserted into the discipline regulations in very stark terms. Anyone trying to hide behind this argument regarding the security of the State <Col N="2444"/>in bad faith will commit a very serious offence. If the ombudsman commission makes a complaint in this regard, the Secretary General of the Department could, under the powers assigned to him or her in regard to the procurement of documents, adjudicate on the matter. There would be serious consequences for any garda, of whatever rank, who tries in bad faith to abuse this provision.</P>
      <P>That is as much as I can do to address this issue without destroying the confidentiality of information relevant to State security. I have pared the provisions down so that they relate not to entire stations but to parts of a document storage facility, and have assigned a positive duty to the Minister to minimise the applicability of this section. This is balanced by the stipulation that anybody who tries to abuse this provision by storing information in an incorrect file or whatever will face the most condign treatment.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 129 is simply a draft amendment. I draw Members&rsquo; attention to the fact that section 123, on page 82 of the draft as passed by the D&aacute;il, contained a typographical error. The reference to section 100 in this section should be a reference to section 99. The Clerk of the Seanad has suggested that I should propose a correction along the following lines:</P>
      <P LI="1">In accordance with Standing Order 121, I request the Cathaoirleach to instruct the Clerk to make a correction in the Bill as passed by the D&aacute;il. The reference in line 30, page 82, to &ldquo;section 100&rdquo; should read &ldquo;section 99&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not entirely understand the Minister&rsquo;s last point. Is the section in question technically incorrect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It contains a typographical error.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The section is correct but there is a typographical error which must be corrected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The existence of a typographical error means the section is not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The error will be corrected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>What is in front of us is not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The typographical error is being corrected under the relevant Standing Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is my interpretation of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Although I could do so, I will not press the matter at this stage.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister&rsquo;s comments regarding matters of a sensitive nature and so on. The penalties for those who are found to have abused the <Col N="2445"/>system in this regard must be clarified because we cannot have a situation where files go missing or are mislaid. However, in a situation where it has been announced that there will be a search of a particular Garda station, what is to prevent a person who does not want a specific file to be seen for moving it to the location where the sensitive information is stored and to which the ombudsman commission is denied access? It will be difficult to address this matter. Senator Maurice Hayes&rsquo;s suggestion would seem to have met the requirements in this regard.</P>
      <P>I am mindful of what the Minister has said about the difficulties in regard to outsiders accessing documents. Where information on informers and others are concerned, such a scenario would not be desirable. Interpretation of this provision may be open to abuse. The main difficulty is the one I have mentioned in regard to a file being moved to the part of the station which is out of bounds for the ombudsman commission or the inspectors. There is nothing to stop such a file being subsequently put back in place and if a complaint is made in such an instance, the ombudsman commission may be able to obtain it at a later date. However, it should the case that there is total access or none. The notion that only part of a station can be open complicates the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>This issue was the subject of lengthy debate during our previous discussion of the Bill. Everybody wants to see a situation where investigations by the ombudsman commission can not in any way be thwarted by the concealment of documents. One hopes such concealment does not happen but it is a possibility. On the other hand, we must balance this with the necessity of ensuring State security. The Minister gave one example in this regard and there are others that could be given.</P>
      <P>One solution might be to devise a system in regulations or otherwise whereby a chief superintendent is obliged to certify to the ombudsman commission that he or she is satisfied that any area declared off bounds to the commission does not contain any information relevant to its investigation. Furthermore, the non-disclosure of any relevant information, for whatever reason, should also be certified and a false certification should be an offence warranting dismissal. I am not sure how often investigations necessitate the searching of stations. One hopes it does not arise frequently. The solution I have suggested may be one way of building an additional safeguard into the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision is improved by the stipulation that the Minister should have to issue directions specifying the part of a document storage facility or Garda station that may be searched. However, the wording of the provision is somewhat confusing. My understanding of the original provision was that the Minister could allow an entire document storage facility to be <Col N="2446"/>searched and that directions were issued to place limitations in this regard. The new provision implies the Minister can make decisions about only part of a document storage facility. On the other hand, one could argue that the definition of &ldquo;part&rdquo; also includes &ldquo;all&rdquo;. I pick up on these types of issues because I studied English in college.</P>
      <P>This is a provision that may need to be reviewed. I acknowledge the points the Minister made about the difficulties in regard to outsiders accessing documents. The most important aspect of the ombudsman commission is that it is supposed to consist of trusted officials. The members are not outsiders but representatives of the people. I accept the Minister&rsquo;s point about the issues in regard to members of outside forces being seconded to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and having sight of documents. However, this could be addressed without allowing these provisions to go as far as they do.</P>
      <P>Senator Walsh&rsquo;s suggestion that Garda superintendents should certify that there is no information in which the ombudsman commission has an interest is inadequate. The purpose of the ombudsman commission is to investigate the working of the Garda and maladministration therein. Its members cannot necessarily accept the word of any garda, regardless of rank.</P>
      <P>In regard to the security situation, one must consider recent events in Donegal. All the material examined by the Morris tribunal in its first module, which examined the planting of explosives and so on, came under the heading of so-called State security. The point that it could be abused has been made by everybody. It needs to be reviewed in the future. It will be part of the legislation now but it will have to be revisited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a difficult task to balance these two interests. I have done my best but I am impressed by Senator Walsh&rsquo;s point that, under the general power to make disciplinary regulations, it appears that procedures could easily be put in place &mdash; subject to discussion with the Attorney General &mdash; for a system of vouching and counter-signature by another member of the force. Another superintendent could be brought in from outside to vouch for a matter. An arrangement of this kind might be made in order to minimise the capacity to abuse this loophole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Minister to discuss group 13, concerning the appointment of judges to oversee the commission&rsquo;s investigations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Group 13 concerns the subject matter of amendments Nos. 117 and 118. These are technical amendments. They arise from my correspondence with the Chief Justice with regard to the provisions in the Bill as it stands, which permit me to appoint a judge to inquire. This is being changed to &ldquo;invite a judge to inquire (while serving as a judge)&rdquo;. Amendment No. 118 concerns the replacement of the existing subsection (2) with the form of wording set out in the <Col N="2447"/>amendment. The emphasis of both amendments is on judges being invited, in the first instance, to conduct an inquiry and then being appointed. The Chief Justice made the point that it was inconsistent with the independence of the Judiciary that judges could be seconded by me without being invited to agree to the proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>We fully support the two amendments. They make eminent sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no difficulty with the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I, like other Senators, have no objection to these. However, the response from the Chief Justice reminds me of the need to make the Judiciary subject to some sort of overarching body in terms of its conduct. The Minister might usefully investigate the system in operation in Massachusetts, where a commission oversees consistency of decisions and judicial conduct. Given some of the events that occurred here, this could be usefully investigated. Nobody wants political interference but it operates effectively there. I was personally impressed by the structure and the explanation we received from a member of the supreme court. We also met the Chief Justice of Massachusetts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Walsh will be interested to learn that we are currently drafting judicial conduct legislation with the co-operation of the Judiciary, the views of which we are taking on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Minister to discuss group 14, the final group concerning joint policing committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 38 to 50, inclusive, are comprehended by this group. Senators will no doubt recall the long discussions we had in this House on the joint policing provisions of the Bill. As I said afterwards, these provisions are all the better for the changes made in the House.</P>
      <P>I brought forward further changes on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il . The first concerns a recommendation, contained in the report by the Oireachtas Joint Committee Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights following its hearings on community policing in Ireland, that the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs should also be consulted on guidelines establishing the joint policing committees. The committee&rsquo;s recommendation was brought to my attention by Deputy Costello on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il. The inclusion of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in the consultation process recognises the role of that Department in building capacity at local community level.</P>
      <P>The issue addressed by amendment No. 43 was the subject of debate on Committee Stage in the <Col N="2448"/>D&aacute;il, when it was indicated that consideration should be given to the question of laying the guidelines concerning the establishment and maintenance of joint policing committees by local authorities and the Garda Commissioner before the Oireachtas. I looked at the matter and took the view that they should be so laid and that is now provided for.</P>
      <P>The background to amendments Nos. 45 and 46 is that the Bill in its original form provided that the setting up by joint policing committees of local policing fora could only be done with the consent of the Garda Commissioner. This was to guard against unreasonable expectations and the proliferation of this tier of community policing.</P>
      <P>Having advanced and withdrawn one formulation for addressing this issue on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il, I indicated that I would look again at some other mechanism to prevent undue proliferation of policing fora. With this in mind, I brought forward an amendment on Report Stage which provided that the establishment of such fora would be a matter for consultation with the local Garda superintendent. This is in line with recommendation 13 in the report of the Oireachtas joint committee on community policing, as pointed out to me by Deputy Costello.</P>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 47, I agreed in response to a point made by Deputy Costello in the D&aacute;il that section 32(2)(<i>d</i>), as amended in committee, was possibly a little too restrictive in that it only provided for the local policing fora to make recommendations to the joint policing committee concerning the matters referred to in what was then section 32(2)(<i>a</i>) rather than those in subsection 32(2)(<i>b</i>). I remedied that on Report Stage by allowing the local policing fora to make recommendations on the matters contained in what is now section 36(2)(<i>b</i>), on which the joint policing committee is to advise the local authority concerned and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
      <P>I mentioned on Committee Stage that I wanted to have an emergency brake procedure in terms of the establishment of local policing fora if the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has reservations about its capacity to service every local committee. After all, we agree generally that garda&iacute; on the beat and on the streets are highly desirable. I do not want them overburdened with servicing local committees to the detriment of a visible policing presence. I indicated that I would confer on the Minister of the day the right to resolve disputes on whether a forum should be created as it would be advisable in my opinion to provide for some form of mediation where there is disagreement.</P>
      <P>Having considered the matter, I decided to make such provision on Report Stage. The Bill now provides that, in circumstances where any dispute arises over the establishment of a local policing forum, the joint policing committee must submit the dispute to the Minister who will consult with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Minister for Community, Gaeltacht and Rural Affairs. The <Col N="2449"/>Minister&rsquo;s decision on the matter will be final. This is part of my approach to ensure that the local policing fora do not become victims of their own success and expand to such a point that they might become unworkable by placing an unreasonable burden on Garda resources.</P>
      <P>On amendment No. 41, the chairman of the National Crime Council impressed upon me the need to consider providing for the appointment on the joint policing committees of representatives of local community interests. I discussed this issue at great length in this House. Accordingly, I tabled an amendment to section 31, which provides for the establishment of joint policing committees, to insert the appropriate reference in subsection (2)(<i>b</i>)(v) which is now: &ldquo;such other persons (including persons representing local community interests) as may be provided for in the guidelines,&rdquo;. That is a fair compromise on the matter. One may hold a purist view, as was discussed in this House, or the opposite view. This is a reasonable balance of the two views.</P>
      <P>Section 33(1) places a duty on a local authority &ldquo;to have regard to the need to take such steps as may be practicable to assist in the reduction of crime, disorder and anti-social behaviour within its area of responsibility.&rdquo; During the debate in the Dail this wording came in for some criticism and I requested that Parliamentary Counsel re-examine the provision, after which it was amended accordingly.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 49 concerns statements made without malice. Section 32(5), as passed by the Seanad, provides that any statement made without malice during a meeting of the joint policing committee or any sub-committee is privileged, as is any subsequent publication of that statement. Following the Report Stage debate in this House, a question arose with regard to the matter of privilege in the context of its application to subsequent statements. The point was made that if a public accusation was made against another person and at a subsequent meeting the allegation was withdrawn, the idea that someone else would be able to publish what had happened originally without reference to the withdrawal of privilege would be unacceptable. I said that I would address the matter in the D&aacute;il and this was the purpose of this amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 38, 39 and 44 are technical drafting amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of information, may I inquire as to progress?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are discussing the final group of amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>This morning it was agreed on the Order of Business that we would cease our deliberations on this matter at 1.30 p.m. I wish to propose an amendment to the Order of Business that we continue with this matter until 2 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="2450"/>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister stated, this House addressed that entire area at length.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 43 states the Minister shall cause a copy of guidelines to be issued. When will these guidelines become available? Amendment No. 41 allows for the inclusion of persons representing local community interests. That was also discussed at length and we made the case that public representatives represent local community interests. It is needless to pursue that point. I am delighted the Minister dealt with the matter raised in amendment No. 49 with regard to statements at public fora as he stated he would do so. I agree with many of the amendments made and do not see the point in harping on about issues we already raised on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no problems with the amendments proposed. Senator Cummins made a point on amendment No. 41. The Minister originally allowed for persons representing local community interests to be involved. To keep people happy, including people in my own party, he introduced this wording to clarify it. I feel strongly on this matter. Many people who pushed this seemed to forget that publicly elected representatives, such as ourselves and county councillors, represent local community interests. That is what we do. We are democratically elected. We do not go along to a meeting attended by ten people to get elected. We run for election where every registered elector in the community has a vote. That point must be made. Local partnership groups argue that local community representation is necessary. They seem to forget that open and accountable elections take place whereby people can vote for candidates. That is far more accountable than any other election process, such as the community fora. That being said I accept that local fora are beneficial.</P>
      <P>The Minister had the foresight from the outset to see the benefits of having Oireachtas Members on these committees. An amendment was made thanks to input by Senator Leyden to include Senators. That is a positive aspect and I look forward to the possibility of being involved. Senator O&rsquo;Toole mentioned that Oireachtas Members are kept off many boards as if they will somehow contaminate them by their presence. Perhaps this was brought in as part of the abolition of the dual mandate and now one cannot have an Oireachtas Member on any local board. The Minister did not see it that way in this legislation, which shows foresight on his part and that of his officials and staff. This House argued that these committees could be based on local area or town committees. That might be the way to proceed as opposed to basing them on county councils or county development boards. All in all I agree with the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>On the latter point, I have witnessed a perceived bias of a small section of the public service against politicians. I have seen <Col N="2451"/>councillors and Oireachtas Members being excluded and, unfortunately, Ministers who are not in charge of their brief go along with it. We are fortunate that does not apply to the Minister with us today.</P>
      <P>I am unhappy with two of the amendments. Amendment No. 41 inserted the phrase &ldquo;(including persons representing local community interests)&rdquo;. The only people I know of who represent local community interests in general are elected public representatives. Community-based specific interest groups do effective work, and I do not state that they should not be involved. However, they should not be involved in joint policing committees, be that a popular or unpopular statement. I also have strong reservations about amendment No. 48, which deals with the Minister being the person to ultimately make a decision if a dispute arises.</P>
      <P>Overall this is amazingly good legislation. The joint policing committee was one of the positive innovative aspects the Minister introduced in the Bill. We had a major debate on that matter and I do not want to rehash it. What I have seen since that debate confirms rather than changes the views I held on the joint policing committee. It can be a forum for dialogue and partnership between local authority members, Oireachtas Members and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It is the first tier of accountability for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I am more convinced than ever of the real need for such a structure. We have a clear choice. Either those who have been mandated by the people to represent them engage with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the joint policing committee where the actions and performance of garda&iacute; will, in time, become part of what will be discussed by that committee, or we broaden it to a catch-all involving many types of interest groups. Undoubtedly the discussions will be on the specific activities of those interest groups. The element of accountability would be impossible to implement as part of that structure. I discussed that matter with senior garda&iacute; who felt it would be difficult for them to be forthcoming with answers and information in a broadened committee. That dynamic could exist with an elected group with responsibilities, such as councillors and Oireachtas Members who operate under a code of ethics.</P>
      <P>I will make an analogy in local government with the strategic policy committees and the area committees. I have yet to meet a councillor who will state the strategic policy committees, which involve outside community representatives from various organisations, are in any way as effective as the area committees made up exclusively of officials and politicians. The Minister should examine and analyse that analogy. Joint policing committees made up exclusively of elected members and garda&iacute; should be set up in some areas to examine how they function. An essential element of accountability would be injected into the process.</P><Col N="2452"/><?oasys _cl10.5-?>
      <P>We should not set up the committees and see how they get on. The Department should plan them and hold properly conducted seminars to advise councillors, Oireachtas Members and garda&iacute; on how they should operate, interact and function, and on the powers of the committee. Future members of the committees should be provided with that background. Through the fora communities can actively interact with the entire system and structure. That is where community groups relevant to the subject matter can be fully and actively involved. I would leave it to the local representatives and garda&iacute; to make a decision on people from public authorities, community groups or other persons provided for in the guidelines being involved with the joint policing committee. Circumstances may arise where they would regard the involvement of a certain person or group as a positive factor in the operation of the whole process but that local knowledge is essential to making that decision rather than it being done centrally in the Department by the Minister. I regret that I am not fully in agreement with the Minister but we have ploughed through this issue previously. I feel strongly about it and my only interest is the effective implementation of this measure. It has tremendous potential and I would not like to see that potential blunted in some way because of structural changes, and I am aware much campaigning has been going on in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very grateful to the Senators for the supportive remarks they made. I would make the point to Senator Jim Walsh that he won the war, effectively. He may not like the exact terms of the peace treaty at the end of the war but he won the war in the sense that when I came into this House with this Bill about a year ago, the model was radically different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>It was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened carefully to what was said here and it accorded with my own hunches that we were going down the wrong track then and we have switched to the right track.</P>
      <P>On the guidelines, it is to be noted that section 36(1) of the Bill as it now stands states that a local authority and the Garda Commissioner shall arrange for the establishment of a joint policing committee in accordance with guidelines issues under section 35. Once this section comes in, it is a positive duty. It is not something that may happen or whatever. It must be done.</P>
      <P>The guidelines will have to be elaborated on, and that is by no means an easy task. One of the functions Senator Maurice Hayes&rsquo;s committee will be forcing the Department to do is ensure it is working on these guidelines and that this work is not pushed back because it is difficult. It is difficult. It is almost a piece of legislation in its own right.</P>
   
      <P>I am minded, however, bearing in mind what Senator Jim Walsh said, to include in the guidelines a possibility to select between different models. That may be the way forward. It may not <Col N="2453"/>be the case that one size suits all. It may be the case that in some areas his purest version of politicians only and garda&iacute; is the right way but it may be that in other areas there is a developed social infrastructure about which Padraic White, the chairman of the National Crime Council, spoke. It is possible to envisage guidelines which would have models A, B, C and D, for instance, and to let the local community and local garda&iacute; select one or other of those models as they see fit. Otherwise, I will be in a position where everyone is saying I got the wrong solution whereas if I offer the local authority a choice of solutions to match its area it may make sense.</P>

	<P>As long as it is not the county manager.</P>

	<P>I am talking about the members of a local authority.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Some areas may have very active chambers of commerce with business improvement district arrangements in place but that may not be the case in other areas. I do not want to mention a town in case it has an active chamber of commerce but councils in some areas do not have developed infrastructure of that kind. I want to put guidelines in place that offer a menu of choices, thereby allowing people to make a decision which is best suited to their own particular needs.</P>
      <P>Senator Walsh said this was the first level of accountability and in a sense that is true but I wish to emphasise a point I made when the Bill <Col N="2454"/>was on Committee Stage in this House. The intention is not that the local authority members will be able to lecture the garda&iacute;. Local authorities have a duty, and they now have a solemn duty under this Act, to get their own acts together. The garda&iacute; now have a forum in which they ask the local authority what it is doing about the state of a block of flats, for example, or the inadequate provision of an indoor football pitch for the youth in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>And the Minister will provide the money straightaway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Local authorities sometimes say they have no money but they often get money for projects about which many people would be slightly sceptical. They can always find money for many projects when it suits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>They will probably do a lot better than the National Aquatic Centre.</P>

	<P>The Minister, without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I will conclude on that note. I believe we have the balance just about right. I realise Senator Jim Walsh believes I have moved back somewhat from my earlier position but I will keep him happy by putting different models of local policing committees into the guidelines to allow people choose from a menu of models which are best suited to their own needs and give local authorities that degree of initiative in choosing the appropriate model for their area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for the time he has given to the debate in the House. On this side of the House we were very disappointed that the legislation was not recommitted to Committee Stage in the other House. That prevented us from dealing with many amendments the Fine Gael Party wanted to put forward. This Bill is the most important legislation dealing with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na since the foundation of the force. Despite the major faults and failings, especially those outlined in the Morris report, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The Senator cannot go back over the subject matter of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;served the State well in protecting the citizens and the institutions of the State. Many members of the force have given their lives in this cause. The Bill must be seen as a new beginning, a new challenge and a new era of transparency. To that end, we welcome the Bill. It presents a new challenge, which the force will be capable of meeting. We wish to thank the Minister for giving of his time. We also thank the Minister&rsquo;s officials for the time and effort put into this technical legislation. We also thank the various associations involved in consultations on this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the enactment of this legislation. It received a tremendous airing and I thank the Minster for introducing the Bill in this House. It was teased out over quite a period of time. As Senator Cummins has noted, the Bill is a major reform of the legislative system underpinning the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>We have covered matters such as the joint policing committees, a partnership between members of local government, Members of the Oireachtas, and the garda&iacute;, the inspectorate and the provisions for the ombudsman. While there may be disagreement on the detail it must be said that overall the Bill will make a significant contribution to underpinning the operations of the force in the future. For this, the Minister and his officials deserve credit and our commendation. I look forward to the full implementation of this legislation. That the Minister has set up an overarching committee to ensure its early implementation is indicative to his absolute commitment to this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>There are many positive measures in this Bill. Unfortunately, my colleagues had to vote against it as there were fundamental matters that were not dealt with. These include an independent Garda authority and a single ombudsman.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="2456"/>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot deal with the contents of the Bill at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that and I was not going to elaborate on those points. If one wanted to tackle the matters raised by the Morris report&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We have discussed these matters during the course of the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I am responding to the Bill overall. I believe the structure of an independent authority would be needed to radically reform the force. The Minister would have demonstrated innovation if he had gone that far. He was not prepared to go as far as many other jurisdictions have gone in responding to a crisis in policing in their countries. We have had a crisis, as have many other open, democratic societies, and the manner in which one addresses it demonstrates how able one is to deal with that crisis. The Minister has shown some ability in that regard but not all that is required to build confidence in our police force, with the public on board. Similarly, with the ombudsman&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot discuss the subject matter of what has been agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of that and am not revisiting those issues but this Bill does not include an ombudsman in the true sense of the word. The Minister did not review it in light of the Morris tribunal, he merely tacked something on to the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>All of these matters have already been discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>To conclude on a positive note I believe the joint policing committees are the most positive measures in this Bill. These will build confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and I hope they are widespread. It is the one measure in the Bill that the Minister will be able to claim credit for and he will be remembered for it.</P>
      <P>I agree with the point made by Senator Jim Walsh that the composition of these boards should be as democratic as possible. I would have preferred that it had been done in that way. When the Minister is drawing up his regulations he should consider the situation in the North where these positions were advertised. One does not want the situation that exists with SPCs where one is not reaching out to a mass of people in seeking candidates. It is often a group of ten people in a room who may or may not be representative. In the North the positions are advertised and anyone can apply. The Minister should consider this when drawing up regulations.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister and his staff. The Members of this House teased out this Bill and made a positive input. The Minister responded well to our points and the Bill has been improved <Col N="2457"/>by the input of the Seanad, as the Minister has stated.</P>

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, to the House. Amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, and Nos. 4 and 6 form a composite proposal and will be discussed together by agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 3, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;(2) In this Act, the &lsquo;Act of 1992&rsquo; means the Electoral Act 1992.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">During the last local elections and previously in the general election it came to the attention of many of us that there is quite an amount of fraud with regard to the electoral register. Two weeks ago a report in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> alleged that there were 800,000 names on the electoral register that did not have a vote. These were names of people who were either deceased or, as happens in many cases, names which were duplicated.</P>
      <P>My proposal, which is an aside to the independent commission on the boundaries, is that the Minister should give serious consideration to introducing phased legislation to attach the vote to a person&rsquo;s PPS number. The PPS system is <Col N="2458"/>already in place and it would not complicate the system too much to ask that electoral registers be replicated on the basis of those numbers throughout the country. This is already happening to good effect in the Six Counties.</P>
      <P>In the last local election a gentleman telephoned me two hours before the booths closed to tell me he had five votes and to ask where he should vote. He had votes in Letterkenny and in the Glenties and Milford areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Does he vote for the Senator?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>As I was not on the ticket I was not in a position to give him advice on that aspect, but I did advise him to vote only once. It is not illegal to be on the register so many times. I know the example I have given is an extreme one, but it does happen. We have an opportunity to change that today if we consider this sensibly. I discussed the matter with the Leader before this debate began. I ask the Minister to look at it sensibly. I have proposed these amendments because we need to instill confidence in the electorate. A gentleman informed me after the last local election that the postal votes of three elderly people had been intercepted and used. An investigation was carried out, but we had no way of proving anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>That is another example. I ask the Minister to give this matter serious consideration, in the interests of instilling confidence in the electorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Roche, to the House. Like Senator McHugh, I am perturbed by the state of the electoral register in the various constituencies. I have first-hand knowledge of my own constituency, but other politicians have told me about the position in their constituencies. I am not sure that I agree with the suggestion in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> that there are approximately 800,000 discrepancies in the electoral register.</P>
      <P>I do not doubt that there is no proper method of ensuring that people&rsquo;s names are included on the register. There was a time when rate collectors called from door to door to ascertain whether, since the last time they had called, anyone in each house had passed the age of 18, died or moved to another address. They compiled the various material on the basis of the facts they acquired. Many years have passed since that procedure was last completed. Nobody is now charged with collecting the data for the national register.</P>
      <P>It is not good enough to refer to the frenzied advertisements which advise one to go to the local Garda station if one wants to be registered as an elector. When I sent two young women to a Garda station in such circumstances, they were sent packing by a garda who said &ldquo;I know nothing <Col N="2459"/>about that&rdquo;. When they went to the civic offices in the town hall, as the advertisements in question suggested, they encountered a girl in the customer care department who also said she knew nothing about that. Nobody is attending to the electoral register. The county seat of County Westmeath is Mullingar &mdash; it should be Athlone, but that is another point. People in Athlone who want to check whether they are on the electoral register must travel 30 miles because they know they will be given an obtuse answer over the telephone.</P>
      <P>A dramatic initiative needs to be taken to update the national electoral register. It is not correct to state that the turnout in a certain constituency was 49% or 52% because the register has not been updated. My political team took a dramatic initiative, of the type that is needed on this occasion, in the Athlone area before a general election in the late 1980s. We went through the various registers to draw up a list of those who should not have been on them because they had died or moved to another location. When we gave the list to a court, on 18 December of the year in question, the names were deleted from the register.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is right for politicians to have to resort to engaging in the massive amount of work involved in updating the electoral register. One can be accused of deleting names which should remain on the register. On the occasion to which I have referred, a man wrote us a letter to say he was going to take us to court for removing his name from the register. He said that his name should not have been deleted because he was still alive, but I do not know what he was worried about because he was living in County Kildare.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to outline the ideas and initiatives which have been proposed in this regard within the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. A massive reorganisation of the electoral register is needed. Changes are needed when people sadly pass away, move to another area or celebrate their 18th birthday. When one is canvassing during the last week of an election campaign, it can be quite saddening to find that one would get six votes in a house if the people living there were registered. It is too late to register new electors at that stage. In such circumstances, the people who are not registered sometimes turn on the person who is looking for their votes. They blame the candidate for their absence from the register. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say about this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a serious issue. The integrity of the register of electors is central to the integrity of the democratic system. If the discrepancies in the register are of the variety and quantity that has been reported, we have something serious to worry about. Perhaps the Minister can take this opportunity to put some information on the record of the House.</P><Col N="2460"/>
      <P>I am familiar with the system used by Dublin City Council to check whether people are on the register of electors and whether they are still living in the house in which they are registered. The council lets the matter sit for a couple of years. If it does not receive a return from a person in a given year, it will not take him or her off the register until it has received a return from another person living at that address. If a person does not make a return for a number of years, the council will eventually remove him or her from the register.</P>
      <P>Have local authorities been given any guidelines on how to guarantee the integrity of the register of electors? Is a particular mechanism used throughout the country? Do all the local authorities use the same sort of procedure? Do they just make it up as they go along? I suspect the latter is the case.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether we should develop a system based on PPS numbers. It seems to me there must be an electronic means of maintaining a national database. I assume there is no national database at present. I imagine that the register of electors is based on local authority areas or constituencies. Surely there is a case for a national database that makes it possible to check whether a person is registered to vote in two different constituencies, or to vote several times in the same constituency. It is obvious that such a database would require some form of identification of individuals. Perhaps people can be identified on the basis of their PPS numbers. There may be an argument in favour of issuing ID cards which are specific to this purpose.</P>
      <P>As I said on Second Stage yesterday, an argument can be made in favour of allowing people to vote at any polling station. If a person presents himself or herself at any polling station, with a valid ID number that indicates he or she is registered to vote in a particular constituency, he or she should be allowed to cast his or her vote there. By doing that, we would make it easier for people to vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Electronic voting would make that possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Regardless of the merits of using electronic voting machines, an argument can be made in favour of using electronic systems to clean up the register of electors and to allow people to vote at any polling station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not believe that we should make it much easier for an elector to acquire a postal vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>We are entitled to demand that people make the effort to present themselves at a polling station. If one is in County Kerry for the <Col N="2461"/>weekend, I do not suppose that it really matters if one calls to the polling station in Sneem to vote in Dublin North-Central, or <i>vice versa</i>. This is a real issue. I ask the Minister to take this opportunity to outline the extent, in his opinion, of the discrepancies on the register of electors. Recent press reports, which I hope are exaggerated, are a source of disquiet. While there have been instances of fraud, my instinct is that most discrepancies are caused by people being registered at two locations by accident. People seek to be registered when they move to a new constituency, but they do not actively cancel their registration at their previous address.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I imagine that the best means of ensuring the register of electors is accurate is to use some type of electronic system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Rourke&rsquo;s comments about the need for a new and better system of compiling the electoral register. Such a system is necessary if we are to ensure people are not omitted from the register. We need to prevent people from registering to vote five times, as in the case mentioned by Senator McHugh. Rate collectors, who are often much-maligned, no longer have a role in this regard. Not only did the collectors call from house to house, but many of them called to primary schools to get details of people who had left the school five or six years earlier and might still have been living in the area.</P>
      <P>We need to consider a different way of compiling the register. Senator Browne has suggested a system based on ID cards. Under such a system, a person who is working in Dublin would be able to vote for a candidate in Carlow or Galway, for example. I suggested during the Second Stage debate that a data collection form, similar to the census form, could be distributed to every house so that all residents over the age of 18 could be registered to vote. Although the current system is quite tolerant &mdash; it allows people to register until three weeks before the polling date &mdash; the register of electors continues to have many errors. Many people are disappointed to find in the last week of an election campaign that they are not registered to vote. We need to try to find a way of improving the entire system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>We should consider allowing people who are going on holidays to apply for a temporary postal vote. When elections are held in May or June, many people are unable to vote because they have already planned to go on holidays for a period of time that includes the polling date. We should consider giving temporary postal votes to people who can submit travel vouchers showing that they have booked flights and consequently will be out of the country on the date in question. As such people pay taxes, they are as entitled to vote as anyone else. I share the concerns which have been expressed about <Col N="2462"/>extending the postal voting system, which is open to widespread fraud. However, people should be allowed to apply for a temporary postal vote in the circumstances I have outlined.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator McHugh that the use of the PPS number is the only way to update the register of electors. I understand that everyone is given a unique PPS number, which they keep for the rest of their lives, at the age of 16. Given that one can scan every product in a supermarket, it should be possible for polling stations to have a machine which would scan PPS cards. This would make it possible to double check who voted so that no one can vote twice. If Senator Kitt is in Carlow during the presidential election, he should be able to enter a Carlow polling station to cast his vote. Where he is located in the country should make no difference. He should not have to be in Galway to cast his vote. If, in the European elections, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke is in Carlow, she should be able to cast her vote there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>The tally would be all wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps. However, we will counteract that. In the case of the presidential or European elections, if one is within one&rsquo;s D&aacute;il constituency, one should be able to vote. Local elections are different because one must vote in a specified area. We should examine the advantages of the PPS number system.</P>
      <P>On the question of notifying people who are being removed from the voting register, they should get a letter from the Courts Service stating they will be removed, and it would be up to them to appear at a court hearing. However, this is not happening. People are being removed from the register and the first they know of it is when they do not receive their polling card. I presume death certificates are issued when people die, therefore, it would make sense if the agency involved passed on the information to the relevant local authority so that the person could be removed from the register. This might avoid duplication. This area needs to be tightened up. This would also be fair to politicians who are using registers which are out-of-date and factually incorrect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
	<P>Many important points have been made. The big problem is that at best, 60% of the electorate in an area will cast their vote and 40% will not bother to do so. We have all been involved for many years in trying to improve the register at local authority level, and we still do not appear to have got it right. Given the huge developments that have taken place over the past five years, with new housing estates and apartments being built and new families coming into areas, much work needs to be done on the register prior to the next election.</P>
      <P>We can say what we like about electronic voting, but there is a strong case to be made for people who have a PPS card to be able to vote. Technology nowadays is so advanced that one should be able to use the card to vote just once. <Col N="2463"/>Voters should be recognised at their polling station and they should not be able to use the card a second time. Whether we like it or not, we will have to move in the direction of electronic voting.</P>
      <P>There are real problems with the voting register and something must be done to improve it. Many important points have been made by Senators. Postal voting was referred to. People who are on holidays should have a right to a postal vote. Likewise, people who must work away from home for their company have a right to a postal vote. People are so mobile nowadays that they do not know whether they will be at home or away on election day. If these people are on the voting register, they should be able to secure a postal vote within a day or two. If they are on the list of postal votes, they cannot exercise that right personally in the polling station.</P>
      <P>We must provide people with more opportunities to vote. I welcome the change to Friday voting. What is wrong with Saturday voting, weekend voting or voting over two days, which would give people an opportunity to exercise their right? A large percentage of people who do not vote are unable to do so because of work commitments or whatever. This aspect must be examined. We will have an opportunity over the next two years to ensure that local authorities correct the register. Given the changes that are taking place in towns and so on, postmen find it confusing when they try to locate people. If this is allowed to continue, there will be real problems during the next election campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with what has been said. In fairness to the Minister, the issues we are raising in these amendments might be worthy of a more lengthy debate in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government. I hope the Minister will be in a position over the next 12 months to introduce another electoral amendment Bill to deal with these specific issues. There are two aspects to this, first, getting the register correct and, second, ease of voting.</P>
      <P>I agree with what my colleagues said in regard to the register of voters. In politics, we are much too easily led by conspiratorial-type theories. I have seen the names of people who might be 80 or 90 years of age disappear from the register on a once-off basis. Presumably it is a print error, but it is unfortunate for the people involved. If the media reports referred to by Senator McHugh and Senator O&rsquo;Rourke are correct, it is a matter which requires an indepth investigation. We will probably have to proceed along the lines suggested by Senator Browne and others that the PPS number, which every citizen possesses, could be used in this regard.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Moylan&rsquo;s remarks regarding postal votes for people on holidays. Last year, I wrote to the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor in this regard, to which I received a negative reply. I appreciate <Col N="2464"/>that the extension of postal voting must be examined closely. The system appeared to be a great idea during the British general election until it got underway. Between 15% and 20% of the entire electorate in some constituencies had postal votes, which gave rise to some suspicions. During an election campaign, it is disappointing to meet people who would like to vote before going on holidays. Perhaps we can examine some type of controlled system to deal with this issue. While we will not find an answer to these questions today, perhaps the Minister will examine the whole system of registration, access to voting and extending in a reasonable fashion postal voting. He might consider bringing the issue before us by way of additional legislation in a few months&rsquo; time. It is important for the Oireachtas to try to ensure that in a functioning democracy people who are entitled to vote are registered and those who wish to vote, no matter where they are located on election day, are given the opportunity to do so.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I wish to repeat what I said on Second Stage in that putting in place a voting window of perhaps a day and half should be considered. I suggested that voting for national elections should begin at 5 p.m. on Friday and continue until 10 p.m. and it should take place all day Saturday. During the local elections last year, the voting trend appeared to increase. However, the general trend over the past 20 years is that the numbers of people voting has decreased. If this is to be reversed, we must try to facilitate people to the maximum. We have tried voting on Wednesdays and Fridays. The Tipperary South by-election took place on Saturday, which was quite successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Did we try Sunday?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I made the point yesterday that if we had an election in Cork or Tipperary last Sunday, the day of the Munster final, I would not like to try to encourage people to vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Offaly would be okay this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>A day and a half might sound somewhat optimistic but we are concerned with trying to engage the electorate and encourage turnout. We must take on board new ideas. I ask the Minister to consider this issue, in which he has had great interest and involvement because of his relevant background, in its entirety and perhaps put forward some ideas later in the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with most of the debate so far. In my own area the integrity of the electoral register is in question, particularly with regard to apartment complexes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>That is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>On the day after polling in the last local elections in my own area, 90% of polling cards remained in letterboxes. A study carried <Col N="2465"/>out some time ago revealed the average stay in an apartment to be two and a half years, meaning that in the time between general elections, at least two people could be registered to the same apartment. This is a major issue.</P>
      <P>The Leader remembered the days in which a registered canvas could be done. In many cases, much money has been expended on security for these apartments and it is almost impossible for canvassers to get in. If they do get in, canvassers are asked to leave because the complex is private. This issue exists not only in major cities but in towns and villages around the country where apartment blocks are becoming prevalent.</P>
      <P>Everybody has heard anecdotal reports of people being registered and polling cards being collected on polling day. It is very difficult for any political party to physically check genuine voters against potential fraudsters. The Minister and his Department have examined this for some time but whatever solution is put forward, the integrity of the register must be maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>On Senator Bradford&rsquo;s point, I have committed to producing guidelines over this summer. I suggested in the D&aacute;il that it would be a good idea to refer these guidelines to the relevant Oireachtas committee. This is one area where politicians know better than most the exact situation. Over the years, every politician has been in a position where he or she believed the register to be incorrect. They may have gone to a household the day before elections and been disappointed to find that five people are not registered to vote.</P>
      <P>We need to segment these issues and examine different elements. Three of the contributions to this debate mentioned the responsibility for compiling the electoral register. This lies with the local authorities. It is done well by some local authorities but others do it in a desultory fashion. Senator McDowell asked for a figure. According to the census of population, the number of people eligible to vote compared to the overall combined registers reveals a difference of 300,000 people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the figure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>There are 300,000 more people on the summation of all registers than are eligible to vote, according to the census. This issue is serious regardless of whether the figure is 300,000, or 800,000. The first figure is the lowest figure and the latter figure is extrapolated to take into account numbers of people who are on the register when they should not be, people who should be there and are not, and people who are deceased and may be on the register to vote for a particular candidate. The figure is serious because even if it is the lowest figure, 300,000 people of the 3.002 million on the combined voting register are on it in error. Only 2.71 million people are eligible to vote by age according to the census.</P>
      <P>I have given this issue some thought since beginning my term in this Department. I indi<Col N="2466"/>cated clearly in the D&aacute;il that I wish the guidelines to be written as I do not think that local authorities are doing their job in this respect sufficiently well. In some cases the work is excellent but in others it is appalling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister have constituency breakdowns for the figures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise but I cannot carry all the figures in my head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Are the figures available to the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>It is difficult to get them. One could extrapolate from detailed figures in the first volume of the census to work out who is eligible to vote and what the numbers should be. The results can be precise. It would be a substantial exercise to carry out and the Senator has asked a good question. If the exercise was carried out, one could then objectively highlight where the biggest errors lie with regard to local authorities.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senators Moylan and Brady&rsquo;s points, both are correct in pointing out the huge changes in living style in the State. Multi-occupancy is now at a rate not seen since the clearance of the slums. This is a reality. At one time the tenement living was the style of living in Dublin and a different style of multiple occupation is now evident. It is very difficult for some people to get into these places, and one might spend half a day talking to intercoms and not knowing exactly to whom one is talking. This frustrating experience has been had by all. In these cases and taking into account the turnover evident in apartments, it is very difficult to keep the register updated. I accept that a challenge exists on this issue and it would be foolhardy for any Minister to say otherwise.</P>
      <P>Senator Browne pointed out that it should be possible to automatically remove deceased people&rsquo;s names from the electoral register. I do not wish to sound impertinent, but this is one of the attractions of a totally electronic system which has registration, voting, etc., included on it. I do not wish to dwell on this as it is a different controversy for another day.</P>
      <P>The position in Northern Ireland has been mentioned because people there have had significant and spectacular problems with voting. Much money has been spent there to get the process right. A system that uses PPS numbers, or their equivalent, has been introduced there. Before I discuss the usage of PPS numbers I will consider some actions on this issue that have taken place in the State.</P>
      <P>Over the past 30 years, different Governments have given much time to voting and elections. Discussion has taken place on how parties are funded, and legislation has been introduced governing contributions and spending. Welcome changes have been introduced to the supplementary register that introduce a degree of flexibility. <Col N="2467"/>I agree that people going on holidays who pay taxes and are registered voters should be allowed some flexibility.</P>
      <P>The Electoral (Amendment) Act 2002, which introduced the change on the supplementary register, also brought in another change which has not been implemented on the ground. It was suggested that more attention should be paid in voting stations to who actually votes. Members know from their own experience whether I am correct to say that this has not been put into effect. The guidelines issued suggested that at least 25% of those voting should produce identity documents. I know this guideline was not observed in my constituency. I am quite certain that most of the people present here could indicate that it was not observed in their respective constituencies either. I have pointed out to officials in a voting station that a person had voted more than once. On that occasion I was told by staff that the person had been in two or three times. I indicated that the person should be challenged but he was not challenged. An electoral fraud had occurred with knowledge, and people were slightly intimidated. The polling staff are not paid a big salary and intimidation or threats of it can be real.</P>
      <P>With regard to the usage of PPS numbers, this issue is primarily a matter for the Department of Social and Family Affairs. The PPS numbers are possessed by that Minister. Legal advice must be taken on any proposals carried through on the issue. I can see the attraction, which is self-evident, but advice must be taken nonetheless. The concern of where the PPS numbers would be used is also evident. I see the attraction of the number being used when a person registers to vote, as the number is unique. Some access to the library of PPS numbers would have to be facilitated in order to counter-check them. I have queries, incidentally, about the layout of the voter registration form as it is not conducive to clarity. If a PPS number is used to register a voter, it will be a meaningless exercise unless a link between the electoral registration office and the PPS number database is provided. That should not be difficult, as it does not involve rocket science. The connection could be made but issues will be raised, which will require clearance from the Data Protection Commissioner. He has shown interest in what goes on the forms and, as a result of a number observations that were made, the forms were changed but not improved.</P>
      <P>The second issue is whether the PPS number should be used for verification at the polling station, which would be ideal in many ways. If an individual had a unique number for voting and a PPS number, in theory, particularly if electronic voting was introduced, he or she could vote anywhere in the State. We are trying to make it attractive for people to register and to make it easier to vote. On election day we are interested in our own results but we have a wider interest in democracy. If we are all interested in democracy <Col N="2468"/>as opposed to partisan results, we must make it easy for people to register.</P>
      <P>A number of years ago I acted as an international poll observer during the Nicaraguan general election following its civil war. There had been blood and mayhem in the country, yet the Organisation of American States, which organised the election campaign, engaged in voter registration up to four or five days prior to the poll. It was a traumatic period in the life of that nation. However, if that could be done in Nicaragua, why can it not be done in Ireland? We must make it easier for people to vote and we must make sure the voter register is audited so those who should not be on it are removed.</P>
      <P>I refer to the issue of security. If a PPS number was used to audit whether the person presenting at the polling station was entitled to vote, it would have attractions but it would also raise issues regarding how that procedure should be handled. The best way to ensure people who present are entitled to vote is to check their identification but an on-line connection between the polling station and the PPS number database will be necessary. A random check of 25% of those presenting is a better way to go.</P>
      <P>I am pleased with the debate. During Question Time in the D&aacute;il earlier this week, I stated I was open to suggestions from all political parties on this issue. Amendments to the register cannot be introduced without cross-party consensus because it is central to democracy. It is not a partisan electoral issue, about which we should gouge each other. However, we should combine all the experience of Members in both Houses to resolve this problem. My Department will encourage local authorities to take voter registration more seriously but improved guidelines and arrangements must be put in place to ensure the current scenario does not recur.</P>
      <P>Senator McDowell referred to figures. Whether the register is 300,000 or 800,000 in error, it is wrong. We should not be in this position in the 21st century, given all the available technology. It is absolutely appalling, as Senator O&rsquo;Rourke stated, that having been advised to attend a Garda station, people are told by garda&iacute; they know nothing about voter registration. Such an offhand attitude, whether it manifests itself in a council office or a Garda station, is unacceptable and it is utterly appalling. Those who pay taxes are our bosses and we should serve them. That attitude is not good enough.</P>
      <P>All local authorities should make the voting register available on-line so it can be scrutinised. Many people use the Internet, particularly young people like those who approached Senator Bradford, and we should encourage them to vote. If they could access the voting register electronically, they could forward a note to the local authority saying, &ldquo;My name is X, my address is Y and my telephone number is Z. Please let me have a voter registration form and I will register&rdquo;. Addressing these issues does not involve rocket science. There has been a lack of willingness to <Col N="2469"/>take them on board but I am willing to do so. I am willing to work in unison with parties and politicians across the spectrum because that is the best way to resolve this issue. We all have an interest in doing so.</P>
      <P>Slackness on the part of local authorities has crept in in recent years. Previously, a grant was provided to upgrade the register. The Government then decided, following the achievement of political consensus, that a general grant would be provided to local authorities to given them flexibility rather than ring-fencing allocations for different sections, as had been the case. The updating of the register is supposed to be undertaken with that grant but I suspect it is being done on a desultory basis.</P>
      <P>Voter registration is a lively issue among Members across the political spectrum. If local authorities cannot clean up the mess, I am determined to examine alternative measures to ensure the register is properly updated. If the arrangements in place are not working, we must find out why that is case, whether they can be fixed and, if not, we must examine ways to do the job better. The amendments address a fruitful issue to which we should return in the autumn. I am willing to take up Senator Bradford&rsquo;s request to ask the relevant committee to discuss the issue. We will have a much better system if we combine our knowledge in this area. I thank Senator McHugh for the amendments but he will fully understand I cannot accept them under this legislation. He has given us much food for thought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister. We have commenced the debate on this issue. I had intended to pursue a division but I acknowledge the Minister&rsquo;s frankness and openness in engaging in this debate and I will withdraw my amendments.</P>
      <P>However, local authorities are severely underresourced and do not have the personnel to maintain the electoral register. It is important to recognise this fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Whatever excuse local authorities make this year, they cannot say they are broke because they have received handsome increases. The issue is not resources but whether people are enthusiastic and willing to introduce new technology to do the job they should be doing. If a business was faced with the task of updating the register, it would not use the system operated by local authorities. I do not wish to be down on local authorities. However, a number of them take this job seriously and do it well whereas others do not take it seriously and do an appalling job.</P>
      <P>The variation in the register is not explicable in terms of a lack of funding or personnel, given the increased funding that has been provided. It is a matter of will, not means. Up to a few years ago local authorities were allocated a specific grant for voter registration and they could be questioned on spending in this area. Subsequently, the <Col N="2470"/>political consensus was that the hands of local authorities should not be tied regarding every penny allocated to them and they have been allocated a more general grant since. It is clear local authorities apply different levels of resources to this issue and I am not prepared to allow this scandal to continue. I am grateful for the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am interested that the Minister has a notion of the extent of the discrepancy. A total of 300,000 double registrations works out at between 7,000 and 8,000 per constituency. That assumes, for example, the register is updated to take account of deaths and so on, which it is not. It is a significant number. I assume it is possible to work out the discrepancy on a constituency basis. The Central Statistics Office produces population numbers per constituency. I assume it produces them for people over the age of 18 per constituency, or that they can be broken down on that basis.</P>
      <P>It would be a useful stimulus to the debate and would enable us all to take it up in a meaningful way with our local authorities if the Minister could provide us with the numbers on a constituency or county basis, or whatever is available. It would be interesting to see whether there are serious discrepancies in one part of the country <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> another part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I am heartened by what the Minister has said but I do not know exactly what he has said on how we will go about this, when it will start, what rules will come in and whether it will be in time for the next election&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader has obviously lunched well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I had no lunch unfortunately because I was here until 2.20 p.m.</P>
      <P>When will all that I mentioned happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader is interested in all of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I am. That is more to the point. Town and county councils are not a bit interested in getting the voting register right because that is up to us poor sods out knocking on the doors. I do not think they regard it as part of their job to do this, by way of circulars or whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>While the Senator was talking I said I intend introducing guidelines which will be available to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government. I made that point clear in the D&aacute;il. I hope the committee will have a full debate involving Members from both Houses and all parties. I will take guidance from the committee on this issue. I am very open on this issue, which we must address.</P>
      <P>I also said it is not rocket science. The technology exists. If there was a bar code on each PPS card people could key in their PPS numbers in <Col N="2471"/>their local post offices and we could automatically register everybody. There are a million things that can be done. I do not want to set up a high-tech system so shrouded in mystique that the public loses faith in it. There are simple ways of doing this. Postmen know who lives at what address. I will make it clear to local authorities that if they do not clean up their act I will look for someone else who will do it for them.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 4, before section 6, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;6.&mdash;Section 6(2) of the Electoral Act 1997 is amended by the substitution of the following paragraph (<i>b</i>):</P>
      <P LI="2">&lsquo;(<i>b</i>) each constituency shall return three, four, five or six if necessary, incorporating all of Leitrim and retaining its full constituency entity;&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have the pleasure of moving this amendment in the absence of Senator Bannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>He was put out.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="2472"/>
    <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Bannon emphasised that this amendment does not affect the current boundary report. It is an amendment for the future to maintain Leitrim as a single entity. The people in Leitrim would prefer either a Sligo-Leitrim constituency or Leitrim-Roscommon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the Senator clarified that point because it is consistent with the approach his party adopted in the D&aacute;il. The Government made the point, and the Senator&rsquo;s party accepted it, that it is no use establishing an independent review committee if we decide we do not like its recommendations and pick and mix from them.</P>
      <P>I am pleased at the different level and tone of the debate in this House. Some appalling suggestions were made about the independent commission in the other House. We set up the commission comprising a small group of people who served the nation well in other fields, and gave it this task. It was not acceptable to hear people cast aspersions on the validity of this exercise.</P>
      <P>This amendment looks ahead and therefore is not appropriate to this Act. The configuration of three, four and five-seat constituencies has applied in this country since 1947. The configuration and I arrived on this planet at approximately the same time. We could achieve absolute proportionality by creating a single constituency for the entire country.</P>
      <P>There has always been a debate about the relationship between proportionality, which is desirable in democratic terms, and the unique relationship between the elected representative, particularly in the D&aacute;il, and his or her constituents. Academics have treated this relationship in a disparaging way as gombeenism. I am an academic and therefore can be as critical of my own profession as anybody else. Academics who sit around all day after a nice long lunch in the common room can think up theses about the relationship between citizen and public representative but much of the academic analysis is bogus.</P>
      <P>The relationship between the citizen and the public representative in Ireland is particularly important because it mediates between the citizen and the State. For all its warts I would defend our system against any other in Europe. In Sweden, for example, parliamentary representatives ask why I rush home for clinics at the weekend. I do so because I want to be re-elected and because it gives me a unique connection with every citizen in my constituency. Everyone in this House has done this too at some stage.</P>
      <P>That is a very valuable feedback mechanism into Government. Public representatives do not have the market mechanism that Senator Quinn had in the pursuit of his career. If he made the wrong decision he would know because he would have no customers. One does not know when public administration does not make the right decision or makes the wrong one. The relationship between the citizen and the elected representative is part of a feedback mechanism into public administration. It is vital in terms of mediating an <Col N="2473"/>increasingly complex State and helping citizens deal with that.</P>
      <P>If one destroyed that relationship, which could be an effect of having too large a constituency, one will have the problem of alienation and anomie. A six-seat constituency would have over 150,000 people spread over a large geographical area. That is not a good idea. A Sinn F&eacute;in amendment in the D&aacute;il suggested we move to seven-seat constituencies &mdash; I am sure it was tabled in the interests of democracy rather than self-interest. If one goes there, one is talking about 170,000 electors or more, and we must therefore be very careful. We have a system that from time to time causes the types of difficulties that have arisen in Leitrim, and I understand those problems. However, the Senator&rsquo;s own party spokesman in the D&aacute;il, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, made an extremely interesting contribution about our current passion regarding constituency boundaries based on counties and the new realisation that Ireland is no longer mediated through arbitrary boundaries drawn up from the time of the Anglo-Norman conquest and concluded in 1604 when Wicklow was carved up.</P>
      <P>There is a new relationship. For example, the Deputy made a point regarding Drogheda, whose people live in the city of Drogheda, in County Louth and in County Meath. Their focus is not the county but the city and we must therefore be very careful. I fully understand the passions that abound on this issue in Leitrim. I have spoken to people there, and they are worried that they will not have a resident Deputy. I told them they had a super Deputy in the shape of Deputy Ellis and that all they need do is vote for him to ensure he will be there again next time; I got the plug in.</P>
      <P>My point is that we must be careful regarding the extraordinary and uniquely Irish relationship between the citizen and the elected representative. It is easier to see the Taoiseach of this country than a planning officer in one&rsquo;s county council. Most people will accept that as reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a very healthy situation. Academic observers and critics, and some people in the media who tend to be cynical &mdash; we are never short of cynics in this country &mdash; have disparaged that relationship, but we must be very careful about accepting it. I make the point that it is, first of all, not appropriate to this legislation. Second, I am grateful the Senator has made it clear he is not in any way casting aspersions on the commission, which has operated within the terms of reference that we set it. It would not be possible to make the change now. If we are to have a debate on the size of constituencies, we must put a great deal of thought into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has made some very interesting points regarding the level of representation, particularly in rural Ireland. I accept that if, for example, one made a constituency out <Col N="2474"/>of the entire county of Donegal, it would become quite difficult geographically for someone to represent such a large constituency. That consideration does not apply in urban areas such as Dublin, where constituencies are very small, geographically speaking. There is a different dynamic at work. It is a fact not unique to Ireland that in urban areas there tends to be a greater diversity of views than in rural areas. More parties are organised than would be typical in rural areas. An argument can be made to provide for a different structure.</P>
      <P>In the past we typically had different structures for urban and rural areas, with five-seaters in the cities, while three-seaters were until recently almost exclusively a rural phenomenon, for geographical reasons as much as anything else. That has begun to change now, since the north side of Dublin now has largely three-seat constituencies, something that probably suits my party, so I am not commenting from a specifically party political point of view. Looking at Dublin &mdash; along with Cork, Limerick and Waterford by this stage &mdash; there is an argument that there is a diversity of political views among the population and that, ideally, all other things being equal, those should be represented in the D&aacute;il. I know that the terms of reference are set down in the 1997 Act, but when we come to do this again, there is an argument that, in urban areas, we should predominantly have four-seaters rather than three-seaters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I have listened with interest to the Minister, and there is no doubt that cynicism abounds regarding such matters as the two Houses rising tomorrow. People ask what we will all be doing for three months, as if we were going to be hunting, fishing and drinking in that order during the period. I wish that some of the cynics who expound that point of view would come and live with me for a week. I could offer to put them up in the house &mdash; although they might turn up, of course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator want Vincent Browne trailing around after her?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to pick the person.</P>
      <P>I wish that they were able to see the amount of work that goes on. That brings me to the relationship between a constituent and an elected representative at local, county or national level. I remember many years ago when I was first elected to the urban council; it was so long ago that I will not bother the Cathaoirleach by saying when. A local reporter asked me how I saw my role. At that stage the word &ldquo;ombudsman&rdquo; was entering use, and I told the person that I saw myself as such. I take that view because breaking down the mysteries of State organisations for a constituent is a substantial task. Through no fault of their own, they often find themselves quite unequal to it &mdash; as I sometimes do too.</P><Col N="2475"/>
      <P>I heard that the Minister had spoken about this matter. Can he do anything about telephones? I mean that not in the sense of communications. One rings an office number and is told to press 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 depending on the service. If one does not have the kind of telephone that accommodates such constant pressing, one cannot get through. One hears &ldquo;The Rising of the Moon&rdquo; or some inferior song being played endlessly while one waits to be connected with someone. That is always the case with Departments, State organisations and so on. I have not heard the Health Service Executive at it yet, but no doubt it is already picking whatever it intends to play.</P>
      <P>People need help, and I accept what the Minister has said. When, in the run-up to a housing Bill, one is armed with the knowledge that a woman who has been on a list for a year and a half has not yet met the housing officer, one surely knows what one is talking about, as long as one has listened to the constituent. That applies also to the merits or demerits of shared ownership and some of the arrangements available from county councils for clients seeking housing. There is a great need, and I have always taken pride in the fact that, if one represents someone, one listens to them. One may not always be able to do it, but one listens to the point they are making and what they have to say to one. I therefore echo that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The unique relationship between the elected representative in Ireland and the citizen is part of our political culture. Most of the academic literature on this would argue that it is negative, but I find it very positive. It helps to mediate between the citizen and the State, humanising that relationship. It is obviously not possible in the context of this Bill to make the change, since this deals only with the current situation.</P>
      <P>However, if Senator Bannon were here, I would point out that we would have to think long and hard about any future course of action. We had very large constituencies here at one time, and the argument has been made again in the context of the six-seater constituencies and of the Good Friday Agreement regarding Northern Ireland. Frankly, that argument is not valid, since we must administer and govern that part of the national territory currently within our jurisdiction. Second, any objective person will recognise that the arrangements that resulted from the Good Friday Agreement emerged from a very specific set of circumstances in the North of Ireland which thankfully do not apply here and have not done so for a long time.</P>
      <P>On the issue of the number of three-seaters, there have been many observations. I do not think that it was the point that Senator McDowell was making, but there have been plenty of precedents in the past where we have had more three-seaters than currently. We will never achieve perfection on this issue, but the dispo<Col N="2476"/>sition and the arrangements that we have in place allow an apolitical, non-partisan, independent group to draw the constituency boundaries. That is as good an arrangement as we will get.</P>
      <P>We have all had our fingers burnt in the past when there was political manipulation of electoral boundaries. I saw a study of the situation in California, which was quite disgraceful, and I would not like us to return to that. We should live with the commission and accept what it says. If we were to go down the route of larger constituencies, we should think long and hard about it. It is very interesting that Senator McDowell was arguing for a different mix of constituencies that would recognise the territory to be covered, a different issue from the subject matter of the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 5, column 2, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;Carlow&rdquo;, in line 4 down to and including &ldquo;Wicklow.&rdquo; in line 6 and substitute &ldquo;Carlow.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The Minister and I have a conflict of interest in regard to this amendment and he will be glad to know I do not intend to press it to a vote. I have put it down as a marker because although I accept the electoral commission&rsquo;s recommendation, I and many people in Carlow are unhappy about it. I acknowledge Senator McDowell&rsquo;s point that we should not get too obsessed with county boundaries. However, it is worth noting the constitutional stipulation that, where possible, county boundaries should be respected. This is not always possible and is generally impossible where counties include cities.</P>
      <P>People in the area of Carlow to which I refer, which includes Hacketstown, Clonmore, Rathvilly and Ballyconnell, elect representatives to Carlow County Council, are represented on Carlow VEC, participate in the Carlow community games and are involved in GAA teams whose players also play for the County Carlow football team. These places have a clear link with County Carlow. I acknowledge that the Minister and his fellow Wicklow representative, Deputy Timmins, serve this area well. However, other Wicklow Members do not give it the same level of attention.</P>
      <P>When the electoral commission next considers the situation of County Carlow, I hope it will take <Col N="2477"/>account of the content of my amendments. In 1997, the commission accepted the point I and others made that there was a need, based on population, for the Wicklow constituency to incorporate part of Carlow in order to justify its allocation of D&aacute;il seats. This is no longer the case, however, because there has been an explosion in the population of County Wicklow in recent years.</P>
      <P>The difficulty is that if the section of County Carlow to which I refer is reincorporated into the Carlow-Kilkenny constituency, the population of that constituency will be such as to warrant more than five D&aacute;il seats. In that case, a section of south County Kilkenny would have to be moved into the Waterford constituency. I would be pleased with such a development for political reasons but that is an issue for another day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I will tell Senator John Paul Phelan what Senator Browne has said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Mansergh mentioned that a section of south County Tipperary is included in the Waterford constituency. The possibility that some part of south Kilkenny might also transfer into the Waterford constituency is a nightmare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I would be glad to devise a constituency especially for Senator Browne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be good if Senator Bradford could do so.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to put this issue of electoral boundaries on the agenda. Even the name of the Wicklow constituency is disingenuous and it should be renamed Wicklow North-Carlow East. North-east Carlow is quite a substantial section of the constituency and that should be acknowledged. Perhaps the Minister will give it back. I doubt the Minister will accept my amendment but I cannot be sure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not, by analogy, press for a renaming of my constituency to Tipperary South-Waterford West. Senator Browne has a valid point in that county council boundaries often do not coincide substantially with electoral boundaries. In County Tipperary, for example, we have North Tipperary County Council and South Tipperary County Council and two electoral constituencies, Tipperary North and Tipperary South. However, the boundaries of the county councils and constituencies do not at all coincide with the result, for instance, that councillors serving on South Tipperary County Council cast their vote in D&aacute;il elections in the Tipperary North constituency.</P>
      <P>This causes difficulties in terms of making representations for the areas that arguably fall between two stools. The positive way of viewing this is that voters may be able to drum up Oireachtas Members in both constituencies on their behalf. On the other hand, however, issues may fall through the cracks. Changes in regard to <Col N="2478"/>electoral boundaries are dependent to some degree on population. Nevertheless, I hope that when this exercise is again undertaken, after the next election, this matter will be considered by the commission.</P>
      <P>There may be a perception that the situation in County Tipperary is entirely straightforward in that the constituencies are close to the national average in terms of representation in proportion to population. However, there is this complication of the crossover of county council and constituency areas. Another issue is that much of the rural hinterland of Tipperary town that for decades was part of the Tipperary South constituency has gradually been transferred into the Tipperary North constituency. Many people living in that area find it unsatisfactory that they are located at least 20 miles from Thurles and 30 miles from Nenagh. Some have to travel across mountains to access the services available in the central locations of the Tipperary North constituency.</P>
      <P>I am not sure why a part of west Waterford has been included for some time in the Tipperary South constituency. One must go up a mountain track to reach this part of County Waterford, which is four or five miles from Clonmel. It seems evident there will be substantial population swings by the time of the next census. For example, most of the towns in Tipperary are growing rapidly for the first time. This may make it possible to introduce some rationalisation of the electoral boundaries. It is desirable that this should be done and that towns should be connected more effectively with their hinterlands. Any such changes in regard to County Tipperary should conform, if possible, to the boundary line between north County Tipperary and south County Tipperary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>In the context of the electoral system, county boundaries represent a system that has developed historically. There is no constitutional requirement in this regard and the Constitution does not mention counties. Legal cases have been taken in regard to this and in one of them, the O&rsquo;Donovan case, Mr. Justice Budd confirmed that the Constitution was not binding in this regard. Its terms of reference require the electoral commission to adhere as far as practicable to county boundaries but there is no constitutional obligation to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the Minister does not mind that he is being brought on a tour of the State. When Galway city became a borough it got some territory from surrounding rural areas. There was no great problem in this regard and the transfer was agreed between the two local authorities involved. However, difficulties have arisen in this regard in other areas. Senator Dooley gave the example of Limerick city taking territory from County Clare.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="2479"/>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask Senator Kitt to deal with the amendments under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to give an example as other Members have done. Senator Dooley presented the example of County Clare, which might have been entitled to five seats if it had kept its territory intact. Unfortunately, this did not happen. A similar situation obtains where Ballinasloe Town Council borders County Roscommon. The Minister is aware of the existence of such issues. We will not resolve them today. I present examples in which it may be simple to change the borough territory, such as Galway city and county. However, it is difficult to do so where adjoining counties are concerned. I would like the Minister to keep that in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>This discussion is very interesting. Senator Brady is correct on the 1961 Mr. Justice Budd judgment in the O&rsquo;Donovan case. That was an interesting decision because most of what we have to say on the Constitution and the variance between the numbers of seats and Deputies flows from that judgment. Mr. Justice Budd made the observation that counties do not have a constitutional existence. They exist in law and practice since the 12th century and because we are close to them. Had we decided at the foundation of the State not to name constituencies after counties but according to a different nomenclature, such as electoral districts one to 42, we would not find ourselves in this ongoing debate. We are where we are, however.</P>
      <P>To accept amendment No. 7 or amendment No. 10 would be to violate the decision of the commission. I am aware it is not the opposing party&rsquo;s intention to press the issue. We have to support the decision made by the commission. The issue noted by Senator Browne is correct. Deputy Timmons and I spend a lot of time in that small area of north-east County Carlow. For a debate in the D&aacute;il, I calculated that, discounting driving, the per capita time I spend conducting constituency clinics in north-east County Carlow is longer by a factor of four to five than the time I spend in Bray, the town in which I live and where the population is located. As an Oireachtas Member, I have the job of covering the whole constituency. This poses problems. It is frustrating to look through the back window of my house at a chunk of land that has a Bray postal address but is located in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown constituency. The people living there feel cut off because a green patch separates them from D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown. It is difficult to attain perfection in this matter.</P>
      <P>Returning to the matters raised by other contributions, if we start fiddling with names, we would have to make changes in north-east counties Cork and Carlow and elsewhere. The nomenclature issue becomes difficult at that stage. I am aware that amendments No. 7 and 10 are not being pressed. In accordance with the principle we all established that the commission should be sup<Col N="2480"/>ported, I would not be in a position to accept them if they are pressed. The debate is worth having, however.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>A census is due in 2006. The Government would have us believe that it will remain in power until 2007. Recent weeks would suggest otherwise but we may return to a different political scenario in the new term. If the census is carried out in 2006 and figures are available by the time a general election is held in 2007, will there be a revisit and a rethinking of constituencies? A few months ago, an article in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> reported that almost half of D&aacute;il constituencies may be under-represented by 2006. If the election is held in 2007, numerous court challenges may be held. The Minister might clarify that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>

	<P>Good. That is very helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>If the election is held earlier, this debate would not be pertinent. If the election is held in May 2007, we will at best have the preliminary report from the 2006 census. Two documents will be published. The preliminary report was mentioned in <i>The Sunday Tribune </i>article, which, while I queried some of the issues raised therein, represented a good piece of journalism.</P>
      <P>The preliminary report has no legal status. The argument has been made that, as the difference between the preliminary census report for the whole country and the final report which is published as volume 1 is only a couple of hundred people, it does not matter. However, it does matter because one must, if going before a commission on constituency revision which has legal status and addresses a constitutional issue, <Col N="2481"/>present the final version of the document. One cannot present the preliminary document.</P>
      <P>Practical reasons exist for this. When the commission considers the data it possesses to draw up new constituency boundaries, it has to descend through electoral divisions as far as the smallest electoral unit. The variances between the preliminary and the final report may be found there. While the difference between the overall population figures contained in the preliminary and the final statutory reports may be 400 or fewer, the variations at the micro-level may be substantial. As Members know, a handful of votes may make all the difference on election day. It is better to get the registration right than to face that circumstance.</P>

      <P>Will there be a legal challenge? Who can say? People with deep pockets can challenge anything. We have to make certain, when drafting this legislation, that we operate to the best of faith within constitutional case law. This law is based on the opinion of Mr. Justice Budd and subsequent Supreme Court judgments. Preceding Mr. Justice Budd&rsquo;s 1961 judgment is a discussion of the output that the census should use. The judge makes it clear &mdash; this is where constitutional case law arises &mdash; that one should operate based on the final and complete report rather than the preliminary one. I thank Senator Browne for presenting me the opportunity to address that issue in this House.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 5, column 1, line 11, to delete &ldquo;Cork East&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Cork North-East&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I accept what the Minister stated on the previous amendments, that since the introduction of the independent electoral commission the political parties have accepted <i>per se </i>the recommend<Col N="2483"/>ations from the various commissions in totality. I have no difficulty with that. We generally accept the constituencies, whether they are redrawn or remain in place. For the general elections of 1969, 1973, 1977 and 1981 the constituency I formerly represented was termed Cork North-East. The next commission, without revising the constituency, perhaps only adding one or two townlands, renamed the constituency Cork East.</P>
      <P>Any member of this House or any person with reasonable knowledge of Irish geography knows will that towns such as Mallow, Mitchelstown and Fermoy are as much north Cork as any town can be. If one examines the components of the Cork East constituency one sees the rural districts of Mallow, Mitchelstown and Fermoy are included. I request that we revert to the position of the 1960s and 1970s. Last night or the night before the Cathaoirleach met the former D&aacute;il Deputy, Mr. Dick Barry who represented that constituency for a generation when it was called Cork North-East. The people of Mitchelstown, Mallow and Fermoy clearly live in the geographical area of north Cork. They also live in the north Cork council and administrative areas. The constituency title should reflect that.</P>
      <P>I do not question the work of the commission. The name of a constituency is of least concern to it. Obviously I could not make a submission to the commission concerning this issue. If a submission was made it would have been on the basis of second-guessing that the commission would allow the constituency to remain in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>As it turned out, the Cork East constituency was the only Cork constituency untouched and unaffected by the commission. There was little point in suggesting to the commission that if it did A, it should be titled B. I did not make a submission on the title of the constituency. The Minister may not be able to respond favourably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>It is common sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not second-guessing the redrawing of any constituency. I simply ask that the constituency be termed what it was previously termed, which was its absolutely correct geographical title, Cork North-East.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I hesitate to take issue with a Cork Senator although many of my ancestors came from Cork. What Senator Bradford argues is tradition versus geography. In any common sense definition, places such as Youghal, Cloyne and Midleton are in east Cork and not north-east Cork. I assume it was done because it is a more accurate geographical description, which on the whole should be preferred even if tradition goes with another description.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I will return to the point I made earlier. This is essentially an issue of nomenclature and does not interfere with the principles of the commission. I must admit to the House, being a truthful man and a novice in office, that when this issue first arose I was disposed to agreeing. I then received advice as to why I should not, which is why I mentioned the nomenclature earlier. If we had decided to name the constituencies as, say, electoral districts 1 to 42, it would have lost the attraction and the romance&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>It would have lost the flavour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;of the title of the county but it would also have got rid of much of this debate. I understand the point made about Cork North-East. It seems to be a common sense geographical definition. Carlow and Wicklow are mentioned. What would we call that? Would it be Wicklow North-East Carlow? Then there would be Kilkenny and the rest of Carlow. It becomes odd as we go down the list. Part of Meath West is included in Westmeath. Senator Mansergh only dipped his toe in it. Tipperary would be extremely confusing. Tipperary North includes the northern part of the administrative area of Tipperary South. Limerick East has a small part of County Clare. Tipperary South touches on parts of Waterford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>All of the constituency Senator Bradford is discussing is in County Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I suggest to Senator Bradford if this causes offence locally a submission should be made to the next commission. At that stage the population will have changed and he might be worried about more than nomenclature.</P>

      <P>If we were to make this change in one or two constituencies we would have to make it in quite a few others. I am not in a position to accept the amendment. I am not unsympathetic. When I thought it was simply north-east Carlow and Wicklow I was most disposed to agreeing but on seeing the floodgates that would open I must refuse the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>

	<P>The <i>Leitrim Observer</i> is watching.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I will speak on the Schedule and the new designation of Sligo-North Leitrim and Roscommon-South Leitrim. I understand the Minister&rsquo;s firm position on refusing to accept amendments, and do not expect him to argue it again. I wish to make my argument. The first electoral changes to Leitrim, and the first breach of the county boundaries, were in 1961. The designations used were Sligo-Leitrim and Roscommon-Leitrim. In 1969, the then Minister with responsibility for local government, Mr. Boland, in his wisdom decided it was not enough to split Leitrim in two and split it in three. He created an enclave around Kinlough, near Bundoran, where he took 8,000 Leitrim voters to prop up south Donegal which at the time, like most of the western seaboard, was haemorrhaging people.</P>
      <P>In regard to the other two constituencies comprising 11,000 voters, it is rather interesting to look at the figures now. That would be a total of 30,000. The current population of the county officially is 25,000. Eight thousand came under the new designation of Leitrim. The commission did not make any designation of territory in terms of Sligo-Leitrim, Roscommon-Leitrim. Under one of the Minister&rsquo;s predecessors, Jim Tully, a further revision was made and again the designation by the Minister was in terms of Roscommon-Leitrim, Sligo-Leitrim.</P>
      <P>The first commission did its revision under the Lynch Administration and after 20 years it restored the county to a single political entity. That argument was redundant, therefore, until today. Considering that we have been speaking in this debate about legal precedent and constitutional positions, I do not understand how the commission decided that the new designation <Col N="2486"/>should be Sligo-North Leitrim and Roscommon-South Leitrim. There was no precedent for that. The point I was making earlier about Leitrim, as the Minister is fully aware, and as the House is by now even more aware to the point of mild irritation and a good deal of boredom, to which the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, devoted a significant part of his Second Stage contribution, and I pay tribute to him for that, is that there is deep hurt in County Leitrim but it is as much about the psychological impact it is having on the county rather than any political fallout.</P>
      <P>On the psychological impact, I quoted the former Senator, the late Paddy O&rsquo;Reilly, in an earlier debate not necessarily relevant to constituency change, when he referred to the geographical make-up of County Leitrim as a &ldquo;geographical monstrosity&rdquo; because the drumlin hills are on one side and there are mountains on the other. The Minister and I have often spoken about history, going back to the 12th century, the creation of the counties and the divide and conquer policy of the English at the time. In our part of the country they split up the traditional Breffni &Oacute; Raghallaigh and Breffni O&rsquo;Rourke and created this &ldquo;geographical monstrosity&rdquo;, as the late Senator O&rsquo;Reilly called it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Nothing to do with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>It has nothing whatsoever to do with the esteemed Leader of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>A Senator</NameTxt>
	<P>Her antecedents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps it is my antecedents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Since that time there has been an effect on the psyche of people from the north of the county who, as the Minister will know from his many visits, as will other Senators, including Senator McHugh, who is closest to me geographically. The people refer to themselves as coming from north Leitrim but there is no north Leitrim entity. It is something that goes back to the mists of time. People from the south of the county, however, do not refer to themselves as coming from south Leitrim. I can make that point because I am in the middle, so to speak, in Drumshanbo. We can look down on both of them. We are the true Leitrim people.</P>
      <P>I must say to the Minister, through the Chair, that it is the GAA which is to blame for all of this; I hope he understands that. This is nothing to do with constitutional commissions. This is to do with the GAA, which nurtured, engendered and cultivated the concept of county identity, which has got everybody riled across the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I think the Senator is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>1890.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly. From 1884 on the county was sacrosanct and one wonders what might have happened if the GAA had not arrived. I say that <Col N="2487"/>with my tongue very firmly in my cheek but there is a historical reality to that as well.</P>
      <P>In the context of the Schedule, in addition to the deep hurt caused to many people in Leitrim there is also the deep psychological impact of not only splitting the county politically but also putting them under these designations. I realise the Minister cannot do anything about that; it is like a sacred cow. It is even worse than the United Nations. The United Nations is a great institution, notwithstanding its flaws. This report is being presented as a great achievement. I understand we cannot touch it because it will unravel everything. I understand also the political reality but I have to put on the record that this report is condemning the county of Leitrim to another identity crisis until such time as another commission is put in place.</P>
      <P>I will conclude on a positive note about which Senator Brady will be aware. A report presented to Leitrim County Council two weeks ago based on the statistical evidence of new house buildings and various other improvements in the county indicated that the current population of Leitrim is estimated at over 28,000. It must be borne in mind that according to the last census the population was 25,100 or 25,200,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>It is growing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a marvellous achievement and the Minister deserves great credit for the job he is doing in his Department, as do all the other members of the Fianna F&aacute;il Administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Mooney made some valid points. I have an interest in this as well because in 1969, part of Leitrim was in part of Donegal South. I have done some study of this matter. Regarding the Minister&rsquo;s own constituency, in 1921, Kildare and Wicklow were one constituency but as a general trend there has not been much movement. In fairness to the case made for Leitrim, however, Leitrim has been bandied about, so to speak, going from Roscommon to Sligo to Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I could think of a few more words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps people should have a voice on future commissions.</P>
      <P>In regard to Donegal, in the 1918 Westminster elections, Donegal had four constituencies &mdash; North, South, East and West &mdash; and as late as 1977 we had one constituency. To return to a point raised earlier by the Minister, people want a connectivity with their politicians. That desire is growing and we should focus on it. Perhaps in time Donegal could be a four-seater constituency again if the trend continues. Leitrim may even have a constituency of its own.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I take up that positive note from Senator McHugh because I had written a note to myself to both welcome and congratulate the boundary commission, its independence and the independence of its findings. It is an entity in itself that is not subject to any political compulsion and it has produced a wonderful report. I understand the reason Senator Mooney could not congratulate the members of the commission.</P>
      <P>I have a particular cause for joy because I am very happy that Westmeath will be linked with Longford again. I started my career as a Deputy for Longford-Westmeath and I intend to end my career as a Deputy for Longford-Westmeath.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Cathaoirleach knows it. There was a councillor living there. Tang is two miles from Ballymahon. It is a small townland. It is not a village. There is a school there but not a pub.</P>

	<P>Are we in Longford now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>There is also a church. As one approaches the townland there is a sign which states &ldquo;Welcome to County Westmeath&rdquo; but the people of Ballymahon go to mass in Tang. They have two masses in Tang said by a priest who believes in short masses. There was a famous Battle of Tang in 988. The book about Cornelius Rabbit of Tang should not be confused with the Battle of Tang. I arrived at the church with my truck, my guys and my microphone. Then Albert arrived with his truck, his guys and his microphone, and it became a question of what would happen. We knew the priest was nearing com<Col N="2489"/>pletion in the church because we had a scout going inside to keep us informed. We did not know what would happen or whether we were going to drown out one another. However, a very nice councillor from Longford said &ldquo;Get up on the one truck the two of ye. Aren&rsquo;t ye both Fianna F&aacute;il?&rdquo; We did, and we said our piece.</P>
      <P>I welcome Longford back into the constituency. The people of Longford and Westmeath are strong soul-mates. I have retained great friendships all over Longford since I ran, but particularly in north Longford. I look forward to renewing those acquaintanceships and friendships, and to working together in a voting sense.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>There is much sympathy in the House with the case of Leitrim. I come from what is in another sense a partitioned county. I have sometimes felt it was partitioned in 1838 as the most troubled county in Ireland, and that perhaps there was an element of divide and rule about that. However, there are certain practicalities in that regard.</P>
      <P>The question raised was where the counties would be without the GAA, which is a sound point. It is one of the great ironies of history that the counties that were quintessentially English creations are today quintessentially GAA creations. However, if we did not have the GAA, every other Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government would change county boundaries. None of us would know from one year to the next the name of the administrative unit we were supposed to be living in. That is what has happened in large areas across the water due to endless local government reform. In many ways, I would say: &ldquo;Thank God for the GAA.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>One point relevant to the future involves the issue of the minus 11% tolerance. In the particular circumstances, although it had not been lived with before, perhaps we should have lived with it to keep Leitrim together. With regard to the total for all the constituencies, it would not have taken that much skin off anyone&rsquo;s nose.</P>

	<P>When one is talking about the county with the smallest population, which certainly lives up to its reputation as being &ldquo;lovely Leitrim&rdquo;, a little more tolerance should be shown if that type of issue should arise again, although I am not suggesting we have unlimited tolerance. If Sligo-Leitrim had been left alone, I wonder whether there would have been a revolt or whether the Supreme Court would have knocked it down.</P>
      <P>While I question that decision, I am a strong supporter of the system and of the convention that one does not change a recommendation. <Col N="2490"/>Anything we may say comes under the heading &ldquo;for future reference&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>During the run-up to an election, the three-week period to register to vote creates a farcical situation. In many cases, people must go to their Garda station but when they do, the green man is on the door and the station is shut. They cannot register and must go away. Most of those who have not registered are busy people. I heard of one case in which several people had to travel from Naas to Maynooth. When they arrived at the Garda station there, the green man was on the door. Of course, the green man&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;-does not speak and could not do anything for them. Such people leave the Garda station disillusioned. They say &ldquo;To hell with them. We are not going to register at all&rdquo;. They forget about it and do not bother to register. Something will have to be done in this regard. There should be some way of getting a form and registering with the local authority. The system is not satisfactory at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>When the Minister cogitates about electoral register reform and the process leading to it, he might consider my strong belief that there should be no opinion polls for approximately three weeks before the vote. Padraig Flynn, a much demonised person now, introduced an amendment in the Seanad to a local authority Bill with regard to voting and opinion polls which was voted down, although I am not blaming those who voted it down. Be that as it may, opinion polls alter the way people intend to vote. For the election period and the tight three weeks between names being registered and voting day, opinion polls should not be allowed in any constituency. I know Deputy Hogan has put this point strongly on behalf of Fine Gael. However, I am not saying this to engage the interest of the Opposition but because it causes distortion.</P>
      <P>Far worse than opinion polls are planted opinion polls, such as was carried out in Meath and given to a local newspaper despite being completely incorrect. What chance has a candidate going forward for election? I distinctly remember that one week before the election in 2002 a local newspaper, the <i>Westmeath Independent</i>, which is the Athlone newspaper, stated my poll results were so impossibly high I would break all barriers. When I called at a door after that, people asked why I was coming around or why was I killing myself canvassing. It was difficult to change that perception.</P>
      <P>This area would make for a very fertile Private Members&rsquo; Bill, although the Minister might have his own ideas on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister and his officials, as well the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, who introduced the debate, for a very interesting debate on Second Stage. The Minister was about to say what I want to say. The debate was very good humoured. In many ways we were very frustrated because we were not going to make changes if we accepted the commission. Ministers from all parties have chopped and changed, resulting in part of north Galway being in the same constituency as south Roscommon and part of south Galway being included with north Clare. These are some examples of the gerrymandering that took place. A commission was badly needed though if we comprised the members of the commission we might do it differently. I thank the Minister and his officials for their work and we look forward to the Minister <Col N="2492"/>coming back to the House. At that stage he might deal with some of the ideas put forward that are not dealt with in the Bill.</P>

      <P>Regarding Senator Paddy Burke&rsquo;s point about the green man at Garda stations, in circumstances where the green man cannot stamp one&rsquo;s card it is possible to go to the local authority. Perhaps this is not very well known and should be examined in discussions in the autumn. In addition to thanking the Senators who made a contribution I also thank the staff of the House who dealt with the Bill in an expeditious manner. I wish everyone who has a practical and personal interest in the matters discussed the best of luck in the new constituencies when they come into effect in the next general election of May 2007.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P el="0">I thank the House for taking this matter today. The adoption of the motion by both Houses of the Oireachtas will pave the way for the planning and development regulations to be amended in three different ways. It will be a requirement for shops that wish to change into an off-licence or to sell alcohol as the predominant business to obtain planning permission. It will facilitate consideration of the need for an environmental impact assessment of peat extraction projects that are currently exempted developments, by reference to criteria set out in the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive. It will reflect in the Irish planning regulations a technical change to annexe I and annexe II of the <Col N="2493"/>Environmental Impact Assessment Directive, which list project categories that require environmental impact assessments. The change is needed because the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive has been amended by the Aarhus Directive 2003/35/EC.</P>
      <P>These are highly technical issues and it would have been better if they had been discussed in an Oireachtas committee. As a Minister I am unusual in my belief that non-contentious technical issues should be dealt with in committees as the exchanges are far better. When it was suggested at the Whip&rsquo;s meeting the Green Party took exception to the idea that we should work through an Oireachtas committee. I do not know why it did so, but it was supported by Deputy Stagg. Ironically, there was criticism yesterday that the discussion was not going through Oireachtas committees but there is a lesson to be learned. It is foolhardy to score political points on issues that are not politically contentious but which require a considerable amount of explanation.</P>
      <P>The positive approval of this House is needed for any change to the exemptions under the planning code, whether the change adds an exemption or limits exemptions, as these changes do. Senators will know that these kinds of regulations are normally discussed in the Oireachtas committee.</P>
      <P>The first amendment will require shop owners who wish to change the use of their shop to an off-licence to obtain planning permission. This makes practical, good sense. I have always been amazed by the fact that, under the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, planning permission is required to change a shop into a chipper but one does not require planning permission to change the same shop into an off-licence, selling all forms of beer, wines and spirits. While chips can be inimical to the figure, alcohol can do a lot more damage.</P>
      <P>The number of shops changing use to off-licence or expanding into the sale of alcohol has increased significantly in recent years. The increase in off-licences has arisen from changes to the restrictions on the transfer of intoxicating liquor licences and from changes in the way in which people socialise and drink. We accept this as part of the evolution of our society. These changes have had an impact on our streets and some communities. This is a land-use issue that must be tackled through the planning code.</P>
      <P>The interim report on off-licensing by Commission on Liquor Licensing, published in May 2001, shared my long-held view on this. It recommended that permission should be needed for a change of use of a shop to an off-licence, while recommending that wine sales continue to be excluded. I have therefore decided to amend the definition of a shop in the 2001 regulations, in line with the recommendation in the interim report, so that a shop changing use to that of an off­licence, or expanding what it sells to include alcohol, would in future require planning per<Col N="2494"/>mission. The change will not effect the sale of wine as a subsidiary to the main use of the premises as a shop. The sale of wine from a comer fridge, which is a minor element of the overall trade of the shop, will not be affected by this change.</P>
      <P>I see the change as a very positive step. By bringing the matter into the planning code I am giving local communities a say in the development and establishment of off-licences in their areas. I am giving them the right to make an intervention for the very first time. I am also giving councils and councillors the right to have a say in this area.</P>
      <P>This has been an area of genuine concern for communities in recent years as more and more outlets for the sale of beer, spirits and wine have sprung up. We all know the consequences of excessive use of alcohol in our societies. It is leading to a yob culture, it is degrading our communities and causing major problems. We must be very careful in how we handle this in planning. I do not want to interfere with people&rsquo;s enjoyment but to give local communities a say where previously they had none. The changes will bring off-licences into line with the current provision for the sale of hot food, also changed under the 2001 regulations. Under those regulations, if people want to change their shop into a chipper, they must get permission, but shops with a hot food counter as a small part of their business do not need permission. This arrangement has worked well in practice since it was introduced in 2002. I am happy that planning authorities will be able to apply the same rules to the sale of alcohol.</P>
      <P>It is not my intention that this proposed regulation should prevent consumer choice or in any way inhibit competition. Rather, the intention is to give communities and councils the right to determine what can and cannot happen in their areas.</P>
      <P>The second amendment is more complex. It arises in part from the difficulties we have had with the European Union and particular issues relating to judgments against us in the European Court. The amendment will facilitate consideration of the need for an environmental impact assessment, EIA, for peat extraction projects below ten hectares, that is 24.71 acres. These are exempted developments under the 2001 regulations.</P>
      <P>The EU Commission has raised concerns that these smaller, but still significant, peat extractions could have significant effects on the environment, having regard to the criteria set out in the environmental impact assessment directive. These criteria include the characteristics of the proposed development, its size, use of natural resources and so on. The environmental sensitivity of the areas affected and the risk of significant environmental effects are also considerations.</P>
      <P>I therefore propose to amend the present exemption in the 2001 planning regulations, which is for peat extraction in a new or extended <Col N="2495"/>area of less than ten hectares, or peat extraction in a new or extended area of ten hectares or more, where the drainage of the bogland commenced prior to the coming into effect of the existing regulations. These changes are being made to provide that the exemption would not apply where peat extraction is likely to have significant effects on the environment.</P>
      <P>This would allow the planning authority to assess whether a peat extraction would have significant impact. Where it would, the authority can step in and require a planning application and environmental impact statement to be prepared, provided there are cogent reasons for doing so. We have been advised that this change will answer the Commission&rsquo;s concerns about the transposition of the EIA directive with regard to peat extraction.</P>
      <P>This change only relates to bogs outside of designated areas, namely, SACs and NHAs, which are under a separate consent system. Therefore, we are talking about medium-sized peat extractions in non-designated bogs, where consideration must be given to the possible environmental impacts. This meets a requirement under EU law and does not mean, as some Members in the D&aacute;il suggested, the end to family turf cutting. That would not be the result.</P>
      <P>I would like to point out that if we had wanted to use Oireachtas time well, we should have discussed these regulations in committee. That we are debating them by way of statements is not my fault.</P>
      <P>The final amendment deals with the Aarhus directive. This is a technical amendment to Schedule 5 of the 2001 regulations, reflecting a relatively minor change to annexes I and II of the environmental impact assessment directive. Part I of the Schedule lists the project categories for which environmental impact assessments are mandatory and Part II lists the project categories for which mandatory thresholds have been set.</P>
      <P>The amendment is designed to ensure that any changes to, or extension of, a project in Part I will in themselves require environmental impact assessments where such a change or extension meets any relevant threshold in Part I. As currently drafted, such an assessment is mandatory only where a development increases by 25%, or an amount equal to 50% of the appropriate threshold, whichever is the greater. Members can be forgiven if I have lost them here, because the issue is quite complex. I will explain by way of example. In the case of an airport runway, a length of 2,010 m. is set as a threshold figure. A situation could arise where, in order to avoid some of the onerous responsibilities involved, some smart person says the runway will only be 2,000 m. long and, therefore, there is no need to go through the process of an EIA. Then, three-quarters of the way through the planning an extra 5 m. or 6 m. will be added. This is done so that a change can be made and a threshold breached without the inconvenience of the EIA.</P><Col N="2496"/>
      <P>The change to the lists of project categories transposes a small part of directive 2003/35/EC, commonly known as the Aarhus directive. This directive provides for public participation in respect of the drawing up of certain plans and programmes relating to the environment and giving development consent to projects.</P>
      <P>Transposition of the Aarhus directive will for the most part be achieved through regulations under the European Communities Act 1972 and further amendments to the planning and development regulations. Work is in progress on these regulations. I intend that the remaining implementation measures will be adopted this summer. I commend the amendments to the House.</P>
      <P>As they are technical amendments I believe they should have been debated in an Oireachtas committee where we could have had more toing and froing on them. However, despite the Government desire to deal with it that way, people took a different, perhaps suspicious, view. Therefore, as we did not have unanimity, it is appropriate for them to come before both Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister back to the House. The amendments are technical and I have difficulty understanding the third one. It would be better to have more time to discuss them in detail and to be in a position to ask in-depth questions.</P>
      <P>On the first amendment, I agree with any measures that can be taken to tighten regulations on the drinks industry. While I agree that people who wish to change their premises from a shop to an off-licence should require planning permission, I have some general comments to make on the issue of the drink culture. I cannot say that this amendment will make the matter worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>It should make it better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes. The other night I attended a residents&rsquo; meeting. One of their main complaints concerned anti-social behaviour in the vicinity of a garage that sold wine. The garage sells three bottles of wine for &euro;20 thereby making it accessible to young people. Anybody can sell wine. Therefore, I wonder whether the Minister should have extended the regulations to cover wine licences. We still have a situation where wine can be sold anywhere. However, I commend and support the requirement on people to seek planning permission for the sale of beer and spirits.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that he wanted to give a voice to councillors and local communities and the planning process certainly does that. However, I see from my area that no matter how many objections there are to an off-licence, a chipper or a take-away, more and more of them seem to get planning permission quite easily. I hope this regulation will not lead to more. The main question I would like the Minister to answer is whether we should include wine under the provisions of these regulations.</P><Col N="2497"/>
      <P>The only concern I have about peat extraction projects relates to small family operations, which involve the digging of turf on half an acre or an acre of land. I will accept the Minister&rsquo;s statement that these regulations will not affect such activity. It is obvious that many families in this country enjoy going to cut turf on an annual basis. I would not like anything to interfere with that tradition, which has been built up over many years.</P>
      <P>While I support the regulations, I agree with the Commission on Liquor Licensing that this country&rsquo;s drinking culture is of serious concern to us all. The problems which exist in this regard need to be addressed. The Government has dropped its proposal to promote caf&eacute; bars. I would not like a plethora of off-licences to mushroom throughout the country. I am concerned by the Government&rsquo;s decision to allow wine to be sold anywhere without any type of permission from any source. I support the regulations before the House, by and large.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to share time with Senator Brady, with the permission of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Roche. Like Senator Terry, I thank him for staying in the House for this debate. I agree with the Senator that the proposal in these regulations that one should have to seek planning permission if one wishes to change the use of a commercial property from a shop to an off-licence is to be welcomed. Senators have raised this matter with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the context of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2000. The Minister, Deputy McDowell, is anxious for Members to discuss the matter further. Like his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, he is interested in the views of community representatives and members of local authorities about off-licences.</P>
      <P>When I read some briefing material about these regulations yesterday, I formed the opinion that establishments selling wine should be required to seek planning permission. Off-licences often sell many bottles of wine for a knock-down price. The Minister, Deputy Roche, quite rightly pointed out that the development of the off-licence sector is a matter of serious concern. It would not bother me if shops selling wine were to be included under these regulations.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the issue of supervision in off-licences. Adults can take crates of alcoholic drinks from off-licences, but that is not possible in pubs. Under-age drinking is facilitated when drinks taken from off-licences in such circumstances end up in the hands of young people. I question the level of supervision in off-licences. I am also worried about the late opening of off-licences, a matter that is not addressed in the <Col N="2498"/>regulations. Senators have spoken to the Minister, Deputy McDowell, about that matter.</P>
      <P>As someone who comes from a village called Lehenagh, which translates as &ldquo;half a bog&rdquo;, I am an expert on the development of bogs and the cutting of turf. I assure the House that I live in the half of Lehenagh that is not a bog, thankfully. If one lived in a bog nowadays, one would be on very unsure ground. When I was involved with the bishops&rsquo; conference on the development of the west 20 years ago, I was asked by an astute farmer if I agreed that the day would come when one would have to get planning permission to cut turf. That was an emotive topic for Deputy Gilmore, who comes from the same parish as me, during the debate on the regulations in the D&aacute;il yesterday.</P>
      <P>If one cuts 24.71 acres of bog each year, one will have a great deal of turf. I do not know what one will do with it all. I accept the Minister&rsquo;s promise that family turf-cutting is safe. The farmer to whom I spoke 20 years ago was probably right to suggest that planning permission will be needed for a certain level of turf-cutting. I presume that we are talking about industrial levels of peat extraction, to be used to produce energy in power stations, for example. I am sure that, like me, the Acting Chairman is acquainted with farmers who are involved in family turf-cutting operations, although there is not much bog in Wexford. Such operations usually involve smaller portions of bog.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister, Deputy Roche, for helping farmers who had to stop cutting turf because their lands had been declared as special areas of conservation. I have been pursuing the issue of the heritage area buy-out scheme for some time. As I said to the Minister previously, people who stopped cutting turf in 2004 received up to &euro;3,500 an acre and &euro;3,000 for subsequent acres. It was very unfair that such people were given a much better deal than people who stopped cutting turf in 1999. The latter group of people, who co-operated quickly with the Department, received a lesser deal at first. The Minister eliminated that inequality by applying the consumer price index level to those who stopped cutting when their lands were declared as SACs or heritage areas.</P>
      <P>I first heard about the Aarhus directive some years ago when controversy arose in County Galway about incinerators and private and public landfill sites. Everybody was quoting the directive, which relates to environmental impact assessments, at that time. The controversy has come to an end, thankfully, because we know where the private and public landfill sites will be located. Incineration continues to be an issue, however. We learned something about the Aarhus directive when people quoted it quite freely at meetings. We will probably hear more about the directive in the context of the campaign to develop an airstrip at Clifden in the heart of west Galway. I hope the directive will not prevent the acceptance of the proposal to build an extended runway. The development of an airstrip <Col N="2499"/>would assist the development of the Clifden area, especially as the railway service in the area was closed some years ago. The roads in west Galway are getting better, but a small airstrip in the area would be of great benefit to the local people.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for introducing these regulations. I hope he will give the House some more information about the issues I have raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Kitt for agreeing to share time with me. I would like to make a couple of points about off-licences. There has been an explosion in the proliferation of off-licences in the centre of Dublin city and its suburbs in recent years. Furniture shops and small tea shops have been turned into off-licences overnight. I know of a substantial property in the Phibsboro area that was being used to sell property in Spain, but was converted into a full off-licence overnight.</P>
      <P>Shopping centre developments seem to have large off-licence outlets attached to them as a matter of course. I do not think that the regulation of such outlets, which are very open, is as strict as the regulation of ordinary off-licences, such as an off-licence that is attached to a pub. There are issues in that regard. I have spoken to the Minister about the sale of alcohol from retail outlets at garage forecourts. We are spending serious money on trying to convince people not to drink and drive, but we are not doing much to discourage the sale of alcohol from off-licences located at garage forecourts. I do not suggest that we are encouraging people to drink and drive.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I welcome the timely changes being made in the regulations. The Minister has spoken about the consequences and effects of the abuse and misuse of alcohol, particularly among young people. Adults are to blame in many cases because they purchase alcohol for young people in off-licences. It is a matter of regulation. The key aspect is to continue to control the proliferation of off-licences. I bow to Senator Kitt&rsquo;s knowledge and expertise in the area of turf. As a city boy, I always thought it automatically came in briquette form. I thank the Minister for his views, particularly on off-licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Members for their contributions. On the issue of alcohol sales, I have introduced these controls to deal with the change in the use of a shop where a substantial part of the trade is in the off-licence sector. It will have the impact Senator Terry and Senator Brady desire. No one wants to be a killjoy or interfere with consumer choice, but there must be control in this area. My long held view is that this was a blatant anomaly, therefore, I indicated early on that I would introduce this regulation. I am pleased I have the support of Members of this House.</P>
      <P>On the issue of wine sales, this is currently dealt with under the wine licences regulations. <Col N="2500"/>These, in turn, are dealt with by the Revenue Commissioners. Under the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, all licences will be brought together and dealt with by the courts. This is one of the positive and progressive aspects with which the Minister, Deputy McDowell, will be dealing in the legislation. I agree with Senator Terry that alcohol is alcohol. While there is an irresponsible attitude to its massive over-consumption, unfortunately, we will have to proceed by way of regulation. I cannot deal with this issue because it is an ancillary to the main business of petrol stations. Regardless of my personal views, I cannot go into that area.</P>
      <P>Senator Kitt referred to young people getting their hands on crates of alcohol. This will continue to happen. It happened last summer and the summer before that. There have been difficulties throughout the country in this regard. I examined how this aspect is controlled in other countries. For example, if one is buying large supplies of alcohol, such as a crate or two crates of beer, from an off-licence or any other establishment in the United States, it is bar coded. There is a bar code on the bottom of every crate and every can, and one must produce identification. The bar code is read, the purchaser&rsquo;s name and details are recorded, and if it ends up in the hands of a minor, one will find oneself in difficulties. Senator Brady made the point, and rightly so, that there is need for responsibility among more adult members of the population who currently supply young people with alcohol. Even though I would like to have control over these matters, they fall outside the remit of my office. There is a consciousness in Government of the points made.</P>
      <P>I also bow to Senator Kitt&rsquo;s superior knowledge of cutting turf. While I was aware that turf did not always come in briquette form &mdash; I am a few years older than Senator Brady and I married a woman from Mayo where turf-cutting is very important &mdash; the Senator made the point that it would be a very unusual small holder who would cut 24.7 acres of turf. I am trying to strike a balance here. Remember where we are in terms of our difficulties with Europe. While we have enacted a lot of European legislation, we have not transposed it satisfactorily into Irish law. An issue has arisen here, therefore, we will find ourselves before the court and paying substantial daily fines if we cannot assure the Commission, which is the body that polices the operations of the laws we have all enacted in Europe. That is why this change is being introduced.</P>
      <P>I was amused yesterday to hear Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s contribution because I was not aware of turf-cutting to any extent in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown. Of course, he was harking back to the home place. Now that I have clarified the position, no doubt he will be truthful in any debate when dealing with the issue. However, that is for another day. I assure the Senator that it is not the intention to have a negative impact on small individuals. A threshold of ten hectares, or 24.7 acres, is a substantial amount of turf-cutting.</P><Col N="2501"/>
      <P>The regulations make common sense. The third one arises from technical changes in the other House. There is a lesson for us all in this. If we are to deal with technical issues such as this, it would be better if we dealt with them by sitting down in the most civilised manner possible in a committee &mdash; not that this House has been anything other than civilised. I commend the regulations to the House. The changes, particularly the change on off-licences, will be widely welcomed by communities experiencing the type of problems the Senators outlined.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to bring the Civil Registration (Amendment) Bill 2005 before the House. The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Civil Registration Act 2004 to provide for the continuation of payment of allowances and fees to private registrars of births, marriages and deaths.</P>
      <P>In addition to registrars directly employed by the HSE, there are approximately 50 private registrars appointed under the registration of births, deaths and marriages Acts to their own designated districts. The majority are private individuals and general practitioners, who provide the service from private residences and private offices. Some private registrars are HSE employees, such as community welfare officers, who perform registration functions in addition to, but separate from, their substantive appointments. All registration staff, including private registrars, will be reappointed on commencement of the provisions of the Civil Registration Act 2004. This is a minor technical amendment but it is essential to facilitate the commencement of the 2004 Act.</P>
      <P>As Members will be aware, the Civil Registration Act 2004 was passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas and signed into law in February 2004. I would like to remind the House of the purpose of the Act. The main objectives of the Act are as follows: to rationalise and modernise the procedures for registering births, stillbirths and deaths; to give an tArd Chl&aacute;raitheoir responsibility for the overall policy for the Civil Registration Service, including maintaining stan<Col N="2502"/>dards of service; assign responsibility for the management of the Civil Registration Service at local level to the Health Service Executive; to streamline the procedures for the registration of adoptions; to establish new registers of divorce and civil nullity; and to reform the procedures governing the registration of marriages and facilitate the linking of life events.</P>
      <P>Civil registration was first introduced in Ireland in 1845 for the registration of non-Catholic marriages and extended in 1864 to births, deaths and Roman Catholic marriages. Thus, a comprehensive registration system has been in place since 1864. The registers form a basic, continuous source of information about the population by providing a record of vital events relating to people and satisfying the need for evidence which has a bearing on rights, entitlements, liabilities, status and nationality. The registers were subsequently extended to adoptions and stillbirths.</P>
      <P>Civil registration touches on each of us at important stages in our lives, beginning with the registration of our births and ending when our deaths are registered. Between these events, civil registration affects us both directly, as in the case of marriage, or indirectly, when certificates are required for many of the services available in our society, such as enrolling a child in school, obtaining a passport, taking up employment and claiming a social welfare payment.</P>
      <P>While there has been little change to the basic registration procedures since 1864, there have been many changes in our society, major developments in technology, and increased expectations on the part of citizens as to how public services should be delivered. Recognising the importance of civil registration and acknowledging the changing needs of our society, the Government approved a programme of work to modernise the Civil Registration Service. The civil registration modernisation programme is a joint initiative between the Department of Health and Children, which oversees the administration of the Civil Registration Service, and the Department of Social and Family Affairs which processed the Civil Registration Act 2004. This is a major undertaking involving the introduction of modern technology providing on-line registration, electronic certificate production and the capture of digitised signatures; a redesign of business processes and procedures; capturing and storing in electronic format all paper-based records from 1845 and a reform of legislation.</P>
      <P>There will be substantial benefits, both tangible and intangible, arising from the modernisation programme. These include improved service to customers, for example extended opening times; greater efficiency in the use of resources and reduction in red tape; nationwide standards for registering life events; the registration of divorces and civil annulments on a central register; the electronic capture and transmission of all vital statistics on life events to the Central Statistics Office; the sharing of data with designated Government Departments and agencies; and a reduction in the demand for paper certificates for the purposes of Government services.</P><Col N="2503"/>
      <P>Until now, the registration and certificate production processes were manual, time consuming and location dependent. The modernisation programme marks a fundamental change in the way the Civil Registration Service operates and is delivering significant improvements in operational efficiency and customer satisfaction throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the House that the new computer system is fully rolled out across the entire country with electronic registration and certificate production available in all registration offices. It might also interest Senators to know that the system has been recognised nationally and internationally as an example of excellence in e-Government and public service provision.</P>
      <P>The modernisation programme aims to deliver a high quality, proactive service to customers. Since September 2003, all new birth registration data is transferred electronically to the Department of Social and Family Affairs from the civil registration computer system. This facilitates the allocation of a personal public service number, PPS, to a child at registration; the establishment of a child&rsquo;s public service identity and the creation of family links on the national central database for all citizens &mdash; the client records system which is administered by the Department of Social and Family Affairs; and the initiation of a child benefit claim for first-born children and the automatic payment for second and subsequent children in a family. In essence, payment of child benefit in respect of a baby born and registered by the Civil Registration System on a Monday is made, or the mother is contacted, by the following Thursday without any manual intervention. This is a prime example of the e-Government objective of Departments working together to provide more convenient access to services for citizens.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the new Civil Registration System is therefore a flagship initiative in providing life-centred services to customers. The visible improvement from the customer perspective is that a single interaction with a public service agency, for example, the registration of a birth not only achieves its original purpose, but also triggers a series of related services by another agency, in this case the Department of Social and Family Affairs. Customers availing of the e-enabled service no longer have to source and complete a multi-paged paper application form and supply a paper birth certificate. They simply have to register the baby&rsquo;s birth to set the process in motion.</P>
      <P>In many cases, the birth notification is passed electronically from the hospital to the registration computer system, and this facility will be implemented for all maternity hospitals in the future. In this case, the birth details are captured just once, at the earliest point in the process, with seamless electronic data transmission from hospital to registration to child benefit and back again to registration with the PPS number.</P>
      <P>In conjunction with GRO, the REACH Agency electronically publishes deaths data and this data is available to all Government agencies. <Col N="2504"/>This is of particular importance for the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the HSE for the efficient and effective management of their services. Vital statistics are transmitted electronically to the CSO. This greatly reduces the amount of manual intervention involved in such exercises, improves the quality of data and enhances the ability of the CSO to manage the data.</P>
      <P>The capture of historic data in electronic format has been a central element of the modernisation programme. This has been a mammoth task, involving the digitisation of over 27 million records and 5 million registration images. The technology used in the process is first rate, and I commend all the staff for their efforts over the years in what has been a difficult and painstaking task.</P>
      <P>I am especially pleased to inform the House that the decentralisation of the GRO to Roscommon has been successfully achieved. A new office building has been provided which accommodates a number of Departments based in Roscommon. The building includes purpose-built archival storage, with up-to-date technology, providing a secure facility for vital historical records. A new staffing structure has been put in place in the registration service of the HSE, and extended opening hours are in operation in most of the main registration offices. I am pleased at the way the registration staff have embraced the new challenge and I am confident that their continued commitment will ensure a first class registration service in the years to come.</P>
      <P>A significant investment will be made in bringing genealogical research facilities up to modern standards. Discussions are under way with the OPW with a view to procuring new premises and facilities for research. The research facility will remain in Dublin and will be supported by a dedicated staff of eight. It is also intended to introduce electronic research in the new location. Those with an interest in tracing their roots will be able to search through records much faster and will be able to view the original register entries which have been digitally scanned onto the system. It is hoped eventually to introduce internet-based research which will be available to a world-wide audience.</P>
      <P>With all of these developments now in place, the stage has been reached where it will soon be possible to commence parts of the Civil Registration Act 2004. In the course of preparatory work towards commencement, legal advice was received to the effect that the Act needs to be amended to allow for the continuation of payment of fees and allowances to private registrars and the Bill is a necessary amendment to allow this to happen. The purpose of the Bill is to insert a new section 67A into the Act to enable fees and allowances to be paid to private registrars and to provide for the necessary administrative arrangements. During drafting of the commencement and related orders for the Civil Registration Act 2004, it had been intended to provide for these payments to be made on an administrative basis. However, when the draft orders were submitted to the legal adviser, the advice given was that a <Col N="2505"/>specific statutory provision would be required. This advice was confirmed by the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>Parts 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8 of the Act relate to the administration of the Civil Registration Service and to the registration of births, stillbirths and deaths. Preparatory work to commence these provisions is at an advanced stage and the passing of the Bill will allow them to be commenced within a matter of months.</P>
      <P>The new procedures for marriage are set out in Part 6 of the Act and include universal procedures for notification, solemnisation and registration of marriages, as well as a choice of venue for civil marriages. Before these provisions can be commenced, a substantial body of work needs to be completed, including the folllowing: the drafting and publication of regulations, guidelines and detailed procedures; the establishment of a register of solemnisers in consultation with religious bodies; the establishment of a register of approved venues for civil marriages; and the further development of the computer system to facilitate the administration of the new marriage procedures introduced by the Act. Implementation of the other provisions, relating to registration of adoptions, divorces and civil nullity, will follow commencement of the marriage provisions.</P>
      <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill and the amendment proposed to the Civil Registration Act 2004. It allows registrars not employed by the HSE, and employees of the HSE who are not registrars, to receive payment.</P>
      <P>Approximately two hours ago the House debated the Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2005 and discussed the updating of it on a regular basis. Great advancements have been made in this area. I suggested that it must be possible for the relevant Departments to pass on information such as death certificates to each other. There seems to be a complete lack of communication from the Department of Social and Family Affairs in this regard. Families are often sent large bills from that Department because they are in receipt of benefits or allowances on behalf of a person who has recently died to which they are not entitled.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to pursue with the relevant Departments the problem of people remaining on the electoral register even though they have passed away. The Civil Registration Service, however, is undoubtedly doing good work in many areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State. While this is a short Bill, it is, nevertheless, important because until it is passed, the 2004 Act cannot be implemented. The legislation covers the registration of births, deaths, marriages, adoptions, divorces and civil annulments. Recently, my colleague, Senator Leyden, introduced a Private Members&rsquo; Bill pertaining to wills, which is an important issue. Unless decisions are properly registered and the appropriate documentation used, significant difficulties could be created for <Col N="2506"/>people down the line. The Minister of State referred to private individuals who provide the registration service and who are not directly employed by the State and to the service provided by community welfare officers and general practitioners. These people are important and the legislation provides for them to paid. All registration staff, including private registrars, will be reappointed upon the commencement of the Civil Registration Act 2004.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State referred to the background to the legislation, which, while short, has great potential, as it will be the engine of the 2004 legislation. Following legal advice submitted to the Attorney General, it was confirmed the only way to resolve the difficulties was to amend the 2004 Act. The transfer of the General Register Office to Roscommon is another example of the Government&rsquo;s success with its decentralisation programme. I welcome the legislation whose implications are tremendous. It will regularise a scenario, which should have been regularised a long time ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the legislation. However, I am concerned the Government still has not addressed the issue of children born through a surrogacy arrangement in Ireland or abroad, which is more complicated.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister of State had read the report of the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction but it addresses the major problem of surrogacy, particularly where the child is born abroad. Following the reporting of high profile cases in the press, we are aware such children are entering the State. However, it is difficult for them to obtain a personal public service number and other documentation that flows from that. It is impossible to register a number of these children under adoption legislation because a financial arrangement has been entered into regarding their births. While the commissioning couple may be regarded as the legal parents of the child, a number of the children may be in a dangerous position.</P>
      <P>The Guardianship of Infants Act has been used by some fathers to give them guardianship of a surrogate child but the mother has no legal right over the child in this State. I am concerned that the introduction of legislation to address this problem will continue to drift. I first raised the issue in 1999 and it will drift until a dreadful high profile case ends up in the courts, following which it will be addressed. I hope this will not happen but I despair that another way to address this issue will be found. Given the complexities of legislation that would be required to address human assisted reproduction, this issue will not be dealt with separately.</P>
      <P>A number of children who were born to surrogate mothers are in their teens and their parents are getting older. There could be bereavements and disputes over inheritance rights and so on. What thought has the Government put into the issue? Children are involved and their rights are important in the context of this issue, not the niceties of our views on surrogacy and so on. What progress is the Government making to <Col N="2507"/>ensure they have the same legal rights as other citizens?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and his senior officials, Kieran Feely and Pat Patterson, who is the registrar of deaths, births and still births. Both of them are located in decentralised offices at Convent Road, Roscommon. I welcome Mr. Feely back to the House, as he previously worked in the Department of Post and Telegraphs and other Departments and he is an experienced official.</P>
      <P>I welcome the legislation and I thank the Minister of State for bringing it forward in such an expeditious manner. The primary Act was passed last year and it cautiously and carefully ensures funds are fully authorised, which is worthwhile. On Tuesday, I published the Registration of Wills Bill 2005. I hope the Minister of State and his officials will return in the autumn to accept the Bill.</P>
      <P>I was contacted by Shannonside Radio earlier regarding the beautiful new building at Convent Road, Roscommon, to which the General Register Office has been decentralised. It is staffed by officials of the Departments of Health and Children and Agriculture and Food. Concerns regarding the second floor of the building were brought to my attention. It is not in use because of a potential structural defect. I was briefed fully on this matter by an official of the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department and I would like to allay the fears of my constituents and the public, who are interested in this matter. The building was provided by McLoughlins-Marmac at a cost of &euro;10 million. However, the Office of Public Works will ensure difficulties that have arisen will be addressed before the building is fully taken over. Senior structural engineers from the OPW visited the building earlier and they will ensure it has been built in accordance with its specification and design. A meeting was also held earlier between the chief fire officer of County Roscommon and officials of Marmac. I visited the new facility last Monday.</P>

	<P>I wish to allay the fears of the public because this is a perfectly good building and it will house the GRO. There is no point amending legislation if the officials implementing it are not in a safe, sound, well designed building, which is a credit to the Department of Finance and the staff who managed the project. There would be no point bringing forward a Bill today or a change in legislation if the officials administering the Bill did not work in a safe, sound, well-designed building. It is beautiful and a credit to the Minister of State, the Office of Public Works and its staff.</P><Col N="2508"/>
      <P>Certain works are being carried out on the stairs leading to the second floor and other areas. There are two fire escape staircases and a lift. People tend to exaggerate the difficulties that arise, particularly in light of events surrounding a swimming pool in this city. I wish to allay their fears.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister of State will expedite the decentralisation of the Land Registry to Roscommon to make it the central location for registration of deaths, marriages, stillbirths, land registry and wills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister of State and his officials on the Bill. Senator Henry referred to the Minister of State&rsquo;s comment on streamlining the procedure for adoptions as a reminder that we have not yet covered the issue of surrogacy. I support her comments. Perhaps it is one of the benefits of having a second House that there is a chance to look again at legislation.</P>
      <P>This Bill would not be before us if we had thought this through last year when the previous Bill came before us. It is a reminder of the danger of putting a Bill through the House speedily, without giving it full attention. The Minister of State explained the system of registration very well this evening.</P>
      <P>I have attended some weddings in France where the civil registrar is different from the celebrant of the other ceremony and the bride and groom must visit the registry as well as attend the other ceremony. It is interesting to note that in 1863 we established the priest as the registrar for a marriage. That was an innovative way of thinking for that time and it has worked.</P>
      <P>I have recently been impressed by the service provided by the Passport Office. When I first came into the House some years ago it was very difficult to get a passport on time. Since the office installed modern technology and got on top of the work it has run efficiently. The same technology and ability to speed things up electronically will apply to the civil registration process, as the Minister of State explained.</P>
      <P>Genealogy and the ability to trace one&rsquo;s relatives offers several benefits. I have met many tourists and Americans who wished to come here to trace their relatives and have not been easily able to do so. I was impressed when I visited the National Archives a couple of years ago to check up on my father-in-law. He was born in 1899 and cherished the ambition to live to be 100 and a few months in order to have lived during three centuries. He was anxious to achieve this as few people had done so but he died at the age of 93. He said of my father, who was born in 1902, &ldquo;That so-and-so would have to be 198 to achieve the same thing&rdquo;, which he unfortunately did not achieve either.</P>
      <P>It is impressive to see the many benefits of this research. I mention only a few. The Minister of State specified the linking of life events. That could not have been done with the old paper system but can be done electronically. I have full confidence that this will work because the effort has been made to ensure it does. I congratulate the Minister of State and his officials for thinking <Col N="2509"/>in this way and for the manner in which they have carried out the idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Members of the House for their interest in, and comments on, the legislation and for the co-operation from the Whips and the Seanad officials in agreeing to allow the legislation be introduced at short notice.</P>
      <P>The comments about the strides in terms of efficiency are valid and I appreciate them. The Civil Service held a showcase event at which elements of 20 Departments toured the country. The register of deaths and births, particularly births, was shown for its efficiency. It is a superb streamlining of the service and is the way of the future. One might expect Intel, Google or other private operators to do their business in this way but civil servants have shown they can compete efficiently with those operators.</P>
      <P>Senator Leyden has allayed many fears that may have been unfounded. I hope people take note of his words.</P>
      <P>The 2004 Act cannot be commenced without this proposed amendment. The introduction of the marriage provisions, including the choice of marriage venues, would be further delayed without it. Surnames of children born to parents who are not married to one another but who subsequently marry cannot be changed. This often results in children of the same family having different surnames which causes distress for the families involved, particularly in regard to school and contact with public agencies.</P>
      <P>The delay in commencing the Act causes continuing difficulties for the General Register Office and the Civil Registration Service generally. The continued reliance on old and fragmented legislation, much of it dating back to the 19th century, poses ongoing problems for the GRO and the general public and is not geared to the needs of a modern society.</P>
      <P>It is obvious from the debate that Members recognise the vital importance of civil registration legislation and its effect on our lives as individuals and the wider society. I assure Members that their comments are noted and will make a valuable contribution to the future development of the civil registration policy, in particular the comments about surrogacy. It is the case that all births can be and are registered but the points Senator Henry raised about the particular difficulty this entails will be noted too.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that owing to time pressures it is not possible to respond in detail to all of the points raised but there was a lengthy and thorough debate on registration issues during the passage of the Civil Registration Act in January and February 2004. I thank Members for bringing their concerns about civil registration before the House and for their co-operation in ensuring this vital technical amendment to the Civil<?oasys _jy?>Registration Act passed swiftly through the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I will address my remarks through the Acting Chairman.</P>
      <P>Thankfully, staff in the Seanad office take very careful record of when they receive an Adjournment issue, when it is stamped and comes back from the Department. That record exists.</P>
      <P>Second, the idea that I should seek to upstage the Minister of State shows that he has some opinion of himself. I have every intention of saying that in other fora. He has some opinion of himself to suggest that because he was to visit Athlone I should run to put down an Adjournment matter. Now I have heard it all.</P>
      <P>I have asked questions about Athlone, Longford and Mullingar simply because what I would call scare stories are proliferating about whether jobs are coming so that no one is clear who is coming, when, or what it is all about. While there are big signs advertising decentralisation, we lack all sense of direction on the matter.</P>
      <P>I wish it to be recorded that we in Athlone secured Athlone as the first town in the country to get decentralisation, in 1977 from the Department of Education. My own brother &mdash; God rest him &mdash; had initiated it when he was Minister. It did not come through until 1977, in the shape of the examinations branch in Athlone. The idea that we will be overwhelmed by someone running around putting up posters is laughable. We then secured special educational needs when I was Minister for Education in 1991. Currently 330 employees of the Department of Education and Science are working &mdash; I hope, happily, but at any rate fruitfully &mdash; in decentralised offices in Athlone.</P>
      <P>I am very keen to know when the numbers outlined in the Budget Statement will come through. I hope that the matter is entirely voluntary. I expect it to be the case, since the Minister has <Col N="2512"/>stressed that throughout. That goes for Longford and Mullingar also. I want to know the status of the proposals, how many jobs will go to each town, the properties to which they are going, the locus of each decentralisation project, and how far advanced are the plans. Each town is very keen to know the proposals, and scare stories have been proliferating that it is not going to happen. I am sure that is not true.</P>
      <P>Let me repeat that on Tuesday at 1 p.m. I submitted this matter for the Adjournment. I said that I would not be able to attend on Wednesday but that I could attend on Thursday. It was stamped as having been received in the relevant Department about 20 minutes later. Some six hours later I met the Minister of State in the corridor. Let me say again that the idea that I should exert myself in trying to upstage him is something else.</P>

	<P>As soon as the House rises and we have time to get around the country to unveil the sites, we will do so. I wish to make it very clear that the scare stories do not exist in the way that the Senator said and that we have bought sites. Next week we intend to unveil signs in Newcastle West, Killarney, Clonakilty, Athlone, Longford, Knock, Tullamore and Portlaoise, with further sites following immediately thereafter. That will give rise to public confidence that decentralisation is progressing and going ahead.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to attend this evening to address Senators once again on the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme. I reiterate that the Government is firmly committed to the full implementation of the decentralisation programme and is very pleased with the progress which has been achieved over the past 18 months. The headquarters of the Department of Education and Science is decentralising to Mullingar, with a total of 298 posts. During the priority period for applications up to 7 September 2004, 247 applications were received for Mullingar through the central applications facility, which is now widely known as the CAF. Some 68 of those applications are from existing staff of the Department. In addition, 11 new entrants have accepted formal offers to transfer to Mullingar.</P>
      <P>In addition to the transfer of its headquarters to Mullingar, 103 posts in the Department of Education and Science will transfer to Athlone, where there is already a large section of the Department, as the Senator stated. A total of 87 people applied through the CAF during the priority period for applications. Of those, 22 are already employed by the Department of Education. In addition, 12 new entrants have accepted formal offers to transfer to Athlone.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science has completed a second and deeper iteration of its implementation plan, which has been submitted to the decentralisation implementation group. The Higher Education Authority will also decentralise to Athlone, with 54 posts. There were 23 applications for posts in the decentralised organisation during the priority period for applications. I understand that no formal offers have yet been made to staff.</P>
      <P>As the Senators know, responsibility for the decentralisation of the Department of Education and Science to both Mullingar and Athlone, and of the Higher Education Authority to Athlone, lies with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin. The Irish Prison Service will decentralise to Longford, with 160 staff. A total of 150 people applied through the CAF for Longford during the priority period for applications. Formal offers have been made and accepted by 26 staff who have undertaken to transfer to Longford. In addition, one new entrant accepted a formal offer to transfer to <Col N="2514"/>Longford. The Irish Prison Service has prepared an updated implementation plan, which has been received by the decentralisation implementation group. I reiterate that the implementation of the decentralisation programme where the Irish Prison Service is concerned lies with the relevant Minister, who in this case is the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell.</P>
      <P>When the last report of the decentralisation implementation group was published in November 2004, indicative dates were provided in respect of each location. I understand that a further progress report will be presented to the Minister for Finance shortly which will provide an update on all the property, people and business issues. Decentralisation and the movement of State employment from Dublin will help provide for the economic and social development of the midland region, which has not benefited as much as Dublin from the recent economic success. The Government&rsquo;s hope is that the decentralisation programme will serve as a catalyst for further economic benefit in provincial Ireland. The public servants who opt for decentralisation will also experience quality-of-life gains as they return to family and friends, and lower commuting times between home and work.</P>

    <Title>Pension Provisions.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House for this very important matter. We have seen considerable change in the set-up of local authorities over the last few years, something introduced by Deputy Noel Dempsey when he was Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Since that period, however, many things have moved on, particularly regarding pensions. We have seen how a previous Minister for Finance, former Deputy McCreevy, brought them to the top of the agenda. However, we find now that remunerated local authority members who pay PAYE and PRSI have no pensions even though employers are duty bound to put pension plans in place for employees. Most local authority members, including county councillors and borough councillors, most of whom work full-time for their local authority, have no pension plan. They get a gratuity when they retire, whether after five years or 30 years, but have no pension. The Government is correct to put the responsibility on employers to provide pension plans for employees because all of us, as we grow older, need the security of an adequate pension. Public representatives are employees of the local authority, as indicated by their payslips.</P>
      <P>In view of the stringent controls being placed on employers in regard to pension provision, I hope the State will not renege on its responsibility <Col N="2515"/>in this regard. We have seen cases, most recently in regard to elderly people in nursing homes, where the State has been obliged to repay benefits that were due. We do not want to find in 20 or 30 years time that cases can be taken against the State because of its failure to put the proper mechanisms in place to provide pensions for local authority members.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to give a progressive response to this matter and ask that it be put at the top of the agenda, as it should be. We must deal with the situation of those local authority members, many of whom are employed in a full-time capacity, who pay PAYE and PRSI but have no pension plan and no prospect that such a plan will be put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue. The local government modernisation programme has seen major improvements in the range and extent of the financial and other supports available to local elected members. These include a representational payment scheme and gratuity arrangements for retiring councillors. Both were introduced following extensive consultations with the three local government associations.</P>
      <P>The representational payment is linked to salary and stands at &euro;15,330 per annum for county and city councillors. The scheme gives practical recognition to the civic contribution local elected members make to their community. It is not meant to be a salary nor is it intended to remove the important voluntary community service aspect of the work of councillors.</P>
      <P>In regard to gratuity arrangements, a number of superannuation options for local authority members were examined following the enactment of the Local Government Act 2001. The option considered most appropriate was the retirement gratuity arrangement which was subsequently introduced in 2002. I will briefly outline some of the main features of these arrangements for the benefit of the House. The maximum gratuity is three times the rate of representational payment on the member&rsquo;s date of retirement and is payable after 20 years service. The maximum service allowable is 20 years with a minimum qualifying service of three years.</P>
      <P>The gratuity is automatically paid on retirement at or after the age of 50 but payment before age 50 may be made where retirement is due to permanent infirmity or where the member dies in office. In the case of retirement due to permanent infirmity, added years may be allowed. Where a person ceases to be a member before the age of 50, whether voluntarily or as a result of failure to be re-elected, the gratuity will be paid when the person reaches age 50 and will be based on the representational payment applicable at that point.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied there is no basis for changing the existing arrangements for a number of reasons. First, the maximum gratuity, payable after 20 years service, compares favourably with the yield from a defined contribution pension plan, based <Col N="2516"/>on a 10% employer contribution and a 5% member contribution, and standard public service pension scheme entitlements for a person with 20 years service. Second, the gratuity arrangement provides for universal coverage. A survey of pension arrangements for councillors in other countries showed that in most cases, only certain councillors, usually full-time or employed by larger authorities, are covered.</P>
      <P>The gratuity arrangements are free, fair and flexible. They are free because members are not required to contribute. They are fair in the sense that they give coverage to all elected members, unlike in other countries, and give a level of benefit which compares favourably with standard public and private sector pension arrangements. The arrangements are flexible in that members receive the benefit in the form of a gratuity which is tax free in most instances and which they can use, if they wish, to purchase a personal pension, whether by way of an annuity, PRSA or otherwise.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the retirement gratuity is the superannuation arrangement best suited to the particular circumstances of local authority members. Accordingly, the introduction of a local authority-provided pension for members is not considered appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Acting Chairman, Senator Jim Walsh, has played an important part in improving conditions for local authority members through the Local Authority Members Association, LAMA. I am disappointed with the Minister of State&rsquo;s response. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is in breach of the regulations it has stipulated for employers in regard to pensions. If the LAMA, the General Council of County Councils or the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland, AMAI, take a case against the State on this matter, they are likely to win. The Minister should, as a matter of urgency, meet with local authority members through the general council or the AMAI with a view to putting a pension plan in place for local authority members.</P>

    <Title>Commemorative Events.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Treacy. The issue I wish to discuss is the need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs, on behalf of the Government, to promote a national minute of silence to be observed at 11.02 a.m. on 9 August, the 60th anniversary of the last major catastrophe of the Second World War, the bombing of<?oasys _jy?>Nagasaki city, in order that Ireland may join in similar commemorations across the world.</P>
      <P>I raise this issue on the suggestion of Mr.<?oasys _jy?>Gear&oacute;id Duffy, to whom I am grateful. On 9 August, a World Culture of Peace Day has been organised in Cork as part of its European capital of culture celebrations. The significance of this date is that it is the 60th anniversary of the bombing of Nagasaki city, the last major catastrophe of the Second World War. It is an anniversary that will deservedly be marked in various ways throughout the world. I am sure we in this House applaud the action Cork has taken in this matter. I suggest to the Government that it embrace this action and turn what will be essentially a local commemoration into a national event that will reach out to all citizens.</P>
      <P>I suggest this can be done by declaring a national minute of silence which would take place at 11.02 a.m., the time the bomb exploded at Nagasaki. It would be a simple gesture which would cost nothing to organise but could have a very worthwhile effect. I am 68 years of age and was therefore only eight years old when this catastrophe occurred. I have no memory at all of it. It is therefore safe to say that, for the vast majority of people in this country and certainly for all our young people, the event is a matter of history. However, we should not allow ourselves to forget this history, although it is all too easy to do so.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The dangers of forgetting our recent history were exemplified in the recent referenda on the EU constitution. The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs attended the marvellous address by the European Commission President, Mr. Barroso. The younger generation has forgotten that the EU first came into being in an effort to avoid future war in Europe. That is a pity because it provides a powerful underpinning for the whole European project and justifies all the troubles we encounter along the way. Similarly, it would be wrong and dangerous for us to forget the incredible havoc that the nuclear weapons wreak, an historical example of which were the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Those events profoundly affected the history of the following half century. While I grew up and during much of my adult life, the threat of nuclear war was real and it remained so until the end of the Cold War 15 years ago.</P>
      <?oasys _cl10.5-?>
      <P>Since then, the threat has retreated to the back of the public consciousness, which is remarkable because it has not disappeared. Indeed, due to <Col N="2518"/>the new form being taken, the threat is far more likely to become a reality. During the Cold War, the balance of power between the United States and the Soviet Union resulted in a stalemate. Now the threat of nuclear weapons comes not from two superpowers vying with each other but from smaller states who are far less likely to be neutralised in a stalemate similar to that of the Cold War. Today, Israel has nuclear weapons at its disposal, as do both India and Pakistan. As we all know, North Korea and possibly Iran are in the process of developing nuclear capabilities. As these terrible weapons proliferate, the danger that they will actually be used in warfare increases exponentially. We are all inclined to bash the United States these days, perhaps for good reason, but we cannot deny that the US Government is alert to the threat. Any policy differences we may have with America should not blind us to the reality of the threat and that it is in our interest it does not come to fruition.</P>
      <P>In this matter I do not call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs to dismantle the nuclear threat that faces the world today. For all his qualities, I fear that task would be beyond him. I am calling for a national gesture of a moral kind which would raise awareness of the issue while demonstrating where we in Ireland stand. A national minute of peace would be observed in the interests of honouring the dead, injured, bereaved, traumatised and dispossessed of all wars and to keep one eye on the future. It would be a minute during which we can ask ourselves whether we are doing all we can to put in place the skills of peace in our own lives and in our communities, as well as internationally. I commend this proposal to the Minister of State.</P>

	<P>Is c&uacute;is &aacute;thais dom deis a bheith agam freastal ar an &aacute;bhar t&aacute;bhachtach idirn&aacute;isi&uacute;nta seo. The question of whether Ireland should commemorate the 60th anniversary of the bombing of Nagasaki was addressed by the Taoiseach in a reply to a parliamentary question on 24 May. In his reply, the Taoiseach indicated that he does not envisage an official event being organised in Ireland to mark this event. He recalled that a commemorative event is held annually at Merrion Square, Dublin, usually on Hiroshima Day, 6 August, which he commended to all people concerned.</P>
      <P>Nobody could doubt the terrible nature of the events in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which brought an end to a World War marked by death, destruction and atrocity on an unparalleled scale. However, it has not been the practice in Ireland to organise national commemorations to mark the anniversary of particular events of that dreadful passage in the history of mankind. Citizens and groups of citizens have often commemorated such events according to their conscience and beliefs. I would suggest that this tradition would most appropriately apply to the proposal to mark one minute&rsquo;s silence on 9 August in commemoration of the bombing of Nagasaki. I commend Senator Quinn on his appeal to all people to remember the tragedy at 11.02 a.m. on that day <Col N="2519"/>and, where possible, attend the annual commemorative event in Merrion Square on 6 August. While attending Expo 1990 in Japan, I had an opportunity to witness at first hand the effects of the devastation visited on the unfortunate people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</P>
      <P>Important as it is to remember past tragedies, it is more important to learn from them. Strong as our sympathy is for the hundreds of thousands who died in the atomic cataclysm of August 1945 or from its after-effects, our determination must be stronger to ensure that devastation is not visited upon this or future generations by nuclear weapons many times more powerful that those which destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</P>
      <P>The only way to guarantee the avoidance of nuclear weapons is to totally and irreversibly eliminate them. Ireland has been to the forefront of international efforts to bring this about. The non-proliferation treaty, NPT, which is the most universal multilateral instrument in the field of disarmament and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, was negotiated following an initiative by the late Frank Aiken as Minister for External Affairs in 1958. His leadership, commitment and dedication on behalf of Ireland received international recognition and has often been referred to at international conferences.</P>
      <P>A review conference of the NPT was held in New York between 2 and 27 May. The Minister for Foreign Affairs made clear in his address to the conference that Ireland&rsquo;s highest priority in the area of disarmament and non-proliferation has been support for efforts to strengthen the treaty and to ensure full respect for all its provisions. These include obligations in respect of nuclear disarmament.</P>
      <P>The Government remains concerned, some 15 years after the end of the Cold War, at the unsatisfactory progress towards the objective of a world free from the dangers of nuclear weapons. We will continue to press for a global security order where nuclear weapons have no place. I know that this vision is shared by every Member. It is also of considerable importance to people throughout Ireland and across the world. The day before the NPT conference began, the mayors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki led an estimated 40,000 people to a rally in Central Park in New York in support of efforts to ensure the total elimination of all nuclear weapons. There can be no doubt that the most lasting memorial to those who died as a result of the attacks in Hiroshima and Nagasaki is to ensure that nothing remotely similar is ever again visited upon mankind. I reiterate Senator Quinn&rsquo;s appeal that as many people as possible commemorate this tragic event at the appropriate time in August.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="2520"/>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his words. I was unaware that the Taoiseach spoke on this matter in May. I am pleased that he acknowledged it. I am delighted to hear mention of Frank Aiken. He was a good friend of my father and visited our house on many occasions as I grew up. This matter costs nothing but is a question of publicising the commemoration, either on 6 August, Hiroshima Day, or 9 August, Nagasaki Day.</P>
      <P>I was impressed by the words of Mr. Barroso. I raised this issue because young people do not realise the benefits we accrued from a united Europe. We have not experienced war. Mr. Barroso discussed events which took place 60 years ago, referring to Auschwitz rather than Nagasaki. He also referred to the circumstances which obtained 30 years ago in Greece, Spain and Portugal, the domination 15 years ago of Poland and Czechoslovakia by the monolith of Soviet Russia and the other problems we have experienced. The benefit of having a united Europe is a reminder to young people of the past.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach and Minister of State should pursue any opportunity to remind people. I had a number of opportunities to go to Japan but did not visit Hiroshima or Nagasaki. I am aware that the Japanese are a peace loving people. They are very quiet and it is hard to understand their experiences in the last World War. Let us ensure that we show them our solidarity. I urge the Minister of State to take every opportunity to encourage people to recognise that occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with what Senator Quinn stated, particularly with regard to the speech made today by the President of the European Commission, Mr. Barroso. That speech was of historic significance and showed outstanding leadership and vision for the future of Europe. He assured everybody that Europe would be an inclusive place for all citizens and that we could work together to ensure the future progress of the great European project, which is so critical to Ireland and the citizens of Europe.</P>
      <P>Peace is vitally important. Mr. Barroso also mentioned the noble role played by the European Union &mdash; not only on behalf of the citizens of Europe &mdash; in managing the aftermath of the Second World War and the great trauma experienced in Europe up until the 1990s. An occasion such as Hiroshima Day or Nagasaki Day would give Irish citizens an opportunity to reflect on history, and on the trauma so unfairly visited on innocent people. Our solidarity, individually and collectively, in supporting such a commemorative occasion can ensure it will never be revisited on any people in any part of the world.</P>
