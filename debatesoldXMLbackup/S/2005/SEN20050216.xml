	<P>I have received notice from Senator Ulick Burke that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children to indicate when details of the home subvention package will be available nationwide and the level of assistance to be given to those requiring it under this scheme.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Norris of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to intervene in the matter of the proposed further development of a saw mill at Leap Castle, County Offaly.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Browne of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to outline the steps that will be taken to secure replacement jobs in view of the closure of the Carlow sugar factory.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Terry of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to report on Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s plans to provide a pedestrian bridge over the canal at Clonsilla Station to connect with Hansfield Road and to outline why Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann did not complete the planning process in this regard when dealing with the previous application.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Morrissey of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to report on the provision of a sports hall for Castleknock Community College, which was approved in 2001.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by Senators Ulick Burke, Browne and Morrissey as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be <Col N="586"/>taken at the conclusion of business. I regret I have had to rule out of order the matters raised by Senators Norris and Terry, as the Ministers concerned have no official responsibility in the matters.</P>

	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on procedure on Second Stage of Bills to be taken without debate, which proposes to address the unwieldy procedure which heretofore applied where an amendment was tabled to the Second Stage Reading of a Bill; No. 2, statements on the progress on development in the BMW region to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 1.30 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of other Senators not to exceed ten minutes &mdash; Senators may share time and the Minister shall be called on to reply not later than five minutes before the end of statements; No. 3, Parental Leave (Amendment) Bill 2004 &mdash; Report and Final Stages to be taken at 2.30 p.m. until 3.15 p.m.; No. 4, statements on regional transport policy to be taken at the conclusion of No. 3 or at 3.15 p.m. if No. 3 has not concluded earlier and to conclude not later than 5 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of other Senators not to exceed ten minutes &mdash; Senators may share time and the Minister shall be called upon to reply not later than five minutes before the end of statements; and No. 15, Civil Registration Bill 2004, to be taken from 5 p.m. until 7 p.m. with the same speaking times as apply to a normal Private Members&rsquo; motion.

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>This morning I received from the Government the amendment to the Bill published by Senator Norris, the Civil Partnership Bill 2004, which we are to debate this evening. This is one of the shabbiest amendments I have ever read in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>This House has had a proud record of debating this important and sensitive issue. The Government is now proposing to vote the Bill down on Second Stage this evening. Even at this late stage I ask the Leader to reconsider this decision. I know that her heart is not in this amendment. The amendment outlines spurious reasons the Bill should be voted down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The matter can be discussed during the Second Stage debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I am raising this matter on the Order of Business as a means of showing my support and that of my group for the Bill. If we have learned one thing from the courts&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="587"/>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The matter can be discussed when the Bill comes before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash; it is that the longer politicians and the Houses of the Oireachtas kick these matters to touch indefinitely, the more responsibility the courts will get. The courts want us to take responsibility in this area and do not want the matter hived off as has continually happened in the past. Even at this late stage I ask the Government to reconsider its position, which I believe to be totally bogus.</P>
      <P>Just as we thought the embattled Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, was about to sing &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry for me Argentina&rdquo;, it is quite clear he is back with a vengeance following his comments in the Lower House yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan"><NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It would seem it is his view that not only has the upstart of a Minister of State, Deputy Callely, been involved in guesswork concerning the metro project&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator calling &ldquo;foul&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>That is in the Lower House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;so too has the entire Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>That statement is derogatory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Brian Hayes should withdraw his remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I will do so. I should not have used the word &ldquo;upstart&rdquo;, rather should have used the term &ldquo;overly ambitious&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is a bit of an upstart himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>On the overly ambitious Minister of State from the north side of Dublin&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>He is not arrogant like the Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;would the Leader agree that much of the Government&rsquo;s work in this area in the past 17 years has been guesswork? When will we see the metro project for Dublin? Fianna F&aacute;il has been in office for 15 of the past 18 years. We are now being told that a plan is imminent. I ask the Leader, as a former distinguished Minister with responsibility for transport who has never been involved in guesswork, to give a commitment to the House as to when the Government will take a decision on the project and when the metro will be operational.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="588"/>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a black day for Seanad &Eacute;ireann. I am ashamed of what is happening here today, as are many Senators on all sides of the House regardless of their position on the Civil Partnership Bill 2004. I intend to withdraw the Bill to spare the shame of the Government or, perhaps, to rub it in in an ironic way. I will not be present this evening and I will not move the motion for the Second Reading.</P>
      <P>If the Government is serious, it seems it is voting down the Bill because it considers that it would be improper to discuss it while it is the subject of a court case, while the All-Party Committee on the Constitution is examining the matter and while the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s report on the rights and duties of cohabitees is being analysed. I do not believe that, however. I am prepared to go with it, but I am not prepared to have the work done by a group of people over two years treated in a contemptuous fashion by a Government that poses as democratic. Approximately a month ago, I had a meeting with the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>He is a new socialist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;whose socialist caring face has now been ripped off. When I left my meeting with him, I thought I had been given the sun, the moon and the stars, as most people do. As I walked down the corridor, the stars started to twinkle more dimly and the moon dimmed. As I emerged from Government Buildings, the sun went out. It has finally gone into eclipse here today.</P>
      <P>As a democrat, I want to be helpful. I think the most helpful thing I can do is to withdraw the Bill and to make a constructive submission to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution tomorrow. That would be the best thing for me to do, rather than initiating a meaningless debate that would be an insult to me and an insult to the many people who would benefit from the Civil Partnership Bill 2004, including people in heterosexual relationships outside marriage.</P>
      <P>I mentioned the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. I attempted to refer this matter to a more appropriate committee, the all-party committee on the family, as did many other professional people who made serious and reasoned submissions. My attempt to make such a referral was rejected because it was not deemed to be a proper matter for the committee&rsquo;s consideration. Like many other people, I hardly even received an acknowledgment. I am surprised by this development, but I know it has happened because the Taoiseach referred the matter to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, even though it was not the most appropriate forum.</P>
      <P>I agree with the leader of Fine Gael, who referred to the Government amendment as shabby. It is over-cautious. The Government has known for a long time that this Bill was in the pipeline. We had a briefing session a week ago. I gave more notice to the appropriate office than most people give in any circumstances. I said that <Col N="589"/>as I acknowledge that such concerns exist, the best thing to do might be to adjourn the debate. The first part of the debate could be held this evening and we could be informed about the matters mentioned in the amendment at a later stage. I accept the Government&rsquo;s argument that the various reports will add to our knowledge.</P>
      <P>To impose a guillotine on such an important measure is contrary to the tradition of the House. My Independent colleagues and I fight against such procedures. To be fair, most Senators on the Government side agree with us. Some 50 years have passed since a Bill initiated on this side of the House was allowed by any Government to pass onto the Statute Book. On that occasion, the Bill was proposed by the late Professor W. B. Stanford and provided for the humane treatment of pigs in abattoirs. I would have thought that Seanad &Eacute;ireann thought sufficiently highly of its dignity to allow it to move on after 50 years, for example, by considering a social problem that is at the heart of the lived reality of so many people in this country.</P>
      <P>A week ago, on Joe Duffy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo;, I listened to a woman who had been bereaved. Family members had been very helpful to her until after the burial, when they went in and started to grab every single thing. This Bill would start to address such problems. I do not suggest&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have given the Senator considerable latitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that it is a perfect Bill, that it is incapable of being amended or that it could not be withdrawn at some stage to be replaced by a better Bill. However, the Government has not made any proposal in this regard.</P>
      <P>I am worried because the Government acted against the principles enunciated by the former Minister, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, who said she would require clear and cogent factual evidence to introduce discrimination against any Irish citizen. The Government introduced the savage 16 cutbacks. It acted in the case of a matter that was heard by an equality tribunal that was established by the Government. The tribunal determined that there had been a serious abuse of the rights of a gay couple.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Senator to conclude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Instead of addressing that inequality, the Government introduced legislation that copperfastened it by redefining a &ldquo;spouse&rdquo;. I am disgusted by the Government&rsquo;s behaviour today. I oppose the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I too am very disappointed that the Government has tabled the amendment to the motion for the Second Reading of the Private Members&rsquo; Bill which Senator Norris was proposing that we discuss this evening. I had looked forward to the debate because I felt it would have <Col N="590"/>added to the general consideration of the issues faced by cohabiting couples who need legal protection. It is a question of protecting the rights of people in cohabiting relationships and civil partnerships and the creation of such civil partnerships. It is very disappointing to see the Government running away from the opportunity to discuss this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not running away from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>It is effectively running away from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>There could be two hours&rsquo; debate on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>Why else would it not allow the Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Who is withdrawing it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Meara, without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment states that &ldquo;Seanad &Eacute;ireann declines to give a second reading to the Bill...&rdquo; To decline to give a Second Reading to a Private Members&rsquo; Bill is a serious matter, although this is not the time to discuss that subject. Clearly, we are not being allowed to discuss the motion for the Second Reading tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>There could be two hours of debate on it tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>This House needs to debate the operation of the Standards in Public Office Commission, specifically the legislation pertaining thereto, in light of the fact that the commission has found itself unable to investigate any further the issue involving the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, under the legislation passed by the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>It is being investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>It is time we examined the legislation, which is extremely complex and cumbersome. We now see that, at a certain level, it is simply not working. We are left with the comment in the Quigley report that there is a perception of impropriety on the part of the Minister, Deputy Cullen. This perception remains in the public arena.</P>
      <P>One of the objects of setting up the commission was to have a mechanism whereby the public could be reassured that matters that needed investigation could be investigated. Clearly, this has not happened and we must therefore determine the efficacy of the legislation, or, in this case, its lack of efficacy, and consider how it can be amended to make it work on behalf of the public.</P><Col N="591"/>
      <P>The House has discussed global warming in the past. I ask the Leader to consider how best the House can examine the very serious threat it poses to us all considering that the Kyoto Protocol comes into force today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding No. 15, the Civil Partnership Bill, it is unusual for a Bill to get to this stage in the Seanad. A debate of two hours is very comprehensive. The outcome of the vote would be a different matter from the consideration of the substance of the Bill. It would receive full and fair consideration in the course of a two-hour debate.</P>
      <P>I am a member of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, which is dealing with the issue of the family. That committee welcomes the fact that Senator Norris is to appear before it to make a presentation. However, it would be entirely wrong to introduce legislation until the committee has concluded its consideration of the matter, particularly given that it is likely that a constitutional amendment will be required in addition to legislation if the matter is to progress satisfactorily. Therefore, it is reasonable that the Bill be debated fully and that we decide on the basis of the vote at the end of that debate whether the Bill should proceed further. It is unusual for a Private Members&rsquo; Bill to get to this point or to have it considered fully. I appeal to Senator Norris to allow a full debate to take place this evening so all the relevant issues can be thrashed out appropriately and comprehensively.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the Kyoto Protocol is significant. It would be more significant if the United States, China and India were involved in the process, but at least it is a start. There is a growing awareness worldwide of how misuse of the environment can change the climate. For that reason the protocol is welcome. We should soon have a comprehensive debate on global warming and the global environment, not just the domestic one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senators Brian Hayes and Norris that it is regrettable that the debate on the Civil Partnership Bill will not go ahead this evening, given that we had such advance notice. I was looking forward to the debate, particularly in light of the fine recent speech by Archbishop Diarmuid Martin and the proposals made by the Law Reform Commission a year ago.</P>
      <P>We could have had a debate and despite Senator Dardis&rsquo;s reservations, and the possible constitutional difficulty, the Bill could have progressed beyond Second Stage. There could have been a delay before the other Stages to allow time to resolve those matters to which he referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>No one is stopping it.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="592"/>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>This House has a good record on dealing sensibly with matters regarding how a civil society should proceed. We do not all have to agree on every issue. It is sad that the Bill is to be voted down in this way at the last minute.</P>
      <P>It reminds me of the way the Government side voted down my stage payments Bill, although the majority on that side agreed with it. The Minister promised a six months review. That period has elapsed. Will the Leader inquire about that from the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government with responsibility for housing?</P>
      <P>On a separate issue, Killarney National Park is the foremost property of its kind in the State, if not the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I never heard of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>As a biosphere reserve, the Leader&rsquo;s former ministerial colleague, Senator Brendan Daly, referred to it as &ldquo;the jewel in the crown&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator seeking a debate on this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I am not but if the Leas-Chathaoirleach wants to be that generous to me I will accept it. At the heart of that national park, beside the Meetings of the Waters lies the old world example of charm and warmth, Dinis Cottage, now in an increasingly dilapidated state. I understood that the Government, through the heritage section of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, had provided the necessary moneys to repair the cottage. The planning difficulties that existed for a long time are resolved but nothing has happened. The Leader visited the area a few years ago and it is close to her heart. I prevail on her to use her good offices to jolt someone and have something done about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader will go on a fact-finding mission to the Senator&rsquo;s favourite hotel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Otherwise, another tourist season will pass and the visitors who love to wander through that part of the park, to rest and view the tranquility of the waters, will not even be able to have a cup of tea there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader invite the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the House to debate the drug problem? Recent developments merit such a debate. The Garda has  apprehended a major producer in the midlands and placed him behind bars, where he belongs. The media today report that many non-nationals are manufacturing, distributing and selling crack cocaine in addition to the members of the indigenous population engaged in the same activity. It is a worrying development.</P>
      <P>The Garda is to be commended on making so many detections lately. Nevertheless, this war<Col N="593"/>rants a debate. If a non-national is found guilty of such an offence deportation should be considered. There should be a mandatory sentence in the case of all offenders because there is far too much of this taking place. Young people are polluted because of the actions of these people and it is time action was taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I support my colleague, Senator Norris. During the past two years he has acted under advice from all quarters. He has consulted, discussed, briefed and listened to everyone. He has tried to move the matter forward in a consensual manner. Given the way we try to do business on these benches, it is an absolute disgrace and utterly unacceptable that, half an hour before two years&rsquo; work is put to the sword, he gets this weasel-worded amendment to bury all that endeavour.</P>
      <P>I compliment Senator Norris who, apart from his last two sentences, avoided the subject and spoke on the Order of Business for the remainder of the time. As I am sure the Clerk will advise you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, there is no restriction on speeches on the Order of Business as long as I stick to the Order of Business rather than the subject of the Order of Business. I can point chapter and verse to a former Leader of the House making a 45 minute speech on the Order of Business when he was not Leader. Before there is a ruling, there are issues to be dealt with&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The House has agreed to a half an hour restriction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Does that mean I have 20 minutes from now?</P>
      <P>I believe in all sincerity that this is not the way to do business. It gives an extraordinarily negative impression of democracy. It is a steamroller of autocracy running down and through a difficult endeavour. No suggestion was made previously to Senator Norris that he should hold back the legislation. On advice from different quarters, he has delayed bringing forward the legislation on at least three occasions over the past six months. He tried to ensure it would not create difficulty for people and it was worded and presented in a way that was open to anyone with moderate views.</P>
      <P>The way the matter has been dealt with is completely undemocratic, unnecessary, undignified and inhumane. It is a shameful way to do business. If the Government had a problem in this regard, there could have been some discussion and a way could have been found to deal with the issues. It would have been easy for the Government to deal with the business tonight, not have a vote on it and let it sit on the Order Paper until it was ready to deal with the matters with which it was concerned. However, it wanted to put on record the rejection of the legislation. This legislation has grown out of a demand from ordinary people because of a suggestion by the courts and out of the practice and progress in other demo<Col N="594"/>cratic nations throughout the world. We could have dealt with the matter in a better manner, which would have given people confidence. Private Members&rsquo; Bills, particularly in the Seanad where no support or research structures are in place, should be given a deal of respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>What has happened here today is wrong. It is a shameful day and it does not become us as parliamentarians and public representatives to bury work in this way and to give such a negative message to many people who were hanging on this legislation. It would be quite in order for the Government to say it listened to what has been said and it is not prepared to take the matter further at this time. It could have said that there would not be a vote on it this evening or it could have given a commitment that Committee Stage would not be taken until the three issues were dealt with. It is sufficiently clever to table an amendment which gives the reasons for the Government&rsquo;s decision. However, it is unusual in terms of Order of Business statements that the reasons for the rejection should be included with such clarity.</P>

      <P>I do not have a problem with what the Government is trying to do, which appears positive. However, it should not undermine the endeavours of a parliamentarian who has put two years&rsquo; work into drawing up the legislation. Has any value been put on his efforts in dealing with the issue? Senator Norris has gone to the highest court in Europe on a related matter. He has given much of his life to these issues and he has tried to do so in a moderate way which will not give offence. He has found acceptability among the general public on many of the issues he has raised. He has raised issues in a way that is admirable. I resent the way in which he has been treated today and I will vote against the Order of Business. I ask the Leader to reconsider the position.</P>

	<P>Fine Gael supports this proposal and will support it on Second Stage today. While we have some reservations about it we would have dealt with those by way of amendment on Committee Stage.

    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris will forgive me if I refer to Blackwood, who came from the Ards of Down to vote against the union. In this case, I came from the Ards of Down to vote for the union as proposed by Senator Norris.</P>
      <P>I hope Senator Norris will participate in a debate on this subject. I came prepared to debate it and to vote for something along the lines of what he proposes to deal with an important and pressing social problem. It is not tremendously <Col N="597"/>necessary to worry about the constitutional implications. It is a matter for the law of contract rather than family law and Senator Norris has been careful in framing this to avoid emotive terms like marriage and family.</P>
      <P>Amendments are fine as long as they are not wrecking amendments. When I am told to wait for the resolution of current litigation, I worry that it might take years. Do we know when the reports of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution and the Law Reform Commission will be finalised? There must be a timescale and it would be a pity if the Seanad was seen to lack compassion for people who are caught in a difficult situation. Is it possible for Senator Norris and the Leader of the House to agree a form of words so the topic can be discussed and then opened up to these committees within a timescale so the House is seen to be compassionate on an important social issue and things are not rushed into? It is important that we have the type of debate only this House can have and that we have it this evening.</P>

	<P>I listened with some amusement to Senator Mansergh speaking about Senator<?oasys [jy?>Robinson&rsquo;s Bill 30 years ago. The then Leader of the House had trouble physically holding the Bill on contraception in his hand so we have improved since then.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris showed great restraint when he spoke about his disappointment on this matter, but I am also disappointed. It is not just the two people within a civil relationship who are affected but any children they may have had in a previous heterosexual relationship. The other partner cannot adopt or have custody or guardianship of any of those children, which leaves them in a vulnerable situation, demonstrating the urgency behind this legislation.</P>
      <P>I respectfully remind Senator Dardis, who suggested that Senator Norris could be asked to delay discussion of this Bill, that I agreed to delay the discussion of my Bill on <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation. That was seven years ago. I agreed to the establishment of a commission and seven years later it still has not reported. Senator Norris could be a very old gentleman if he agreed to delay the Bill.</P>

	<P>It is absurd to assert that any side of the House cannot table an amendment to any legislation that comes before it, particularly under Private Members&rsquo; business. It happens regularly on both sides.</P>
      <P>I join those who compliment Senator Norris on his work in this area, where he has been a champion of change and has approached the matter in a genuine and reasonable way. Equally, however, the contrary point of view must be taken into account. The Bill has implications for marriage, adoption and other sensitive issues. It is not <Col N="598"/>unreasonable for the Government to ask that issues that are under consideration in the courts or the Houses receive the appropriate consideration.</P>
      <P>It is for the Houses of the Oireachtas, not the courts, to determine these issues. However, there are two sides to the matter and I have reservations about the Bill, which I have discussed with Senator Norris. Nevertheless, I would welcome the opportunity to articulate those strong and genuine views and I am sure there are others like me. It is only in the process of debate that we will eventually reach an outcome that will benefit all of society, which should be the objective of the every Member of this House.</P>

	<P>Given that Ireland lost its bid to win a massive Dell investment that would have created approximately 1,500 jobs and that last year County Longford lost Cardinal Health, I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to the House to debate Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness and industrial policy in order to establish once and for all the extent of the jobs challenge facing our country. Since Christmas we have experienced numerous job losses because of stealth taxes introduced by the Government. We are told this on a daily basis. Any company director will give the same answer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader for a debate on the workings of a press council in light of a number of issues that have arisen recently. One perennial issue is imbalance in the media not only here but in other countries where the media come down on one side of an issue and give a distorted view. We need only look at the elections in America, and not specifically the presidential election. An amendment was voted down by 11 states in the state elections but the liberal media were so far on one side they lost sight of the reality on the ground. It is very important to have balance in reporting.</P>
      <P>I am intrigued by the sequence of events here this morning. A debate was offered but because the Government has indicated it is voting a particular way, the debate is being pulled and we are told we are undemocratic. This should be debated properly. The Government is not undemocratic. It did a very democratic thing.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="599"/>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Bill introduced by Senator Norris, it may be reasonably easy to resolve the issue. I was taken by what Senator Maurice Hayes said. If Senator Norris and the Leader of the House could meet for a few minutes they could agree that the Government will withdraw its amendment, that the Bill as introduced will be debated this evening for a full two hours, that there will be no vote at the end and the Bill will, therefore, be adjourned&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>On Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and will then be referred to the all-party committee. This would save the Government&rsquo;s face. I suspect this decision was taken somewhat precipitately under pressure from people who seem to wield disproportionate influence within certain parties. It would allow the debate to go ahead. It would mean nobody would be embarrassed in any way and it would mean the Bill could come back to the House and be voted on at a later stage.</P>
      <P>It would also accommodate the difficulties, which are very understandable, on the other side of the House that were particularly eloquently spoken about by Senator Jim Walsh. It would accommodate the difficulties of Senator Mansergh in that the Bill could be amended as the Government wishes on Committee Stage. That is a possible solution that would allow a serious debate. Senator Norris is right in his view that the Seanad is in danger of being seen to run away from a difficult issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>The word &ldquo;decline&rdquo; in this amendment is immensely offensive. I will be voting against the Order of Business as well. Perhaps after that vote the Leader and Senator Norris would sit down and try to resolve this problem in a civilised manner. That would be quite easy and would satisfy everybody.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the comments of Senator Dardis in respect of a debate on global warming and the environment given that the Kyoto Protocol has been signed by most countries, apart from the United States, China and India.</P>
      <P>On the issue of the western rail corridor, I have seen some figures that suggest the cost would not be as great as the earlier consultative reports indicate given that the line is going from Collooney to Ennis, which is the area not served. Unfortunately, the costings have included a line to Cork. I hope we will have an opportunity to discuss that issue.</P>
      <P>I hope we will have a debate on the Civil Partnership Bill 2004, proposed by Senator Norris. I will be disappointed if it is withdrawn. The debate would offer an opportunity to air differing views and outline different aspects of this matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be brief. Since the health portfolio was taken over by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, last month 6,297 people lost their medical cards; in December 2004 more than 2,100 people lost their medical cards and since the last election 64,000 people have been denied access to medical cards. If this trend continues this Minister for Health and Children will go down as the Minister who dismantled the medical card and GMS system. I ask the Minister to indicate what she is doing with regard to the medical card and GMS service. She has promised approximately 200,000 yellow pack medical cards but we have been told some will not be in place until April or May. I ask that something be done immediately for the many who are suffering as a result of their withdrawal.</P>
      <P>Women in the west do not have access to BreastCheck and, as a result, 40 per annum die because of their late presentation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I add my voice in support of the Civil Partnership Bill 2004, proposed by Senator Norris, and avail of the opportunity to second Senator Ross&rsquo;s proposal. We need to resolve this issue because there is a huge degree of scepticism out there in regard to politics and the role of this House. We have heard about Seanad reform. If we make this House irrelevant, we must take responsibility for that. A precedent has already been set by the Minister for Agriculture and Food in regard to the veterinary practice Bill which was debated here before Christmas. When the Minister discovered there was a need for substantial change to the Bill she delayed it and it has not yet been debated on Committee Stage where necessary changes will be made. Something similar could happen in this case.</P>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on the issue of drugs. There are a number of ways to examine this issue. The abuse of drugs is rampant in provincial towns and is causing serious problems but it is not being addressed and a blind eye is being turned. Non-nationals should not be solely <Col N="601"/>blamed because there are other reasons and other problems which need to be dealt with. The one serious problem is that no services are available in rural Ireland for those people in provincial towns who find themselves afflicted by this scourge and who genuinely want to get off drugs. The Minister for Health and Children needs to put such services in place in rural areas. People are forced to travel to Dublin or Limerick and they cannot get in there. For example, in a provincial town such as Roscrea, there is no methadone-dispensing chemist. This problem must be tackled immediately. I support the call for that debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Last Sunday, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs announced his intention to replace the lone-parent allowance with a system he described as &ldquo;family-friendly&rdquo;. I ask the Leader to invite him to the House to explain this system. I have a horrible feeling this is the type of solo run typical of the Minister. I understand that no preparations have been made in this area. The points made by the Minister in the article are quite valid and need to be further explored. Following the outcry over last week&rsquo;s column in <i>The Irish Times</i> it would be very opportune for the House to debate this issue. The Minister should come to the House to explain his plans and the timeframe involved. He also needs to explain whether this will have implications for married couples. I understand from sources within the Department of Social and Family Affairs that the plan to scrap the lone-parent allowance could be discriminatory against married couples. The matter warrants a debate in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to speak in general terms about the mini-debate the Leas-Chathaoirleach was kind enough to allow. Senator Norris and I have discussed this matter on numerous occasions. We did not reach any conclusion but the Senator certainly knows the lie of the land from my point of view and I am very clear on his position. I am aware of this issue since he spoke to me well before Christmas. Senator Norris arranged an excellent presentation in the audio-visual centre for all Members who wished to attend and which I enjoyed very much. I also discussed this matter with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell and the Taoiseach. I have not been delaying the issue by any means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware the Senator understands my position. Many Members on this side of the House were looking forward to the debate in which we could express our views. It was agreed at our party meeting this morning who would speak in the debate. I was looking forward very much to putting my views on the record of the House on the matter, which I regard as a <Col N="602"/>human rights issue. I am disappointed and I hope Senator Ross&rsquo;s view can be discussed afterwards.</P>
      <P>The amendment to the Order of Business is not shabby, as Senator Brian Hayes stated, but is in fact correct. Each of the subheadings in the amendment make correct points. Ms Zappone and Ms Gilligan are currently involved in litigation. The Oireachtas All-Party Committee on the Constitution is in existence but I am not aware of any all-party committee on the family. It may be a sub-committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The House has received the consultative document from the Law Reform Commission but not the full report which is due some time in the future.

	<P>I would welcome the Bill being debated for two hours tonight because the views expressed by speakers from all sides would be very interesting and would add texture to the ongoing debate on this important issue. The Houses of the Oireachtas should seek precedence and be the prime movers on matters such as this and the courts, including European courts, should not impose their will. Surely Members are able to make up their minds on the issue.</P>
      <P>Rather than being delighted to defer the debate, I had been looking forward to speaking to the Bill and, like many other Senators, had indicated to the Government Chief Whip that I wished to do so. My colleagues and I look forward to placing our views on record for everybody to see. It would be wrong to claim that everybody has the same view. How could that be the case? Our diverse lives bear witness to the different points of view that would have emerged this evening. My comments are addressed to Senators Brian Hayes, Norris and O&rsquo;Meara.</P>
      <P>Senator Brian Hayes referred to the point of view expressed by the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Callely. The Minister of State is an excellent, positive Minister who has come before the House on several occasions and works hard at his job. The Senator will shortly be able to address him directly when he comes before the House.</P><Col N="603"/>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Meara called for a debate on amending the Standards in Public Office Act. She also raised global warming.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis stated that much greater progress would have been made in reducing consumption of fossil fuels if China, the United States and India had been involved in the Kyoto Protocol.</P>
      <P>Senator Coghlan agreed with Senator Brian Hayes. He also expressed concern about Dinis Cottage near the Meetings of the Waters and asked that we intervene with the heritage council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Glynn called for a debate on drugs. I understand this issue is the prerogative of the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, rather than the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell. I note the Senator pointed the finger at nationals as well as non-nationals. We are too quick to blame non-nationals for the ills of society. We will seek a debate on the issue.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole expressed support for Senator Norris. I have great respect for the Bill, which is the reason I had meetings and conversations with Senator Norris, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>Senator Mansergh raised Exchequer investment in transport. I agree that we need a debate on the issue.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand the reason people do not want to debate Senator Norris&rsquo;s Bill today because our views would be valuable. Senator Terry stated the decision was not democratic. It is democratic for a Government to put forward a viewpoint. Surely the ability to speak on issues is part of democracy.</P>

	<P>That is not the point. I do not want to be misrepresented. I strongly resent the Leader&rsquo;s remarks and ask her to withdraw them. I have not tried to stop Senators speaking but suggested that the debate be adjourned so the House can have further debates. The Leader should not, therefore, say that I and other Senators are against debate or do not want to hear the views of others. I will make my submission to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution tomorrow.</P>

	<P>I liked Senator Maurice Hayes&rsquo;s historical allusion. He expressed the hope that the House would debate the issue. We hope we will do so. I agree that the House should not appear to be lacking in compassion. We do not all live in cosy arrangements. Unfortunately, life is not always a two-up, two-down and everything that goes with it. I have strong feelings on the matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry praised Senator Norris&rsquo;s restraint and referred to her Bill on <i>in vitro </i>fertilisation, an issue on which a commission was established in the Department of Health and Children.</P>

	<P>Senator Jim Walsh stated that the Oireachtas should be proactive in discussing the question of civil partnerships. Senator Bannon requested that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment come before the House to debate employment and Senator Hanafin also requested a debate on the issue.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross wished to discuss the Civil Partnership Bill. He wished the Bill would be debated and put forward a scenario he thought could help resolve this matter. We would be willing to discuss the matter and I look forward to seeing the Senator after the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>Senator Kitt referred to global warming and hoped the debate on the Civil Partnership Bill would take place tonight. Senator Ulick Burke stated that 64,000 people have been denied medical cards since the last election. The Senator called for a debate on medical cards and the extension of the BreastCheck programme to the west.</P>
      <P>Senator Coonan supported Senator Ross&rsquo;s proposals regarding the Civil Partnership Bill and Senators Norris and O&rsquo;Toole indicated they would vote against the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>Senator Browne requested that the Minister for Social and Family Affairs come before the House to discuss his proposals for lone parents. I listened to the Minister and thought he was extremely positive. He wants lone parents to be able to take part in education and employment without having their entitlements docked, which I thought was sensible.

    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House for statements on the progress in relation to the development of the BMW region.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="606"/>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to open this debate. While the focus of the debate is on progress in the BMW region, it is important that we reflect at the outset on the major economic strides the country as a whole has made in recent years. As I will indicate in my address, the BMW region has very much shared in this progress.</P>
      <P>A thriving economic climate has been created in Ireland over the past decade and we have recorded one of the best economic performances in the world. From 1997 to 2003, Irish gross domestic product grew by an average of over 7.5%, compared to an average of just over 2% in the Union. The fruits of this economic success have been put to good use and have benefited people the length and breadth of the country.</P>
      <P>The taxation system has been significantly reformed, public services have been improved and provision for the future has also been made with the establishment of the national pensions reserve fund. Our public finances have been put on a sound footing and the general Government debt level has been more than halved from 74% of GDP in 1996 to 31% last year.</P>
      <P>The unprecedented growth rates of the past decade could not be maintained indefinitely. We are now moving towards a more sustainable level of annual growth of 4% to 5%, still more than twice the EU average. The key challenge facing us is to manage the transition to these lower rates <Col N="607"/>of growth and to tailor our expectations accordingly. This is particularly important in the context of this debate when we will no doubt hear strong arguments for higher levels of investment of taxpayers&rsquo; money. With this in mind, I ask Senators to reflect on the following two considerations.</P>
      <P>First, it is imperative to both our national and regional social and economic well-being that we remain competitive. We must focus on competitiveness if we are to copperfasten the economic progress we have made so far and enhance our capacity to grow in the medium term. In particular, we must keep our labour costs competitive and this has implications not just for the level of pay increases but also for the level of payroll taxes which can be levied.</P>
      <P>The second consideration is that maintaining the public finances on a sound footing is essential. We face many demands for improvements in public services while lower growth rates mean lower tax revenue growth. Our low debt ratio is an important positive but we must remain vigilant to ensure that we continue to enjoy stable public finances.</P>
      <P>These realities require us to continue to pursue the correct economic policies to enable us to create at national level the resources for investment throughout the country. They also require us to prioritise investment in sectoral areas of best economic return, taking account of overall Government policy objectives. The key point is that investment in the BMW region or the country as a whole cannot take place in a vacuum. It must be built on the foundations of solid and stable national economic and fiscal policies.</P>
      <P>The fact that we are addressing today the issue of development in the BMW region is itself a tribute to the outcome of the Government&rsquo;s negotiating strategy in the Agenda 2000 negotiations. As Senators may recall, Ireland went into those negotiations in the position that the country as a whole had no prospect of retaining Objective One status for Structural Funds. Our rapid and continuing economic growth since the mid-1990s meant that Ireland had well exceeded the 75% of GDP threshold for Objective One status.</P>
      <P>Initially, it seemed the only option in the Agenda 2000 negotiations was to pursue a transitional movement from Objective One status for the entire country. This was certainly the fate the EU Commission had in mind for Ireland at the time. However, the Government was conscious that some regions were below the 75% threshold and adopted the policy of seeking to retain Objective One status for those regions for the period 2000 to 2006. I recall the scepticism of the Opposition when that negotiating strategy was brought forward.</P>
      <P>The Government strongly pursued the retention of Objective One status for the BMW region in the Agenda 2000 negotiations, which culminated in the Berlin summit in March 1999. After intensive negotiating efforts, the Government&rsquo;s objective was fully achieved when agreement was <Col N="608"/>secured on dividing Ireland into two regions for Structural Funds purposes. The BMW region was to retain full Objective One status for the period 2000 to 2006 while the rest of the country secured generous transitional arrangements for the phasing out of Objective One status.</P>
      <P>The outcome of the Berlin summit, in so far as Structural and Cohesion Funds are concerned, was a major success for the Government&rsquo;s strategy, leading to continuing significant transfers of funds to Ireland in the period 2000 to 2006, notwithstanding the major economic strides we had made by 2000. The agreement provided for &euro;3.8 billion of structural and cohesion transfers over the seven-year period. An additional &euro;600 million of Structural Funds was allocated for the BMW region on foot of its retention of Objective One status, bringing the total Structural Funds allocation to &euro;1.4 billion. In addition, the Government secured the retention of a much more favourable State aids regime for the BMW region.</P>
      <P>It is only fair that I acknowledge the support the Government received at that time from the relevant regional authorities and the newly-created regional assembly for the BMW region. It should also be recorded that the assembly has discharged most efficiently its responsibility as managing authority for the regional operational programme under the national development plan.</P>
      <P>The National Development Plan 2000-2006 built on the regionalisation approach adopted by the Government in the Agenda 2000 negotiations. It set out an unprecedented level of national investment, &euro;51 billion in 1999 prices, in key economic and social areas. A particular focus of the NDP was a major enhancement of the economic and social infrastructure of the country through an investment of some &euro;22 billion over the period, of which &euro;6 billion related to the BMW region. This constituted a significant increase in investment in the region over previous levels in key areas such as transport, social and affordable housing, environmental services, education and health.</P>
      <P>The Government viewed the initial allocations in the plan published in November 1999 as indicative in nature, as was clearly stated in the plan as published. Senators will accept it would be impossible to set out precisely, seven years in advance, the yearly outturns for the many areas of investment encompassed by the NDP. By reference to the initial investment profile set out in the plan, investment in the BMW region at mid-2004 in the key area of economic and social infrastructure was some &euro;660 million below the target set. Exchequer-funded investment in the infrastructure in the region was only &euro;240 million below profile.</P>
      <P>I assure the House that over the remainder of the NDP, the BMW region will see a significant increase in investment in economic and social infrastructure. I will elaborate shortly on how I hope this objective will be achieved. Before that, however, I will give some examples of enhance<Col N="609"/>ments to the infrastructure of the BMW region under the NDP. In the area of transport infrastructure, almost &euro;2 billion has been spent since 2000. Projects completed or continuing are leading to major improvements to key routes in the region, such as the M1 Dundalk western bypass, the N2 Carrickmacross bypass, the N4 Sligo inner relief road and the N5 Strokestown-Longford road. The key rail lines into the region were completely upgraded by 2003 and significant assistance has been given to its regional airports.</P>
      <P>More than &euro;749 million has been invested to date in non-national road projects in the BMW region, contributing to the improvement of almost 20,000 km of non-national roads. The second and third phases of the broadband metropolitan area networks, MAN, scheme is being rolled out and will cover all towns in the region with populations of 1,500 and over by the end of 2006. This is an important initiative in the context of the region&rsquo;s future economic development.</P>
      <P>Almost 8,000 child care places have been created, with significant further investment planned before the end of 2006. Much progress has been made in the area of environmental services, with expenditure to date of &euro;634 million on the economic and social infrastructure operational programme. In addition, expenditure on the rural water measure in the BMW regional operational programme is more than &euro;100 million and 103,000 people in the region are benefiting from improved group water supplies.</P>
      <P>These examples of major outputs arising from capital investment are replicated in other key areas such as housing, health and education. The Exchequer also heavily subsidises the operation of certain services in the region. For example, there is significant subvention of passenger rail and air services into the region.</P>
      <P>At a macro-economic level, significant progress has been made in the region since 2000. Employment in the BMW region has grown by some 33% in the past six years, representing an average annual growth rate of 5%. In early 2004, there were some 120,000 more people in employment in the region compared with the beginning of 1998. This is a phenomenal rate of employment growth by any standard and is well ahead of the national employment growth rate. Unemployment in the region is at approximately 4.5%, indicating almost full employment. The latest published data indicate that output <i>per capita</i>, measured in terms of GDP, was 88% of the EU-15 average in 2001, compared to 79.3% in 1998. I do not doubt that the region has since then converged much closer to the EU average. The BMW region is now the second wealthiest Objective One region in the EU.</P>
      <P>BMW representatives have been critical of the pace of investment in transport in particular in the BMW region as compared with the south and east region. I accept the BMW region has to date lagged behind the other region in this regard by reference to the initial profile of NDP investment. However, the BMW region benefits from invest<Col N="610"/>ment in transport, especially road infrastructure, in other parts of the country. For example, most of our ports are located in the south and east region and much of the exports from the BMW region are routed through these ports. In addition, much internal business is conducted between the BMW and Dublin regions. Without good and efficient transport links to the Dublin market, and onwards to the major markets in the UK and Europe, businesses in the BMW region will suffer cost disadvantages.</P>
      <P>It is my objective to see increased levels of investment in infrastructure in the BMW region. For the remainder of the plan and beyond, the financial framework for investment in infrastructure will be governed by the five-year capital envelopes launched in budget 2004 and rolled over for another five years in budget 2005. When account is taken of the envelope provisions for 2005 and 2006, total Exchequer resources available in these years for investment in the key infrastructure areas is well in excess of that originally planned for under the NDP. Accordingly, there is scope for additional investment in the region in these years over that originally projected.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>As Senators will realise, decisions on project selection in individual areas are generally taken by Ministers and Departments under the delegated sanctions on capital expenditure from my Department. Of course, they do not do this in isolation but in a manner consistent with Government priorities. In this context I have no doubt that my colleagues will be particularly attentive to need to increase the level of investment in the BMW region between now and end 2006.</P>
      <P>I will now briefly address the post-2006 situation on two levels, namely the Structural Funds outlook and, more generally, the sectoral investment and regional development in that period. Last year the European Commission published its proposals for the planning period beginning in 2007. These proposals have implications for Ireland and for the BMW region. Since contributions to the EU budget are based broadly on a country&rsquo;s relative income, Ireland will pay a higher share of the financing of the EU budget. In addition, as our <i>per capita</i> income increases, we become less eligible for support from the Community budget in the form of Cohesion and Structural Funds.</P>
      <P>The result of these developments is that over the seven years from 2007 to 2013, Ireland will receive a much lower level of net transfers from the EU budget than we previously enjoyed. We will continue to be net recipients from the EU budget for the initial years of the 2007 to 2013 period. From approximately midway in the period, we will become net contributors. This rather dramatic turnaround is the result of the very positive economic progress of recent years. While recognising that EU membership has been good for us and that EU budgetary transfers have assisted in our economic progress, we will still be <Col N="611"/>defending our national position in the current budget negotiations as strongly as any of our partners.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, it must be recognised that the Border, midlands and west region, because of its comparative prosperity, will not qualify for Objective One status under the proposals. Instead the BMW region will qualify for enhanced support under the Commission&rsquo;s proposals to achieve regional competitiveness. This transitional support will be at a more reduced level than under the current round and will need to be concentrated in a few key sectors linked firmly to the Lisbon Process if the Commission&rsquo;s proposals are accepted. In essence, after 2006, the Structural Funds transfer to the BMW region will be more modest. This means that even more so than under the current plan, investment after 2006 at national and regional levels will have to be funded from our own resources.</P>
      <P>The Government has made no decision as yet on whether to have a successor to the current national development plan and, if so, what it should encompass. I would be interested to hear Senators&rsquo; views on the subject in today&rsquo;s debate. As I have stated already a medium-term capital investment envelope is now in place, which sets the financial framework and programme prioritisation out to 2009. As Senators are aware, in the budget I announced agreement in principle to the idea of a ten-year envelope for transport. I expect that the Minister for Transport will submit his proposals in this regard to the Government in the near future.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to maintaining the current high levels of capital investment, approximately twice the EU average, over the next five years and perhaps for a number of years beyond this. It will be considering if and how this commitment needs to be given greater expression through the articulation of sectoral policy priorities in a new national development plan. Whatever the post-2006 scenarios there is no doubt that the BMW region will lay claim to significant investment in infrastructure in the coming years. As already stated, I am sympathetic in this regard. However, I expect any submissions I receive from regional interests on the issue to be characterised by two key necessities &mdash; an economic return from the programme or project being promoted and prioritisation within programmes and between projects.</P>
      <P>Given the demands for improved public services nationally we will never have sufficient resources to satisfy all needs. Therefore, the Government must prioritise by reference to what yields the best economic and social return. For example, in the area of transport, it is particularly important to avoid wasteful duplication of high levels of investment on the same routes across all transport modes unless a strong economic case in favour of such duplication exists.</P>
      <P>I would like to make some brief comments on the general issue of balanced regional develop<Col N="612"/>ment. Over the period of the current plan, while the BMW region made rapid economic strides, little progress has been made on narrowing the gap with the other region as that region has also benefited from the prosperity of the country. However, it must be borne in mind that the southern and eastern region has significant areas of deprivation including in the larger urban centres. Simple comparisons between the two regions do not tell the whole story.</P>
      <P>The major new factor is that we now have a template for balanced regional development through the national spatial strategy. The national spatial strategy does not focus on a two-region approach but has rather designated a number of new gateway towns and hubs through which to drive greater balance in regional development. As it happens the four new gateway towns or centres in the national spatial strategy are in the BMW region. The national spatial strategy has a 20-year horizon going beyond 2020. It will be important for the future and especially beyond 2006 that investment choices at national and regional level take full account of the national spatial strategy framework. While this approach will probably benefit the BMW region, it will be firmly grounded in the national spatial strategy.</P>
      <P>The BMW region has benefited significantly under the current national development plan and has made strong economic progress across many headings. The infrastructure needs of the region mean it has legitimate claims to an increasing level of investment over the medium term. The national spatial strategy provides the template for promoting better balance in regional development in all parts of the country. I look forward to hearing the contributions of Senators and thank them for their attention.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I thank the Leader for arranging this discussion on the BMW region. The topic was raised by many Senators in recent weeks and I am glad we have the opportunity to discuss with the Minister the issues Senators have with the progress in its development, particularly as it relates to transport and infrastructure.</P>
      <P>In his remarks, the Minister placed particular emphasis on competitiveness. We all agree with him that it is vital for the future development of the economy to maintain our competitiveness. However, this is in marked contrast to his antics and those of his Government colleagues in the last general election campaign when, for political expediency, the notion of competitiveness seemed to be cast aside completely in an attempt to gain electoral success. While this was obviously ultimately successful, it saw our competitiveness reduce dramatically when compared with other <Col N="613"/>countries in Europe and the world. Ireland dropped from being in the top five in the world competitiveness league to being somewhere in the 30s in a very short space of time, which obviously happened as a direct result of Government irresponsibility. I am glad that in his new role as Minister for Finance, the Minister seems to be returning to the need to promote our competitiveness, a matter on which he will find no disagreement from this side of the House.</P>
      <P>The Minister also referred to the national spatial strategy, about which I have not heard for some time. While many on this side of the House were sceptical as to where the plan stood, in his concluding remarks the Minister made it clear that it still exists. I would be interested to hear the views of other Senators on the different provisions announced in the spatial strategy, many of which appear to have been cast aside since its announcement.</P>
      <P>The Minister also referred to the national development plan and suggested that a successor might be introduced on the expiry of the existing plan. I would like to see it continue with special emphasis on infrastructure and particular reference to public transport. To date public transport has not been satisfactorily addressed in Dublin or in the BMW region and its need for the western rail corridor. When establishing a successor to the national development plan, I urge the Minister and his colleagues to place particular emphasis on this area.</P>
      <P>The census in 2002 revealed that 18 counties, all outside the eastern region, recorded significant areas of rural population decline. Experts predict that the population of rural Ireland will decline by a further 20% in the next 15 years, which represents a very significant population decline.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to investment in road and rail infrastructure. I would like to discuss a couple of issues in that regard. A report produced by Indecon stated that road investment in the BMW region under the national development plan is well below the expenditure target. The report&rsquo;s finding that less than half of the projected funding for the roads programme in the region in 2002 was spent is most alarming. The Government failed to prioritise a single major roads project in the west of Ireland in 2003.</P>
      <P>Seven major roads schemes were started in 2003. Some &euro;1.26 billion was spent by the National Roads Authority on roads and bypasses in that year. Most of the work took place in regions which have already been developed. Some &euro;445 million was spent on roads projects in the Dublin local authority areas in 2003 but funding of just &euro;68 million was provided for such projects in Connacht in the same year. The roads schemes which were commenced in the BMW region in 2004 include many which were intended to be completed by 2006, under the national development plan, but are now significantly behind schedule. According to the Western Development Commission, just &euro;926 million of the &euro;1.5 billion allocated to the BMW region in <Col N="614"/>the first three years of the national development plan was actually spent. Some &euro;644 million that should have been spent under the plan during that time was not spent.</P>
      <P>The roads building programme contained in the national development plan is at odds with the national spatial strategy, which was mentioned by the Minister in his opening remarks. The national development plan proposes a radial motorway network, with Dublin as its hub. The development of that network is considered to be of greater importance than the linking of road corridors to form an arc, curving through the south and west from Rosslare to Letterkenny via Waterford, Limerick, Galway and Sligo. The Minister spoke about road building schemes in the west and the BMW region, many of which are behind schedule. The N4 and N6 route between Dublin and Galway is many years behind schedule. We have not yet received a clear indication of when work on three or four separate projects on that route will be completed.</P>
      <P>The national rail strategy, known as the strategic rail review, rejects the recommendations and principles of the national spatial strategy. A 20-year programme of investment in this country&rsquo;s railways, at a cost of &euro;8.5 billion, is envisaged in the strategic rail review. That expenditure will be primarily targeted at improving rail services on Dublin-centred routes, to the exclusion of routes that underpin the national spatial strategy. The western rail corridor, which I have already mentioned, is an example of such a route. The reopening of the western line was dismissed as too expensive in the strategic rail review, which costed it at approximately &euro;572 million. West on Track, which was established to investigate the feasibility of reopening the line, has estimated that it would cost &euro;230 million to do so. Mr. Frank Dawson, Galway County Council&rsquo;s director of services, claims that the line could be reopened for &euro;215 million.</P>
      <P>The western rail corridor could be used to develop a cross-radial service, as well as commuter services to serve Limerick, Sligo and Galway. It could be used to connect cities, towns and rural communities along its route. The reopening of the western line could facilitate the expansion of the transport of Irish exports to international markets. The Minister mentioned earlier the facilities that are available at ports in the southern and eastern region, such as Rosslare and Waterford, both of which are served by railway lines. While such facilities are not in the BMW region, they could be used for its benefit. The western rail corridor could serve as a vital link between Sligo, Limerick and Waterford ports, which are currently served by substandard roads. Not only would an effective rail link overcome the roads problem, but it would also have the added bonus of taking heavy goods trucks off the roads.</P>
      <P>Job creation and population growth in rural areas would be much more feasible if the western rail corridor were reopened. The existing line <Col N="615"/>could be reopened relatively easily if the Government took the initiative by entering into a public private partnership to develop commuter services for towns and cities along the route. It would then be quite feasible to introduce other services along the rest of the line. The western rail corridor should be used to stimulate development in the BMW region, rather than following development into the area. The Government&rsquo;s typical response is to say it will wait until development growth areas along the western corridor have become established before it will consider establishing a rail link.</P>
      <P>The recent report of the enterprise strategy group recommended that spending on public transport in the west should be increased. The reopening of the western rail corridor would be in line with that requirement. When one considers that hundreds of million of euro are spent each year on the roads programme and other infrastructural projects, such as the Dublin Port tunnel and Luas, it is clear that the project&rsquo;s estimated cost of &euro;250 million can be met. The Minister for Transport should invest in the western rail line immediately to make it viable, which is a key objective of EU transport policy. He should develop commuter services to Sligo, Galway and Limerick and the Mayo link between Ballina, Castlebar and Westport. The expansion of the rail network to include Knock and Shannon airports is important if we are to ensure their future viability, especially following the recent restructuring of Aer Rianta.</P>
      <P>I was somewhat disappointed by some of the Minister&rsquo;s comments, just as I was disappointed about the revelation that the Government has consistently underspent in the BMW region. The Minister mentioned that Opposition Members raised objections some years ago when the country was divided into the BMW and southern and eastern regions for EU funding purposes. The objections raised at that time by those in the south east, which has consistently been the second poorest region in Ireland in recent years, were genuine and legitimate. I come from that area, which is not part of the BMW structure.</P>
      <P>The Government has undermined its policy on the BMW region by underspending the funds it announced it would spend in there. The Opposition has particular qualms about the Government&rsquo;s current policy in that regard. I look forward to hearing the contributions of other Senators on the BMW region, which has not been developed to its full potential in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Phelan for sharing time with me. I thank the Leader of the House for arranging this debate, which I have sought for a long time, on the funding allocated to the BMW region. Has the region received its fair share of funding in recent years? The Minister answered that question earlier when he said that the region has not received a fair share. It is shameful that the Government has neglected <Col N="616"/>certain parts of the BMW region. I do not doubt that certain areas within the BMW region have prospered as a consequence of investment. This country has received a considerable amount of money from the EU on the back of the BMW region. It is disgraceful to think that the Government has neglected to spend a considerable proportion of that funding in recent years.</P>
      <P>I travel through counties Mayo, Roscommon and Longford on my way to Dublin every week. I have not noticed any real change in such areas over the past seven or eight years. Although the railway line been refurbished in recent years, as the Minister said, it has cut just 20 minutes from the four-hour journey between Westport and Dublin. We await new signalling equipment to cut further time from that journey.</P>
      <P>I would like to speak about employment in the BMW region, particularly in Castlebar and the rest of County Mayo. Some 1,000 jobs were lost at Volex in Castlebar and 350 jobs were lost at Allergan in Westport in recent years. These jobs have not been replaced and there is no sign of a replacement. It is a disgrace that IDA Ireland does not seem to have any plans for further job creation in County Mayo. Many jobs have been created throughout the country in recent years, but no jobs have been announced for the Mayo area. Will the Minister ask IDA Ireland to outline its plans for that part of the BMW region?</P>
      <P>Knock International Airport has reached agreement with a number of air carriers and requires funding to expand. It is pressurising the Government for funding for certain developments required around the airport in this regard, but it is doing so to no avail.</P>
      <P>At a meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport yesterday, a submission was made on the open skies policy between the European Union and United States. One issue that arose was the need to strengthen existing services and provide further essential services around airports such as those at Knock and Shannon. If there is to be an open skies policy and further flights into Dublin, a balance must be achieved in the regions. Extra facilities will be required in the regional airports if they are to be viable and generate more traffic.</P>
      <P>There has been no work done on the national primary route from Westport to Dublin, particularly the section from Westport to Mullingar. If anything, a backward step has been taken. The busiest part of the N5 is from Castlebar to Westport but works on this stretch have now been put on the long finger. There is no sign of progress at all regarding the national secondary route from Castlebar to Claremorris, which is a very busy road. All of these projects were prioritised in a needs study conducted some years ago.</P>
      <P>The Government is now seeking a contribution of 20% from local authorities for waste water treatment facilities. Towns such as Castlebar are seeking funding of &euro;50 million to provide waste water treatment plants but the Government&rsquo;s request for a local contribution of 20% will mean that they will have to raise &euro;10 million to &euro;12 mil<Col N="617"/>lion if their waste water treatment units are to be developed. This is scandalous considering that funding was obtained for such projects in the BMW region. The Government wants the ratepayers and business people in the BMW region to foot the bill although areas that are not in that region had to make a local contribution of only 4% or 5%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Senator Feeney.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and his officials and I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s speech. It was important to set this debate in its general economic context and note that Ireland has managed to maintain an exceptional economic performance over many successive years. Senator John Paul Phelan is wrong that we have lost competitiveness. I recommend to him an article on this subject in the ESRI&rsquo;s quarterly published not more than a week ago. It shows under several different headings, including in respect of growth, employment and public finances and particularly in respect of our market share in different industrial sectors, with the exception of the footwear and clothing sectors in which we have lost EU market share, that our market share has improved considerably and, in some cases, dramatically so over the past few years.</P>
      <P>We all know that the division of the country into two regions was primarily to secure continued structural and cohesion funding under Agenda 2000. However, it was equally acknowledged in the Minister&rsquo;s speech that the breakdown does not reflect exactly the regional breakdown in income terms. According to the latest figures, which date back to 2000 and 2001, several counties in the south-east region, for example, have lower incomes <i>per capita</i> than some of the counties the Senators mentioned, such as Galway, Mayo and Roscommon.</P>
      <P>Let us consider the real regional policy issue. The greater Dublin area has been the engine of growth for the economy in many respects and I do not in any way begrudge it this growth. However, income figures suggest that our major cities, including Galway, Limerick and Waterford, have a higher <i>per capita</i> income than some of the counties that do not have such strong centres. It is a real challenge to maintain a balance.</P>
      <P>Some of the debates we have been having on transport and so on have proven that the greater Dublin area is capable of soaking up billions of euro. In that regard, I believe the contribution of the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Callely, was mentioned this morning on the Order of Business. However, it is also the case that relatively small amounts of money in comparison to the amount that could be soaked up by the greater Dublin area can make <Col N="618"/>a considerable difference to the regions. I quoted an example pertaining to railways last week. There has been much discussion of railways although they do not necessarily comprise the only subject we should be discussing. The renovation and reopening of a certain length of line to Midleton would cost approximately &euro;45 million while the renovation and reopening of a similar length of line, such as that going to Dunboyne, would cost approximately &euro;145 million. The difference in price is largely due to the cost of land acquisition.</P>
      <P>The Minister made the important point that the BMW region has grown by some 33% in the past six years and that 120,000 more people are in employment. He stated it is now the second wealthiest Objective One region. However, there is a catch. I keep making and clearly need to continue making the point that there is a difference between GDP <i>per capita</i> and GNP <i>per capita</i>. The former makes us look very good. It flatters us and makes us the third wealthiest country in the EU, but it is not actually real. Therefore, we should bear in mind the latter. I know many of the statistics are not measured in this way and therefore we need to keep our feet on the ground.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that since the introduction of the national development plan, significant extra industrial investment has taken place in many parts of the BMW region, although not necessarily in all parts. In the mid-1990s, all funds, apart from some which were spent on a major project in Clonmel, were pumped into the greater Dublin region. This has changed, which is for the good. On the other hand, colleagues from places such as south-west Donegal, where the electricity capacity is not really sufficient to support industry and where there are questions over the lines of communication, will state that there is a problem associated with attracting investment to such regions. North-east Donegal obviously has the advantage of being closer to Derry and can therefore benefit from major cross-Border energy plans.</P>
      <P>Senator Paddy Burke referred to less glamorous matters that are very important for development, such as water treatment plants. There is very little political mileage in such projects but they are vital to underpin development.</P>
      <P>Bearing in mind that there will be relatively little funding after 2007, the Minister asked for our views on whether there is value in having a national development plan. I believe there is because it provides an overall framework at which one can look. It would also be useful in the context of social partnership discussions. While there are multi-annual envelopes for various sectors and one can argue that it is not strictly necessary, the overview is valuable.</P>
      <P>The Minister talked about not duplicating investment, particularly in the area of transport. Choice is a fundamental economic principle. One can spend two hours commuting each way in a car or half an hour in a train even if one must stand. In congested areas we need all possible <Col N="619"/>modes of transport. The Department of Finance should not use this as an excuse to say that as there is a higher return on roads all the money should go into roads and we should forget about public transport. That is not happening but such an argument should not receive support.</P>
      <P>Clonmel, one of the most dynamic towns in the country, was not chosen as a hub or a gateway in the national spatial strategy for reasons I do not understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>That might be because it is not in the BMW region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>It is one of the most successful regional towns in the country. This underlines that we do not live in what used to be called a planned economy. Market forces play a major role in economic development and they like Clonmel. People involved in drawing up the plans should remember that these factors are indicative and be fluid and flexible. One cannot simply dictate a development from the top. Se&aacute;n Lemass knew this in the 1960s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I warmly welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe. I also welcome the Minister&rsquo;s speech and thank Senator Mansergh for sharing his time.</P>
      <P>We have benefited significantly from EU Structural and Cohesion Funds. The prudent far-seeing financial management of the economy by the Government has resulted in Ireland becoming wealthier than any of us could have foreseen or imagined. Our national income is above the EU average, something of which we are all very proud. We must now, however, ensure that our wealth is spread throughout the country, and investment should positively discriminate in favour of the peripheral economic regions.</P>
      <P>The BMW region falls below national averages in many respects, including income per head, population growth, and public transport investments. We must strive to narrow the differentials through further investment in infrastructure, particularly in the west and north west.</P>
      <P>It was rather worrying to hear the Minister say that post-2006 Structural Funds transfers to the BMW region would be modest. As his speech progressed, however, it was encouraging to hear him emphasise that investment choices at national and regional level would take account of the national spatial strategy which in turn would benefit the BMW region. As one who has lived there for over 20 years, I am glad Sligo is a gateway. I hope that will be the result of the enhancement of the north west.</P>
      <P>I am also delighted by the idea of decentralisation but we must be rigorous in pushing this forward. It is a great stimulus to peripheral regions &mdash; 200 permanent Civil Service jobs in a provin<Col N="620"/>cial town are better and last longer than the jobs provided by a factory.</P>
      <P>Three of my four children are in third level education and had to move away from Sligo to attend university. One is in Dublin and two are in Galway. Although Galway is closer to Sligo than Dublin and is in the same province, it is easier to travel to Dublin using the rail, road or new air services. The Minister attributed this to subvention for passenger rail and air services. Surely it is wrong that students are being taken out of the west to go to the east. We should try to keep them in the west, particularly their own province where the education is the same as that in the east. The western seaboard infrastructure must be a priority.</P>
      <P>EU investment in Ireland over the past 30 years has helped it turn from being a beneficiary to a contributory nation. We must do the same for the regions. I am delighted by the Minister&rsquo;s objective to increase levels of investment in the BMW region.</P>
      <P>I hope that the Minister of State will convey my comments to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen. The Minister has brought together a group of consultants to review tax breaks on which he has an open mind. It is important that he retains that openness. It saddens and annoys me to hear the Opposition say that those tax breaks help the rich to get richer. That is far from the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Senator name those people? Who said that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the Labour Party. I apologise to Senator Bannon for including him in that criticism. I will concentrate on directing my annoyance towards the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>I travel from Dublin to the north-west twice or three times a week and see at first hand the extent of good housing developed as a result of rural and urban renewal. There are fabulous hotels dotted across the BMW region but I am most familiar with those in the Sligo-Leitrim area. They receive good publicity in the commercial property supplement of <i>The Irish Times</i> today.</P>
      <P>Those facilities would not exist were it not for the reliefs we have enjoyed. Our investment in construction has created jobs and its continuing operation will remain an excellent asset. I urge the Minister to keep an open mind and not throw away the tax reliefs.</P>
      <P>One of the Sunday newspapers carried a report stating that companies in the International Financial Services Centre have contributed more than &euro;700 million in corporation tax in the last year, which is wonderful. That centre would not be there but for the far-seeing Fianna F&aacute;il Government of the time and, in particular, Charles J. Haughey, when Garret FitzGerald tried to block it. It is wonderful that there are companies there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Senator Feeney is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am approximately the same age as Senator Bannon and I remember Garret FitzGerald blocking the proposal for the IFSC. Were it not for Fianna F&aacute;il, it would not be in place. Is it not wonderful that the centre contributes more than &euro;700 million in taxes to the Exchequer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Garret FitzGerald never trusted the leadership of Fianna F&aacute;il at that time and he was proved right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>That was an interesting exchange, although the IFSC is not connected with the BMW region, any more than is Clonmel. I must concur with Senator Feeney on the IFSC, an idea for which Charles J. Haughey was widely criticised at the time. That is the reality.</P>
      <P>The issues in the BMW region relate to the people, the environment and the infrastructure. The infrastructure allows people to engage with the environment. There are significant problems in terms of lack of investment in that area. In welcoming the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, to the House, I would ask him to consider this aspect. I addressed a meeting last week in Mayo and I said that if I were examining the BMW region, I would start at the water and move eastwards, which is a difficult thing to do.</P>
      <P>Senator Feeney gave a good example of the difficulty for her children travelling from Sligo to college in Galway. I have heard that example given on several occasions. All the infrastructure in the BMW region is heading eastwards, not north-south, which is a fundamental issue in terms of infrastructure. If we start at the Atlantic, how many significant fishing ports are on the west coast? If one travels from Castletownbere to Dingle, the next port is Killybegs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>There is Rossaveel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Rossaveel is a processing area. It is not a huge fishing port and it would be nothing but for the efforts of a former Fine Gael junior Minister, Mr. John Donnellan, who many years ago ensured that it was developed. He must take full credit for that in the same way the former <Col N="622"/>Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, can take credit for the IFSC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>One cannot compare them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no significant fishing port in the area. A friend of mine has a fish processing factory in Rossaveel. However, I would consider Rossaveel a port rather than a fishing port. Anyone who spends an hour there will agree with that. There is nothing of significance in Mayo or Sligo. It is an indication that the whole tourism aspect of angling has not been developed along that coast.</P>
      <P>In terms of access, there is now a programme to invest in a number of marinas in that area, and not before time. Some committees have been asking whether they are good value for money. They are absolutely essential to opening up that whole area. There is a marina in Kilrush and there is a proposal to build one in Galway, perhaps on the Aran Islands. There is none on the west coast of Clare, or north Clare, which would be an ideal spot for a marina. There is also a proposal to build something similar in the Belmullet area, Sligo and north Donegal. This is what needs to be happening.</P>
      <P>What is being done about our rail infrastructure? There should be a train every hour from Dublin to Sligo, Dublin to Ballina, Dublin to Westport, Dublin to Galway, Dublin to Ennis and Dublin to Limerick. That is the only way we will open up our rail infrastructure. In terms of the north-south area, that rail link must be established, and not just from the western rail corridor. There is not just a problem with the western rail corridor, there should be a rail link from Sligo to Limerick Junction or wherever and across to Rosslare on the existing line. This should be a viable upgraded line. This would open up a whole area of the country which has been ignored by the tourism industry. This cannot be opposed.</P>
      <P>It all boils down to the quality of the water in our rivers, lakes, water supply and sewerage system. I agree with Senator Mansergh that sewerage systems are now developing right along the Shannon. There has been a significant improvement in all the towns in the west because of the establishment of water treatment and sewerage plants of various descriptions. A query was raised here recently as to where the plan is and how far it will go. There should be a national development plan after 2006, which should be directed at areas of the country that need a leg-up, so to speak. According to the latest reports from the NRA, the infrastructural plans in terms of roads should be up and running by 2010.</P>
      <P>In regard to how people in these areas live, there are great difficulties with planning in the whole BMW region. If we take all the opposing or conflicting arguments, what is happening at the moment is not acceptable. Objections to granting planning permission every time someone wants to build a house in the area where they were born and reared must be considered in a measured, <Col N="623"/>informed and focused way. I am opposed to people being allowed to build in an area just because they live there. However, I am equally opposed to the blanket opposition to building that takes place time and time again. An Taisce has been responsible for much of this over a long time. Hamlet development should be encouraged, particularly where there are existing houses. Someone who lives and works in an area should be given more consideration than someone who is building a holiday home.</P>
      <P>While I agree that tax breaks should be examined, I would be opposed to the elimination of all of them. However, they should be examined because it was never intended that the super rich should pay no tax. Members of this House will be aware that many middle income people in their circle of friends have taken advantage of tax breaks. This does not apply to just the super rich. We also know there has been a gain in the hotel industry in particular. Senator Feeney&rsquo;s point is correct in terms of the quality hotels that are being developed throughout the west. The last time I spoke on this issue, I made the point that there was no hotel in Belmullet, for instance, which is a central area for golf, tourism and many other pursuits. A hotel is now being built in the area, which is very important.</P>
      <P>The Senator referred to Sligo and Leitrim. However, what is being done to Leitrim village is not acceptable. A village that had 30 houses some years ago will now have 400 houses, with no appropriate infrastructure. Many of these will be ghost houses which are not lived in. We need to draw a distinction when planning permission is being granted in these areas so they are not overrun.</P>
      <P>To return to the commuter issue, we must examine how we can serve Limerick and Galway. We hear every morning on the radio that the Oranmore roundabout and the Tuam Road are completely blocked. Senator Kitt said in this House some months ago that a commuter service from Tuam to Galway could be up and running in six months, whereas to build a road would take six years. In terms of infrastructural gain, this is what we should be considering. The week before Christmas 2003, a commuter service was opened between Ennis and Limerick. Its use has now quadrupled, even without building all the intervening stations such as Bunratty, Sixmilebridge and so on, which must also be considered. It indicates that there is a demand for this service, and there would also be a demand in the other direction. If Ennis-Limerick is viable, there is no reason Ennis-Galway would not be viable. If Ennis-Galway is viable, why is Galway-Limerick not viable? There is no doubt that a rail service into Galway would be a winner. Last month Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann began a new morning commuter service from Athlone to Galway. I have not examined the figures, but I intend doing so in the next week or so. I have no doubt that the train will be filled and used frequently. We cannot <Col N="624"/>allow a situation to continue whereby the last train out of places like Sligo, Ballina and Castlebar, and back to Galway, is at 6 p.m. Even from Cork, the last train leaves at approximately 6.30 p.m. or 7 p.m. That is disgraceful. It is a waste of a resource for trains to be parked in stations overnight and not to be used. We should invest in our rail network.</P>
      <P>A difficulty in discussing railways is that nobody working in CIE remembers the last time a railroad was built nor do they know anybody who worked on the building of one. People think that investment in rail infrastructure is a major undertaking but it is not.</P>
      <P>We are discussing the proposed M3 route, against which I spoke trenchantly recently. However, I said that I supported the idea of an M3. Why should we not provide for a railroad running alongside that new motorway? We are talking about the Dublin-Dunboyne, Dublin-Dunshaughlin and Dublin-Navan routes. When building every new road why can space not be provided for a railway to run alongside, as is provided in half of the world? France is probably the best served country in Europe in terms of a railway service. Railways are still being built there. Only in the past two years a TGV line from Lille in northern France to the Mediterranean was opened. That is the type of development we need here. Given the cost of parking, motorists realise it is not worth the effort to drive into Dublin. These are issues that need to be examined.</P>
      <P>In terms of support for investment in infrastructure &mdash; I acknowledge I did not deal with the road network &mdash; we should recognise all the smart advice from people on the east coast in regard to airports in the west, particularly in Galway and Knock, was that neither of them was viable. There was opposition to the provision of an airport at Knock from the two main political parties. Senator Mansergh will be quick to contradict me if I am wrong about that, but as I recall Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The same applies to Fianna F&aacute;il. There was no support for that infrastructure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I used that example not to make a party political point but to make a different point. Every time I discuss infrastructure in the west with the experts, they tend to be based in Dublin and to come to a longitudinal conclusion on the matter. They point out the number of people who use the railways and say that if we were to invest many millions of euro in them and divide that amount by the number of people who use them, the investment would not be viable. They never talk in terms of the demand for the service. I am aware that Senator Mansergh shares many of my views on this. We must create demand for the service. Such development of the rail service would work and we need to move forward on that.</P>
      <P>I have spoken on a number of occasions about the negative consequences of selling Eircom. It is not so much that many subscribers lost money on their investment in shares as the opportunity lost to extend the rollout of broadband to every corner of the country. That needs to be done and the necessary resources must be invested.</P>
      <P>I was in the Galway Gaeltacht recently and noted that three companies were engaged in interpreting the written word, the spoken word and video work. They were able to do their business from the L&aacute;r-Ghaeltacht in Connemara because they had a broadband facility to transmit information down the line. They did not need to be based in a city. Ten years ago that type of industry would have had to be based in the centre of Dublin as that would have been the only place such companies would have had the necessary back-up. Those companies are a classic example of how broadband can open up the west and the extension of such facilities is crucial to achieving that objective.</P>
      <P>Every time the issue of the west is raised, people take a broad view but unfortunately debate usually centres on constituency matters. The west needs to be considered by people who think beyond the basis of their constituencies and who will envisage a plan for its development. We have people who are open to change and are adventurous, entrepreneurial and considerate. They can ensure the growth of the economy of the west, not merely a continuity of its protection, that will match that of any in the rest of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State. I am delighted to have this opportunity to make a few points on this issue. The many representatives from the BMW region in the House have been seeking this debate for some time.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s speech and broadly agree with its main thrust, although I have some <Col N="626"/>concerns about aspects thereof. We in the BMW region do not wish to have anything at the expense of people in any other region. We acknowledge wholeheartedly that there has been an unprecedented level of funding and improvement in the region in recent years. However, we are not much closer to closing the gap, which we would all hope to achieve at some stage in terms of balanced regional development between the BMW region and other regions. The gap still exists because improvements in the southern and eastern region are not in proportion to improvements in our region.</P>
      <P>I want to change the focus slightly. The statistics that make the BMW region look as well as it does in certain respects result predominantly from the success of Galway and the south-east midlands, rather than the rest of the country. There is a line, not one I drew but which has been drawn by Departments, between Dublin and Galway. We have had an underspend of almost 40% on targets to date. That money is available and it is a disgrace that it has not been not spent. There can be no justification for that. I do not understand the reason for that and I call on the Minister, the cross-departmental team on infrastructure and the officials in the Department to put in place a plan to get that project up to speed as a matter of the utmost urgency.</P>
      <P>When Departments examine the question of the infrastructure required in the west, they consistently fail to take account of the historic deficiencies in infrastructure in terms of building roads and so on. That must be done. The <i>per capita</i> scenario in terms of expenditure will not stack up in that region and will become worse unless we are prepared to invest capital in infrastructure in the area and achieve one of the primary objectives of the national spatial strategy, namely, to create capacity before demand. If we do not have the capacity, we will not have the demand. Se&aacute;n Dorgan of the IDA has consistently pointed out that no level of IDA grant aid to foreign direct investors will compensate for a deficient or weak infrastructure. That continues to be the case.</P>
      <P>I want to deal with a number of issues concerning roads. North of a line from Dublin to Galway we have the N4 and the N2 heading north. Neither of these is included in the national development plan as an inter-urban routes, despite the fact that these are trans-European networks according to the EU Commission. For example, while the N4 heading north west is a particularly good road at present, it is not earmarked for upgrading to dual carriageway or motorway status as would be the case in respect of roads serving other centres. There can be no excuse for that. In terms of drawing up a template for road improvements in the future, the national roads needs study of 1988 is the one that applies. That was put together by the National Roads Authority using historical vehicle movements, which are completely out of date in today&rsquo;s context.</P><Col N="627"/>
      <P>In terms of energy requirements, we have heard about the problems in south-west Donegal. Senator O&rsquo;Toole mentioned An Taisce which played a major role in blocking plans by the ESB to bring in a 220 kV line which is much needed and, as a result, no energy-dependent industry can locate there at this stage. We were pleased in Sligo that we made progress with our 220 kV line but there are other areas in the region that must be dealt with.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>It is ironic that we have such reserves of gas off the west coast but we will not receive any benefit from them according to the CEO of Bord G&aacute;is, who recently said that while everything was going well, there was a commercial mandate on the company and there were no plans to extend the network to the north west. I have a letter dated 21 March 2001 in which the then Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise stated that the Government had decided to extend the gas network to the north west and that the necessary arrangements would put in place as quickly as possible. I have no doubt that the Government is committed to extending the network to the north west but I would like the see the management of Bord G&aacute;is making the necessary arrangements.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>We should be doing a number of things to improve rail transport. None of the 400 new rail carriages being purchased by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is for the Sligo to Dublin line &mdash; we will get the hand-me-downs from the Cork line. We will be glad to get them, considering the 18th century stock we are currently using, but there is no visionary approach to the fact that 1 million people will locate around Dublin between now and 2020 and we want to accommodate them. Land prices and the costs of production, building and infrastructural improvements will be much lower if we look at the gateways and hubs that lie north of the line between Dublin and Galway and decide to invest in them and create the capacity for people to live. That will make these areas more attractive to foreign direct investors and stimulate indigenous industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State thought they were all going to Laois.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has closed its freight facilities in Sligo, which is a gateway city. From where did that decision come?</P>
      <P>There is no university north of the line between Dublin and Galway, other than St. Angela&rsquo;s College, which is a constituent college. There are excellent institutes of technology, which are the shining lights of the region and are propping it up in many ways. We should seek a cluster of institutes of technology and make them into a <Col N="628"/>north western university. The IDA has stated that intellectual property and physical infrastructure are the most valuable currencies when it comes to attracting foreign direct investment or stimulating indigenous commercial activity.</P>
      <P>Last week outside Leinster House people from the south east protested that there is no radiotherapy centre in Waterford. I hope they get one but north of the line from Dublin to Galway, there is no radiotherapy facility and no plans for one.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that any submissions made to him must have an economic return as a result of the programme or project being promoted and prioritisation within and between projects. In any other region I would support that, but it cannot be applied north of the line between Dublin and Galway and west of the eastern corridor to Belfast. If we go on a strict cost-benefit analysis, we are closing the door on the area north of the line between Dublin and Galway because it will not pay to put anything in place there. If, as the national spatial strategy aspires to do, we create capacity before demand, the people of those areas will rise to the challenge and create the good fortune for themselves.</P>
      <P>The national spatial strategy is the best template for this State ever put together. When it was launched, however, I stated that there was concern about whether everyone would buy into it and that it might require legislation. I have given examples where we do not buy into it. If semi-State companies were conscious of the aspirations of the national spatial strategy, why are they closing freight departments in gateway cities? Why is Bord G&aacute;is not going into the north-west? The maps of its network are laughable, the entire north-west is blank.</P>
      <P>We must examine the national spatial strategy and ensure everyone buys into it. It should be the prime directive of any arm of the State that any plan conceptualised must dovetail with the strategy. That is not the case at present and that is a disappointment because it is a great plan. We must be prepared to create capacity before demand in line with the strategy and I call on the Minister and his colleagues to do more, on top of the great work we have already done in these areas and, if necessary, be prepared to borrow for it. China is gaining a competitive advantage &mdash; it laid 500,000 km of motorway in the past five years. There was not a single km laid in that time north of the line between Dublin and Galway and west of the Dublin to Belfast corridor.</P>
      <P>I hope we will look at this region on a more strategic basis and invest appropriately because in time we will reap the rewards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment the Leader of the House for facilitating us with a debate on the mid-term review of the BMW region and I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I wish the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach and the entire Cabinet were here to hear Senator MacSharry relate the neglect by the Government <Col N="629"/>of the BMW region. He listed statistics in a range of areas from infrastructure through education to health. The Senator knows what is not happening in the BMW region and why there has been an underspend. As a Longford person I welcome the chance to discuss the lack of progress in a region which has much to offer to the native population and to visitors.</P>
      <P>The BMW region has 47% of the land area of the country but only 27% of the population. It has a weak urban base, with only 32% of its population in urban areas compared with 68% for the rest of the country. The population growth rate of 1.7% between 1991 and 1996 is slower than in the rest of the country, with a population density half that of the national average. It is comprised predominantly of rural areas, some of which are disadvantaged and suffer from a lack of agricultural and infrastructural resources. After years of relative decline, however, recent years have seen some expansion, with output growing by 7.5% in current prices between 1991 and 1996 and the numbers at work growing by nearly 44,000 in the same period.</P>
      <P>Some of the results of the mid-term evaluation of the BMW regional operational programme, however, are alarming to say the least. Little funding has been drawn down in several areas, including general rural development, e-commerce, agriculture, tourism and waste management because of Government bureaucracy, red tape and neglect.</P>
      <P>Unlike the affluent connotations of its name, the BMW region did not have a tiger in its tank. While the southern and eastern regions have had a disproportionate share of the fruits of the Celtic tiger, we have had to make do with far less than a fair or equitable share. We urgently need to remove administrative obstacles and red tape and give more focus and drive to the operational programmes. If we do not fund them we will have to go back to the EU as happened in the past. However, we may not receive favourable treatment because a huge number of new nations are also looking for funding. It is, therefore, important that we spend the funding we are given.</P>
      <P>The BMW region is urgently in need of investment in infrastructure, including roads, rail, communications, broadband and natural gas. It is a shame that natural gas is brought from the west through the midlands to the east coast while nearly all the towns in the BMW region are neglected. We have called several times for a spur to be brought from Athlone or Moate to Longford. To date, this has not happened and the Government seems to have no intention of doing it despite demands from development associations, county development boards and so on in the different counties.</P>
      <P>The allocation of &euro;600 million in the national development plan has not been spent in the BMW region. Moreover, the national development plan has failed to address the imbalance between the BMW region and the southern and <Col N="630"/>eastern regions. Major deficits are still evident in these areas.</P>
      <P>Despite increased expenditure on roads nationally, there is slow progress on the upgrading of many national and secondary routes throughout the region, for example, the N5 Kinnegad-Galway motorway, the N2, N3, N60, N62, N63, N52 and N55. I have called repeatedly for the development of the N55 because if it was properly developed it would divert much of the traffic from the east coast back through the midlands. It would make great sense to develop it. This case has been put forward several times by the Midland Regional Authority and also by the BMW regional assembly. There is wonderful support for it but the Government has not taken any initiative on it. With the national secondary routes being of the utmost importance to the BMW region, greater investment is urgently needed.</P>
      <P>The Minister has travelled the N55 and seen the bottlenecks and the poor structure of the route between Athlone and Cavan. Something needs to be done. It must be given higher priority than it is getting at present from Government. The latest announcement by the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, surprisingly pre-empts the publication of any details by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, on a ten-year transport plan. It is hardly credible, let alone seeming to offer hope to the BMW region.</P>
      <P>With the national development plan in its fifth year, spending at mid-term in the BMW region under the regional operational programme has been slow to date. Only 54% of the target expenditure was spent from January 2000 to June 2004, with agriculture and rural development reaching only 26% of the target for the period. Expenditure from June 2002 to June 2005 highlights the under-funding of the BMW region. On the productivity sector of the operational programme, the national spend is 62%. The spend in the BMW region is 39% while it is 61% in the southern and eastern regions. On the economic and social infrastructure operational programme, the national spend is 91% while it is 75% in the BMW region and 96% in the southern and eastern regions. The figures speak for themselves.</P>
      <P>The BMW region urgently needs an improved rail service plan. This was referred to by other Senators. The reopening of the western rail corridor is essential to the provision of commuter rail services to the major towns. In addition the rolling stock and services on the Sligo, Westport and Ballina lines must be upgraded. This has been called for repeatedly. Another essential element, which has been a pet project of mine for a long time, is a central rail line linking the towns of Roscommon, Tullamore, Mullingar, Longford and Cavan in the midlands. It is important to begin developing in this region. To reach Cork from Longford or Westmeath one must go either to Dublin or Port Laoise. We deserve better than that in this modern era of communications.</P><Col N="631"/>
      <P>Airport facilities are of growing importance in order to attract inward investment and tourism. With the competition now associated with the tourism industry and the changing face of holidays and holiday destinations, ease of access is essential to attract tourists to the region. Knock is the only international airpost in the BMW region, with the south west being served by three airports, Shannon, Cork and Kerry. Abbeyshrule Airfield, with which the Minister is very familiar, should be developed for the midlands. When he represented the constituency of Longford-Westmeath and Longford-Roscommon, the former Taoiseach, Mr. Albert Reynolds, gave a commitment to develop Abbeyshrule. That was a decade ago and little has happened since then apart from the efforts of the local committee.</P>
      <P>A matter of grave concern is the complete lack of expenditure in the BMW region in important areas such as recreational angling and marine tourism. No resources have been put in place for regional sports centres or the development of a new swimming pool for Longford. These areas are an essential ingredient in any tourism package. We are still awaiting child care facilities. There is a huge number of applicants in the BMW region but the issue seems to have been put on the back boiler. It is important to recognise the areas of greatest weakness within the BMW region which have been repeatedly outlined. I will not cite the entire list.</P>
      <P>A regional foresight study is being undertaken in the BMW area by the regional assembly. My brother, Larry Bannon, is the only Longford County Council representative on the assembly and he is doing his best. However, he is frustrated with the slow rate of progress and the fact that Government red tape and bureaucracy is preventing the assembly from drawing down the necessary funds to develop the region.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will take note of what has been said today by the Opposition and by members of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party. They are very disappointed, as are we, with the slow pace of drawing down funding for the various projects in the region. I hope we will see firm action after today&rsquo;s debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Leader is listening to the debate. If we move faster, we may finish on time.</P>
      <P>The disappointment of Senator Bannon is nothing to the disappointment that would have been experienced if his party were in Government when we achieved Objective One status for the BMW region. That party had no plan to regionalise the country. Fianna F&aacute;il took a very brave step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Fianna F&aacute;il was not in favour of Objective One status for the BMW area but was forced to accept it so there is no point in Senator Leyden bleating now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not surprised by Senator Leyden&rsquo;s statement. He always speaks nonsense, not only here but also in the constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, was here earlier. I am delighted he came to the House. He made an excellent speech in this regard. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon.</P>
      <P>One of the most important points made by the Minister was the underspending of &euro;650 million set out in the plan, although Exchequer funding investment in infrastructure in the region was just &euro;240 million below the profile. We have time on our hands to get investment into the region before the deadline of 2006. That is the reason I suggest we concentrate on those projects that are ready to roll and can receive the necessary investment for regional development in the BMW area. One major project that will come to Government is the western railway corridor which should be reopened. A major investment of funds would be required to have it reopened.</P>
      <P>Were it not for the input of the Leader, the then Minister for Public Enterprise, we would not have the existing railway system from Westport to Athlone. It was in dire straits as far as investment was concerned from a safety point of view. That rail line has been upgraded but the carriages have not been upgraded. The Government should invest in new carriages for that link out of the money that has been underspent. Those are the areas in which investment is required.</P>
      <P>Horan International Airport at Knock was built by the late Monsignor James Horan in co-operation with the former Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey. We stood by that project when others said it was a foggy boggy site and created Knock International Airport. More investment is needed in that airport to attract more business. I suggest <Col N="633"/>that consideration be given to whether the &euro;40 million can be given to Knock International Airport to improve existing conditions.</P>
      <P>As far as schools are concerned, two school projects in my area, Scoil Mhuire gan Sm&aacute;l, Strokestown, and Elphin Community College, are seeking approval to invest in major developments of both campuses. That is developing the regions and the BMW area, particularly in a county such as Roscommon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope we can return to this debate. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, to secure decentralisation as quickly as possible for the BMW region. There are a number of areas, including Knock, which have a Government Department and Roscommon has the Land Registry. We have much to be proud of in terms of &ldquo;a lot done and more to do&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the new Western Development Commission appointed today by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, which includes Mary Devine-O&rsquo;Callaghan, from my constituency, and Des Mahon, Mayo county manager. They work in conjunction with the BMW region.</P>
      <P>I believe in the BMW region. I suggest that signs be erected on the building in Ballaghaderreen. We are proud to have the BMW region&rsquo;s headquarters but there should be large signs in the square indicating that it is located in Ballaghaderreen. Given that there are no signs to indicate it is in the town, I ask that some investment be made in the promotion of the BMW headquarters and the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Leyden for sharing time with me. What concerns me is that the plan is drawing to a close and will be finished in approximately a year&rsquo;s time. I was surprised to learn from the Minister today that no decision has been made by the Government to have another national development plan. It is critical that we have a further national development plan. If my contribution can be worthwhile in encouraging the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, to speak to the Government about the necessity to do that, today&rsquo;s debate will have been effective.</P>
      <P>I am more concerned about the issues that have not been dealt with in recent years. Unfortunately, when the BMW area was established, Clare was omitted. There are major problems especially on the west coast where there are small villages without sewerage systems and small fishing harbours in need of development. Coastal erosion has caused enormous damage and resources such as wave power, which has enormous potential, and the oil and gas reserves identified off the Clare coast at Spanish Point have <Col N="634"/>not been harnessed. No effort has been made to undertake an investigation or exploitation of that huge resource of oil and wave power. My message to the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, given that this development plan and the BMW region are winding up, is that some thought and effort be put in well in advance of 2006 in order that an overall national development plan will take account of the declining populations in the small villages, the neglect of sewerage facilities in villages&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I emphasise the necessity to put a new national development plan in place and to commence it now to deal with the shortcomings in the existing arrangement. It is unreal that substantial available funding has not been spent. How can we go back to the EU seeking additional funding if we have not spent what is earmarked? There is an urgency to expedite these plans and the provision of sewerage facilities, harbour facilities and marinas, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole <Col N="635"/>said, such as at Ballyvaughan which has been crying out for a marina for the past 20 years. Funding has not been spent while huge projects such as these could be developed which would have enormous benefits for less developed areas of west Clare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Ulick Burke has two or three minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I greatly appreciate being facilitated. I thank the Leader for accepting my proposal last week on the Order of Business for a debate on the BMW region. On that occasion I highlighted the very point made by Senator Daly, namely, that &euro;640 million was unspent last year. Whoever is responsible for that has to accept blame for the discrepancy between development in the west under the BMW region and the rest of the country. In 2000, there was a gap of 13.7% between the BMW region and the rest of the country. Today the gap is 13%. Therefore, that is a minimal change, despite all we have heard from the Government side about the huge investment and so on. The return is an 0.7% GDP improvement in the status and that is not acceptable. There is no commitment and no prioritisation by Government towards spending and improving the level of infrastructure and economic development of the west if that is the reality.</P>
      <P>It is frightening to note the report by a Teagasc official last week that by 2020, the flight from the land will be worse than it has ever been in our economic history. Some 25,000 to 35,000 additional people will have left rural Ireland, particularly in the BMW region. No Government policy is in place to stem that tide and there is no indication of such a policy. It is clear from the budgets of the past three years that there was no response to agriculture, our primary industry in the past. Senator MacSharry said our natural resources were being taken out of the region. If we are talking about developing the west, why is there not a commitment towards it?</P>
      <P>When Deputy Brennan was Minister for Transport he had an opportunity to show his intention of balancing the economic infrastructure and the input of resources. He provided &euro;300 million for a feasibility study on the provision of the western corridor rail link. Estimates show that &euro;215 million would provide that rail link between Sligo and Limerick. At the same time he was providing &euro;3 billion for the provision of a rail infrastructure in Dublin. We have yet to see whether or not that will happen. Can this be called prioritisation? Is this an adherence to the principles of Objective One status? It is not.</P>
      <P>Senator Leyden referred to this Government looking for Objective One status. It was hauled reluctantly into making a decision. It waited two years before making a decision. The end of the Objective One status will come in 2006 and the west will not have benefited <i>pro rata </i>in terms of the rest of the country. The Minister of State <Col N="636"/>should take note of the figure of 0.7%. This has been the rate of improvement over the past five years. There will be no better rate of improvement. This is the record and the indictment of this Government. Even the Western Development Commission was starved of resources and finances at a time when it was willing to put forward improvement projects.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of Senators emphasised the need for investment in public transport. The Government&rsquo;s record in this area is exemplary. From a base of virtually zero investment in public transport in 1997, which is not that long ago, the Government is now providing approximately &euro;0.5 billion per year for the sector, resulting in a major increase in public transport capacity, including improvements in the BMW region. The key rail lines into the BMW region were completely upgraded by the end of 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a quick skip for the Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has forced me to be quick. Those rail lines will be totally upgraded and there will be significant investment in the rolling stock. Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann was recently given approval for the extension of the rail network track and signalling project to the Westport and Ballina lines.</P>
      <P>A number of Senators referred to specific projects in the transport area and these are matters to be dealt with by the relevant Minister. The Government is providing unprecedented levels of <Col N="637"/>investment in transport, including public transport. In the period 2005-09, the Government will provide &euro;10.15 billion. I remind Senators that there is pressure for spending in other important areas, particularly in health, and therefore expenditure and investment must be prioritised by the Government.</P>
      <P>Senator Phelan expressed his support for continuing investment in infrastructure after 2006 which I welcome. This is in line with Government policy as set out in the multi-annual capital envelopes. However, I do not agree with his contention that our approach to investment in roads is out of line with the national spatial strategy. The key objective is to provide good links between the national spatial strategy gateways. The national development plan and post-2006 investment will achieve this aim.</P>
      <P>The country&rsquo;s employment growth rate is one of the best in Europe. This proves that the country is competitive but we must remain vigilant. Employment rates are rising and employment growth is also in evidence in the BMW region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The rate of unemployment in Donegal is 19% and it is 40% in Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I will deal with that point. As the Minister stated earlier, employment in the BMW region has grown by one third in the past six years. This is an annual rate of 5% which is exceptionally strong judged by national and international norms.</P>
      <P>Senator Ulick Burke implied that there would be an underspend of the Structural Funds in the BMW region but I can guarantee this is not the case. The overall spend in the BMW region is behind profile. However, as the Minister stated in his contribution, the objective is to increase the spend in the region over the remaining term of the plan and Senators can be assured in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Was there not a &euro;640 million underspend last year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the support of a number of Senators for the national spatial strategy. As part of the Government&rsquo;s work to embed the national spatial strategy in the investment plans of Departments and agencies, these bodies must now report annually to the Department of Finance on the fit between their capital expenditure and the national spatial strategy. This is a critical part of the capital envelopes arrangements.</P>
      <P>The BMW region is now the second wealthiest Objective One region in the entire European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>With what is the Minister of State comparing it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>The other Objective One regions. I compliment the Government for being so successful. If it was not for its success in negotiating <Col N="638"/>the Objective One status for the BMW region, we would not be debating the issue today.</P>
      <P>There are now 120,000 more people employed in the BMW region than in 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The employment rate is 19% in Donegal and 40% in parts of Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not all doom and gloom down there. I wish Senators Bannon and Ulick Burke luck with their airport in Abbeyshrule. The BMW also includes my own county of Offaly and also Laois. More than &euro;8 billion has been spent in the BMW region under the national development plan. More than half of this has been spent on capital infrastructure projects. Progress under the national development plan is accelerating and the objective is to continue this momentum until the end of the plan. The Government&rsquo;s commitment to balanced regional development is reflected in the national spatial strategy which will be forming future investment strategy.</P>
      <P>Senator Leyden asked about decentralisation. I assure the Senator&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I thank all Senators for their contributions which were generally very positive. I take note that a gap still exists.

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Before we commence, I remind Senators that a Member may speak only once on Report Stage, except the proposer of an amendment who may reply to the discussion on the amendment. Also on Report Stage each amendment must be seconded.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="639"/>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 3, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;(2) The Minister shall, in the interests of equality, within three months of the enactment of the this Act, cause a Report to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas examining the feasibility of introducing paid parental leave.&rdquo;</P>
      <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Fahey, to the House. I was unhappy with his response on Committee Stage last week. Since then, the debate has broadened as regards work and parents, particularly parents on low incomes regardless of whether they are single parents or families on low incomes. The reason I tabled this amendment is that single parents and families on low incomes will not be able to avail of parental leave because they will be unable to afford to take unpaid leave. I have taken on board the Minister of State&rsquo;s response last week and endeavoured to make my amendment more acceptable to him by framing it to require him to examine the possibility of introducing paid parental leave in the interests of achieving equality for everybody.</P>
      <P>The decision to provide unpaid parental leave, in the knowledge that the option will be open only to those who can afford it, must be considered as part of any study undertaken by the Department of Social and Family Affairs on how single parents and those on low incomes are paid. I ask the Minister of State to accept the amendment, which is fair, and invite him to consider the possibility of introducing paid parental leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment. It is important to try to ensure that parental leave is paid because those parents who most need to be able to deal with problems concerning their children will not be able to take leave under the current provision. Senator Terry raised the important issue of lone parents, which I also raised on Committee Stage. Lone parents depend either on one income or social welfare benefit. Two-income families and families with one parent permanently at home who can deal with problems as they arise are in a better position.</P>
      <P>Since the Committee Stage debate, I have become concerned by the failure to increase the age thresholds for parental leave to sufficient levels. When one considers, for example, that 85 boys in Limerick have again been unable to secure a place in second level education, one realises that these kinds of important issues also crop up with regard to older children. The Minister of State, given his background, and the vast majority of Members are aware that the transition from primary to secondary school is a difficult time for children. In the circumstances I described, it would be preferable for fathers to deal with the schools into which they hope their sons will be accepted. The position is appalling and while I realise the Minister for Education and <Col N="640"/>Science is trying to solve the problem, what does it say to the children in question about the value society places on them?</P>
      <P>Recently, we heard a great deal of ill-informed comment about lone parent families from an electrical engineer and a journalist who relied on research from the United States of America, which has a completely different culture from Ireland. Considerable research, much of it commissioned by the Department of Social and Family Affairs, has been carried out here and is useful in terms of what the Department is trying to do and Senators are trying to support. I refer specifically to the report entitled, Contemporary Family Policy &mdash; A Comparative Review of Ireland, France, Germany, Sweden and the UK, by Mary Daly and Sara Clavero. The report was commissioned and funded by the then Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, under that Department&rsquo;s families research programme, whose staff are acknowledged in the report. The review discusses the value of parental leave and provides support for everything the Government and Opposition are trying to do.</P>
      <P>We need to examine the financial benefits available to parents. After all, they are raising children who will support society in the future. Measured in terms of cash supports to families, Ireland ranks higher than only Greece and Italy among the pre-enlargement European Union countries. That is not an enviable position for a country which boasts that it is the richest country in the EU. Senator Terry&rsquo;s proposal is reasonable in this regard.</P>
      <P>Once again, I urge the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to do more to publicise the excellent and plentiful research which it produces. It might prevent ill-informed comment if this research were afforded more public notice. Research on this issue could be conducted quite briskly with the help of the Department of Finance. This would allow us to see whether the Minister of State would be in a good position to present the feasibility of paid parental leave to the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>The report to which I have referred puts the importance of the availability of parental leave above even that of child care for working parents. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform produces so many reports that it is sure to be able to produce one on this issue, containing the relevant figures, in a short space of time. On the basis of this report, the Minister of State can tell us either that a paid parental leave provision is impossible on grounds of cost or that such an approach is feasible and that he will communicate this finding to the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill will constitute a significant change in that working parents will have a statutory entitlement to parental leave. This is a step in the right direction in that the leave entitlement of 14 weeks represents almost 30% of the working year.</P><Col N="641"/>
      <P>However, we must acknowledge that this will represent something of an imposition on employers and will involve some element of disruption to working practices. For companies operating under a marginal viability, particularly in the private sector, it is important that we do not impose impediments. We are dealing, therefore, with a matter of competing priorities. The costs of a paid parental leave entitlement should not be imposed on employers. In regard to the suggestion that such an entitlement should be covered in the context of the social welfare code, the resources available for supporting families could perhaps be better targeted.</P>
      <P>I understand the point behind the amendment but there must be recognition of the significant change envisaged in the Bill. Over the course of the next few years, it will be interesting to see how its provisions work in practice and the effects they will have on parents and employers. In today&rsquo;s global economy, we hear of companies which have had to discontinue operations because of a lack of competitiveness. We must be mindful of this in everything we do. It is of no benefit to parents if advantages and benefits are provided which ultimately undermine the entire structure of their income. We must consider this issue in a reasoned and measured way and the Bill is successful in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Terry&rsquo;s amendment, the substance of which may serve to give some momentum to the efforts to introduce paid parental leave. If a report as envisaged in the amendment is produced, it should look not only at the costs, but also the benefits. These potential benefits relate not only to financial considerations but should include such issues as improved quality of life. There are cost implications in terms of savings in several areas for a society in which quality of life issues are considered. I hope such an approach might be taken to the compiling of the proposed report.</P>
      <P>Senator Terry has raised the issue of equality but there are broader concerns to address. I am aware of middle-income, dual-salary families in Lucan for which the possibility of taking up the parental leave entitlement would not be possible for either parent because of the financial demands of mortgage repayments and other living costs. I have already raised the issue of the prevailing culture which predicates that fathers are not expected to avail of parental leave. A paid leave entitlement would encourage more fathers and mothers to avail of the facility. The long-term objective should be to secure a statutory provision for both maternity and paternity leave, in addition to the parental leave entitlement as provided in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Jim Walsh in welcoming that these entitlements are being improved. Hopefully, many parents will avail of them. However, Senator Walsh is incorrect in stating that the 14-week leave entitlement represents almost 30% of the working year. These 14 weeks <Col N="642"/>apply over an eight-year period, which equates to less than two weeks&rsquo; leave per year. In this context, the provision is welcome but inadequate.</P>
      <P>The potentially disruptive effect of the provision of an entitlement to paid parental leave on the economy must be considered. However, improvement in this area can beneficial to the economy and similar provisions have been implemented with no adverse effect in other countries with strong economies. Each of us has only one life to live and our primary objective is not to improve the economy but to achieve a good life as part of a good society. The type of measure envisaged in this amendment is in keeping with that objective and the economy is a facilitator in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment would require the Minister, within three months of the enactment of the Bill, to lay a report before both Houses of the Oireachtas in regard to the feasibility of introducing paid parental leave. This is not an appropriate mechanism for dealing with this matter.</P>
      <P>As Senators are aware, the question of paid parental leave was considered during the review of the Parental Leave Act 1998. Many of the elements of a feasibility study were addressed by the review group, taking account of equality considerations, the retention of women in the workplace and the uptake by men. Comprehensive material on a range of factors in regard to paid parental leave was documented by the group in its report, including consideration of such issues as lack of payment affecting the uptake of parental leave, the extent to which leave is taken in broken format, cost to employers, cost to employees and their children, cost to the social insurance fund and the Exchequer, cost to public sector employers, the question of whether employers, the social insurance fund or the Exchequer should bear the cost, the appropriate payment and comparative situations in other EU member states. The report was published in April 2002 and is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The next occasion for further negotiation on this issue will arise towards the end of this year during discussions on the next social partnership agreement to replace Sustaining Progress, which expires in December 2005. At that point, the key stakeholders will have an opportunity to assess the feasibility of introducing paid parental leave. A statutory obligation on the Minister to lay a report before the Oireachtas will add nothing to this process. As I said, a comprehensive report is already available which deals with the issues that the proposed feasibility report would consider. I thank the Senator for her amendment but I cannot accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed in the Minister of State&rsquo;s response. In light of the ongoing debate about the situation of families, working parents and lone parents, this amendment would have <Col N="643"/>provided the Minister with a good opportunity to report to both Houses within three months on this issue. In the broader context, it is an issue about which debate will take place in any case. The rejection of this amendment represents a lost opportunity.</P>
      <P>I reiterate the point made by Senator Tuffy in response to Senator Walsh that the proposed parental leave entitlement is to be taken over eight years. Leave may not be taken for 14 weeks of each of those years, or 30% of the working year as Senator Jim Walsh indicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>The leave can be taken in a block.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>We are talking about a small amount of time in the first eight years of a child&rsquo;s life. In that context, the cost of a paid parental leave provision on an annual basis would be small. While some people may decide to take it in blocks at an early stage in a child&rsquo;s life, the majority will probably try to spread it over the eight years. Along with many organisations with an interest in the area, I am very disappointed in the Minister&rsquo;s line, which represents a lost opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 3, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;(2) The Minister shall, within three months of the enactment of this Act, cause a Report to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas examining the feasibility of increasing the parental leave entitlement from 14 weeks to 25 weeks.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This amendment requests the Minister to consider increasing the parental leave period from 14 weeks to 25 weeks and to lay a report before the Houses of the Oireachtas. In light of what I have said already, parental leave, while extremely welcome to those who can afford to take it, is not adequate considering it covers eight years of a child&rsquo;s life. I am being moderate in my request to have it increased from 14 weeks to 25 weeks and all I am asking is that the Minister lay a report before us to allow us to examine that possibility.</P>
      <P>We continue to put pressure on families by encouraging parents back into the workforce. In recent years families have contributed greatly to today&rsquo;s wonderful economy. However, up to now we did not consider the type of pressure this puts on families. Gone are the days when the man of the house went out to work and the wife stayed at home looking after the children and the house, which gave considerable stability to the working person. That stability no longer exists for the <Col N="644"/>majority of families and we need to introduce structures to try to support them given the pressures they now experience. Asking that parents be allowed to avail of parental leave of up to 25 weeks is not an unfair request. I can imagine I will receive the same response from the Minister of State as I got to the previous amendment and similar to the responses we got last week. As far as I am concerned they are not family friendly policies and do nothing to address the pressures families experience today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment. I refer the Minister of State to pages 88 to 94 in <i>Contemporary Family Policy in Ireland and Europe</i> which clearly shows how parental leave can support the family especially in cases where both parents are working and find it difficult to take unpaid leave. As Senator Tuffy said, while having a splendid economy is one matter, it is more important to consider what it does for everyone and how we can support everyone to keep the economy going. Some 30 years ago, 8% of married women worked outside the home and that figure is now 37%, which represents a huge increase. Many of those women are mothers with children under 18 &mdash; children seem to be young forever, which I say on the basis of having raised some. We should do everything we possibly can to support these families for our benefit, as they are the citizens of the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>In common with the previous amendment, I see no merit in this proposal. A feasibility study on increasing the duration of parental leave would not add to our understanding of the issue. The parental leave review group considered proposals made by ICTU and the Equality Authority to increase the duration of parental leave. These proposals were considered in the context of the following factors: the recent extension of maternity and adoptive leave; the Carers Leave Act 2001; the comparative situation in EU member states; and the implications for possible future paid parental leave. Each of these factors is addressed in the review group&rsquo;s 2002 report, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library. I expect the next round of partnership discussions starting later this year to again focus on parental leave using the material in the review group&rsquo;s report as a basis for discussion and further study or research as necessary. For this reason I am not prepared to accept the amendment.</P>

    <P>Government amendment No. 3:</P>
    <P LI="1" el="5">In page 4, line 3, to delete &ldquo;3&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;6&rdquo;.</P><Col N="645"/>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>As I indicated on Committee Stage, an unintentional anomaly has come to light in section 2. The reference to the upper age limit for adopted children needs to be corrected. The construction used in section 2(2)(<i>b</i>)(ii) unintentionally narrows the parental leave entitlement for the parent of an adopted child. It does this by providing that in respect of a child who is the subject of an adoption order, and who is aged between three and eight years on or before the date the adoption order is made, parental leave must be taken within two years of the adoption order. The following example will explain the anomaly.</P>
      <P>The parent of a child for whom an adoption order is made at the age of four would be required to take leave by the child&rsquo;s sixth birthday as opposed to the eighth birthday for other children. However, the intention was that the parent of an adopted child should be entitled to parental leave until the child reaches eight years of age with additional flexibility giving up to two years to take the leave in the case of an older child for whom an adoption order is made between the ages of six and eight.</P>
      <P>This amendment improves the provisions in section 2(2)(<i>b</i>)(ii) regarding the age limits for an adopted child by providing that where a child is aged six but has not reached eight years of age at the time the adoption order is made the parent may take the parental leave within two years of the making of the order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 6, between lines 4 and 5, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;3.&mdash;The Minister shall, on 31 March 2005 and annually thereafter, publish a statement detailing the reasons why parental leave may not be transferred between parents.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I do not understand why we do not make rules and laws that are flexible and that would make life easier for those who are going to avail of provisions and benefits. This is one example. I do not see how allowing leave to be transferable would cause disruption to the employers and it would be of great benefit to the two people who are responsible for a child. While this Bill is welcome, despite all its flaws, rather than confining leave to one individual, it would be of more benefit to allow leave to be transferable between the two people in charge of the child. I did not understand why this amendment was not acceptable on Committee Stage. I hope the Minister of State will now accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Parental Leave Act 1998 provides an individual and non-transferable entitlement to each parent to 14 weeks unpaid leave from work per child to take care of young chil<Col N="646"/>dren. This is consistent with the provisions of the EU parental leave directive, which gives legal effect to the framework agreement on parental leave agreed by the social partners at EU level. Section 2(2) of the agreement, which is an annexe to the directive, states &ldquo;to promote equal opportunities and equal treatment between men and women, the parties to this agreement consider that the right to parental leave provided for under clause 2.1 should, in principle, be granted on a non-transferable basis&rdquo;. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform sought legal advice on the question of transferring the parental leave entitlement during the review of the Parental Leave Act 1998. It was advised that the leave may not be transferred. In that context, it would be pointless to provide in the Bill that an annual statement on this issue should be issued. Consequently, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment, by leave. withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 6, to delete lines 14 to 26.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I also proposed this amendment on Committee Stage. My colleagues and I believe the rule that states that blocks of parental leave must be ten weeks apart is inflexible and unnecessary. This amendment proposes to delete section 3(<i>b</i>), which enshrines inflexibility in the legislation by providing that a second period of parental leave cannot be taken unless &ldquo;not less than 10 weeks have elapsed since the first period of parental leave ended&rdquo;.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Section 3(<i>b</i>)(1B) states that the employer and the employee may agree to a shorter period than ten weeks. As the Bill stands, the onus is on the employer to agree to that. It does not state that the employee has the right to seek leave after a shorter period. The Bill should enshrine flexibility by placing an onus on the employer to state why he or she cannot provide that flexibility.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said on Committee Stage that he could not accept this amendment because it is contrary to the agreement reached by the parental leave working group. As I said on a previous occasion, we should emphasise that our role as legislators is different to that of employers. My proposal is in the interests of employers and would benefit them. I cannot see any reason this amendment should not be accepted. Other amendments can be argued against on the basis of their cost, but such an argument cannot be made in this instance because this amendment does not involve a cost to the State. It would not cost anything to provide for flexibility. It is somewhat arbitrary to state that ten weeks should elapse between periods of parental leave. There is no logical need for such a provision. This section of the Bill should be deleted and the question of parental leave should be a matter for employers and employees to decide. Employees should have the right to ask for flexibility from <Col N="647"/>employers. The onus should be on employers to state that they cannot provide that flexibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment. Senator Tuffy has made a good point. Why is there a need to provide for a period of ten weeks? As a doctor, I approach issues of this kind by considering the problems faced by a parent who needs time off because of a child&rsquo;s illness. It is pretty hard to say that a child will be sick from a certain date until another date and the employee will be able to return to work thereafter. This amendment will not detract from the Bill. As Senator Tuffy said, the acceptance of the amendment will not cost any money, as far as any of us can see. I hope the Minister of State will accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment proposes to delete section 3(<i>b</i>) of the Bill, which provides for a ten-week interval between periods of parental leave. As I said on Committee Stage, the effect of the amendment would be contrary to the parental leave working group&rsquo;s recommendation that parental leave may be taken in separate periods, each consisting of a minimum of six continuous weeks. The working group&rsquo;s recommendation resulted from a compromise agreement between employers and employees that offers employees greater flexibility when availing of their parental leave entitlement, while also considering the business needs of employers.</P>
      <P>Section 3(<i>b</i>)(1A) implements the working group&rsquo;s recommended interval period between blocks of parental leave. Section 3(<i>b</i>)(1B) allows for a flexible approach to the ten-week interval by allowing employers and employees, or their representatives, to agree to a shorter interval if that suits the employee&rsquo;s circumstances and the employer&rsquo;s business needs.</P>
      <P>The new provision in section 3(<i>a</i>)(ii) gives employees an entitlement to greater flexibility in the way their parental leave may be taken. It may suit some employees to take a period of parental leave of between six and eight weeks during the summer holidays. Section 3(<i>a</i>)(ii) entitles them to do so while retaining the right to take the rest of their leave at a later stage. If that provision were not in place, the employer could insist that the entire 14-week period be taken in one period or not at all. In agreeing to the new entitlement, employers sought an element of control over the length of the interval between periods of leave. The ten-week interval provided for in the Bill was agreed following the usual give and take on both sides. It would be wrong to deviate from it now.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Tuffy and her colleagues for raising this matter again. I am not prepared to accept the amendment, however, because the Bill&rsquo;s existing provisions reflect the intention of the working group in full. It includes a mechanism that gives greater flexibility to employees during the ten-week interval, if that suits employers and employees.</P>

    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 7, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;4.&mdash;The Minister shall by regulations provide that&mdash;</P>
      <P LI="2">(i) an employee shall have a right to request more flexible parental leave arrangements than those provided for under the Parental Leave Acts 1998 and 2005,</P>
      <P LI="2">(ii) the employer is obliged seriously to consider any such request, and</P>
      <P LI="2">(iii) refusal of the employee&rsquo;s request should only be justified by the employer giving particulars of the business case for the refusal.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Like the last amendment, this amendment has been proposed in an attempt to enshrine flexibility in the legislation. It relates to the ability of an employee to seek flexible leave arrangements. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions has sought regulations of the kind mentioned in this amendment. I am sure the Minister of State will reply by talking about the working group, as he did in response to amendment No. 5.</P>
      <P>I wish to discuss the role of Members of the Oireachtas. I appreciate that Senators are elected by a broader electorate. I was elected by members of local authorities throughout the country who, in turn, were elected by the entire electorate. It is obvious that D&aacute;il Deputies are elected by the whole electorate, including employers and employees. Why has the parental leave working group been given the power to make decisions? As legislators, we have to take the working group&rsquo;s recommendations into account, when we should be primarily focusing on the wishes of those who elected us.</P>
      <P>One has to make a judgment when one is confronted by the different interests in society. Members of the Oireachtas, who can claim much more legitimately to represent the overall population, should have the power to make decisions on the contents of legislation. That power should not lie exclusively with the working group, the work of which I respect. I understand the need to consult and take on board the various recommendations which are presented to us. I have no problem with the working group&rsquo;s recommendations being put before us, as the Minister of State has done. It is right and proper that we should take its suggestions into account. I do not think the working group should make decisions for us, however. The Minister of State seems to be saying, in effect, that we have to stick with the decisions made by the working group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment and support Senator Tuffy&rsquo;s comments, although I do not wish to repeat what she said. I complained on Committee Stage that the Minister of State was constantly <Col N="649"/>relying on the working group&rsquo;s recommendations. He and his senior colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, can overrule those recommendations. I do not think the relevant Minister has stuck so rigidly to the recommendations of a working group during a debate on any other Bill I have been involved with in this House. While we have to recognise and appreciate the work done by many working groups, we should acknowledge that Ministers have the power to amend and improve on the recommendations they make. Some of these recommendations would have resulted in better legislation had they been improved along the lines we have suggested or had the Minister taken on board the reasoning of Members on the Government side. What has been suggested in the House today is not only supported by the Opposition, but also by the Government side. The Minister of State should take responsibility for the legislation and improve it where possible without tying his hands behind his back, as he seems to have done by way of sticking to the strict recommendations of the working group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am a little at odds with this amendment and would be very concerned if it was accepted. It would be a recipe for industrial chaos in some locations. One might as well not have a Bill at all and stipulate that people are entitled to parental leave such that there would be a free-for-all without any prescribed conditions. One needs to be prescriptive in this area. The Minister is being prescriptive, just as prescriptions are made regarding annual holidays and bank holidays. It would be ludicrous and an act of madness to allow people to negotiate their holidays on an annual basis and to allow the entitlements in this regard to vary from company to company. It would certainly not help to sustain our economic well-being.</P>
      <P>People are sometimes inclined to believe that because our economy has grown over a number of years and is now doing well, we can throw whatever we like at it and hope the ship stays afloat. This is not the way to go. I agree fully with the prescriptions in the Bill, which is a step in the right direction. I agree with the sentiments expressed to the effect that it should be reviewed after some time to determine how it is working in practice and, if necessary, modified in light of the experience of beneficiaries of parental leave and the imposition it represents on employment. Ultimately, if one does not have employment, one is certainly not giving a service or serving well the parental situation. This was largely the case under the <i>laissez-faire</i> policies of the Government in the 1980s, whereby people had to leave Ireland and find employment abroad. This had an impact on our society for well over a decade. Now that this problem has been corrected, it is important that we maintain an even keel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I note Senator Jim Walsh&rsquo;s point, but the Taoiseach is a socialist and said so him<Col N="650"/>self. If he were here, I am sure he would support us in this matter.</P>

	<P>He is also realistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I am also fairly realistic. Most businesses that are well run will be flexible but those that are not so well run will not be as flexible as one would like them to be. It is well worth taking account of the amendment.</P>
      <P>I have always contended that while this Bill concerns parental leave and looking after children, children are the responsibility of society as a whole and not just their parents. This is because our economy will proposer to the extent that they succeed. Our economy has prospered and we have done incredibly well over the past 30 years because of initiatives such as free education. Should we really make people pay for that? In referring to free education, I include free secondary education. Such initiatives have improved the country as a whole. What we seek is a small measure in that we all have an interest in the welfare of the children of the country, not just their parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>On Senator Jim Walsh&rsquo;s point, I do not see how it is a free-for-all in terms of employees. First, parental leave is not paid and it will be difficult to encourage people to take it in the first place. It is not only for the common good but also for the good of the economy because it encourages people to stay in the workforce. It probably discourages people from taking sick leave inappropriately or going absent from work because they feel they cannot be upfront with their employers regarding their reasons for seeking leave. If one has a flexible employer, one is more likely to work harder and want to remain in one&rsquo;s job. I do not understand why it is not in the interest of the employer to introduce the kind of flexibility I seek and why it is not in the interest of the Government to enshrine it in law.</P>
      <P>We are trying to have it both ways in this legislation. We are saying that there could be flexibility but only if the employer agrees to it. Why not enshrine the provision for flexibility in law from the outset? A protection still exists in that if the employer cannot be flexible and can provide reasons therefor&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator talking about extending flexibility?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I am saying that the onus should be on the employer to say why he cannot provide the flexibility sought by the employee.</P>

    <Title>Regional Transport Policy: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, to the House for statements on regional transport policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for the opportunity to address the House on regional transport policy. It is appropriate that this debate take place today, not because of any media reports concerning me but because of the national launch earlier this month of the regional planning guidelines. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, stated at the launch in Ennis on 4 February 2005 that, for the first time, Ireland now has in place the entire hierarchy of strategic plans envisaged under the Planning and Development Act 2000. These range from the national spatial strategy, to regional planning guidelines and to city, town, county and local area plans. The national spatial strategy and the complementary regional planning guidelines recognise that the various regions have different roles to play in the country&rsquo;s development.</P>
      <P>With the regional planning guidelines in place, the next task is to shift emphasis to the achievement of these guidelines&rsquo; objectives in each region. The economic and social potential of our regions can only be achieved if the various players collaborate more closely on agreeing stra<Col N="652"/>tegies for development. As far as transport is concerned, the individual regional planning guidelines provide a structured framework within which we can plan to meet the transport challenges facing each region. This framework will also help to achieve better integration between transport and land-use planning. Moreover, it will provide a clear context and direction for future investment within each region. In this regard, the Department of Transport established a national spatial strategy cross-cutting team, which contributed to the preparation of the regional planning guidelines for each region. This team will now work on the longer-term investment requirements of the different regions. Hence, my Department will work closely with regional and local authorities and with other Departments and State agencies in seeking to ensure that our transport requirements are met during the implementation of the regional planning guidelines.</P>
      <P>Let me turn to the significant plans for investment which are being prepared by my Department. In his recent Budget Statement, the Minister for Finance agreed in principle that an extended ten-year capital envelope was appropriate for investment in transport. This reflects the long lead-in times required for design and planning as well as the substantial construction periods required for major capital projects in the sector.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, stated in the D&aacute;il yesterday that the ten-year transport investment framework will identify the investment and outline the measures required to <Col N="653"/>develop further all elements of national transport infrastructure. It will address existing bottlenecks, many of which have already been eased. I hope many people have enjoyed the benefits of the work undertaken at places like Monasterevin, Cashel and Monaghan. Ten new projects started in 2004 and a further 16 projects to rectify bottlenecks have begun.</P>
      <P>We are also considering capacity constraints, quality improvements, network use optimisation and prudent advance provision for future economic growth. One statistic that recently struck me indicated that based on projections from the 1996 census, the population of the Dublin area will expand by approximately half a million within the next 20 years. Four fifths of the nationwide increase will occur in the Dublin and mid-east regions.</P>
      <P>The ten-year framework will take account of the recent substantial changes. We have seen large increases in our population, wealth and employment. Economic growth has led to significant increases in the transportation of goods as well as strong growth in car ownership levels, increased travel demand and increases in the numbers of people and goods passing through airports and ports. The ten-year framework will also take account of the linkages between transport, land use and spatial planning so we can develop a transport system that contributes to sustainable development in its economic, social and environmental dimensions. The framework will be informed by and will support the policies set out in the national spatial strategy. It will also take account of the regional planning guidelines to which I have already referred, and will be informed by and support a number of regional land use and transportation strategies for the cities, such as the Dublin Transportation Office&rsquo;s long-term strategy, A Platform for Change, and the Cork area strategic plan. I might say in light of some recent media coverage I received, that A Platform for Change is a very interesting document that should be digested by Senators who might be interested in transport development. The metro-Luas proposal is mentioned in the strategy. Officials from my Department have been engaging with CIE, the Railway Procurement Agency, the National Roads Authority and the DTO and the expertise and inputs of these agencies have been significant in helping to identify broad lines and priorities for programmes to be undertaken under the auspices of the new framework.</P>
      <P>The current five-year envelope for transport investment is over &euro;10 billion for the period 2005 to 2009. The precise financial parameters for the period to 2014 will be subject to final agreement with the Minister for Finance and my Government colleagues. My colleague the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, hopes to present his proposals to the Cabinet sub-committee on infrastructure next month.</P>

	<P>The Minister of State does not jump the gun.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I would never do that but I am ambitious. I would like to think that the electorate believes I am a good, ambitious, young politician who is setting out some positions that should be developed, particularly for a population that is growing, especially in the Dublin region. I welcome the support I have received in this House in that regard.</P>
      <P>Time does not allow me to go into detail on the range of transport investments that are currently being undertaken but there are a few areas I believe I should mention. One of the most significant areas of transport investment is national roads. One need only refer to the fact that Exchequer investment in national roads is at an all-time high of &euro;7.8 billion for the period 1997-2005; and over &euro;1.4 billion in 2005. The investment framework provides for a further investment of &euro;7.7 billion over the period 2006-09. This scale of investment is needed to maintain the pace and momentum of the programme built up over the past few years.</P>
      <P>Excellent progress has been made. Nothing less than a major transformation of the national road network is under way. The beneficial impact of the major increase in investment is evident throughout the country in the elimination of the major traffic bottlenecks leading to shorter journey times, greater time certainty and a safer road network. The high-quality network we are putting in place is contributing significantly to supporting our national competitiveness, job creation and more balanced regional development. The past few months have seen a number of major projects opened to traffic on time and within budget. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government also recently announced the 2005 allocation of almost &euro;500 million for non-national roads. This is continuing evidence of this Government&rsquo;s commitment to upgrading regional and local roads which are the backbone of the rural transport network.</P>
      <P>As regards rail, the strategic rail review provides us with a policy framework to assist in making important decisions for the future of rail. It is the first major report in the history of the State to recommend the rebuilding of the railways. There is now clear evidence of considerable investment being made in rail. Over the past four years, more than &euro;1 billion has been spent on the railways, both on infrastructure and new rolling stock, after decades of underinvestment. We have been playing &ldquo;catch-up&rdquo; and significant investment in the network and in passenger services has occurred. All of the investment has been put into upgrading existing lines and more than half of the expenditure on infrastructure over the past five years has been spent on keeping the network safe.</P>
      <P>This investment will continue with major projects currently being implemented under the National Development Plan 2000 to 2006 and the <Col N="655"/>additional DTO strategy. Newer projects will be funded under a rolling five-year multi-annual framework, resulting in continuous improvements in our rail services. We have reached a situation now where almost all track on the main lines is new and continuously welded. Over 400 miles of tracks have been renewed over the past six years across the regions. A new network-wide signalling system is being installed and work is well advanced on this project.</P>
      <P>Now that substantial progress has been made on renewing the infrastructure, we are turning our attention to upgrading services. A major programme of rolling stock acquisition is being undertaken by Irish Rail. Some 67 carriages are due to start delivery later this year for the Cork line alone. The Minister for Transport recently announced the placing of a contract for 120 regional railcars costing in the region of &euro;460 million, representing a commitment to the railway itself and the development of services to the regions. We are working toward hourly frequencies on the Dublin to Cork line, two-hour frequencies on other intercity lines and service improvements on branch lines as this rolling stock comes on stream.</P>
      <P>Now that the &ldquo;catch-up&rdquo; process is almost complete, I am aware that Irish Rail is looking at improving other regional rail services. In this regard, I wish to refer to one particular and significant project, namely, the Mallow-Cork-Midleton commuter rail system. This is a highly significant example of central government responding positively to strategic planning at local level. In this regard there was an announcement of a &euro;90 million investment in the Mallow-Cork-Midleton commuter rail system. This rail announcement follows through on the Cork area strategic plan, CASP, and shows investment in critical infrastructure being prioritised to encourage new and innovative development patterns. This commuter rail strategy was developed in Cork in line with a land use development strategy. The plan recognises and highlights the need for supporting and complementing land use strategies to these proposed public transport developments. A subsequent feasibility study endorsed the viability of the proposals, as did the strategic rail review. This endorsement was grounded substantially in the fact that the rail development would only proceed on the basis that the CASP land use strategy for the rail corridors would also go ahead. Both Cork City Council and Cork County Council are working closely with my Department. It is hoped the project will be completed by 2007.</P>
      <P>One other rail project has also been given a lot of attention in the recent past. I refer to the western rail corridor. As Senators will be aware, the previous Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, appointed a working group to carry out an examination of the proposal to reopen the western rail corridor. The track on the Limerick-Ennis section has already been largely renewed, but significant infrastructural investment will be <Col N="656"/>needed to bring the rest of the line up to passenger standard.</P>
      <P>Although reinstatement of the corridor was considered in the course of the 2003 strategic rail review, the western rail corridor was not included in the review&rsquo;s recommended investment strategy, primarily because it was not supported by complementary land use and settlement strategies. The strategies are necessary for all major transport projects because without them, there may not be the required level of potential travel demand to justify the required investment.</P>
      <P>The review did, however, identify the western rail corridor as fitting particularly well with the aims of the national spatial strategy, especially as regards balanced regional development. As a result, the Minister identified the need for the proposal to be carefully evaluated and its potential to be examined from all relevant perspectives. In establishing the working group, the Minister was anxious to provide every opportunity for the case to be made for the proposal. When launching the group, Deputy Brennan made the point that new railway proposals can only be justified on sound economic, social and commercial grounds that accord with public expenditure guidelines on capital expenditure and provide value for money. Such proposals must also be underpinned by the relevant planning authorities adopting and implementing appropriate and complementary land use, settlement and local economic strategies. The working group and its five sub-groups have been considering the question of the feasibility of the western rail corridor since June last year and I understand that they may now be nearing the end of their deliberations. I would be happy to give that information to the House as soon as it is available. We will address the group&rsquo;s conclusions in the ten-year transport investment framework, to which I referred earlier.</P>
      <P>Not all our transport solutions are rail-based. Some very good work is taking place to improve public transport through bus priority schemes. As a Dublin-based public representative, I should refer to the success of some of the light rail projects, in particular, the Luas project. Both the green and red lines have been enormously successful. They have assisted in transforming people&rsquo;s mindset on public transport in producing genuine time savings and guaranteed journey times. We are now exploring extensions of the Luas system. I am pleased to indicate that moneys have been allocated for the commencement of a new rail station at Spencer Dock. A significant amount of money has been invested in the DART services in the greater Dublin area. By and large, whether rail, light rail or metro, there is much to look forward to in terms of new services, more capacity, passenger comfort and improved journey times.</P>
      <P>My Department is providing funding for the development of quality bus corridors, green routes and other bus priority measures in a number of regional cities. These include two <Col N="657"/>green routes and a park and ride site, which I was pleased to open in Cork last December, a bus lane on the Dublin Road in Galway, completed last month, and technology to give buses priority at key junctions in Limerick, which will be operational within weeks. A bus priority study is currently under way in Waterford from which specific bus priority proposals will emerge later this year. We have allocated &euro;8 million for bus priority measures in the regional cities this year. I therefore expect further substantial progress in implementing bus priority measures later this year. Work planned this year includes a further three green routes in Cork, the commencement of work on the first bus lane in Limerick and work on giving buses priority at junctions in Galway. Discussions are taking place between the NRA and Galway County Council exploring whether it is possible to enable buses to use the hard shoulder on part of the N17 close to Galway city. I am examining other options to approve the use of hard shoulders for quality bus corridors. I invite Senators to let me know if there are areas where bus services, in particular quality bus corridors, can assist in transport measures. Some of the agencies working with my Department have indicated that journey times on quality bus corridors at peak hours compared to travelling by car can be improved by 72%. We should not lose sight of this fact, nor the fact that money is available to invest in these quality bus corridors which have proved to be extremely successful.</P>
      <P>Before completing my reference to relevant examples of large transport projects, I would like to refer to the somewhat smaller but no less important work being undertaken under the rural transport initiative. There are currently 34 rural community organisations around the country which are being funded under the rural transport initiative to address the particular transport needs of their areas through the provision of local transport services. I am pleased I had the opportunity to launch the rural transport initiative on behalf of my colleague, the then Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, when I was not in the Department, and now learn of the huge benefit the rural transport initiative has been to the regions. It is now operational in virtually all counties, with some 2,500 transport services being provided on approximately 380 new rural routes established under the initiative. More than 40,000 passenger trips per month are being recorded on these services.</P>
      <P>Area Development Management Limited manages the RTI on behalf of the Department and makes specific annual allocations to individual projects from funding provided by the Department. The Department has provided &euro;3 million for the RTI in each of the years 2002, 2003, 2004 and has increased this to &euro;3.45 million for 2005. By the end of 2005, we will have provided in excess of &euro;12 million for this initiative, compared with &euro;4.4 million committed in the national development plan. We have also committed to <Col N="658"/>funding the programme in 2006, to the end of its pilot phase.</P>
      <P>On transport development, the mandate given to my Department in An Agreed Programme for Government is to implement an integrated transport policy which will connect all routes. All of us have identified the work that has been taking place in the regions where bits of roads and services have been improved and new rail services have come on stream. We now need to ensure there is a co-ordinated approach to managing what will effectively be a new transport network and fully integrated services. Therefore, there is much to which to look forward.</P>
      <P>I have also shown how we are building bridges between strategic planning at regional and local level and the realisation of our national investment priorities. More practical supports and investment will be needed in the coming years to give effect to the regional planning guidelines and achieve the Government&rsquo;s key objective of more balanced regional development. In this regard, the Department of Transport has a key role to play in ensuring that an efficient and effective transport system is provided to meet increasing demands and that it contributes to social development in terms of promoting regional balance, social inclusion and sustainable development. While a great amount of development and enhancement work has taken place in Ireland&rsquo;s system and transport networks in recent years, more is needed. There is a real challenge for my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, and me, in working with the implementing agencies to continue the significant investment programme to ensure the right projects are pursued at the right time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State should be congratulated on having world stability on his mind but I am not sure about the Government parties. The Minister, Deputy Cullen, must watch his back because Opposition Members are not the only ones after his job. The Minister of State gave a clear indication today that he is after his job and he wants to bury him sooner rather than later in the area of transport. This was evident in his announcement last night.</P>

	<P>Even as we speak, there is a similar arrangement between the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Cullen. However, less adherence to the old saws and more attention to cohesive policy would benefit the Government and, by extension, the citizens it purports to serve. It is important that this policy looks after the needs of our citizens.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>We had an important debate earlier on the mid-term review of the BMW region. The Minister of State should ask the people of that region how they feel about the proposed annual offer of &euro;1 billion for road construction. I hope he will bring that message to the Cabinet. Much was promised for the BMW region but little was delivered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>Much was delivered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>They have heard it all before. The Minister of State&rsquo;s ten year projection was nothing more than a figment of his imagination and a promise waiting to be broken. We have had evidence of this time and again since the last general election.</P>
      <P>Infrastructure and transport issues are top of the list in rural and urban areas. While proportionately southern and eastern regions have been the winners in funding in these areas, issues such as a second terminal at Dublin Airport, a metro service for the north side of Dublin &mdash; the reasons for the provision of which we are all aware &mdash; and road construction have come to the fore once again due to the Minister of State&rsquo;s pronouncement, but for some local transport is a continual burning issue.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State referred to the rural transport initiative. There is a major shortage of funds for its implementation across the country. The budgets in local authority areas will run out by September to October of this year. That is a <Col N="660"/>fact in respect of which I have evidence in my county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>They have been very successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>That happened last year. The Minister, Deputy Cullen, has only guaranteed funding for this initiative until 2006 after which it will have to stand alone, so to speak. That is not possible as this service caters for many elderly people. This is a great initiative and it should be maintained. The Government should have a lifelong commitment to its provision.</P>
      <P>The Government is blinkered in its approach to this initiative when it only provided funding for it until 2006.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the extent of the period of the pilot phase.</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>Senator Bannon to continue without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State has admitted that this is more than a pilot initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should address his remarks through the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has admitted that this is more than a pilot scheme; it will and should continue to operate. That is the view of the people we serve. I am disappointed the Minister of State is treating this as a pilot initiative. It is extremely successful. Senator Wilson is nodding his head in agreement. It has been successful throughout rural Ireland. Several programmes on national and local airwaves have covered the success of this initiative. Local authority members and Members of the Oireachtas are of the view that this initiative should be continued. We should ensure it is supported and continues to operate.</P>
      <P>Currently 40% of people living in rural Ireland do not have access to even a basic bus or rail service; that is where this initiative comes into play. This is particularly the case in the BMW region. Some 20% of those rarely, or never, have access to a car to go shopping or attend health checks. Only 30% of people living in the country or in towns or villages with populations of under 1,500 have daily morning or evening commuter services. Most affected are the elderly, the ill or disabled, young people and those on low incomes.</P>
      <P>Apart from the lack of transport services, there is a lack of critical infrastructure, spending on which in 2004 fell by 11.5% on 2003 figures. There is also the matter of the appalling condition of some of our roads. This will be brought to the notice of all public representatives when they visit rural parts of the Kildare and Meath constituencies during the next three weeks. It is also a safety issue. Visits from politicians representing urban areas to rural areas will exercise their minds in this regard.</P><Col N="661"/>
      <P>The number of deaths caused countrywide through traffic accidents, according to the National Safety Council, is shamefully high. Road deaths in 2004 reached their highest level since 2001 despite efforts the Government was supposed to be making in deal with this issue. This indicates that we are back to the level of road fatalities we had prior to the introduction of the penalty points system. Deaths can and must be reduced. They have been reduced in every other country in Europe with the exception of Ireland. That shows that the Government is not taking the necessary action. Currently the death ratio in traffic accidents here is twice that of nearest neighbour, Britain.</P>
      <P>Remedial action must not only involve investment in better training, testing and safety procedures; it will require the enforcement of existing law. However, we do not have a traffic police force such as that which exists in other developed countries. This is where we are falling down compared to our counterparts in Europe, America and other parts of the world. Road checks are not frequent enough and there is widespread flouting of the law. We do not have sufficient garda&iacute; to deal with this problem. Where are the 2,000 extra garda&iacute; that were promised in the run up to the last general election?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Recognising that HGVs in particular are potentially hazardous to vulnerable road users, the Irish Road Haulage Association &mdash; I declare an interest in that association as I was nominated by it to contest the Seanad election&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>Were its members not lucky?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>They spoke highly of the Senator when I met them recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>That association, the National Safety Council and the National Council on Ageing and Older People have launched a joint safety campaign to highlight the existence of a danger zone or blind spot around HGVs. Their valid contention is that if a person cannot see the driver of such a vehicle, the driver cannot see the person.</P><Col N="662"/>
      <P>According to the National Safety Council, there was a total of 3,360 fatal, serious and minor injury collisions between 1998 and 2002 involving HGVs and pedestrians. Of these, 10% resulted in fatalities and 20% in serious injury. Older pedestrians are more likely to suffer fatal or serious injury in a collision with a HGV. The three organisations involved are calling on HGV manufacturers to fit special mirrors on all new cabs to eliminate the driver&rsquo;s blind spot. That problem must be examined, even in terms of other vehicles on our roads. Hauliers and fleet managers are also being asked to fit these mirrors, and I am aware hauliers are complying with that request.</P>
      <P>Regarding Dublin&rsquo;s public transport network, the Government has produced five separate blueprints to consider its improvement. While it was compiling those, the number of cars in Dublin reached 720,000 in early 2003, which was the projected number for 2016. As we all know, traffic congestion in the city is costing in the region of &euro;650 million annually. That is a problem about which we have heard many promises. The only Minister for Transport in recent years to move to solve that problem was the Leader of this House, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, when she was Minister. We have only heard promises from the Minister of State; he has not yet delivered.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael has called for a number of measures to rectify our transport problems, including speedy implementation of the full range of penalty points. Out of a total of 69 offences, four have so far been introduced. We have called for a penalty points system to include offences to tackle drug driving, which is currently not tested by garda&iacute;. We have been told by people who have witnessed accidents that many speed-related offences are committed by people on drugs. The Minister of State must get on top of this because more than drink is involved in many late night deaths.</P>
      <P>We also call for the establishment of a new Dublin transport authority and reform of the national speed limits before the introduction of up to 50 new speed cameras. The Government missed an opportunity with the move from miles to kilometres per hour. Local authorities are up in arms because the elected members were not consulted. In County Longford they are reviewing the speed limits today and the introduction of new speed limits will cause an extra burden on the taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>They were asked to do it in January 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>It will cost money to put up the new signs and that is happening in every county. <Col N="663"/>The Government had an opportunity to alert local authorities to this and it did not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>It did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <?oasys [cl10.7]?>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>It did not happen. Elected representatives were not consulted.</P>
      <P>There must be reform of the driving test system and driving instructor techniques. I have received numerous representations from people who have had to wait up to ten months for a driving test, a process that the Minister of State should speed up.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael calls on the Government to produce a White Paper on aviation policy. We spoke this morning about air transport but there is no airport in the midlands, although there is an airfield in Abbeyshrule which offers a golden opportunity to put funding in place and develop it as a regional airport for the midlands. I ask the Minister of State to support me in that request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader of the House will also support me in this regard.</P>
      <P>We must establish an accident investigation unit to investigate the cause of all road accidents. There are reports on accidents but this investigation unit is essential because when we find out the cause of accidents, we can act to eliminate them. There are often blackspots in countryside locations where up to ten people have been killed but no action has been taken to address the problem that caused those accidents.</P>
      <P>We call for the introduction of a dedicated traffic corps and the provision of a fully accessible public transport system as part of a broader package as part of the Disability Bill.</P>
      <P>Our capital city&rsquo;s transport network and our rural infrastructure is failing due to the Government&rsquo;s incompetence and while Ministers squabble and indulge in one-upmanship, the problem is not being resolved; it is getting worse to everyone&rsquo;s detriment. There are problems with the N63, the N55, the N4 and the N3 while the upgrading of the dual carriageway from Kinnegad to Galway has not happened.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State referred to the school bus network. This is in a chaotic state with many of the buses that carry our children to school well over ten years old.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>There are serious problems with the quality of school transport that must be addressed but the Government has not made any provision for it in the past decade. On the day the Kyoto Agreement comes into force the emissions from some of these buses are shameful. The Government should fund the rural transport initiative and ensure it is a lifelong process &mdash; we are all heading for old age and will want those facilities to be in place. We should also support those who currently use it.</P>

    <?oasys [cl11]?>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House to discuss this critically important issue. I am taken aback by Senator Bannon&rsquo;s contribution because it appears nothing in Fine Gael policy has changed. He has outlined proposals for massive spending and any of us who remember the failed policies of the past know that we do not spend beyond our means. He wants new school buses and roads sorted out overnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>This Government has been in power for almost a decade and has done nothing about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>We have a relatively wealthy economy but only recently has that been the case. For many years we suffered from a lack of investment because the money was not available. We have done well in recent years on the back of the Celtic tiger and of good policy decisions by all sides &mdash; the Government is to the fore in that but Fine Gael also had an input. Senator Bannon should recognise, however, that the country was very poor for a long time, with weak infrastructure. Some of the eastern European countries have fantastic infrastructure that predates their current difficulties. We can only spend at the rate at which we are earning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I am talking about the &euro;60 million that was squandered on e-voting that could have been spent on public transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>How does Senator Bannon propose to raise the finance to deliver all he will do in such a short time? Will he increase taxes or make cuts in other areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>We would not squander money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is usually on his feet giving out about proposed cuts so I wonder from where the money will come. Perhaps he has some rare ideas that we might hear in the debate on the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>There were many calls in the House to discuss urban and rural transport initiatives and it was decided to split them between two debates. The debate dealing with Dublin was helpful and set out clear policies on the metro and other areas. I am sure we will see those issues delivered in time.</P>
      <P>Today&rsquo;s debate is a wider examination of Government policy on transport initiatives outside Dublin. People often get caught up in the belief that congestion is only a problem in Dublin and on the east coast. That is not the case. There are bottlenecks in many provincial towns and it is incumbent on the Government to alleviate them. The roll out of the road investment programme as detailed in the national development plan will achieve that end. The Minister has already given details of measures on bypasses and new roads that have been put in place and that are coming on stream all the time. People living in these areas have just as much right as people in Dublin <Col N="665"/>to quality infrastructure and to be able to go about their business in an orderly way.</P>
      <P>We only hear from lobby groups based on the east coast. They tend to bring the debate on transport deficiencies in Dublin to the fore and that tends to grab the attention of the media. The delivery of the metro within a particular timescale becomes hugely important. That imbalance is being addressed by this debate on transport outside Dublin.</P>
      <P>Transport is a vital cog in the wheel of economic development. Transport policy must continue to be an integrated part of a suite of policies in enterprise, tourism and spatial planning. Transportation infrastructure is the cornerstone of many of these policies. It is critical to the principle of balanced regional development, balance between over-congestion on the east coast, particularly around the conurbation of Dublin, Wicklow, Meath and Louth, and the creation of a reasonable infrastructure on the other side of the country that would help to solve the congestion problems by encouraging people to live in their own areas. Decentralisation is an issue for the Government. I hope the Minister will continue in his current vein. I know from the views he has expressed that he will do so.</P>
      <P>The brief is wide and we could talk all day. That is why I will confine myself to a couple of specific points. I am sure my colleague, Senator Wilson, and others will deal with issues with which I cannot deal.</P>
      <P>Government policy on motorways has for some time been about developing the inter-urban routes between Dublin and Limerick, Dublin and Galway and Dublin and Cork. However, it is necessary to look at other economic corridors. The road from Port Laoise to Limerick is part of the inter-urban route from Dublin to Limerick. There is probably not the same need to fast track the section of road from Port Laoise to Limerick because there are no real hold ups on that road now. There is a greater need to look at the economic corridor from Limerick to Galway. Most of that is under way through the completion of the Ennis bypass which will be of motorway or dual carriageway quality from Limerick, bypassing Shannon and Ennis. The onward connection to Galway, which is the next phase after the Ennis bypass, is of critical importance for the future of Shannon Airport. It is also critical for the development of a reasonable quality of life for the people who travel between those two cities and within them; for the encouragement of investment in the region through foreign direct investment; and for job creation. I am aware I am being parochial, given that it is in my constituency, but that economic corridor could be a microcosm of balanced regional development. Measures must be put in place that will generate growth in the region and set it apart, putting it in a position to act as a balance to the east coast. The region has been identified in the spatial strategy. Limerick, Shannon and Galway are gateway towns with Ennis as a hub in the middle. <Col N="666"/>It is an ideal area for a pilot programme for delivering critical road infrastructure.</P>
      <P>There has already been discussion regarding rail infrastructure. Tremendous progress has been made in terms of railways over the past few years particularly given the lack of investment by successive Governments in this area. The Leader was to the fore as Minister for Public Enterprise in securing the significant investment and commitment to investment that made the announcements now being made possible. The rail infrastructure has suffered from neglect and lack of investment for many years. Much work is being done behind the scenes, the benefit of which is not yet evident. The Minister talked about continuous welded track and the upgrading of stations. That has paved the way for investment in the delivery of rolling stock and the recent announcements by the Minister and the Minister of State. It is an exciting new phase for railways in Ireland. We are taking a leap of almost a century in terms of the kind of service that can be delivered. That will have a number of impacts. First, it will generate much greater demand and put pressure on the Department of Transport to invest further to roll out more rail service with greater frequency and uniformity of service.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State touched on the western rail corridor. I am aware that Senator Kitt will want to make some specific points on that issue if he gets an opportunity to speak. I hope the review will come through quickly. It is a great opportunity to put in critical infrastructure for a relatively small amount of money along the western seaboard which has the capacity to deliver on regional development and allow for badly needed growth. It will put in place a foundation on which people can build their homes and lives in that region. I strongly support the people who are proposing the redevelopment of the track and the approach they are taking. The review group is critical; it must taking account of the views of county managers and business interests in the region so that there is proper land usage.</P>
      <P>There are lessons to be learned from what has been delivered through the Ennis bypass and the rail connection between Ennis and Limerick. Given current passenger numbers on that line, when a quality service is in place demand will increase. This should be taken into account in projections on the other section of track. The success of the Ennis to Limerick line proves that if the service is of good quality and is frequent and punctual, passengers will use it.</P>
      <P>The next phase is to look again at the Ennis to Galway line, which is currently a strong commuter link. It also has the capacity to go onwards to Limerick. These are two fairly large cities with quite a bit of economic activity between them. If that can be done it will open up the possibility of connecting Shannon Airport to that line with the connection of the Shannon rail spur at Sixmilebridge. That is critical to the future development of Shannon, particularly as Shannon Airport is trying to position itself as a low-cost airport to <Col N="667"/>cater for increased demand from companies such as Ryanair and EasyJet. The provision of a rail service from the airport is a critical component of service delivery because the people who come on cheap flights for a short stay are not interested in hiring a car. Linking Ennis, Limerick and Galway with the airport is critical in encouraging people to use that service. The Department of Transport has been in contact with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann with a view to having a feasibility study carried out.</P>
      <P>It is important to examine the impact of the State Airports Act. A new board has been appointed at Shannon which is working quite well. Ryanair has announced nine new routes there this year. The Department is examining issues regarding the cost of restructuring and its financing. That must be kept under review, and I would be delighted to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments later. There is concern in the region regarding the impact on Shannon Development of some of the recent announcements. I understand other airlines are looking at this lower cost model and the new offers the board is able to put in place. I am aware that some have come on board and that Aer Lingus is also considering future developments in that area.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the decision to retain a golden share in Aer Lingus. That is critical as the airline is a strategic asset. It is strategically important in protecting tourism and enterprise through the provision of direct access.</P>
      <P>The dual gateway status of the Shannon stopover, as it was known, is of critical importance. There is expectation of changes there. The current policy is a vital component for regional development, not merely a crutch for the airport. It has a critical role in economic development, foreign direct investment, tourism and enterprise development not just in County Clare but throughout the wider region, in Limerick, Kerry, Galway and north of that. Any changes to this policy must be made on sound analysis and on the current facts. It must be based on an analysis of the impact of all the elements I have mentioned.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, a very unhelpful report was produced yesterday by the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland which tends yet again to espouse east coast issues. That report contended that the ending of the dual gateway status would lead to a 10% growth in economic activity. In anybody&rsquo;s estimation, that is wide of the mark. On questioning, one of the authors indicated it would probably be spread over three years. In my view that is well wide of the mark. There was no sound basis for the conclusion. On reading the report it became clear that the proposition is based on data that is five years old. The number of changes that have taken place in the aviation sector in the past five years is phenomenal.</P>
      <P>The whole industry has done an about face, many of the key players are gone out of business and the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland are generating a report by two gentlemen which was <Col N="668"/>supposed to be the most authoritative report on the whole open skies discussion for many years. Yet those two gentlemen are taking information from somebody else&rsquo;s report, based on data that is five years old. That has been hugely unhelpful because it has resulted in headlines today which seem to suggest that if we get rid of the dual gateway status in a short period there will be 10% growth in the economy. That shows a total disregard for the facts and it is an issue that needs to be highlighted because it is misleading, given that many people rarely get the opportunity to read behind the report or the facts associated with it. I hope the Department of Transport will not take into account the spurious conclusions of the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the rural transport initiative which is critically important. Senator Bannon raised some issues about it. As I understand it, the Government has spent approximately &euro;4 million more than was budgeted for in the national development plan. There is a statement also in the programme for Government to the effect that when the programme ends the Government will put in place a new programme to continue to support the rural transport initiative. We all know the benefits and I do not want to get parochial. However, there is a particularly good one in east Clare, the east Clare accessible transport initiative, which has been doing particularly good work. It allows many in isolated rural areas to draw their pension, go to shops, visit friends in hospital and to go to the local village. If society cannot give to those who may not have learned to drive, because of the economic climate in which they grew up, it is incumbent on us to recognise the tremendous work they have put into building this country to its current level. It would be wrong if anybody took from it. I am supportive of the work of the rural transport initiative.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Callely, and his officials to the House and thank him for setting out comprehensively the regional transport policy. I wish to confine my remarks to the issue of rail in the mid-west region. The Minister of State will be aware there is much concern in the region due to the lack of investment and the need to upgrade the rail infrastructure. Senator Dooley said the success of the Limerick-Ennis rail line was due to the upgrading, frequency and punctuality of the service.</P>
      <P>The Limerick-Ballybrophy line goes through Nenagh and Roscrea and is a low grade service. While some of the stock and the line have been upgraded and there has been some investment in recent years, I noted from the Minister&rsquo;s speech, when referring to the western rail corridor, that <Col N="669"/>he said significant infrastructure investment would be needed to bring the rest of the line up to passenger standard. If that does not happen, there is no hope of the Limerick-Ballybrophy link being upgraded.</P>
      <P>For the economy of the region, particularly the north Tipperary-east Limerick area, the railway line is probably the most under utilised resource. A huge amount of public money is being invested in upgrading the road infrastructure in the area and the figures the Minister of State quoted are extraordinary. He said &euro;7.8 billion was invested in national roads between 1997 and 2005 and &euro;1.4 billion in 2005 alone. That is excellent and we are all pleased. Those who travel the N7 are particularly pleased at the opening of the Monasterevin bypass which has made a huge difference. A sum of &euro;500 million has been invested in non-national roads in 2005, all of which is justified. However, in the past four years &euro;1 billion has been invested in rail infrastructure and rolling stock.</P>
      <P>In this regard there was an announcement of a &euro;90 million investment in the Mallow-Cork-Midleton rail system in the context of the Cork area strategic plan and the Minister of State is looking at the western rail corridor. On a simple comparison, rail is the poor relation. I do not say rail should have the same investment as road, but it is clear where rail appears in the order of priority.</P>
      <P>Given that the Kyoto Agreement comes into force today, one way of reducing emissions is to upgrade the rail infrastructure and encourage people to leave the car at home and take public transport. The success of the Luas has shown that is exactly what people are doing. As in the case of the election slogan regarding the DART to Dingle, we cannot have the Luas all over the country, but we can upgrade existing infrastructure. A line such as the Limerick-Ballybrophy line is a classic one. With relatively small investment it could be linked to the national rail grid but there is no sign of that on the Government&rsquo;s agenda. I appeal to the Minister of State to put that issue on the priority list. His colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, is being written to by public representatives in the region with regard to holding a meeting with the rail partnership which comprises the local authorities and other interests in the area to promote the idea of investment in this line. For economic investment alone it is essential to have the line upgraded.</P>
      <P>Senator Dooley mentioned Shannon Airport which is a key part of the infrastructure of the region. The railway line is also a key part of the infrastructure. It is an under-utilised resource. I recall being at a meeting when the then Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, said the Government was committed to keeping it on track. Unfortunately, that is not enough. We are being left behind in the region due to under investment in the railway. I appeal to the Minister of State to have that issue put on the priority list as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, and his officials to the House. I welcome also the opportunity to debate regional transport policy. Those of us from rural areas have continually made the point that there is a mindset that invariably confines the debate to the greater Dublin area.</P>
      <P>From a national and a regional perspective, road transport is by far the most important mode of transport in Ireland and very important in terms of the areas furthest away from urban centres. Many improvements in roads projects have been made in recent years. When I was elected to this House two and a half years ago there were huge bottlenecks on the N8 and N7, particularly in the towns of Monasterevin and Kildare. It is now a pleasure to see the last 50 miles stretch from Port Laoise to Dublin and to bypass the bottlenecks of Monasterevin and Kildare. These bypasses are fine examples of infrastructure.</P>
      <P>Much progress has been made in and around Cork in recent years. I have continually said the Jack Lynch tunnel is one of the finest examples of engineering in this part of Europe. It has reduced journey times and has improved road safety. Watergrasshill is now bypassed and gradually the links from Dublin south and Cork north will meet and eventually there will a motorway from Cork to Dublin. That is welcome in terms of shifting concentration from one centre to another and it makes for easier passage from the capital city to the real capital city. The Ballincollig bypass is an outstanding piece of infrastructure, built albeit under controversial circumstances in terms of those employed to build it.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister of State about a proposal submitted to the Department of Transport by the western committee of Cork County Council in June 2002. I am aware that Deputy Callely has very strong connections with west Cork and possibly knows the terrain there better than most. Cork County Council proposes to upgrade the R586, particularly the stretch between Enniskean and Bandon. It is an impediment to the infrastructural development of west Cork. In this day and age it is unacceptable that the speed limit restrictions on that road include a stretch where the speed limit is 80 km/h which is unrealistic. I am aware the local authority has discretion in this regard but it is worthwhile making the point that a number of newer limits have been introduced on that road. It has proved to be an impediment when it comes to finding replacement jobs for industries which were siphoned out of west Cork such as the Molynlycke facility in Dunmanway. This road has been consistently referred to as one of the reasons investment would not come into the region. This road is an important corridor for the Bantry-Castletownbere section of west Cork. Senator Dooley referred to being parochial but that is what regional transport policy is all about and we are required to raise these issues.</P><Col N="671"/>
      <P>Significant sums of money were spent on the development of the Castletownbere road 15 years ago by the Department and the local authority assisted by European funding. This stretch of road on the eastern side of west Cork is hindering the development of the region. The proposal and costings are being considered by the Department. I am aware that road projects are expensive but this road project is important for the economic viability of that region. I know that Deputy Callely has as good an interest in this as anybody else.</P>
      <P>At one stage the rail network reached into the heart of west Cork. A decision was taken in the early 1960s to close that line. The rail network is underutilised but until such time as there are decent alternatives to people using their cars, the uptake of public transport and rail will be somewhat less than is desirable. The underinvestment in the railways is an issue that needs to be examined. The carriages currently being used on the Kerry line could be called &ldquo;bone-shakers&rdquo;. They have been in use for 25 years. They do not owe the State much money but it is an indication of the underinvestment in that sector. Unless the train service is of a professional standard and delivers a public service that is appealing to the public, there will not be a significant uptake.</P>
      <P>The roads deficit in my constituency and the underinvestment in the rail network are the two points I wish to make. I reiterate my call to the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, to examine that section of the road. Perhaps on the next occasion when we meet on the first Friday in Bantry, we might have an unofficial discussion about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House for this debate on rural transport policy. Sometimes when we speak about transport policy in this House, we seem to think primarily in terms of transport in Dublin. I note that all the speakers are from rural areas, except for the Minister of State and myself. I will not dwell on that aspect too much because it has been given a good airing so far.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State in his contribution referred to the Platform for Change document. He said that this document should be digested. For anyone who cares to read it, I must warn them they will get indigestion. Every figure in the document is wrong and every forecast is way off. I do not blame the authors but they have not kept pace with new forecasting techniques and the manner in which the economy has moved along. The only certainty in the report is that the figures forecast for 2016 are already with us. We are experiencing 2016 levels of traffic around Dublin and around the country. The off-peak hours of a few years ago are now the peak hours but still the 2004 levels of investment apply. The Minister of State believes we have almost achieved catch-up but I think we have many miles more to go. We need to get to the 2016 levels of expenditure now and we cannot wait a further ten years.</P><Col N="672"/>
      <P>I take great exception to some of the advice being given to the Department. It is working on the advice of the DTO but also that received from the NRA. In yesterday&rsquo;s <i>Irish Independent</i>, National Toll Roads stated that putting 7,000 extra trucks on the M50 as a result of the tunnel will lead to massive sprawl on the M50 at a time when it is being upgraded. It is as if the major players are warning that we should not come to them in five years because they told us this five years ago. The NRA stated at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport that the M50 will be at capacity on the day its upgrading is completed.</P>
      <P>The plans for the upgrading of the M50 are quite advanced. As an example of the lack of joined-up thinking, only three weeks ago at the public inquiry dealing with the upgrading of the M50, the consultants to the NRA did not know about the bus depot at Harristown which will be opened next week by the Taoiseach. It will cater for 240 buses and is situated at the Ballymun interchange.</P>
      <P>I contacted the NRA last week and asked what the levels of traffic at the Blanchardstown interchange would be when the M50 is upgraded and the Dublin Port tunnel and the M3 are open in a few years. The answer from the NRA was that it was not its responsibility, that it was upgrading the M50 and that it had not computed those figures.</P>
      <P>I asked if the NRA had taken into account the proposal for a rail link to Dunboyne which is likely to happen. The reply was that this had not been considered by the NRA. I asked if it had taken into account the fact that there might be a carpark for 1,200 cars in Dunboyne to accommodate park and ride. The reply was that this had not been considered. I insisted that I should be told the figures for traffic that would use that junction. I was told that when it is all done, traffic which currently travels at 5 km/h along the Navan Road will travel at 40 km/h. If traffic will be travelling at 40 km/h, the only certainty is that everybody will be driving and will not use the train if the roads are so good. It beggars belief that the NRA can say that the M50 will be at saturation point when the upgrade is finished and at the same time suggest that traffic will be able to travel at 40 km/h.</P>
      <P>When the M50 was first mooted only 25 years ago &mdash; and it is not yet completed &mdash; there was also supposed to be an outer ring route. Some 23 out of 24 councillors in the Fingal area voted in May 1999 to sever that route which was always on the old Dublin County Council map. I was the councillor who was the exception. Erroneous comments have been made that the toll plaza is the point of congestion. The interchanges, rather than the toll plaza, are the problem, as I witnessed this morning. Although traffic was backed up beyond Clonee at Blanchardstown, drivers could fly into town once they cleared the interchange on the M50. In excess of 20,000 cars travel from Blanchardstown to Lucan along the M50 <Col N="673"/>every day, clogging up interchanges on the M3 and M4 and being forced to pay a toll because there is no alternative except to go through Strawberry Beds or take the winding roads of west Dublin.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach&rsquo;s comment two weeks ago that an outer ring road is necessary. The local councils have still not even picked up the telephone to each other to discuss the possible location of an outer ring. In light of the time required to build the M50, I wonder how long it will take to build an outer ring road. We now have freeways running across the M50 from the M1, N3, N4 and N7, bringing traffic rapidly from the regions into town. On the other hand, we are not creating additional space inside the M50. I have no problem with reducing space. However, at the same time as Dublin City Council pursued a strategy which reduced car space and cut car numbers inside the ring by 11%, the National Roads Authority has pressed ahead with creating freeways that bring traffic into the city via interchanges.</P>
      <P>Greater emphasis should be placed on the bus network. While the bus network and fleet have improved dramatically in recent years, quality bus corridors have not been given the priority they deserve. Despite major investment in QBCs, Dublin Bus has had to fight for every metre of white line along certain routes, whereas Luas, a fantastic system, has benefited from a railway order giving it priority, which I welcome. Buses must be given similar priority if we are to benefit from recent investment in the bus network.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand the delay in announcing and proceeding with the Irish Rail five-year plan. It is a no-brainer that the plan is the correct way to proceed. While a metro would be a fantastic system, were it to be built, it would not be of much benefit to those living in Dublin&rsquo;s suburbs, which now stretch to Mullingar, Carlow and Dundalk. These commuters must get into Dublin either by road or rail and it is preferable that they do so by rail. Irish Rail&rsquo;s five-year plan should be implemented without further delay.</P>
      <P>While I understand the Spencer Dock project is proceeding, we can no longer wait for significant investment in the rail network around Dublin. Projects to construct double tracking to Kildare, open the line to Dunboyne and build an additional station in the docklands to relieve congestion at Connolly Station must proceed. We have placed too much emphasis and invested too much time on the metro in recent years to the detriment of the regions. Young couples have been forced further and further out of Dublin into the regions. When we start canvassing in County Meath shortly, we will hear stories of people getting up at 6 a.m. to get through Blanchardstown. This is no longer tolerable. The economy is growing apace due to the policies of the Government. We must ensure, however, that people can get to and from work. I plead with the Minister of State to bring his energy to this task <Col N="674"/>and identify what can be done to upgrade the rail network.</P>
      <P>I was surprised by some of Senator Dooley&rsquo;s comments on the fantastic report produced on behalf of the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland yesterday. The organisation did us a service by launching the Sorensen and Dukes report, around which I believe all future aviation policy will be debated. The report will stand the test of time. The authors took a positive approach and concluded that it is a question of when rather than if dual gateway status will be abolished. The Government must take a positive approach and seize the opportunities arising from it by introducing policy initiatives. Rather than regarding the end of gateway status as a threat, we must ensure our other airports, such as Shannon, Cork and Kerry airports to which the report also alludes, have proper access. In that regard, the Shannon rail link feasibility study should be concluded. I ask the Minister of State to ascertain from Irish Rail what progress has been made in this regard. The report concludes that Shannon Airport will only survive if it has proper road and rail access.</P>
      <P>The report refers to a 10% improvement in the current 4% forecast of economic growth. It does not forecast additional growth of 10%, which would give a figure of 14% growth. This additional growth would provide considerable benefits to the tourism sector, which has significant untapped potential. These are challenges and opportunities we must pursue. We can no longer rely on a protectionist policy in the area of aviation because an EU-US open skies policy will ensure protectionism does not stand in the way of the development of aviation internationally.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt our roads have improved dramatically. As Senator Dooley and others stated, it is a pleasure to travel to Cork since the completion of bypasses at Monasterevin and other bottlenecks. Despite these improvements, we must ensure our railway system receives the required investment.</P>
      <P>Last week I raised the issue of the Dublin Port tunnel on the Adjournment and discussed the advice provided to the Government by the National Roads Authority. The NRA has seriously misled the Government on the port tunnel and this matter will have to be addressed in time. It raised safety concerns to cover up for its mistakes. It is erroneous to suggest that reducing the lane width of the tunnel to 3.5 m would give rise to safety concerns. This width is a European standard. For example, a tunnel between France and Spain, which was built in 1941 or 1942, is being replaced by a new tunnel built to 3.5 m gauge. This is allowed and it is all that is being asked for with regard to Dublin Port tunnel. It is inconceivable that we are digging a 12 m hole in the ground yet cannot find the few centimetres required to accommodate certain vehicles. Many thousands of jobs depend on getting our exports to their destinations. The current approach will result in smaller trucks being accommodated in <Col N="675"/>the tunnel while larger trucks are kept on the city&rsquo;s streets. Dublin City Council will not be able to introduce a ban on the movement of supercube trucks which have been licensed by all Governments over the past 15 years. This should not happen because too many jobs are dependent on it. It is something the Department should consider in regard to the advice it receives from the NRA.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>As part of the construction of the M3, a park and ride facility with capacity for 1,200 vehicles will be developed in Dunboyne. A mile outside Dunboyne, on the Navan side, there will be a toll booth. It displays a lack of joined-up thinking on the part of the NRA to suggest that people will pay a toll coming into town and pay again to avail of park and ride facilities before getting the train. The toll booth should be on the other side so that one pays a heavy toll on passing the carpark. There are cases in which the NRA has not looked at the other transport networks, as they have confirmed to me. I ask the Minister of State to utilise his own advisers in ensuring that the advice received from the NRA on some of these major projects is sound.</P>

It looked this morning as if we might not have this debate as the intention seemed to be to vote the Bill down. That would have been the end of it as the Bill would have been torpedoed. There was some turbulence on the Order of Business but the democratic resolution is that we are here this evening and will have the opportunity to hear views from all sides of the House and from all ranges of opinion.

Even if I do not finish what I have to say this evening, I will have an opportunity to round up further on.</P>
      <P>Change is inevitable. It is almost 20 years to the day since the enactment of the legislation which made contraception available for the first time. For younger people, this is quite an astonishing change. It is also inevitable that legislation such as that represented by this Bill will make its way on to the Statute Book. The only question is the means by which such legislation arrives there. I am joined in this view by eminent persons such as Professor William Binchy, who could not be regarded as a revolutionary figure. He is a careful, legal-minded person and he expressed these views at a conference I attended in the Incorporated Law Society in Blackhall Place.</P>
      <P>Professor Binchy&rsquo;s view attained unanimous agreement among all those eminent legal people from different backgrounds. They agreed that this is coming and that the only question is the manner in which it is delivered. Will we get it through imposition from the European Court of Human Rights or our own courts? How often has the Oireachtas been chided by the courts for its apparent laziness or failure in facing up to social issues? Alternatively, will we accomplish this with dignity by the will of the Parliament of a free people?</P>
      <P>The latter is my preference, especially if it were to be effected by this Bill. This would surely be timely. As I mentioned on the Order of Business, it is now some 50 years since the last legislation passed from this side of the House onto the Statute Book. That was a Bill sponsored by my late colleague, Professor W.B. Stanford, which provided for the humane treatment of pigs in abattoirs. Many would think the time has time for the Seanad to move on and to accept progressive legislation from these benches on the welfare of humans.</P>
      <P>After all, this was the clear intention of the framers of the Constitution with regard to the function of the Seanad. It would also undoubtedly enhance the standing of this House in the eyes of <Col N="677"/>the public to initiate legislation that addresses a real and substantial social issue at the heart of Irish society, instead of being &mdash; as all too often has been the impression &mdash; merely a rubber stamp for Government legislation. From a purely egotistical point of view, I believe this appropriate because when I got involved in the area of homosexual law reform some 30 years ago, homosexual behaviour was a criminal offence. It would bring my career in this area to a satisfying conclusion if my name were on the Bill that finally and definitively removed discrimination.</P>
      <P>However, this is not a narrow item, nor is it confined to gay people. Instead, it addresses the principle of legal recognition of the rights of all couples in committed relationships outside the institution of marriage and their offspring. It is almost two years since I put together a small committee to work on these proposals and I pay tribute to its members. They included Mr. Deagl&aacute;n &Oacute; Caoimh, Ms Hilkka Becker, Mr. Chris Robson, Dr. Mary Lyons and a young student, Mr. Iain Gill. We were joined at a later stage by Professor Ivana Bacik of Trinity College, Dublin. I also wish to acknowledge the help I received from a member of staff in this House whose experience in draftsmanship proved invaluable as he gave advice freely and voluntarily in his own time.</P>
      <P>We began by compiling a list of those specific areas in which people felt there was a significant, disproportionate and unfair advantage exercised by society against those outside the religious or State institution of matrimony. These areas included the right to inherit from a partner, to be included in pension rights and to be recognised as next-of-kin in cases of hospital visitations, for example. We first produced a lengthy and complicated Bill after a period of hard work. We found, however, that it was too bulky, lengthy and complicated.</P>
      <P>Instead, we produced what is now before the House, a Bill which has the virtues of preciseness, simplicity, directness and effectiveness. As I have already indicated, we looked at the principle underlying the Bill. This philosophy was announced clearly in this House by a former Fianna F&aacute;il Minister for Justice, M&aacute;ire Geoghan-Quinn, when she indicated in response to a mean-minded amendment from this side of the House that it would require clear, cogent and factual reasons to cause her to introduce discrimination of any kind against an Irish citizen.</P>
      <P>Moreover, it is clearly understood that this situation affects not only gay people but also heterosexuals outside of marriage. More than one third of births are to unmarried parents and the rights of cohabiting couples and their offspring must be safeguarded. There have been examples of the problems in this regard. Many of us, including the Leader, heard an interview on Joe Duffy&rsquo;s radio show last week with a young, gentle, inoffensive and decent woman who had been in a relationship with the love of her life. Upon his death after a period of years together the family was as sweet as pie until after the funeral when it <Col N="678"/>closed in, in pursuit of the property and money in forms of rent. The family even got a mechanic to hot-wire the couple&rsquo;s car and persuaded the woman to hand over the registration book. The family possessed itself of everything in a squalid manner and this woman had no rights to defend herself against this. No one can suggest this is fair on a human basis. It has nothing to do with sex, it is an issue of fairness and decency.</P>
      <P>In the area of tax, the brave and dignified couple, Katherine Zappone and Ann Louise<?oasys [jy?>Gilligan, have taken a case which is awaiting judgment and which the Minister has mentioned in his amendment. The tax situation has already been addressed in a minor way by this House as a result of material placed before it for consideration relating to the case of an elderly couple. The survivor was being charged because of his caring attitude as a spouse in placing the house in the name of his younger partner who subsequently died, which was not fair. We got support from all sides of the House and Mr. McCreevy honourably altered this provision. However, a piecemeal approach is not satisfactory as there is always the possibility of setbacks, which we had, I am sorry to say, for example, with what were called the &ldquo;savage 16&rdquo; cuts.</P>
      <P>While many of them were reversed, a situation arose as a result of an appeal by a citizen to the Equality Tribunal where it was found that the spouse in a gay relationship had been denied rights of travel afforded to other spouses. Instead of addressing this inequality, which was brought to its attention by a body established by itself, the Government introduced legislation to copperfasten it by redefining the word &ldquo;spouse&rdquo;. That was extraordinary and was a pity. It is the only instance I can recall of discriminatory legislation being introduced by a government within the European Union against gay citizens in the past ten years.</P>
      <P>The Government said it was preparing catch-all legislation. However, when I spoke to the Taoiseach approximately one month ago, it was clear that no such steps had been taken. As a result of my discussions with the Taoiseach he indicated that he would refer the matter to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, which I welcome. While I will make a submission to this committee, along with many other people I made submissions to a committee, which we believed to be more relevant, that was the committee on the family and marriage. However, these submissions were brushed aside.</P>
      <P>Some people have felt a difficulty could exist regarding the constitutional position and have suggested that to grant a degree of recognition through a Bill such as this would be to undermine the institution of marriage and this would be unconstitutional. Our advice is that marriage would not be threatened or undermined as long as we did not purport to give greater rights to the new institution of civil partnership or make it an alternative more attractive than marriage. We did not do this.</P><Col N="679"/>
      <P>The question of the common good was raised at the conference. I have no problem with dealing with this matter and I will supply evidence to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution that indicates that far from being inimical to the common good, supporting people in stable relationships creates a benefit for society in terms of the general increase in well being, in employment, in a drop in suicide statistics and in greater revenue yield &mdash; in other words in every measurable form. A recent article in the business press pointed out that major firms in the United States tend to locate in areas and cities with a vibrant and well-adjusted gay community. It is seen as one indicator of a vital, innovative society. Last year I spoke at the invitation of the managing director of IBM about a programme inside its organisation. The head of the entire network has instituted this programme not out of sentiment but because it is good business practice and it actually helps business.</P>
      <P>I believe this forms part of Daniel O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s wonderful argument when challenged as to whether Catholic emancipation would remove some advantages from the ruling class. He made the point that far from doing that, human rights and dignity were not a finite resource, which were diminished by being handed out to other people, rather they were enhanced and multiplied the more people in the country had such advantages.</P>
      <P>A question was raised about the impact on the Exchequer and whether this measure would cost the State money. According to a detailed report published in <i>The Economist</i>, the reverse appears likely to be true. In other words, a net benefit would accrue to the Exchequer with, for example, a smaller uptake of social welfare benefits. However, supposing there was a cost, I believe it could be justified anyway. It would mean that overpayments by single and gay people received by the State over many years would be redressed. In the past, society benefited disproportionately from taxes raised and distributed in ways that are of no use to a significant part of the population. In their initial phases necessary advances in our society have frequently appeared to cost money. Giving equal pay to women cost money. Would anybody now suggest that we should not have that provision? I shall address several areas tomorrow in my submission to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, including those of adoption and foreign relationships.</P>
      <P>I know people are concerned about adoption. Owing to advances in our society whereby young women no longer go to Magdalene laundries or have their children taken away and sent to America, they now keep their children. Each year fewer than 100 babies are put up for adoption, which is administered by an adoption board. The principle, with which I strongly agree, is that the welfare of the child shall be paramount. However, in some cases one of the partners in a gay relationship is the biological parent. Why should they not adopt?</P><Col N="680"/>
      <P>I must put on the record that civil partnership is not marriage. I believe in the separation of church and State. If the church should not be permitted to direct policy of the State, the same is true in reverse. The State has no right to instruct the church as to the way it should regard its own sacraments. I see no difficulty with this. I applaud and very much welcome the statements of people such as the Most Reverend Diarmuid Martin, Archbishop of Dublin, firstly in his Littleton lecture and subsequently at a press conference, to the effect that addressing the social issues and correcting injustice is not incompatible with the teaching of the church.</P>
      <P>I will also place before the All-Party Committee on the Constitution evidence showing that Ireland is now lagging well behind other countries in Europe in this area. This is not a dramatic or revolutionary proposal; it is a tentative attempt at change. I am very grateful to the Minister for being flexible, to the Leader of the House for being so accommodating and to my colleagues who made suggestions that were helpful. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say and to continuing this debate, which will be adjourned this evening.</P>

	<P>I wish to share time with Senator Ross.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to acknowledge the extraordinary work Senator Norris has put into preparing this critical Bill. While I recognise that we will hear different views on the Bill, which is also important, I hope the Minister will just take it and run so that he can develop it, change it or introduce an alternative in its place, which I believe has been the intention of Senator Norris from the beginning and which is as it should be. We should see this as a progressive and innovative start.</P>
      <P>This Bill does not constitute gay marriage or any innovative or new kind of marriage. This Bill is what it claims to be and we get what it says on the tin, namely, civil registration. It represents a necessary response to the extraordinarily varied relationships which exist and develop in modern society. It is a reflection and recognition of what is. It is an acknowledgement of a need that society at all levels has recognised. This matter has been mentioned by the Judiciary and the churches, and has obviously been discussed by politicians in various democracies around the world. It is a reality which needs to be addressed. Tonight we are taking a first important step in this regard.</P>
      <P>As well as being a response to the varied relationships that exist and develop in modern Irish society, its need has been created by an increasingly litigious and greedy society. While in previous generations people recognised, perhaps in a non-vocal way, the importance of relation<Col N="681"/>ships and of people living in a house in which they had spent 30, 40 or 50 years, we now find that survivors tend to grab what is left and break it up with no recognition of the importance of a surviving partner of a relationship other than a &ldquo;normal marriage&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The issues that need to be addressed are wide and varied. Many of us in the trade union movement have looked at the difficulties created by an inability to deal with pension rights in simple cases. If one partner from a married couple, which broke up after a certain number of years, got involved in another relationship and died after, let us say, 30 years, the surviving person in that subsequent relationship has no access to the pension to which he or she should have access in any normal or fair circumstances. What we are doing here is a reflection of the need for equity and fair play. We are trying to ensure that the public can enjoy fair access to property, pensions and adoption and that the laws in such areas are just. We should not bring to this discussion the emotive baggage that has destroyed the debate on gay marriage in the United States. While I should state that I support gay marriage, I stress that it is not under discussion this evening. It is easy for those who have worries in that regard to accept this Bill.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris has done democracy and the Seanad a favour by proposing this Bill. This House was among the first fora to discuss AIDS, for example. Senator Norris has brought us a step forward by initiating this debate. I ask the House to recognise the importance of this debate and to pursue the matter in a consensual way, if possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator O&rsquo;Toole for sharing time with me. I do not share the extraordinarily conciliatory and moderate attitude of everybody on this side of the House. I support the Civil Partnership Bill 2004 but I do not understand what all the fuss is about because it is a moderate, liberal and sensible Bill. It has been introduced to recognise reality. I do not doubt that the Minister will be able to correct one or two technical problems in the legislation on Committee Stage. The Bill recognises the reality of relationships as they exist in Ireland today. The Irish people have voted with their feet. As Senator Norris said, one third of births are to people involved in extra-marital relationships. It would be ridiculous not to recognise in law as equal the substantial number of such relationships.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why this Bill did not almost pass on the nod. I do not understand why this moderate and sensible Bill has caused so much trouble in one of the Government parties. The legislation is a bit of good housekeeping. Perhaps some difficulties are being created because the Bill is being promoted by certain people on the Independent benches who have been identified with the liberal agenda. I would have thought it would have been far more sensible for the Government to decide to accept this sensible legislation.</P><Col N="682"/>
      <P>As Senator Norris has said, the Bill before the House is not about gay marriage. It recognises the realities of the present day and proposes to remove simple forms of discrimination which have arisen from the changes in Irish society. It relates to inheritance and pensions issues. It is an attempt to resolve the inequities which exist because things have changed in this country, thank God. It would be sensible for the Government to accept the Bill but I appreciate that that has not been possible.</P>
      <P>This Bill does not need to be referred to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. There is no need for it to go any further than this House or to be sent elsewhere for further consideration. There is a danger that the legislation will be buried because it is considered that it contains political difficulties. Anybody who reads the Bill will find such difficulties do not exist. Why does it need to be referred to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution? If it really needs to be considered by that committee &mdash; if there is a constitutional problem with it &mdash; the Bill should not have been introduced here in the first place. The legislation does not need to go to any other committee. It could easily be passed by the Seanad and the D&aacute;il without much controversy. If there is any controversy, it has been created by the Government rather than by Senator Norris.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should rethink the decision to refer the Bill to the all-party committee. Bills are traditionally sent to the committee as a delaying mechanism. Everybody knows that the 1967 recommendations of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution were buried. The committee was used at that time as a hole for controversial and sensitive matters. I have a feeling that such a destiny is intended for this Bill, although I hope I am not right.</P>
      <P>Like Senator O&rsquo;Toole, I pay tribute to Senator Norris. The courageous introduction of this Bill is the pinnacle of his great career of liberal crusading in this House. Even if Senators do not agree with the Bill, the House should pay tribute to Senator Norris&rsquo;s great independence, clarity and courage in pioneering Bills of this nature, which are not necessarily popular because they are sometimes misinterpreted by others. I pay tribute to the Senator, who is asking us to show those for whom he is pleading in this Bill the same humanity he shows to others. I have heard him say that heterosexuality is a disease that should be tolerated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Such tolerance should be extended to the Senator in this context. I commend and applaud him on introducing this Bill. I hope it will receive a speedy passage through committee, rather than being delayed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett"><NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P><Col N="683"/>
      <P LI="1">To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;Seanad &Eacute;ireann declines to give a second reading to the Bill so as to permit further consideration of important legal and constitutional issues and in particular</P>
      <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) the resolution of current litigation regarding the recognition of a foreign same sex marriage;</P>
      <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) finalisation by the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution of its examination of Articles 40.3, 41 and 42, relating to the family;</P>
      <P LI="2">(<i>c</i>) publication of the Report of the Law Reform Commission on the Rights and Duties of Cohabitees.&rdquo;</P>
      <P FLI="0">I compliment Senator Norris on introducing this Bill. It is fair to say that he has been one of the most ardent supporters of the marginalised in this House over the years. I do not refer only to those he represents tonight but also to those with disabilities. The latter issue is very dear to my heart. Such people are extremely lucky to have Senator Norris on their side. While I do not agree with the Senator this evening, I commend him on his efforts.</P>
      <P>The family based on marriage has been the overwhelming norm in this country since the foundation of the State. That typical domestic situation has changed as social trends have developed. I do not doubt that the concept of marriage is under stress. Marriage breakdown is increasing. Poverty among children who are being raised by a sole parent is part and parcel of modern society. We know that children are being raised in one-parent families. Social ills have resulted from that and the poverty associated with it. All Senators encounter examples of that on a daily basis. I do not suggest that children from one-parent families are solely responsible for such ills but the phenomenon to which I refer is certainly a contributory factor.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris spoke of the difficulties experienced at a human level by couples whose relationships do not conform with the norm, as outlined in the Constitution. The Senator spoke of the problems that would be experienced by a couple living together if one of them were to get sick and have to go to hospital. If the patient&rsquo;s partner went to the nurses&rsquo; desk to inquire about the partner&rsquo;s condition, which may be serious, they might be told they do not have the right to be given such information because they are not a next-of-kin. Such a situation would be difficult, frustrating and dreadful. We should examine such difficulties in one context or another.</P>
      <P>Section 6 of the Bill is its core. It proposes that &ldquo;parties to a civil partnership shall be regarded in law as having the same rights and entitlements as parties to a marriage valid in law under the Family Law Act 1995 and Civil Registration Act 2004&rdquo;. The Senator proposes that &ldquo;a civil partner<Col N="684"/>ship&rdquo; should be defined as &ldquo;a conjugal relationship&rdquo;. In other words, those who are involved in a civil partnership will be considered to be those who are engaged in a sexual relationship. It is particularly important to emphasise that so that one does not think the Bill will benefit other people living together, such as siblings or other members of families, who are not involved in a sexual relationship with each other. The Bill will not alter the social welfare or taxation rights of such people, whose circumstances need to be examined in a Bill of this nature.</P>
      <P>On a superficial reading, the Bill appears to correct what some people perceive to be a form of social inequity. That aspect of the issue needs to be the subject of a great deal more consideration before we can form a judgment on it that we are happy to stand over. As outlined in the amendment to the motion on the Second Reading of the Bill, the All-Party Committee on the Constitution is examining Articles 40.3, 41 and 42 of the Constitution, which refer to the family. The committee sought many contributions and there have been many submissions. Questions posed at the committee concerned whether gay couples should be allowed to marry, how the family should be defined, whether it is possible to give constitutional protection to families other than those based on marriage, and the rights that should be protected in respect of the natural father, the natural mother and the child. The committee is the appropriate forum in which to tease out all these issues because it allows for the consideration not only of the opinions of Members of the Oireachtas but also those of the public. It will provide the basis on which we will make our ultimate judgment call. The more experts with whom we engage and the more we involve the public, the better that judgment call will be. Therefore, it would be unwise for us to proceed with the Bill.</P>
      <P>The amendment alludes to the case of Zappone and Gilligan, which is currently before the courts. The outcome of that case will enlighten us and we would be unwise to form an opinion until all the facts are known.</P>
      <P>The Bill probably poses a direct challenge to the definition of the family contained in Article 41.3.1&deg; of the Constitution which provides that &ldquo;The State pledges itself to guard with special care the institution of Marriage, on which the Family is founded, and to protect it against attack&rdquo;. I believe Senator Norris&rsquo;s Bill may be in contravention of the Constitution but I am sure the Minister will tell us, more than adequately, whether this is the case.</P>
      <P>A body of law in this area makes it clear that superior rights cannot be guaranteed to those in liaisons that do not fulfil the criteria under the Family Law Act 1995. If we disregard this, we are disregarding the fundamental principles of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of information, which may be helpful, the Law Reform Commission has <Col N="685"/>addressed these points and has come down positively on the side of the legislation. I will be citing its statement to the committee tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett"><NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill could represent a contravention of the fundamental requirements of the Constitution. It proposes to treat as equal all conjugal relationships involving cohabiting partners. Under Article 41, they are not equal. Additionally, while seeking to vindicate the rights of cohabiting couples, it ignores the duties that come with their relationships, including the duties of care to children and the rights of children in those circumstances.</P>
      <P>The Bill is quite general in respect of the Family Law Act 1995 and the Civil Registration Act 2004. Questions in this area are difficult to address because, while the Constitution clearly recognises the family as the natural and primary fundamental unit of society, the rights of married couples are complex. These rights are not just covered by the Constitution but also by common law and statute law.</P>
      <P>I recognise and respect Senator Norris&rsquo;s passion for this Bill. I hope that when we finally set our sights on coming to terms with all the fundamentals of the Bill, as I hope we do, we can meet somewhere in the middle such that the Senator and the Government will be happy and the Constitution will be intact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for attending this debate. I thank Senator Norris for presenting this Bill and compliment him on having been to the fore regarding this issue throughout his public life. He has worked tirelessly on it and all of us, both gay and straight, owe him a great debt of gratitude for trying to ensure that we hold all citizens as equal before the law.</P>
      <P>I understand that this Bill was the result of a cross-party effort, with Reid Professor Ivana Bacik doing much of the work, together with representatives of the ICCL and GLEN. I thank all these individuals. Last week Marie Mulholland and Chris Robson visited Leinster House and their contribution should not be forgotten in this debate. It is worth putting on record that many concerned and active citizens have been directly involved in the legislative process, not just professional politicians like ourselves.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach said, &ldquo;These people who are in relationships which are not illegal, they&rsquo;re not immoral, they&rsquo;re not improper .... They say: &lsquo;We want more equality and we want to be treated fairer&rsquo;.&rdquo; I agree with that view. Let me refer to the words uttered recently the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell. He stated the D&aacute;il should pass legal reforms that formally recognise people who have entered into a civil partnership with each other regardless of their sexuality, and allow the surviving half of such partnerships to acquire next-of-kin status.</P>
      <P>It is an absolute disgrace that the Government attempted to kill this Bill. I am thankful that cir<Col N="686"/>cumstances have improved since this morning but believe the Government proposed to abuse its position and the institutions of the Oireachtas by using the All-Party Committee on the Constitution as a comfort blanket. I do not know if the Government&rsquo;s opposition to this Bill is borne out of indecisiveness or homophobia but it has let the House down in the way it has dealt with it today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>That is outrageous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>My party did not make a submission to the committee on this issue because it feared that what has transpired today would come to pass. The Government has deliberately blurred the lines of debate on this issue and claimed that civil partnership is an issue pertaining to Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann. That is not the case. Legislation, if framed correctly and amended as necessary, should be such that the question of civil partnership would not impinge on the Constitution. While the Bill will not progress to Committee Stage at this time, I hope sincerely that it will do so soon.</P>
      <P>For far too long, citizens of this State who have had all the responsibilities of citizenship placed on them, have been denied full rights. Despite what some would say about the institution of marriage being denigrated and coming under attack, it is a simple fact that every measure in this State&rsquo;s family law revolves around marriage, including the issues of tax, social welfare, pensions and ownership. Many rights and entitlements depend on the presence of a marriage certificate in order to be granted in full. This excludes huge numbers of people who are not allowed to marry by virtue of their sexuality or who choose not to marry because of their life choices, which can be shaped by everything from personal circumstances to religious beliefs.</P>
      <P>I will not go into further detail on the Bill because Senator Norris has done so and will be doing so again tomorrow. My party and most, if not all, other parties would agree with the broad thrust of the Bill. However, there are two points I would like to make on specific sections, the first of which concerns the dissolution of partnerships. In this regard, section 7(4) states: &ldquo;The prescribed period for the purpose of subsection (2) [of section 7] is six weeks from the making of the conditional order&rdquo;. I understand the reason for this six-week rule was the fact that the Bill is based on contract law and that such a period is the norm in those terms. I am disappointed by this. What hope have we of achieving equality if these relationships can be disposed of within six weeks, albeit on the same terms as a marriage, when a married couple must wait four years? It runs contrary to the call for greater equality to award the rights but not responsibilities of marriage. While the four year stipulation for divorce was inserted into the Constitution to convince a wary electorate in the divorce referendum, it will do the cause of equality no good to introduce a <Col N="687"/>type of &ldquo;divorce lite&rdquo; into the civil partnership debate.</P>
      <P>Last July, Fine Gael became the first major political party in the State to produce a comprehensive civil partnership policy document. We believe it is necessary to ensure that it would be difficult to dissolve such a partnership in order to preserve its integrity. Should the Bill reach Committee Stage, Fine Gael will propose an amendment along these lines.</P>
      <P>Section 6 is the critical section on adoption. It states:</P>
      <P LI="1">The parties to a civil partnership shall be regarded in law as having the same rights and entitlements as parties to a marriage valid in law under the Family Law Act 1995 and the Civil Registration Act 2004.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The reasoning behind this section is clear. Due, however, to the somewhat pioneering nature of this legislation, any consideration of whether this section consists of an &ldquo;attack on marriage&rdquo; as prohibited by the Constitution is shrouded in doubt. Constitutional interpretation of the Bill is an art and not a science. The legal advice Fine Gael received, notwithstanding the thoughts of the Law Reform Commission on this issue, was that to grant adoption rights to the parties of a civil partnership would run foul of Article 41.3. 1&deg;.</P>
      <P>As a public representative, committed to the passing of legislation in this area, the last thing I and my party want is to plunge this country into a divisive referendum. This would either confirm the <i>status quo</i> or prompt organisations such as Youth Defence and their supporters to scream about &ldquo;gay adoption&rdquo; and allow a moral panic to envelop this worthy debate.</P>
      <P>It is important that the fight for equality is not hijacked to the detriment of the entire agenda. The House is in tune with public opinion in discussing, and I hope awarding, partnership rights but it has some way to go before rights of adoption are widened.</P>
      <P>Parenthood is an issue for gays and lesbians. Throughout the country, gay men and women are raising children. These children may come from previous, heterosexual relationships. These people may be guardians and gay couples are allowed to foster children &mdash; the sky has not fallen in as a result. The right to adopt children necessitates a proper public debate first but the debate is in its infancy. Besides, adoption is a remote possibility given the numbers of children put up for adoption each year in this country. I appeal to the opponents of the Bill and of any move in this area to temper their language when speaking on this aspect of gay rights, even if they cannot do so on other aspects of the Bill.</P>
      <P>When my party published its document on civil partnership it received a handful of telephone calls in protest. Most people supported the partnership policy, as did the media, with the exception of one journalist. I urge people to acknowl<Col N="688"/>edge the work Senator Norris has done and the serious attitude he is adopting on this topic. Then we will treat the issue sensibly and with speed. For too long people have lived on the margins and we must address those issues. I hope we will do so soon and I look forward to a Committee Stage debate at an early date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I pay tribute to Senator Norris for the work he has done in the past, and continues to do in this Bill, on the rights of cohabiting couples. This Bill, and the debate last May on the rights of non-marital and one-parent families, are valuable contributions to the development of policy in this important area.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with Senator Ross&rsquo;s point that this is a simple matter and should be waved through. That is superficial and glib. Senator Terry&rsquo;s scriptwriter betrayed her by introducing a shallow and somewhat unfair note accusing people on this side of the House of being homophobic, hesitant and indecisive in the matter. We must be careful on this subject. Knowing Senator Terry as I do, I realise that her scriptwriter&rsquo;s vindictiveness is at fault not her own view in making a charge of homophobia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>The views I expressed are mine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I regret that the Senator should charge anybody in this House with homophobia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not charge anyone, I questioned motives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I could say the same about Senator Terry and question her on the same point but it would be equally unjustified.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge on behalf of the Government that the position before the law of same sex couples, and others in caring relationships, including extending State recognition to civil partnerships between such persons, needs to be addressed. We cannot walk away from, ignore or postpone this issue.</P>
      <P>Society has changed greatly over recent decades and the law must be kept up to date with the needs of society while at the same time preserving all that is of value in what we have, and respecting the Constitution by which we all are bound. Anybody who sees a constitutional dimension in this issue should participate in the All-party Committee on the Constitution and not pretend that this issue can be dealt with on a non-constitutional level.</P>
      <P>Senator Kett rightly identified two aspects of this Bill which cause difficulty. I agree with Senator Terry in that the analysis available to the Government is that section 6 is contrary to the Constitution and would be struck down by the courts. I acknowledge that, as Senator Norris says, the Law Reform Commission takes a different view but the advisers to Senator Terry and to <Col N="689"/>the Government take the view that on a detailed analysis the proposal in this section is contrary to the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Senator Kett&rsquo;s second point, with which I agree, is that this proposed legislation is restricted to &ldquo;conjugal relations&rdquo;. Therefore, two friends, or sisters, or any two people who have spent their lives together caring for one another and sharing their home are excluded by the language in section 3.</P>
      <P>In the context of sexuality are two people who have a non-sexual relationship to be substantially discriminated against because theirs is a non-sexual relationship? If not, the definition of a civil partnership in section 3, which makes a sexual conjugal relationship a necessary precondition for a civil partnership, is discriminatory. We must consider this carefully. These are two points of principle and not of conservatism. They have a significant import. Are we creating a new set of relationships based on a sexual underpinning or are we willing to accord civil partnership status to people who have no sexual relationship?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Sexual and conjugal are not coterminous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know what the term &ldquo;conjugal&rdquo; means in that context if it is not designed to mean something akin to sexual in nature. I do not think two elderly bachelors living in a farmhouse in County Kerry would regard their relationship as conjugal, even if they were fully committed to looking after each other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>If they were in Kerry they certainly would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>God forbid that they would split up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>In these two sections, which are not simply details but central issues in the Bill, there are major constitutional, philosophical and discriminatory issues to be addressed.</P>
      <P>Irish law already takes into account in a number of ways non-marital relationships. As referred to earlier, capital acquisitions tax has been changed. The Guardianship of Infants Act, as amended, provides for the appointment of unmarried fathers as guardians of their children in certain circumstances. The Domestic Violence Act 1996 also covers non-marital relationships.</P>
      <P>The needs of cohabiting couples, many of whom want to share property, home life, income, and perhaps deferred income in the form of pensions, and those who want to care for each other and be cared for in that context in a next-of-kin hospital situation and so on, require legal protection and are imminently suitable for legal reform. As a society, we must give thorough consideration to what course we can and should follow in this very sensitive area. We must decide what we are trying to achieve. For example, do we want to focus on particular rights of importance to <Col N="690"/>cohabiting couples, which should be given the protection of law or do we want to give cohabiting couples a status equivalent to marriage, as proposed in section 6 of the Bill? Extending some State recognition to partnerships between persons who decide to create a relationship of mutual dependence, care and love between themselves, whether the relationship is heterosexual, homosexual or non-sexual, is qualitatively different from the alternative course, which is providing a status equivalent to, and attracting the same rights and entitlements as conventional marriage which is up to now a status based on a male-female monogamous relationship for the duration of the life of the marriage.</P>
      <P>Heterosexual couples currently have the option of marriage open to them. We must ask ourselves what it is about marriage that is causing many heterosexual couples to say &ldquo;No thanks&rdquo;. Why will they not avail of all these extra rights in terms of pension, property, tax and social welfare? What is holding these people back from saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; in this regard? While I am not in a position to offer a comprehensive answer to that question now, it must be addressed. It might raise the question that there are obligations going with marriage, which they are reluctant to undertake. Senator Terry put her finger on the point when she criticised the Bill &mdash; even though it is a criticism I would not share in regard to civil partnerships &mdash; on the basis that the dissolution provisions are a good deal more lenient than those which currently apply to marriage. If a civil partnership, which has all the attendant rights of marriage, has a let out of six weeks or whatever while marriage under the Constitution cannot be dissolved except under the four year provision, if one is talking about heterosexual cohabitants, one must ask whether it is marriage life that is on offer here, identical in terms of all the rights but different in terms of the fundamental obligations and duties. This is a question which will not go away. I am making that point because we must be honest with each other. I note that section 6 does not mention duties except, by inference, mutual duties. If one is suggesting a relationship which has all the entitlements and rights, but none of the obligations, except in so far as they are bound up in mutual rights, then one is clearly in danger of infringing the constitutional provisions for the protection of marriage. This is giving everyone all the advantages of marriage while discouraging them from undertaking any of the onerous responsibilities.</P>
      <P>Heterosexual couples have the option of marriage open to them. If we are to offer them something with all the rights and entitlements of a valid marriage, it should also have the same duties attaching to it. I am one of the few politicians who is prepared to say that in this rights culture in which we live, no right is worth a damn without a co-relative duty. That was taught to me by a former Member of this and the other House, the late John Maurice Kelly, in jurisprudence classes in UCD. Rights without duties are mean<Col N="691"/>ingless. They are the stuff of which Soviet constitutions are made but they are nothing unless there are attendant duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>Even the Jesuits and Dominicans can agree on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Someone must accord the corresponding duty to every right. The point I am making in regard to this issue is that marriage as envisaged by the Constitution is not simply a basket of rights. It is in explicit terms stated to be a relationship which carries with it profound duties.</P>
      <P>Section 6, in effect, would mean marriage, albeit by another name. It is doubtful whether there are any advantages to providing in law for an institution for heterosexual couples which mirrors marriage to that extent. I agree that the situation is different for homosexual couples, for whom marriage is prohibited at the moment. I want to take this opportunity to put it on the record of this House that the Government is unequivocally in favour of treating gay people as fully equal citizens in our society. That is why the Government parties, and all parties in the House, concurred on the decriminalisation of homosexuality. We passed other equality legislation on sexual orientation to ensure that people cannot be discriminated against on the basis of their sexuality.</P>
      <P>Many same-sex couples may not want an institution which gives them all the rights, entitlements and duties of marriage. They may want a form of civil partnership which protects certain rights of importance to them. People may not want to enter into a life-long relationship but something short of that. It is worthwhile remembering that there are people who simply have a platonic relationship, to which there is no sexual dimension, who may want their home, pension, tax, welfare, inheritance rights, rights of next-of-kin in regard to each other in the case of illness and the like, capable of some form of recognition.</P>
      <P>In November 2004, the Taoiseach, in response to a question concerning gay marriage, emphasised the importance of dealing with the situation of same-sex couples and of rational debate on the issue. He said that we should not get the question of marriage mixed up with the many inequalities and unfairness &mdash; he used the phrase &ldquo;we are making their situation fairer&rdquo;&mdash; such people face. He advocated trying to deal with these issues on the basis of what people have to surmount in their daily lives.</P>
      <P>Dr. Diarmuid Martin, the Catholic Archbishop of Dublin, to whom Senator Norris paid tribute, stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">I recognise that there are many different kinds of caring relationship and these often create dependencies for those involved. The State may feel, in justice, that the rights of people in these relationships need to be protected.</P><Col N="692"/>
      <P FLI="0">There is no huge difference between us philosophically on this issue.</P>
      <P>We need also to consider the position of people whose relationship has no sexual element and who may need legal protection and recognition for what is <i>de facto</i> a relationship based on a community of property or income, which flows from a caring relationship between them. All of these needs must be considered. The Government believes that if significant social change is to take place, and it is taking place &mdash; the Government does not like King Canute stop social change &mdash; it must have a fairly broad measure of support across society.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I compliment Senator Norris on including heterosexual couples as well as homosexual couples in the scope of this Bill because it makes sense from the perspective of fairness and equality to expand the debate to include others in caring relationships. I go one stage further and say we should also deal with non-sexual people in a relationship of caring and dependency.</P>
      <P>A major problem arises in section 6. I made the point that Article 41.3.1&deg; of the Constitution provides that the State pledges itself to guard with special care the institution of marriage, on which the family is founded, and to protect it against attack. The advices available to me are that this article precludes the State from doing what section 6 purports to do, namely, equating the institution of marriage with other forms of relationship or partnership which do not carry the attendant obligations.</P>
      <P>There are also problems of a legal and technical nature, of which the following are examples. The Bill does not contain an explicit list of rights and entitlements. Any Bill creating a new civil partnership institution would have to include a list of those rights and entitlements. The rights of parties to a valid marriage are complex and are not contained or to be found in any single instrument. They derive from the Constitution at one level, from statute law and from common law as interpreted by the courts. The question is precisely what is meant by the reference to the Family Law Act of 1995. This question is fundamentally important because the Act of 1995 does not, for example, extend to the validity of a marriage, neither does it provide for the types of rights referred to in the explanatory memorandum to this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill also lacks provision in regard to duties. In this context, it must be borne in mind that marriage is not simply a series of rights, although it may seem that way, I fully acknowledge, to people who are kept out of it and who feel they are being denied those rights. Marriage &mdash; the same would have to apply to any new institution which would mirror it &mdash; is a complex of duties. Married people owe each other many judicially enforceable duties such as a duty of maintenance and a special duty in respect of a home used by them. If two people in a marriage use a place as their home, it becomes subject automatically and <Col N="693"/>by operation of law to the Family Home Protection Act. Married people owe each other many other judicially enforceable duties such as the question of bigamy and competence as a witness. A married person is not competent to testify against a spouse. There are other issues such as privilege, divorce, judicial competence over capital assets and dividing up the assets of the persons. A few years ago this was not a matter of great importance but now it is. In family law cases major decisions can be made involving millions of euro being divided this way and that between the parties by the courts. This Bill is silent on these matters. Section 6 states that civil partners shall be regarded as having the same rights as parties to a marriage.</P>
      <P>From a liberal perspective, it is not liberal to say that the only basis on which gay couples or a non-sexual couple can make arrangements for their next-of-kin status and the like is if they agree to a relationship which has all the incidents of marriage. We should think of this in a more long-term way and from a liberal perspective and ask ourselves whether this Bill would be fair to those who simply want to make some arrangements for their lives without making all the arrangements which marriage carries in its train.</P>
      <P>In pointing out these matters, it is my intention, on behalf of the Government, to be helpful rather than negative. I hope Senator Norris accepts that. These are complex issues. If, as it appears, the Bill is an attempt to be comprehensive, it is not achieving its purpose. If it is an exercise in liberalism, and I know the Senator would regard it as such, it is not liberal if it indicates to couples who want to avail of a civil partnership that the only basis on which they can do that is by undertaking all the rights and incidents of marriage under our Constitution, statute law and common law.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not deal with children&rsquo;s issues adequately, with which Senator Terry agrees. Sections 13 and 14 on foreign civil partnerships is generous but probably not in accordance with the Constitution and does not address issues such as the potential for fraud or the wide disparity between the laws of foreign jurisdictions.</P>
      <P>The proposals in the Bill would have extensive implications for tax, welfare and civil legislation. Tax accruing to the State in the area of income tax, capital acquisitions tax and the like would be affected. I agree with Senator Norris that the mere fact that something can cost money to the Exchequer is not a reason, as we know today from consideration of the Article 26 reference, for putting into our law something which is unfair or for keeping it there. However, we have to think long and hard about whether our tax system could survive if generalisation of its provisions extended to everyone in society including two elderly farmers in Kerry who, because they care for each other, are entitled to be regarded as a family and to get double tax allowances. We have to think long and hard about that as a proposition and we might find the result would be that we <Col N="694"/>would have to dismantle the present tax system, which is remarkably pro-family.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the shortcomings of the Bill, I wish to make a final point because I am aware I am trespassing on the House&rsquo;s time. It is most emphatically not the case, as Senator Terry seemed to suggest, that those on this side of the House decided to try to derail this Bill today. I record that in the days leading up to this debate every means was sought to avoid voting down this Bill. I am glad Senator Norris, the Leader of the House and other Senators have come to an agreement whereby that will not be the outcome of this evening&rsquo;s proceedings. It was most emphatically not the purpose of the Government to vote down this Bill, sabotage or derail it, or to say that the issues covered in it are too complex to merit early consideration. That is emphatically not the Government&rsquo;s position.</P>
      <P>We must emphatically reject the simplistic argument offered to us by Senator Ross that the merit of this Bill is so blindingly obvious that there should not even be a debate on it and that it should be nodded through. In the name of all that is good, that remark simply does not stand up to even a ten second scrutiny. I am sorry to say that in the absence of Senator Ross; I would have preferred to say it to his face. This Bill is not something which should be nodded through. It is not self-evidently so compelling in its terms as to merit no further debate; the exact opposite is the case. This Bill is a legitimate effort to counter unfairness and hurt for many people in Irish society and I accept it in that spirit.</P>
      <P>The Bill is not something which could be pushed through on the nod or accepted uncritically; it must be teased out. Of course it is of interest whether the Supreme Court rules that two gay people who are married abroad can have their marriage recognised here, as is now being ventilated in the courts. If the courts decide that is the case, many of the issues in terms of the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s view of the world and the one shared by my legal advisers and Senator Terry would disappear.</P>
      <P>It is relevant whether we are content in future to have family rights restricted under the Constitution to unit groups in society based on matrimony, which is the issue being decided on currently by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. It is also right that we should wait for the Law Reform Commission to report on its consultative paper on the rights and duties of cohabitants. It uses the horrible phrase &ldquo;cohabitees&rdquo; and I do not know from where they got that phrase; &ldquo;cohabitants&rdquo; is the one I would use. We should wait and see what some of these issues are. The Law Reform Commission, when it gets wind of the contrary legal advice of at least two parties in this House, might take a second look at this and acknowledge there is perhaps more to this than meets the eye.</P>
      <P>I have great pleasure in saying it is not true that the Government panicked and tried to derail this process. The Government set out, and I am sure <Col N="695"/>the Leader will confirm this in her contribution, that our definite priority in this matter was not to divide the House but to come to some arrangement that would accommodate this Bill as a meritorious assay in this area without defeating it because of the issues that I have raised. Therefore, I am grateful to Members of the House for allowing me to participate in this debate. This Bill is very important and the areas it covers cannot be deferred for another generation or another Parliament to consider. This is an issue for us to consider now, but that does not mean that we can commit the sin dangled in front of our noses by Senator Ross of nodding through something as important as this without looking around at least a few corners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps he was simply trying to provoke the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I support this Bill on behalf of the Labour Party and I thank Senator Norris for introducing it. In doing so, and in his previous work in the Seanad, the Senator promotes this House which is often ahead of the D&aacute;il in introducing measures such as this.</P>
      <P>This Bill recognises social reality. Senator Kett mentioned the Taoiseach&rsquo;s referral of the issue to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, of which I am a member. The committee will give the issue thorough examination and is already looking at the entire area that incorporates this issue, but what happens to its reports? Last year the ninth report was issued on property rights and nothing has been done about its recommendations.</P>
      <P>We do not need any more information. Senator Kett spoke about expert knowledge but we do not need expert knowledge on this issue. This Bill is a recognition of reality and the fact that society is ahead of us as legislators. We must now legislate to deal with the way families are being formed. People are entering non-marital unions and the law must recogise and support them.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform concentrated on rights and obligations, reducing this to a simplistic focus. This Bill has nothing to do with the issue of rights versus obligations. People who make up any type of family take on obligations to each other and there is no avoiding them. Heterosexual couples who can get married but choose not to, do not do so to avoid obligations. This issue is complicated but it is an increasingly common family unit. The quarterly figures from the Central Statistics Office show that 30% of births take place outside marriage. If a person has a child with someone, he or she takes on obligations.</P>
      <P>This Bill has nothing to do with rights and obligations, it is about supporting families. The Department of Social and Family Affairs stated that in the context of increasing diversity in Irish society, we need an inclusive definition of &ldquo;family&rdquo; that encompasses all types of families. To be <Col N="696"/>inclusive, a definition should be capable of embracing such diverse family forms as those made up of grandparents and children, foster parents and children, lone parents and children, unmarried partners and children as well as same sex parents and children.</P>
      <P>This Bill is part of that process. It does not include the example the Minister gave of the two elderly bachelor brothers living together but we have already taken measures to try and support such a unit in the tax code. Why would we not do so? Such people need to be supported and when they live as a unit, it would be wrong to leave one homeless if the other died. Of course we should support any type of unit and the measures in this Bill will support families of the type outlined in the legislation. We should also take measures to support the other types of families the Minister has mentioned.</P>
      <P>We should do so because we want to support a large portion of society. There are good economic and social arguments which support this approach, even for those from a socially conservative background. Senator Norris&rsquo;s Bill promotes two people forming a stable relationship, something we should support.</P>
      <P>There are sound economic reasons for this approach. Our legislation is contradictory. When the Minister spoke of rights and obligations, if that is the focus, why does the tax code not recognise heterosexual, unmarried couples or same-sex couples in terms of tax bands, while the social welfare code recognises unmarried heterosexual couples as married? The Departments do that to save the State money. We are, however, losing money. If people form stable relationships and we protect them through the social welfare and tax systems, we help society. If we leave someone homeless or if we must provide a person with local authority housing because he or she cannot inherit the home shared with a partner, it will cost the State more and that is a waste of money.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has referred this matter to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution because he wants to kick it into touch and he does not want to face up to the issue. It will be dealt with inevitably. Other countries are ahead of us on this issue. Society is ahead of the Legislature on this matter. The train is leaving the station and the Government is either on it or standing on the platform. The Government should hop on the train with Senator Norris and allow for positive legislation that supports families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is underneath the train.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to state that there is no argument on either side of the House about what should be done or about Senator Norris&rsquo;s approach to all of this. The question is whether the Bill is the correct approach and there might be some argument about that.</P>
      <P>The Senator has done us a considerable service by having this matter debated on the floor of the <Col N="697"/>House because there is a reluctance to consider these matters. Many people have congratulated him, as I would, on what he has achieved to date and his unswerving dedication to a difficult cause over many years. He should be commended for that as he should be commended for bringing forward the Bill.</P>
      <P>It is also important to state, as confirmed by the Minister, that there is no homophobia on any side of the House. If there is any minuscule amount of homophobia it is not confined to one side of the House. We have come a long way since 1993 when M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, as Minister for Justice, introduced legislation to decriminalise homosexual acts.</P>
      <P>I was involved to an extent with siblings who had been living together for years in very expensive houses who were crippled with capital gains taxes when they had no money. Something was done about that. Anti-discrimination legislation specifically stated that sexual orientation was no grounds for discrimination so we have come some way.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Norris that we need to move on. Do I accept that there can be loving relationships between people of a single sex? Yes, of course I do. Do I believe they can be permanent? Yes, of course I do. Do I believe the State should support that? Yes, of course I do. There is no argument about that.</P>
      <P>The Senator made an important point in the explanatory memorandum about the common good and the public good. We are charged with that and we can have differences as to how we interpret it. It is important that people who have property and who are in a loving, stable relationship should be able to hand on the property. It would be totally wrong if because someone had a natural child, that child would take precedence over someone who had lived with a partner for 30 years. That would be wrong and it needs to be rectified. There is no debate about any of those matters.</P>
      <P>The constitutional aspect of this legislation has been raised. I find myself echoing many of the remarks made by the Minister even though I have not discussed the Bill with him. I take issue with section 6 which provides that the parties to a civil partnership shall be regarded in law as having the same rights and entitlements as the parties to a marriage. I made the point on the Order of Business this morning that there was a constitutional dimension to this issue. That was rejected by the Opposition. I still insist that there is a constitutional aspect to it. That view is supported by G. W. Hogan and G. F. Whyte in the fourth edition of <i>The Irish Constitution</i> by J.M. Kelly published in 2003 which states that regarding the constitutionality of State support for non-marital families, an issue not yet being addressed by the courts is whether the Oireachtas can provide equivalent statutory protection for non-marital families as is currently provided for marital families. More specifically, it poses the question as to whether the Oireachtas could legislate to <Col N="698"/>recognise common law marriages, same-sex unions or polygamy. It states that the issue is whether or not the constitutional obligation to guard with special care the institution of marriage requires the State to maintain marital families in a privileged position in law, in which case the legislative promotion of alternative social units to such families might be unconstitutional, and that support for this view might be gleaned from the description of the family based on marriage in Article 41.1 as, <i>inter alia</i>, the primary unit of society. There is, therefore, a constitutional issue which must be addressed.</P>
      <P>There is the question of legal property and inheritance rights about which the Minister has spoken. Regarding the matter of the family, at the all-Party Committee on the Constitution, Dr. Finola Kennedy quoted Senator Barack Obama of Illinois and first African-American president of the <i>Harvard Law Review</i>. The quotation is from the book <i>Dreams from my Father, a Story of Race and Inheritance</i>, published in 1995 and reprinted in 2004. Senator Obama asks:</P>
      <P LI="1">What is the family? Is it just a genetic chain, parents and offspring, people like me? Or is it a social construct, an economic unit, optimal for child rearing and divisions of labor? Or is it something else entirely: a store of shared memories, say? An ambit of love? A reach across a void?</P>
      <P FLI="0">There are difficulties regarding how we define the family and constitutes the family.</P>
      <P>Regarding the other aspects of the Bill, I have problems with the phrase &ldquo;conjugal relationship&rdquo;. I am not sure what it means. It should be defined. At the all-party committee or perhaps in the Constitutional Review Group, there have been discussions regarding how the phrase can be defined and how it relates to the family.</P>
      <P>There is another difficulty to which the Minister has referred. I do not see how it is not discriminatory that such a relationship can be immediately dissolved because it has irretrievably broken down when there is a four-year wait in the case of a marriage. That discriminates against married people. There must be consistency across the board, and that is an inconsistency which, in my view, amounts to a defect.</P>
      <P>I also have some difficulty regarding section 12 which provides &ldquo;Where two persons register as civil partners of each other, the civil partnership is voidable if, at any time when they do so, either of them did not validly consent to its formation (whether as a result of duress, fraud, mistake, unsoundness of mind or otherwise).&rdquo; That seems the same as a person walking up the aisle having a mental reservation and assuming that, therefore, the couple are not validly married. That constitutes an easy get-out clause.</P>
      <P>Section 14(2)(<i>a</i>) refers to capacity to enter into a relationship. Does that mean somebody with an intellectual disability does not have the capacity to enter into a relationship? I accept that the <Col N="699"/>Senator would never suggest that. However, I wonder about that section.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Tuffy, I am a member of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. There is one example of that committee having a very significant effect. That was in regard to abortion. There was a constitutional amendment which was adopted by the people. Something as sensitive and as difficult as that was debated and the result was consensus. That is what the All-Party Committee on the Constitution can achieve &mdash; it can achieve consensus. That is why it is important for Senator Norris to come to the committee, as he will be doing tomorrow, and make these points.</P>
      <P>There seems to have been some confusion this morning regarding whether this Bill can be referred to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution and be dealt with in a legislative way. The All-Party Committee on the Constitution does not have that competence because it is not a House committee, it is an all-party Oireachtas committee. While it can consider the contents of the Bill and propositions contained therein, it cannot go through it line by line and amend it in a Committee Stage debate. It is important to state that. The All-Party Committee on the Constitution has a role and can make a positive contribution. I accept that something needs to be done quickly to regularise the situation and allow people to enjoy the stable unions about which we have spoken.</P>
      <P>On a lighter note, I am disappointed that Senator Norris has succumbed to the &ldquo;in relation to&rdquo; disease which Senator Quinn and I have campaigned for years to eradicate from our legislation. Here it is in this Bill introduced by someone who was described recently on television as a man of letters, albeit with a camera. How he can succumb to the &ldquo;in relation to&rdquo; disease I do not know.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate Senator Norris for introducing this Bill. Modern life has changed. The way we think has changed. We need to examine these matters and to tease out many questions we had not thought of before. This debate has been a valuable contribution. I wish many more people could hear it because it has opened my eyes to a whole range of topics, challenges and questions I had not thought of before. I am pleased we are debating this issue. It is a topic we must not avoid. We must listen to different opinions. That is what we are hearing today.</P>
      <P>I have one concern, namely, each time we recognise non-marital relationships in some way in law we in some way weaken the whole institution of marriage. I examined this Bill to see <Col N="700"/>whether it passed my test of not weakening the institution of marriage, and that is something we have not considered well enough.</P>
      <P>Like the Minister I looked up what the Archbishop of Dublin, Dr. Diarmuid Martin, said. He stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">It may, in certain circumstances, be in the public interest to provide legal protection to the social, fiscal and inheritance entitlements of persons who support caring relationships which generate dependency, provided always that these relationships are recognised as being qualitatively different from marriage and that their acceptance does not dilute the uniqueness of marriage.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I fear that section 6 does that. I am not sure but I suggest it might do so because it states that such relationships are equal to marriage.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis has clearly pointed to the fact that if we regard such relationships as equal to marriage we discriminate against married people. That concerns me because in the Constitution and in our way of life we have recognised marriage as something different, something unique and we have placed it on a level. This Bill proposes to place other relationships on exactly the same level, and this is perhaps where Senator Norris and I disagree. It is not enough for marriage to be equal. Marriage must be at a different level and have a different status. If we do not do that we are in danger of damaging, weakening and demeaning it.</P>
      <P>I hope we can deal with this issue without getting bogged down in the issue of gay marriage, which is causing such disruption, particularly in America. To many people,  both here and in America, to propose gay marriage is an affront to their religious sensibilities. Rather than get involved in that debate which has every likelihood of being indeterminable, we should concentrate on the kernel of the issue, which is the need to provide a legal structure for the rights and obligations of those who enter into non-marital relationships.</P>
      <P>Regardless of whether people or married or not, the State has an interest in promoting stable relationships. They are the glue that hold our society together. As soon as we enter this area we immediately run the risk of falling into linguistic traps. I see one such trap in section 3 of the Bill. It has been talked about before. It refers to a civil partnership as a &ldquo;conjugal relationship&rdquo;. This begs the question. The most commonly accepted meaning of the word &ldquo;conjugal&rdquo; incorporates the concept of marriage. I looked the word up in a dictionary. The Latin verb <i>conjugare</i> which is the root of the English word means &ldquo;to join in marriage&rdquo;. I have a different opinion from Senator Norris because I believe it includes the sexual connotation. A better term needs to be found although I do not feel qualified to offer one. I realise it is necessary to distinguish what we are talking about from relationships that result from family members or friends living together.</P><Col N="701"/>
      <P>Inevitably the question of the Bill&rsquo;s constitutionality will arise. Members will recall that the Constitution review group made a number of recommendations regarding Article 41 in its 1996 report. The group took the view that the concept of the family in Irish society had undergone significant changes since 1937 and recommended that Article 41 should be amended to take this change of attitudes into account. On non-marital relationships, it recommended that although the State&rsquo;s obligation to protect marriage should be retained the revised Article 41 should explicitly state that this should not prevent the Oireachtas from legislating for the benefit of non-marital relationships. We have debated this issue. The Minister clearly made his point.</P>
      <P>The argument can and no doubt will be made that this Bill cannot stand until such a constitutional amendment is passed. On the other hand, the Law Reform Commission for its part believes that the law as it stands does allow the Oireachtas to legislate for the non-marital family, provided it does not treat such relationships more favourably &mdash; I think that is the term it uses &mdash; than the marital family. On that basis this Bill could get through. As usual the lawyers differ and we must see what emerges. I have a difficulty with the words &ldquo;more favourably&rdquo;. I believe marriage is a different state and on a different level and if we put other relationships on the same level we diminish the status of marriage.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Norris for initiating this debate. It is valuable and has opened my eyes to many questions and challenges I had not thought of previously. It is not over, it will go on. There is a little bit of Latin I love to drop in and it is seldom I have a chance to do so &mdash;<i>obesa non iam contava,</i> the fat lady has not sung yet.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Quinn for sharing time. I thank Senator Norris for all the hard work he has put into this Bill. I thank the Leader for ensuring this debate took place this evening and for her judicious use of &ldquo;horsetrading&rdquo;&mdash; that is probably not the right word &mdash; to ensure the debate would proceed. I also thank the Minister for his extremely thoughtful and useful speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>It carefully teased out much of what is in the Bill. While we support Senator Norris&rsquo;s proposition some of us have concerns such as those raised by Senator Quinn. Section 6 is very difficult. It provides that heterosexual relationships will be the same as marriage. They will have the same rights but not the duties as was pointed out. I, probably more than any one in the House, have had experience of working with people who simply will not get married, even though I <Col N="702"/>thought it was the best thing for them to do. For 35 years I worked in the Rotunda Hospital and even though it was not my job or my duty to have anything to do with advising people on their private life I could see that at times people were getting into fairly serious legal difficulties as time went on. I worked there over a period when the rate of birth of non-marital children went from 3% to 30%. This did not mean that their parents were not in stable relationships. The vast majority, 90%, were in stable relationships. I do not know if they are more likely to get involved in a civil partnership than in marriage from the various reasons they gave me as to why they were not getting married. They never got around to it. They were saving for the wedding. They were saving for the house. They were saving until the third child was born because they did not want the first two to be discriminated against because they would be married when the third was born. I have heard the most amazing explanations, all very worthy, but I am not convinced that these people would be more likely to become involved in a civil partnership. It is a private decision that people make. Sometimes I wonder if it is due to the fact that we delayed introducing divorce for so long that it became perfectly obvious that it was acceptable to have non-marital relationships and there would be no problems. Now we have a situation where all of us who could have done something about bringing in divorce much earlier face this confusion. Those who are most affected are same sex couples. I salute my friends Dr. Katherine Zappone and Dr. Ann Louise Gilligan who are in the Visitors Gallery on their courage in bringing forward their case&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;which is the subject of the first part of the Government amendment. I do not like the Legislature being totally influenced by the courts. I like us to have a fair amount of influence on it and was looking forward to Committee Stage. We need to be careful that in protecting marriage we are not letting the family down. There are an enormous number of different family types in Ireland. I think particularly of the position of children because same sex couples who may, as others have said, have had children in a previous heterosexual relationship are in a terrible position given that they cannot adopt or have guardianship or custody of that child. This is a really difficult situation because if something happens to the biological parent what is the position regarding that child? Perhaps the Minister would address the issue of such couples who have had children by a surrogate mother because that is far more widespread than one would think.</P>

	<P>Some public cases have been in the press but there are others and I have raised this matter here previously. We will have a messy case <Col N="703"/>in the courts one day and regret it very much. For the stability of society, the rights of children and the happiness of those in same sex relationships I hope we can make progress on this issue as rapidly and comfortably as we can. The stability of society, including parental leave, is what we discussed all afternoon and it is to all our benefit to encourage that. I again congratulate Senator Norris on his courage in introducing the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I too wish to join in the praise to Senator Norris for his courage which he has displayed in spades for many years in the way he has addressed issues. Before speaking on the Bill I thank the Senator for bringing it before the House where we had an acrimonious mini debate this morning in which, across the House, various insults were heard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>No, we are not singing. I wish to echo something the Minister said, namely that it was never the Government&rsquo;s wish to vote down the Bill. I was involved for weeks in seeking to bring about some agreement. Senator Norris will be aware of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I have spoken with him on a dozen occasions in person and on telephone about his Bill. I have been aware of the Bill from its gestation. I took the trouble to go to see the Taoiseach last Wednesday night on some matters but mostly on this matter and we had quite a thorough discussion on it. I take my duties as Leader seriously so what I am saying is the truth. There was never an intention on behalf of the Government to wilfully come in and vote down this Bill. I strongly regret that was the tenor of this morning&rsquo;s exchange but that was then and this is now. In the interim we had various other discussions with the Minister, who proved extraordinarily accommodating, the Taoiseach and my own party members. Whatever about the relationships of which we speak one has to keep all sorts of relationships going as well and that took some doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The uncivil party.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="704"/>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Not really. I regret very much that the word &ldquo;homophobia&rdquo; came into the debate. I am not castigating Senator Terry because I have found her to be extraordinarily open and transparent. I regret that the word &ldquo;homophobia&rdquo; was heard on this side of the House. Homophobia is a strong, ugly word which I have grave reservations about ever pinning on a person. In its way, it is a form of complete discrimination. Homophobia has never come into discussions with members of my party. On behalf of all of us I regret that remark and deny it was connected with what we proposed this morning.</P>
      <P>A matter was raised while we were in the audio-visual room last Wednesday when Senator Norris and his colleagues gave a fine presentation on the Bill&rsquo;s proposals. The same point was raised in the House by several Members who, for one reason or another, might not have been able to attend the presentation. The issue is whether there is discrimination against married couples. I know from experience within my own family that if a married couple wish to separate or divorce there is a very long lead-in time before a divorce can be obtained and this proper. The ease of dissolution which appears to be provided for in this Bill could in effect be a discriminatory measure against a married couple who must go through the hoops, so to speak, to disengage from one another. I approve of that arrangement because I believe people should go to mediation and wait a number of years before they take such a significant step. Senator Norris and Ivana Bacik spoke about that provision at the presentation and Ms Bacik brought it to our attention most strongly.</P>
      <P>In a small way I was involved in a labour law in about 1993 or 1994. One of its clauses stipulated that one could not be discriminated against regarding job opportunities or employment promotion on the basis of one&rsquo;s sexual orientation. I remember presenting the Bill in this and the other House. I was the Minister with responsibility for labour affairs at the time. I was glad to introduce that Bill because I regarded it as my contribution, my niche, in societal development.</P>
      <P>In my view, society has made advances in this regard. As we were informed by <i>The Irish Times</i>, society has changed dramatically and that newspaper has been to the forefront of change. There is no doubt about that and the House is keeping up with that pace. It may seem sometimes as if we are tardy but I do not agree. The matter must be viewed from all sides. The Minister&rsquo;s speech was so thought provoking in the proper sense and gave the House so many facts that Members will be pondering them for some time.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister on behalf of the House. Ministers come and go; mostly they come and go very quickly but this Minister comes and stays&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett"><NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
	<P>He is here all the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>We are thinking of making him an honorary Senator because he comes here so <Col N="705"/>often and stays for debates on his Bills. We are grateful to him for giving a commitment on this issue.</P>
      <P>Senator Tuffy raised a point which was echoed by Senator Quinn that stable relationships are the glue in society and I agree. They may be the words used by Senator Quinn. In my view, a couple who love one another, who wish to care for one another and to continue their lives like that is a thing to be marvelled at, to be appreciated and of which to be glad. There is so much that is wrong, ugly and divisive in society that it is wonderful to find people of whatever sex &mdash; in same sex or heterosexual relationships &mdash; who have found a partner, someone who echoes their aspirations, their unsaid thoughts and can share things such as poetry, walking together, living and cooking together and doing all of the things which are lovely in a relationship and which everybody would applaud. I am only so sorry I have lost it. People who can be in a relationship which gives each partner joy and in which they can have joy unconfined with one another is such a wonderful thing. We should be offering a paean of praise to it, as this Bill does.</P>
      <P>All these areas dealing with relationships and with the things that matter in life are being introduced incrementally. It may seem tardy but we live by our Constitution which is our charter for living. It is right and proper that the Minister should bring various matters to our attention in that regard. Senator Dardis stated his intention to call for the adjournment of the debate rather than for a vote. I concur on behalf of my party. We will not be calling for a vote on the amendment. I wish Senator Norris well tomorrow when he speaks to the committee and lays out his stall, so to speak.</P>
      <P>In my view, this is a thoughtful Bill into which Senator Norris has put his heart, as have his colleagues, many of whom are in the Visitors Gallery. He has worked very hard on the Bill. Senator Terry made the point that Fine Gael as a party did not make a submission to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. The former leader of Fine Gael, now the EU ambassador in Washington, made a very strong submission which was based on the family and which rejected outright any other type of relationship. I suppose many within the Fine Gael Party agree with that view. As I said this morning on the Order of Business, I appreciate the opportunity to express my views on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I too wish to congratulate Senator Norris on bringing forward this Bill. Many worthy points are covered in it and these were explained in the presentation given by the Senator last week in the audio-visual room. In common with the other speakers I wish Senator Norris well tomorrow when he appears before the committee.</P>
      <P>I was very heartened by the views of Archbishop Diarmuid Martin&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="706"/>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s proposals. I have had my eyes opened in this debate, like so many others and not least by the Minister. I concur with the tributes to the Minister. We have seen further tangible expression tonight and further proof of the able guardian and protector of the Constitution that he is and the fine legal brain he possesses. I was thrilled and delighted that despite the acrimony which existed in the House this morning that agreement was reached. I had a chat with Senator Norris and with the Leader of the House. I had my own simple formula but that may not have been what was used. In any event, we are all glad this debate has taken place and that there will not be a vote. I accept the need for a consideration of all the important legal and constitutional issues.</P>
      <P>I note the Oireachtas All-Party Committee on the Constitution and the case currently before the courts. As the Minister pointed out, there is a difference between the legal advice to him and the legal advice on which the Law Reform Commission has been working. We all accept, and I am sure Senator Norris equally accepts, the provisions of Article 41 of the Constitution which describes the family as based on marriage. That is the basic, fundamental unit of society to which we all pay homage and salute. A difficulty with section 6 of the Bill has been noted. No one would do anything to infringe the constitutional protection provided for the marriage unit. On the possible discriminatory nature of section 3 of the Bill, I believe work will be done to remove that provision. I was delighted to hear the Minister state there are no great philosophical differences on this matter. All Senators need to be commended for not dividing the House.</P>
      <P>We welcome the fact that Archbishop<?oasys [jy?>Diarmuid Martin has given approval to giving legal rights to couples, including homosexuals, to live in relationships other than marriage. The Taoiseach stated that extending rights to gay couples in the areas of tax and inheritance was the &ldquo;fairest&rdquo; and &ldquo;Christian way&rdquo; to deal with the issue. Dr. Martin recognised that:</P>
      <P LI="1">....there are many different kinds of caring relationships and these often create dependencies for those involved. The State may feel in justice that the rights of people in these relationships need to be protected.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The Minister has made a similar statement and there are no differences between the two sides of the House on the issue. While the Archbishop stated he was referring primarily to caring, dependent relationships in general, as opposed to homosexual relationships, at the same time, he indicated that he did not exclude homosexual relationships. He stated he had a wide range of relationships in mind and while he did not exclude gay relationships, his main concern was &ldquo;with all caring relationships where dependencies have come into being&rdquo;. I share the Minister&rsquo;s con<Col N="707"/>cern about Kerry farmers because it would be a hell of a job if they had to split the pollach&aacute;n. They would need some of the Minister&rsquo;s senior counsel colleagues.</P>
      <P>It is great that everybody accepts the need to redress these matters and that Irish law already takes into account certain issues regarding non-marital relationships. It is good that the Minister placed on record that the Government is unequivocally in favour of treating gay people as fully equal citizens.</P>
      <P>The Minister flattened poor Senator Ross in his absence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>He deserved it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>He will rise again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I know and that is great. The Bill lacks provision as regards duties and is silent in regard to other matters.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris&rsquo;s input has been tremendous and is welcomed by all Senators. I believe he would accept that further work needs to be done on the Bill. He has the brainpower and people to do it. The Bill, in conjunction with the helpful points the Minister has made, means we will go forward. Progress has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, the Minister is willing to remain in the House for a short time. I propose to change the Order of Business to extend the debate by approximately 20 minutes to accommodate several Senators who wish to speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That is an indication of how seriously Senators take the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Hanafin will, therefore, be able to speak. I, too, congratulate Senator Norris and thank him for the trouble he has taken to bring the legislation before the House. I also thank the Leader for her diplomacy in ensuring the debate proceeded in an acceptable form, the Minister for his thoughtful and compassionate speech and Senator Kett for proposing the amendment in the manner he did.</P>
      <P>I think of marriage as a contract in which people agree to take on certain obligations and do their best to carry them out. For some people marriage is enriched by being a sacrament, which is fine, but there is also a civil element of contract. The family is a building block which stabilises society and provides a matrix in which children can be brought up and safeguarded. However, the nature of the family has changed over the years. The family, as defined in the 1937 Constitution, represented the ideal of family at the time.</P>
      <P>I commend a good book by a French sociologist entitled <i>The Family in History</i>. The family at the time of the Brehon Laws was different <Col N="708"/>from the current family structure. We had the extended family and nuclear family and now new arrangements have emerged in society and we must deal with them. Each of these arrangements is important and can work. The important factors are stability, solidity and certainty and that people accept their rights and responsibilities. The Constitution, as a living document, must take account of this and I am glad the All-Party Committee on the Constitution is addressing the matter.</P>
      <P>I have two difficulties with Senator Norris&rsquo;s Bill. I share his view regarding the purity of the classical etymology of the word &ldquo;conjugal&rdquo;. Unfortunately, the word has been vulgarised by lesser etymologists and now has a sexual overtone. It would have been preferable to find another formulation in this instance. The Senator has got himself and the Bill into trouble by importing the dreaded &ldquo;M&rdquo; word, marriage, into section 6. While it may be handy shorthand to state that civil partnership has the same meaning as marriage under previous legislation, it will be necessary to tease out what are the responsibilities and benefits in a civil partnership.</P>
      <P>Although I bow to the Minister&rsquo;s legal knowledge, I believe the best way to deal with the issue is as a contract matter. People could have variable contracts which could be registered. This would meet requirements and would not be in competition with marriage <i>per se</i>.</P>
      <P>The important issue is that there is pressing social need. It is all very well to say there are not many people facing these circumstances but the issue is extremely important in every single case. I hope, therefore, that to the extent that the different consultations that are necessary can be influenced by the House and the Government, they will be pressed on to finality. The requirement to consult and deliberate further should not be used to put the issue on the long finger. It should be brought to a conclusion. I welcome the debate and thank Senator Norris and the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>Like other Senators, I thank Senator Norris for introducing the Bill. I also acknowledge the actions of the Leader in listening to and reflecting the views expressed on the Order of Business, particularly on this side, and allowing the debate to proceed and even be extended. I welcome the legislation because it develops a debate recently touched on by a number of key people, including Archbishop Diarmuid Martin, to whom many Senators referred. It opens up a debate on questions such as what is the family and what is marriage.</P>
      <P>The Minister&rsquo;s speech is a useful commentary on the legislation. He asked what are the duties, responsibilities, rights, entitlements and so on of marriage. Rights and entitlements arise, as reflected in Senator Norris&rsquo;s Bill, but so do the issues of duties and responsibilities.</P>
      <P>The legislation is a landmark in extending social change. The family looks much different <Col N="709"/>now from how it did in the past. However, this does not mean that family units as they are now constituted are any less families than those which adhere to the traditional definition of that entity. A family may not be a nuclear family which consists of mother, father and children but may be made up of a unmarried couples with children, couples in second relationships, gay couples, couples who choose to live together and not have children, or couples who choose to be married and not have children.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I acknowledge the contention of many Members that the family unit is the place in which children are nurtured and become members of society. However, partners who choose not to have children or are unable to do so are no less a family than partners who choose to have one or more children. The family unit is the cornerstone of a well-working society and it is our duty as legislators to support it. We have reached a point, however, where our laws and, if necessary, our Constitution must reflect a changing view of the concept of family and must support actual families. I include long-term same-sex relationships in this context.</P>
      <P>The question of legal protection for the rights of cohabiting couples is important. With social change has come an acceptance that partners of the same sex have rights and should be accepted in their choice of living together. I know a couple well who have lived together for a number of years and have accumulated much property. Questions arise for couples such as this in regard to issues such as pensions and inheritance. The Minister will agree these couples have a right to be protected under the law.</P>
      <P>However, in providing such protection, I agree with what the Minister said regarding the importance of considering the other elements we may create in law through such changes. I welcome this debate, which is part of what this House is about. Tonight&rsquo;s debate will contribute to the broader debate that must take place on this issue before any legislative change takes place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the recent remarks of the Archbishop of Dublin, Most Reverend<?oasys [jy?>Diarmuid Martin, who stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">I recognise that there are many different kinds of caring relationships and these often create dependencies for those involved. The State may feel in justice that the rights of people in these relationships must be protected. Not only would this approach be more fair, it would also make political sense. For, if significant social change is to take place, it needs to have a fairly broad measure of support across society. We should try for a consensus approach.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This Bill does not satisfy the requirements as set down by the Archbishop.</P>
      <P>Before I go any further, I observe that the word &ldquo;homophobic&rdquo; has been used in reference to <Col N="710"/>some Government Members. I am proud of the record of this side of the House. In 1989, it was a Government comprising Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats which steered through the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, which made it an offence to publish or distribute material or use words or behaviour that are threatening, abusive or insulting, and are intended or likely to stir up hatred against a group or persons on account of a number of specific grounds including sexual orientation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That provision was included as a consequence of my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Employment Equality Act 1998 prohibits discrimination in employment on grounds of sexual orientation. Sexual orientation is defined in this Bill as meaning heterosexual, homosexual or bisexual. The ground-breaking Equal Status Act 2000, which was also initiated by this Government, protects against discrimination outside the field of employment by prohibiting discrimination in the supply of goods and services on nine distinct grounds including sexual orientation.</P>
      <P>It is to be regretted that the debate has diminished to the level of name-calling. It amuses me that people sometimes think that a person who takes another view does not understand the issues. I reject that and contend that we are quite clear on the issues. Marriage is an institution honoured in most societies because it benefits the State and civil society. Through the procreation of children, it provides for the future of the State. When children mature and go to work, they pay for the pensions and social welfare benefits of the present generation. Marriage is, therefore, an important institution which should be strengthened and promoted by the State. All serious studies indicate that a family in which the parents are married is the best milieu for the rearing of children.</P>
      <P>The question I pose in regard to this Bill is probably the same as that which went through the mind of the child observing the emperor whose tailor had allegedly provided him with a beautiful suit. There was much admiration of this suit until the child pointed out that the emperor had no clothes. If this Bill applies to civil partnership every <i>de jure</i> and de facto meaning of civil marriage, the question arises as to why heterosexual couples should not just choose civil marriage. This issue arose during the debate in the UK and it is a question that should be addressed.</P>
      <P>The Bill confines civil registration to conjugal relationships, which the dictionary defines as pertaining to marriage or the right of a sexual relationship. Like marriage, it also has a schedule of forbidden degrees of kindred and provides for dissolution and annulment. The message of registration and the entire proposal imitates civil marriage. Section 6 bestows on a civil partnership the same rights of marriage now enjoyed by legally married couples. Presumably, this includes tax<Col N="711"/>ation benefits and the right to adopt children. Apart from seeking privileges for same-sex couples and cohabiting heterosexual couples who by the Bill&rsquo;s definition would have to be free to marry, the Bill excludes others living together such as a widowed mother and son or two siblings, for example.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that the Bill will prove to be unconstitutional. The proposal for civil registration as envisaged in this Bill effectively amounts to a consideration of the question of homosexual marriage. This is a question that was recently rejected in all 11 states in the United States in which it was tested, despite the influence of the liberal media. We should not accept the Bill as it stands and I second the proposed amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Tribute is owed to Senator Norris, not only for putting this question before us, but also for the campaigning he has done over a long number of years. The highlight of this campaign was the Bill enacted by the former Minister for Justice, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, under the aegis of the Fianna F&aacute;il-Labour Party coalition, on the decriminalisation of homosexuality. There is no disagreement on any side of the House that change and reform are needed. The issue relates to the question of what that change should constitute.</P>
      <P>As the finance spokesman for Fianna F&aacute;il in this House, I feel entitled to raise the point that there is a powerful fiscal undercurrent to this debate. There are three categories for capital acquisitions tax. Category A, which applies to straightforward family relationships such as that between child and parent, has a threshold of &euro;456,000. The threshold is &euro;45,000 for siblings, while for those who are not related a figure of approximately &euro;23,000 applies. This is an important dimension to the debate.</P>
      <P>There are many choices to be made and I am very much in sympathy with most of what the Minister said in his analysis of the issue. One must decide if only sexual relationships, whether heterosexual or homosexual, should come within the remit of civil partnership legislation or whether such provisions can apply to friends, companions or siblings. My clear preference, which is against the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission, is for a broad, inclusive and comprehensive view of relationships. It does not seem right that a cohabiting couple should be treated more favourably than siblings living under the same roof. There are divisions of opinion on this question. The fundamental question concerns marriage as understood up to now and as it is understood in the Constitution, although this is <i>sub judice.</i> Do we believe that the family and marriage should have some primacy over other relationships or do we feel they should be on a par?</P>
      <P>It is somewhat disingenuous to suggest, as some speakers have done, that this has nothing to do <Col N="712"/>with gay marriage. Section 3 states that a civil marriage is a conjugal relationship. The Oxford dictionary states that &ldquo;conjugal&rdquo; means &ldquo;of marriage, of the relationship between husband and wife.&rdquo; Taken with section 6 we are talking to all intents and purposes about gay marriage. How should we decide whether we choose that option or something else? It is not just a matter for the courts, although the input of the courts will be important. While what the Legislature has to say will be important, it is not just a matter for the Legislature. It is so fundamentally important that it should be a matter for the people, not as a question in isolation but on foot of carefully considered legislation dealing with very complex issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon"><NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
	<P>This debate revolves around the family. A family is a primary social group consisting of a man and a woman living together in a long-term commitment formalised by marriage. The primary definition is usually extended to include children and then on to any group of people related by blood, heterosexual marriage or adoption. Even from a strictly evolutionary point of view, nature itself knows of only one kind of human family, namely, biological pair bonding. This fundamental definition has been endorsed by the Supreme Court, which holds that the constitutional meaning of &ldquo;family&rdquo; is confined to a family based on marriage.</P>
      <P>Many scholars who have considered this issue have arrived at the same broad understating of family being a unit, cemented by marriage. The attempt to redefine the family to include various alternative lifestyles ignores the historical and sociological evidence. The natural family remains an historical and social reality, which cannot simply be altered by legislative fiat or by the adoption of current mores.</P>
      <P>It is important to recognise that people in non-traditional household units have certain legitimate rights, which justice demands we recognise. The challenge is to do this without undermining the respect and protection for the family based on marriage, which is properly provided for in the Constitution. The key is to ensure that rights accorded to persons in non-traditional household units are not granted based on the existence of a recognised sexual relationship. Rather such rights should be based upon the fact that two or more persons form the economic and social unit of a household. Where two or more persons have formed such a household for a period of, let us say, five years, they could be granted certain tax advantages and other rights without prejudice to the special status of the family based on marriage.</P>
      <P>The question of inheritance tax is easily and uncontroversially resolved by granting the principle that every person should be allowed to have one privileged heir who can inherit the bulk of an estate without being subject to ruinous levels of inheritance tax. In the case of a married person, his or her spouse, <i>ipso facto</i>, becomes that privileged heir. Other persons could be allowed to <Col N="713"/>nominate a privileged heir, possibly even a corporate person such as a registered charity.</P>
      <P>The relationship of marriage deserves special protection as it forms the basis for stable families with a minimal level of dependence on the State. Many significant advantages accrue to society from the existence of such stable units. By its nature as a procreative relationship, marriage is based upon the existence of an assumed natural sexual relationship between the spouses and the law requires consummation for validity. This is where the recognition of the institution of marriage and the legal rights accorded to the family based on marriage must be unique if they are to have any meaning.</P>
      <P>I come to the matter of homosexual or gay marriages. The definitions of marriage in all societies refer variously to marriage as a contract between a man and a woman to live together as husband and wife. Marriage is an institution older than the State and the institution of positive law, an institution that has been assumed into the sphere of the State&rsquo;s concern for good reasons. There is a rationale for the existence of civil marriage, as such. This rationale is based on the fact that marriage is an institution which is fundamental to society and which it is in society&rsquo;s interest to protect and nurture. This very rationale, which justifies the intrusion of the organs of the State into marriage, would be undermined by the introduction of homosexual unions analogous to marriage.</P>
      <P>It is important to recognise that the refusal of the State to countenance marriage or civil unions between persons of the same sex does not mean that other legitimate rights of such persons cannot be granted or protected by law, as they should be. However, such rights are based on their citizenship rather than on their relationship, which it is inappropriate for the State to recognise in any way other than that they form an economic household unit.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed in the time allowed for this debate. Having listened to Senator Norris I was particularly disappointed that he was given so little time. He could have talked for an hour on the Bill and should have been given at least half an hour. I hope he will talk further on the Bill when the debate resumes.</P>

	<P>It is daunting to make a meaningful contribution to a debate on such a complex issue in four minutes. What is important about this evening&rsquo;s debate is that Senator Norris has done us a service by providing a focus for the debate. Already I can see parameters put down by two different points of view. Some might say the Senator put his head on the block. On the Order of Business this morning he might have feared that it might be knocked off. However, even if his head were knocked off, I believe he would continue to make a very good case.</P>

	<P>I have always found the Senator to be very moderate in his views even on subjects which are very extreme. I give him credit for that and I wish we had more time for this debate. I will make a few points with a view to being helpful. It is very easy to throw around words such as &ldquo;compassion&rdquo;. At this time it is probably somewhat premature to do so and I am sure it can be discussed at a later stage. Many of us grew up with a very traditional outlook on life and are pretty focused in that regard. When we came across people who found themselves in the position of same-sex unions, all of a sudden it became a human issue and we took time out to consider the situation, which is very important. Legislation is one matter and humanity is another. We must always try to bear that in mind.</P>
      <P>As my time is limited, I want to focus on same-sex unions. I would advise that people in such unions should not go into competition with marriage. While Senator Maurice Hayes put it down to an issue of contract, I feel that might be a starting point. I could never understand why gay people wanted to stand out and not integrate in their own right with everybody else in the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day parade in New York. While I do not mean to be insulting in any way, there was a certain degree of exhibitionism in that approach, which does not help the case of gay people.</P>
      <P>If this debate is to continue we must start from the point that we have experience of the family unit. We know how that unit has stood to us in time and we know that it will be very difficult to get people in the main to change their views in that regard. In the debate, perception will be as important as reality and we should focus on the perception. If this discussion were taking place on Vincent Browne&rsquo;s programme or on any other radio programme it would be a case of &ldquo;God help the debate&rdquo;. However, it is happening here involving people who are prepared to listen to each other&rsquo;s opinions, have done research and realise that we have a long road to travel. It is important not to leave it to the media to have the debate; let us have the debate here. I wish everybody well. We all know where we are coming from. If two opposing points of view exist, I have no doubt that the bridge between them is humanity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>As I did this morning, I compliment Senator Norris on introducing this Bill. It is not often that debate on a Private Members&rsquo; Bill is extended by 20 or 25 minutes. This morning it looked like we would have no debate at all.</P>
      <P>I have reservations about the Bill and I have spoken privately with the Senator in this regard. It raises issues which will need to be teased out over a period of time, and will need to be done in a sensitive way in the interest of the individuals who find themselves in certain situations and also in the interest of society as a whole. To some extent this represents the challenge to the <Col N="715"/>Government and to all of us in the Houses. On the one hand we must cater for the individual while at the same time ensuring that the well being of society is preserved.</P>
      <P>I was struck by one of the Minister&rsquo;s comments which puts down a challenge to all of us and particularly to Senator Norris. The Minister said we must decide what we are trying to achieve. In other words, are we focusing on the particular rights of importance to cohabiting couples, or are we looking to give such couples a status equivalent to marriage? That is the real kernel of the issue because a great deal of the emotion of this argument revolves around it.</P>
      <P>I wish to discuss an issue that is not directly related to the concerns of same sex couples and heterosexual cohabiting couples. Marriage is not being supported by the State in the way it should be. At the time of the introduction of divorce, which was necessary in many instances, it was promised that support structures would be put in place to help marriages that were in difficulty or breaking down. Since then, I have encountered many instances of people who walked away from marriage subsequently having tremendous regrets when, for example, their second relationships did not work out. Not only are such people affected by marriage breakdown, but their former partners may be bitter and their children may be in an undesirable position. I do not argue that we should force people to stay together, or even attempt to do so, but we should put in place a system that helps them to protect their relationships. We should think long and hard about introducing anything that undermines the position of marriage in society. We should probably avoid such measures.</P>
      <P>I accept that same sex couples are affected by certain issues, but I do not think those issues apply to cohabiting heterosexual couples in the same way. The option of marriage is open to the latter group. I do not think we should put in place a parallel marriage system. We do not need two different systems running in tandem. The Law Reform Commission addressed a number of the issues to which I refer, including the issue of property rights. I am aware that changes in the capital acquisitions tax code have facilitated the protection of houses, which is probably the most sensitive aspect of this issue.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Other issues, such as succession rights, are well articulated in the report of the Law Reform Commission. When a person who has cohabited in a stable and loving relationship gets sick, it can happen that other people interfere and the person&rsquo;s partner gets cut off. If <Col N="716"/>Ireland is the Christian country we like to think it is, that issue will be addressed in a proper way that takes into account the rights of such people. I do not suggest that we should be generous because giving people their rights is not a question of generosity. At the same time, we should take care not to undermine marriage.</P>
      <P>Like other Senators, I am disappointed not to have had more time to contribute to this debate. I would have liked to speak about certain aspects of the issue of homosexuality, about which I have firm views. I am sure I will have other opportunities to do so. Senator Norris will return to this issue, which will not go away.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, to the House. I would like to ask him and his colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, when the home subvention package, which is at pilot project stage in the east coast section of the Health Service Executive, will be available nationwide. What level of assistance will be given to people who require it under the scheme? The Minister of State is aware that a successful pilot subvention scheme has been operational in the eastern regional area for 14 months. I would like the scheme, which involves the paying of an additional allowance to old age pensioners over the age of 65 up to a maximum of &euro;190, to be extended throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The home subvention payment is an important support because it helps elderly people to access additional services. It allows them to continue to live in their homes and communities. Most public representatives appreciate the importance of helping elderly people to stay in their own homes. The home subvention scheme, which is means <Col N="717"/>tested, is economically viable &mdash; its cost is far less than the cost of maintaining people in private nursing homes or public institutions. The scheme allows people other than family members to provide additional care to an elderly person. It is offered in addition to existing schemes such as meals on wheels and the home help service, which are provided by the bodies which used to be called health boards.</P>
      <P>The ongoing review of the scheme and the Government&rsquo;s drafting of its plans should be completed as soon as possible. It is a particularly urgent matter because of the current crisis in the nursing homes subvention system. It appears, following a Supreme Court judgment this morning, that health boards were making illegal deductions from elderly people.</P>
      <P>I do not know if anybody can emphasise sufficiently the importance to elderly people of being able to recuperate in their own homes after a stay in an acute hospital. It is reassuring for them to be in the company of those they know best in the comfort of their home surroundings. If the Government is a caring Government, as it claims to be, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State should immediately extend the home subvention scheme throughout the country. The scheme is important in major urban areas such as Dublin, Cork and Galway. Its importance in rural areas and communities, where there is a shortage of home help workers and providers of other services which are readily available in major urban areas, cannot be over-emphasised.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State and his senior colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, to extend the home subvention scheme. Can the Minister of State tell the House how much progress has been made with the drafting of legislation to give effect to the scheme, if such legislation is necessary? To what extent will resources be made available for this important scheme, which could make a substantial difference to the lives of many people throughout the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Ulick Burke for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I appreciate his interest in the area of subvention. It is nice that we agree the Government is a caring one.</P>

	<P>It claims to be a caring Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government&rsquo;s policy on developing and delivering services for older people is to maintain them at home in dignity and independence for as long as possible in accordance with their wishes. That policy involves restoring to independence at home older people who become ill or dependent and encouraging and supporting the care of older people in their own communities by family, neighbours and voluntary bodies. All studies indicate that older <Col N="718"/>people are much happier in their own homes and recover more quickly from illnesses when at home. The Government will continue to support people in that regard for as long as possible.</P>
      <P>The aim of the home help service is to enable older people to remain living at home in their communities who would otherwise have to move into residential care. It is recognised that the home help service is an essential support to the individuals concerned and their carers. The home help service, by its nature, is a flexible service designed to respond to clients&rsquo; needs. The service is targeted at high-dependency and medium-dependency clients in accordance with their assessed needs. As a result, the level of service required in individual cases will fluctuate from time to time. Nevertheless, the total increase in expenditure on the home help service across all the former health board areas since 2000 has been over 113%.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to developing the home help service as a community support for older people living in the community. In 2005, expenditure on the home help service will be over &euro;131 million. This increased funding for home help services is a clear example of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to improving the lives of older people living in the community.</P>
      <P>There are a number of reasons for the increasing demands on the home help service, one of which is the fact that, each year, an additional 6,000 people over 65 years of age enter the system. Furthermore, there is, proportionately, a greater increase in percentage terms pertaining to those over 80 years of age who are more heavily dependent.</P>
      <P>An expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme was undertaken jointly by the Departments of Health and Children and Finance in response to a Government decision in 1999. The review, which was carried out by Professor Eamon O&rsquo;Shea, National University of Ireland, Galway, was published in June 2003. The report recommended that a home-based subvention scheme be introduced to help support vulnerable older people living at home. The health strategy also recommended the introduction of a home-based subvention scheme in conjunction with other Departments, including the Department of Social and Family Affairs, as part of an integrated approach to caring for people in the home.</P>
      <P>The introduction of a home-based subvention scheme is consistent with the policy of successive Governments of maintaining older people in their own homes in dignity and independence for as long as they wish. The HSE eastern region has been piloting the Sl&aacute;n Abhaile and Home First pilot schemes to help support vulnerable older people in the community. Those living in the community and those who no longer require inpatient care in the acute hospital sector have benefited under these pilots schemes. The schemes have recently been evaluated and have proven to be very effective in supporting older people in their communities.</P><Col N="719"/>
      <P>My officials have been working closely with the national nursing home team to develop a national home care grant scheme. The proposed scheme is seen as an important initiative given that it directly supports the Department&rsquo;s long-standing policy of supporting older people. It is expected that the scheme will, when introduced, relieve the demand on private nursing homes beds and extended care beds in community hospitals and relieve pressure on the acute hospital sector. A draft of the scheme is being finalised by the HSE and will be submitted to my Department for consideration in the near future.</P>
      <P>In November 2004, the Minister for Health and Children announced additional funding of &euro;70 million to implement a ten-point action plan to improve the delivery of accident and emergency services. My officials are working closely with the HSE to ensure early implementation of these measures. The measures include the transfer of 100 high-dependency patients to suitable private nursing home care, negotiating with the private sector to meet the needs of 500 people annually for intermediate care of up to six weeks and an expansion of home care packages to support 500 additional older people at home.</P>
      <P>Funding of &euro;2 million is being provided in 2005 to establish the home care grant scheme throughout the country based on protocols approved by the Department. The effectiveness of this scheme will be monitored and it is hoped that it will help to redress the imbalance alluded to in the O&rsquo;Shea report, in which it is stated that the current system allocates resources to residential care to the detriment of alternative care programs, such as community care.</P>
      <P>It is the policy of the Government to try to maintain older people in their homes in independence for as long as possible, in accordance with their expressed wishes. The home care grant, while not representing the entire solution, is one step towards fulfilling this goal and also demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to older members of our population.</P>

The area will no longer benefit from this revenue.</P><Col N="720"/>
      <P>There have been many job losses in Carlow recently. Keenan&rsquo;s of Borris and Braun have laid off staff. Fair Oaks Food of Bagenalstown laid off 40 staff this week and I believe an engineering firm in Carlow also laid off 40 employees. Many jobs were lost in the past few weeks and this is having a knock-on effect in the Carlow area.</P>
      <P>There has been considerable growth in indigenous industry and the retail sector in Carlow in recent years. However, the danger is that we do not have a proper balance. We do not have the big multinationals we should have. A recent F&Aacute;S report indicated clearly that growth would be in the banking and pharmaceutical sectors but we have no industries in these sectors. I am sure the Minister will agree. Historically, Carlow has had a large manufacturing base. It is much larger than that of Kilkenny, for example, which has a tourism base. However, the reality is that the manufacturing industries around the country are under serious pressure and cannot compete globally. We had a very successful bicycle manufacturer in Carlow called Trek, of which the Minister may be aware. Although it had won major awards, its owners decided to close and relocate to east Germany to avail of cheaper labour and rent.</P>
      <P>We have had much bad luck in Carlow lately and it was nauseating to see the sugar factory close even though it made a profit of &euro;10 million last year. This is a conservative estimate. We need to secure a replacement industry. We have an industrial park on the outskirts of Carlow town and the IDA spent approximately &euro;11 million on its acquisition and infrastructure. I acknowledge the considerable role Carlow County Council has played in this regard not only in terms of securing one broadband connection to the industrial park, but of putting in two broadband connections. It has put the necessary infrastructure in place, yet the park has been lying idle for two and a half years. It is imperative that we attract businesses into the park regardless of whether they are pharmaceutical or commercial banking organisations.</P>
      <P>Carlow County Council, Carlow Chamber of Commerce and certain agencies in the county produced a document last week promoting the positive aspects of Carlow, of which we are all well aware. To be honest, I am blue in the face listening to all the positive attributes of Carlow. It has two third level colleges, a good supply of housing, fantastic recreational facilities and top class golf courses. It is quite near Dublin in terms of gaining access to ports and airports and it is also close to the port in Rosslare. The county has all the necessary assets. The N9 is to be upgraded and this will be a great boost to the infrastructure of the south-east region. I ask the Minister to ensure that Carlow gets its fair share of the cake and that the loss of jobs due to the closure of the sugar factory will be offset by the creation of new jobs in the area. This would obviously have a considerable knock-on effect. When creating one job we should think about the impact this will have on the creation of others. The manufacturing industry base in Carlow is very vulnerable and <Col N="721"/>while the retail sector has grown significantly in recent years it will die away too if no industry or people earning high wages come into the town, which is under competitive pressure from Kilkenny, Newbridge and Naas. It is vital to have industry and attain the right balance in the town. Unfortunately, the unemployment figures there are growing. We want to stop that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter on the Adjournment and for his kind comments on my new portfolio. The board of Greencore has made a commercial decision to cease production of sugar beet in Carlow, with Mallow remaining as the sole producer in Ireland. The company has indicated that the move is designed to ensure the survival of its business in the face of reforms to the existing EU sugar regime and the increasingly competitive nature of the company&rsquo;s market, which will severely impact on the viability of sugar production in Ireland.</P>
      <P>While primary responsibility for this area rests with the Minister for Agriculture and Food, the State agencies under the aegis of my Department will be available to assist in whatever way they can. Initially, the full services of F&Aacute;S, including retraining and upskilling, are being made available to any workers who wish to avail of them. Carlow town is a key focus for IDA Ireland in attracting foreign direct investment, in line with the Government&rsquo;s strategy of achieving balanced regional development.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, Carlow has many of the ingredients necessary for attracting overseas investment, particularly a strong third level educational provision through Carlow Institute of Technology. It is important to ensure that a supportive business environment is being developed and maintained in Carlow. This includes working closely with the third level sector to ensure that new course development is aligned with the requirements of potential overseas businesses, and maintaining a close working relationship with the local authority to ensure that world class infrastructure is available to foreign investors.</P>
      <P>The expected commencement in 2006 of the northern section of the N9 and N10 motorway-dual carriageway, which includes a bypass of Carlow, will enhance Carlow&rsquo;s attractiveness for investment. The existing base of overseas companies consists of five firms, employing 976 people according to the most recent Forf&aacute;s employment survey.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland&rsquo;s continuing commitment to Carlow is evidenced by the development of a flagship business and technology park on the Dublin road. This will further enhance the town&rsquo;s attraction for overseas investment. An investment of &euro;11.5 million has been committed to the park to date. Site development works were completed on the park in 2003 and planning permission was granted for the construction of a 17,600 sq.ft. advance office building on the park.</P>
      <P>Construction began in December 2004, with expected completion during the third quarter of 2005. IDA Ireland continues actively to market <Col N="722"/>Carlow town and the business and technology park through its network of overseas offices. Now that construction has commenced, IDA will be marketing the new building as well as the greenfield sites available on the park. IDA Ireland is also marketing Carlow for international services and high technology manufacturing sectors for which proximity to both Dublin Airport and city are key advantages.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Ireland works with companies in its portfolio to assist them grow their sales and exports and improve innovation in order that they can compete on world markets. In the past three years Enterprise Ireland approved support of over &euro;6 million and made payments of over &euro;4 million for manufacturing industry in County Carlow. This investment was in areas such as research and development, capability building and process development. As part of its regional development role Enterprise Ireland works with other agencies in the county to develop the business infrastructure.</P>
      <P>Infrastructural projects include community enterprise centres, incubation facilities in the colleges as well as supporting other technology centres. Enterprise Ireland also works closely with the institutes of technology to encourage industry-third level partnerships in the regions. Enterprise Ireland has approved &euro;1.42 million for the construction of a campus innovation centre at Carlow Institute of Technology and an additional &euro;156,000 for the management of the centre. Construction work on the centre is under way and is due to be completed by this summer. The first tenants will move into the centre in September.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Ireland approved &euro;200,000 for the construction of a 7,500 sq. ft. community enterprise centre located on O&rsquo;Brien Road in Carlow which opened in December 2004. The development of community-based enterprise centres is a crucial part of the drive to create new regional enterprise. Carlow County Enterprise Board has relocated its offices to the centre and two new enterprises have opened. An additional four units are available for letting and it is hoped that the building will be fully occupied by June 2005.</P>
      <P>Carlow County Council launched a new brochure promoting Carlow on 10 February. Enterprise Ireland was actively involved in this venture and will continue to work closely with the local authority and all other agencies in any initiatives that help to promote industry in the county.</P>
      <P>The combined efforts of the industrial development agencies, including the County Enterprise Board, together with local community interests will be able to address the needs of the Carlow area following the closure in question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister here for this Adjournment matter. It is ironic that I should raise this issue tonight because 12 or 13 years ago I had the honour of leading a march around Castleknock to get the Castleknock Community <Col N="723"/>School built. At that time we were told there was no need for the 450 capacity school that became the major community school in Castleknock.</P>
      <P>A gym was built in the school but only for 450 pupils. Following extensions the school has 1,150 pupils and 44 classes but 680 pupils, or 23 classes, cannot be accommodated for physical education because of the size of the original gym. We are all aware of the importance of physical education but while there is a great deal of lip service paid to encouraging young people to participate in sports, 50% of this school&rsquo;s students cannot participate.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science sanctioned the proposal for a second gym three or four years ago. I appeal to the Minister to recognise this and to give us some good news.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it provides me with an opportunity to outline to the Seanad the Department of Education and Science&rsquo;s overall strategy on the provision of physical education halls generally and at Castleknock Community College in particular. Modernising facilities in the country&rsquo;s 3,200 primary and 750 post-primary schools is not an easy task given the legacy of decades of under-investment in this area as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth. Nonetheless, since taking office, the Government has shown a sincere determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure that the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum including physical education activities.</P>
      <P>We have progressively increased funding for the school modernisation programme in recent years to achieve our goal with an aggregate total of almost &euro;2 billion allocated for this purpose since 1998, the largest investment programme in the history of the State. Within the modernisation programme, it is a particular policy to provide for the delivery of a broad and balanced physical education curriculum at primary and post-primary level and to support this with the provision of appropriate infrastructure.</P>
      <P>Many post-primary schools already have physical education halls, hard play areas and playing fields. In addition, many use adjacent local facilities, including public parks, playing fields and swimming pools.</P>
      <P>For those who do not have such facilities, it is the practice of the Department of Education and Science to provide a physical education hall as part of the delivery of an extension project to a school where no such facility exists. A physical education hall is also provided when a new school is being built.</P>
      <P>Last year, to coincide with the European Year of Education through Sport, 15 physical education halls at post-primary level were included <Col N="724"/>in the school building programme. These were either under construction at the time of publication or approved to proceed to tender and construction during 2004. The projected spend on these projects is almost &euro;40 million.</P>
      <P>These projects are being delivered under two programmes &mdash; the drugs task force initiative, which is jointly funded by the Department of Education and Science, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the generically-designed physical education hall initiative which was developed in the Department of Education and Science. It is intended that this approach in particular, subject to evaluation procedures, will provide the template for sports facilities in post-primary schools countrywide.</P>
      <P>The proposed physical education hall for Castleknock Community College is at stage 1 of the architectural planning process. In common with all projects, it was recently assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects, which were revised following consultation with the education partners. Progress on this project is being considered in the context of the school building programme from 2005 onwards.</P>
      <P>In this regard, the Senator will be aware that the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, recently announced the first phase of the 2005 school building programme which provided details of 122 major school building projects countrywide, which will prepare tenders and move to construction during 2005. This is the first in a series of announcements the Minister plans to make in the coming period on the schools building and modernisation programme. It will include details of schools identified as suitable for construction under public private partnerships, an expansion of the number of schools that will be invited to deliver their building projects on the basis of devolved funding, details of schools with projects approved under the 2005 summer works scheme, schools whose projects will further progress to the design process and schools that will be authorised to commence architectural planning.</P>
      <P>I assure the Senator that the Government has never underestimated the scale of the task and the level of capital funding and other resources required to rectify decades of under-investment in school infrastructure. The budget day announcement regarding multi-annual capital envelopes will enable the Department of Education and Science to adopt a multi-annual framework for the school building programme, which will allow significant and visible inroads to be made into our educational infrastructure deficits. I thank the Senator once again for raising this matter in the House.</P>
