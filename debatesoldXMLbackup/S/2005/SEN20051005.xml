	<P>I have received noticed from the Senator Henry that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to report on the progress, if any, made in implementing the recommendations of the expert group on midwifery and children&rsquo;s nursing education.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Feeney of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Finance to outline the recent changes to taxation policy regarding the taxation of expenses for members of boards of governors and VECs who sit on interview panels.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Morrissey of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to outline the implications of the recent crisis at Irish Ferries for labour force protection and relevant national and European legislation and the steps he intends to take to ensure that all workers have adequate protection from sharp labour practices, bullying and intimidation in the workplace.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Bannon of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism to clarify the position with regard to funding of genealogical projects by the Irish Genealogical Project, IGP, as funding of projects, other than its own, seems not to be within the remit of the IGP, precluding all other projects and affecting a situation which is adverse to the advancement of Irish genealogy as a whole.</P><Col N="154"/>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Dooley of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline a timescale for upgrading the ambulance service at Scarriff, County Clare, and the establishment of an ambulance service at Shannon, County Clare.</P>

    <Title>Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I rise to express my sympathy to the wife and daughters and immediate family of the late Liam Burke, who was both a Deputy on seven occasions and who served in this House twice, once by appointment and once by election. I did not know him well but I knew him around the Houses and always found him to be very urbane, charming and nice with all the qualities one would like to see in a public representative. In particular, he was held in great affection in Cork. I am aware that the Cathaoirleach knew him although I am not sure whether he was here during Liam Burke&rsquo;s time in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Liam Burke had a great quality of being able to bounce back. He lost his seat on two separate occasions but got back in on subsequent occasions. Cork holds him in great honour and affection for all his work over the years. We always talk about public service, how important it is and how wonderful it is to have it when we stand up here. Liam Burke had public service in bucketfuls. It was what he dealt with all the time, both for and with his constituents. We cannot all be Cork people but if we could, we would want <Col N="155"/>to be like the late Liam Burke. He was a gentleman. I recall a comment in a newspaper that he was what was described as &ldquo;a gent&rdquo;. It is an old-fashioned term but it suited the man, his occupation and how he did his business. He was very urbane and always well turned out and groomed &mdash; things one would like to see in a public representative.</P>
      <P>I saw his wife Noreen on television this morning when she was in the Distinguished Visitors Gallery in the D&aacute;il and his two sisters and I believe they were very impressed with the kind things people were saying. Of course, one can say kind things and not mean them but in Liam Burke&rsquo;s case he was everything that everybody said he was. Cork will long remember him.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kenny had a very funny joke about a young chap who was leaving Cork to work in Dublin. It was a long tale but the gist of it was that they could not all be Cork people but that the person in question had to keep his mouth shut about that. He was better than any of them. There is no doubt that the sense of proprietorship that Cork people feel about their own is immense. On behalf of my party, I offer my sympathy to Senator Brian Hayes and Fine Gael and to all of the parties here but most of all to Liam&rsquo;s wife Noreen and their two daughters. Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo the words of sympathy for the Burke family so eloquently expressed by the Leader. Like many of my colleagues in this group, I was in B&eacute;al na mBl&aacute;th in August attending the annual General Collins commemoration when we heard of the untimely passing of Liam Burke. While many of us knew for some months that he was unwell, the news came as a great shock to the party supporters assembled on that Sunday.</P>
      <P>Liam Burke was a gentleman. He was involved in politics for over 50 years, serving on Cork City Council and in both Houses of the Oireachtas, as a distinguished public servant. It is a great pity that after his retirement from the other House in 2002, and local politics in 2004, he did not have a longer time to enjoy being with his family and friends in his beloved Cork.</P>
      <P>I remember him with great fondness. When I lost my seat in 2002 the first letter of support I received came from Liam Burke and I recognised the sincerity of that gesture. He did not have great ambition for himself in politics but had it for our party. He was one of those elder figures within a party who was utterly loyal and committed, with a devout sense of belonging to a political grouping and defending it against all comers, a characteristic that is probably less prominent in Irish politics today than 20 or 30 years ago.</P>
      <P>He also defended a marginal seat in the difficult working class constituency of Cork North <Col N="156"/>Central for many years. Famously, he won by a handful of votes in 1992 when his was the only additional seat Fine Gael won in the whole country &mdash; a significant testament to his work rate in that constituency.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In 1979, his victory along with that of another then member of our party effectively brought about the end of Jack Lynch as leader of Fianna F&aacute;il and Taoiseach. Liam Burke was there in the momentous times caused by the by-elections in 1979. The highlight of his political career came in 1984 when he was Lord Mayor of Cork. He loved Cork city and the corporation and his time as Lord Mayor.</P>
      <P>On behalf of our group I offer our sincere sympathy to his wife Noreen, his daughters, Catherine and Emma, and the extended Burke family. He will be greatly missed in Fine Gael, in Cork, and among people who follow dog racing and coursing and so on. I do not understand these activities but am told they are great sport.</P>
      <P>I was in County Clare on my holidays and met a large group of people in Liscannor who spoke fondly of Liam Burke. They described him as &ldquo;a great dog man&rdquo;&mdash; someone who enjoyed the dogs and had great success at the sport. We send our deepest sympathy to his family and remember him fondly as a figure who, in his way and time, gave great service to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Those of us in the Independent group wish to be associated with the words of sympathy expressed on the death of Liam Burke.</P>
      <P>We are somewhat at a loss in that none of us served with him in this House. We met him over the years coming and going in the House and found him to be a warm and generous man. He was a very open man, easy to talk to, always ready to offer a view and to chat. As Senator Brian Hayes said he represented a particular political generation. Not having worked with him I cannot add to what has been said but offer his wife and family our sincere condolences. We record our appreciation and acknowledgement of his long years &mdash; Senator Brian Hayes says half a century &mdash; of diligent public service and representation on behalf of his city and country. Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh s&eacute;. We also offer our condolences to his party colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Liam Burke was my local Deputy for the best part of 20 years. I clashed with him once or twice in my earlier, perhaps excessively self-righteous, career in politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>No change there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>We became friends as the years went on, since it was impossible, once one knew Liam Burke, not to like him. He was immensely popular with members of my own party on Cork City Council, and also with all other members. Known <Col N="157"/>affectionately as &ldquo;Burkie&rdquo;, in his later years he had moved beyond party conflict, although he was very able in it, and was regarded almost as an institution in Cork politics, both locally and in its national expression. It is quite tragic that someone who always had such a zest for life and a sparkling sense of humour sharp enough to provoke the likes of me in my earlier days should pass on. It took me a while to realise that he was getting much more fun out of it than I and enjoying the provocations.</P>
      <P>Liam Burke was a good, hard worker and a remarkable political survivor. For the one or two occasions on which he lost, there were others when he survived in ways that can only be described as miraculous. His capacity to extract 12th or 13th transfers across the entire political spectrum is perhaps the strongest evidence of his genuine likeability. As a mere blow-in to Cork who spent 30 years there, I feel that he will be missed, since people had a sense of him as one of those who defined the city and its local political culture.</P>
      <P>On my own behalf and that of my party, I sympathise with Liam&rsquo;s family and Fine Gael. He is genuinely someone whose absence will be noticed, and he will be missed in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I join in the tributes to the late Liam Burke. I understand that, apart from the attributes rightly ascribed to him this afternoon, he was called &ldquo;the silver fox&rdquo;. I assume that it had more to do with his appearance than his political activity, although I am sure that there are various judgments on the matter. In my experience, he was unfailingly courteous. He has been described as a gentleman, and I never heard anyone speak ill of him, another unusual circumstance in politics. He was extremely loyal to his native Cork, and he looked after the interests of its people very effectively over the period of which we have spoken. He survived in an extremely difficult constituency, and it was remarkable that he served only one short term here in the Seanad, being in the D&aacute;il for a long time.</P>
      <P>He was very much involved in sport, breeding greyhounds as well as racing them. Perhaps that is another Cork feature, since the sport in question may be more popular in the south than elsewhere. He served his constituency and country extremely well, and I sympathise with his wife, daughters, extended family, colleagues in Fine Gael and constituents in Cork. May he rest in peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan"><NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is with a measure of sadness that I join in the many tributes paid to the memory of the late Liam Burke and extend my sympathy to his wife, daughters and family. His virtues have been well extolled today but the word &ldquo;humility&rdquo; has not been used. Like all Cork <Col N="158"/>people, Liam was a humble person. He was also joyous and personable, a people person. While he served the Fine Gael Party well, he served the people of Cork better, irrespective of their politics. Like most Corkonians, he worked for the benefit of his people, with no regard to the various changes in constituency boundaries. My sympathy goes to Mrs. Burke, Liam&rsquo;s daughters and his wider family. Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to pay tribute to the late Liam Burke, a neighbour of mine in Cork. As a fellow Corkonian, I extend my sympathy to Noreen and her children and to Liam&rsquo;s brothers and sisters. Liam had a special personality and an aura which people loved. His common touch distinguished him and enabled him to connect and communicate with people. His love of sports is well known, including the role he played in developing dog racing in Cork.</P>
      <P>I have another connection with Liam&rsquo;s family in that his wife Noreen, formerly Miss Casey, was one of my teachers in primary school. It was with great sadness that I learned of Liam&rsquo;s death following a prolonged illness. He will be well remembered in Cork for the great service he gave its people for so many decades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for the opportunity to speak. I join with previous speakers in acknowledging the great contribution to public life in Cork of the late Liam Burke. As Senator Ryan said, those of us from Cork knew him as &ldquo;Burkie&rdquo;. I got to know him in 1999 when I was elected to Cork City Council. Liam was very much the father figure on the council and often offered a word of advice across the floor. I was glad when he spoke before me on a particular issue because it was always possible to take a lead from him. He was a tipster when it came to dog racing and also a political tipster. At times he confused those roles so that a person might be uncertain as to what he or she was backing. He enjoyed such mischievousness.</P>
      <P>My family is friendly with the Burkes, and Liam&rsquo;s wife Noreen in particular, who also taught me in primary school at Eglantine. I should discuss this with Senator Terry because it is possible we attended school together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>There may be a school reunion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I extend my condolences to Liam&rsquo;s family and endorse the kind sentiments expressed about him. In this case they are all true. He was parochial in his thinking, promoted Cork and crossed party divides. During those long nights discussing council budgets and so on, Liam always worked behind the scenes and he carried that dedication through his political career. As Senator Brian Hayes said, his loyalty to his party <Col N="159"/>was the mark of his political career. Furthermore, his loyalty to his people extended not only to those he represented but to Cork city in its entirety. He took pride in this, in both his business and political lives. Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I join in the tributes to the late Liam Burke. I got to know him in 1977 when we were both elected to the Seanad. We often met on the journey to Dublin and developed a friendship which proved long lasting. We had many a joke and in a hostelry in Cork on the evening of his funeral a joke on the subject of potatoes, or spuds as they were called, was recalled.</P>
      <P>Liam and I had other interests in common including horseracing and greyhound racing, although I did not get involved in the greyhound pup syndicate which Liam Burke organised. Whether in Government or Opposition he was a flamboyant and colourful character who made people comfortable, especially with that disarming smile. His long service in the Houses of the Oireachtas reflected his popularity and his work for the people of Cork.</P>
      <P>I extend my sincere sympathy to his wife Noreen and daughters, Catherine and Emma, on their sad loss.</P>

	<P>The Order of Business today is Nos. 1 and 19, motion No. 23 with No. 1, statements on early childhood education (resumed) to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude no later than 5 p.m. Senators have eight minutes each, with the Minister to be called upon to reply no later than five minutes before the conclusion of the statements; and No. 19, motion No. 23, to be taken from 5 p.m. until 7 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader of the House will agree that for many years domestic violence and the appalling levels of violence inflicted on women in our society were taboo subjects constantly swept under the carpet. Last year out of 20,000 calls made to Women&rsquo;s Aid, a dedicated helpline women can ring to report incidences of abuse and receive counselling and advice, 7,000 were missed because of a shortfall in funding of &euro;70,000. In this day and age it is a scandal that a dedicated helpline cannot do its important work because of the lack of such a paltry sum of money. When that is set against the &euro;70 million the Government has given to consultants to roll out a botched payroll system in the Department of Health and Children we see how misplaced are our priorities. We need a debate on domestic <Col N="160"/>violence as soon as possible to establish exactly what support the Government is prepared to give to such agencies to help them do their important work.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader if she will provide time in next week&rsquo;s Order of Business to debate No. 19, motion No. 21, in the name of my colleague Senator Coghlan, on the groceries order, given the heated and contentious debate that occurred last night in the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should not believe everything he reads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It is high time the Government set out its exact position. I understand the abolitionists are in a significant minority on the issue. We need a debate and a substantive motion on the Order Paper. Senator Coghlan has such a motion and a proposal for the way forward and I encourage the Government to provide time next week for such a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>In spring last year Senator Ross and I put down a motion in the House concerning auctioneers and auctioneering and the need for regulation. It was accepted by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Michael McDowell, who acted on it by setting up a review committee which has now reported. We have not seen the report yet but we are aware he will propose a regulatory system for auctioneers. This initiative came from the House, was developed and has borne fruit. I look forward to the next stage.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The Irish Ferries dispute has raised many fundamental issues and I am concerned that we are not seeing the wood for the trees in the matter. Industrial relations only work if everybody takes part in the process; if this does not happen we are in trouble. The last piece of legislation relating to this which was passed and which made the process somewhat voluntary, putting people on their honour, can be ignored. The Labour Court should be given the authority and right to compel people to attend and subpoena people, whether these people represent unions or companies. The people can argue the case when there is so much at stake.</P>
      <P>The main issue with the Irish Ferries dispute is that if a similar practice takes off in the economy, we will witness an erosion of standards of living and work that have been won and developed through hard work at all levels, from management to workers and all those in between. Greater wealth was created in this country, it was spread out and standards of living were improved. Even people in this House benefitted from benchmarking and other schemes that came from such a process. The work is about to be usurped. If this happens, every part of the econ<Col N="161"/>omy will be affected and we will start going backwards. It will be a case of &ldquo;back to the future&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Last year I raised the issue of the flags of convenience under which some ships operate in our ports. In many cases, these ships are no more than institutionalised sweat shops where normal health and safety practices are completely ignored or left unimplemented. This issue does not help us, and the Irish Ferries dispute should be debated and discussed, leading to certain definite conclusions from Government. I would welcome a debate on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader if she has made any progress on the issue of aircraft allowed to land in the country that do not produce manifests of cargo and crew. Under what circumstances are these aircraft permitted?</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole. I read this week about a group of Polish workers who complained six months ago that they were being underpaid by their employer, yet the labour inspectorate in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has not yet begun investigating the complaint. This is because the inspectorate does not have sufficient staff. If that case takes more than six months to investigate, how long will it take to draft legislation and how can we believe that it will be enforced? The first thing that is required is a significant and multilingual expansion in the labour inspectorate.</P>
      <P>A controversy arose this week on the issue of who defines ethos in our hospitals. When equality legislation was passing through the Houses, many endeavoured to produce a definition of ethos so that people would know what the term meant. It appears to me, on the basis of two separate experiences, that ethos means what people want it to mean. If, on one hand, one ventures into the area of human sexuality, one receives a metaphorical strike from a crozier delivered by people who have the most plausible reasons. If, on the other hand, one tries to set up a hostel for homeless alcoholics, as I experienced in Cork recently, one can collide with Catholic schools, whose official ethos is to champion the cause of the homeless &mdash; the marginalised, according to religious orders. These schools led and sustained a campaign against the provision of the hostel in the vicinity of the school. One can conclude that with regard to official Roman Catholicism, sex is important and the poor do not count.</P>

	<P>Next April, the Dublin Port tunnel will hopefully be opened. This tunnel has cost much money, but the number of cars using it will possibly be severely limited because of excessive proposed toll costs. More important, the tunnel will not take all the trucks coming to and going from this country. For the benefit of using the tunnel, the haulage industry will pay some &euro;20 million to National Toll Roads to cross <Col N="162"/>the M50 back and forth on an annual basis. Of that &euro;20 million approximately &euro;10 million will go to the Government and &euro;10 million to NTR. Some may have a problem with the size of the tunnel.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>At a time when the M50 is being upgraded and the M50 consortium will take in an extra &euro;20 million, what is the Department of Transport doing in regard to traffic congestion and the height of vehicles entering and exiting the country?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Are they not telling the Senator?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I support what Senator Ryan said about beefing up the inspectorate division. There has been a dramatic expansion as a result of Polish, Lithuanian, Latvian and many other nationalities coming to Ireland. In every rural town there are workers from those communities. While everybody has focused on the position of Irish Ferries because of the numbers involved how can we ensure there is not mass exploitation throughout the country of many of these workers who have language difficulties? I agree with the Senator that if they are beefing up the inspectorate there are people with different language skills who can communicate with the new communities.</P>
      <P>In regard to the ESB and the expansion on the east coast of urban communities radiating out into the countryside I am appalled at the standing charge on the ESB bill, of which I was not aware. There is a standing charge of &euro;94 for those in rural areas and a standing charge of &euro;52 for those in urban communities. It has been discovered with the mushrooming of populations in rural areas that many had been paying the rural charge. The ESB has said it will take action at the end of next year with a view to rectifying the bill, whether rural or urban. To wait until then could be deemed as sharp practice. It should act now to rectify the position. The public service obligation on a bill which imposes an extra charge on all consumers is an aberration in this day and age. The energy regulator has said this is anti-competi<Col N="163"/>tive. It is up to the Minister to remove that public service obligation and reduce ESB bills for consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week the House debated an issue on which all sides came together and agreed a common motion. It was an interesting exercise. During the course of the debate I referred to the issue of sectarianism in Northern Ireland. Since then there has been a number of reports, not least the one in the newspapers with regard to the blessing of a graveyard in north Antrim where there have been threats to dig up bodies. That is unacceptable. I ask the Leader, with her colleague leaders in the other parties, to bring forward a composite motion on the issue of sectarianism and leadership there to ensure the matter is tackled. I am glad some of the Unionists have spoken out against that issue. It has implications for the peace process and leads to severe polarisation of communities. It is essential that the House be heard with one voice on such an important issue which is happening only 100 miles from here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I call for a debate on the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report which was published last week. I am not doing so to knock the Government in any sense because, while it provides a great deal of material with which the Opposition can criticise the Government, I do not really believe that it is a matter of great concern.</P>
      <P>Successive Governments have presided over huge waste in the public sector on an ongoing basis. It would be useful for the House to discuss transport, to which Senator Morrissey referred. While this is not an issue of waste, it does concern auditors having missed a &euro;2 million item. It is a matter of public concern that the auditors, KPMG, failed to see &mdash; as it was their duty to see and certify as being true &mdash; that &euro;2 million due to the Government from National Toll Roads was not paid over. Not only was it missed and miscomputed extraordinarily by the company, but it was also missed and miscomputed by the National Roads Authority and the Department of Transport. I will not be more specific than that, but I wonder how many other items of this sort are being missed by auditors who are paid specifically not to miss these items. How that particular item was missed is beyond explanation.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred to auctioneers but it is not yet time for the House to congratulate itself on having achieved anything in this regard. Nonetheless, a commission was established and I thank the Leader and the Minister for their help in that matter. I ask the Leader to make representations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform so that when legislation is introduced to attack this last refuge of the cowboys who call themselves professionals, it should be introduced <Col N="164"/>in this House because the input has come from the Seanad and not the Lower House.</P>

	<P>Last week, we discussed the situation at Irish Ferries on the Order of Business. Our industrial relations machinery and the institution of social partnership have once again vindicated themselves with both sides attending the Labour Court. Senator Finucane referred to working conditions for immigrants and the labour market generally, which will clearly be important subjects for the forthcoming social partnership negotiations. The Government should not be afraid to set and enforce standards, whether they relate to employment or the height of lorries. We simply cannot allow the market to decide all these maters for us, otherwise it would have undesirable social consequences.</P>

	<P>As we know, there is much apathy towards pension planning. In light of the recent remarks on this subject by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, to the effect that we cannot stand around and do nothing, may I ask the Leader if it is the Government&rsquo;s intention to introduce legislation on pensions, particularly mandatory pensions? Does the Leader still favour a splurge in spending the proceeds of the special savings incentive accounts?</P>

	<P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate as soon as possible with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to discuss water and sewerage schemes with specific emphasis on the serviced land initiative. As many Senators are aware progress in advancing certain schemes has been very slow, which is causing severe disadvantage to some villages and towns resulting in their being unable to grow and develop along the lines set out in county development plans. It is also causing a problem in planning. A demand exists in rural areas for housing. On the one hand people are finding it very difficult to get planning for one-off rural houses while at the same time no housing is available in the villages and towns because many of the schemes have not advanced as quickly as they should have. I would like to Minister to outline to us his plans and those of his Department on the matter.</P>

	<P>This morning&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> reported that four months after a HSE decision to organise hospital care around ten regional networks, the new CEO has now decided to organise hospital care around four regional networks. This will have major implications for hospitals throughout the country. I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on this very important matter as soon as possible. It will not be acceptable for the Minister to come back and say this is a matter for the HSE. It is not just a matter for the HSE.</P>

	<P>This is a matter of great importance for communities throughout the country and for the management of the health service. Warnings were given when we debated the legislation to establish the Health Service Executive. At what point is there any democratic accountability or input into major decisions being made? I ask the Leader to respond on the matter as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I also ask the Leader to arrange a debate at an appropriate time on the Government&rsquo;s policy on foreign adoption. This follows a report that the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, stated last week that the era of foreign adoptions is coming to an end. Obviously this would be a matter of major importance to many people throughout the country. It is a major policy issue and one that I hope the Leader would raise.</P>
      <P>Last week I asked for a debate on the national treatment purchase fund following the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General. I ask the Leader to respond to me on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek a debate on the role of Ministers and the two horrible words the Government hates &mdash; accountability and responsibility. I asked for this debate last year and it is more <Col N="166"/>pressing now than ever especially considering the fiasco with the computer system for health services. The new tactic is to blame the HSE for everything and, by implication, to blame the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s predecessor. Ministers must realise that while perks go with the job, so does responsibility.</P>
      <P>I also call for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children to come to the House. She has been in her current role for a year now and it is time we carried out a full review of all the broken and unfulfilled promises in that time.</P>

	<P>I support the remarks of Senator Brian Hayes regarding Women&rsquo;s Aid, which has expressed complete dismay at the lack of funding for its centre. It is no longer able to answer a large percentage of telephone calls made by people who are generally in a pretty desperate situation. Having reached the point of having to ring Women&rsquo;s Aid to seek help they are unable to have their call answered due to a shortage of funding. Last year I made the same point but the position has not changed for the charity.</P>
      <P>With regard to An Post, I wish to express serious concern about the delay in getting letters or parcels delivered. Today I received a letter which was posted on 21 September. It took ten working days it to get from Blanchardstown to Kildare Street. I had a similar experience when a map posted to me in Kildare Street from Fingal County Council in Swords took three weeks to arrive. While awaiting its arrival I had to request a second map, which arrived within time. How can business survive with this type of service from An Post? If we cannot get our post delivered on time, that is a serious issue in terms of our competitiveness and our economy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure my colleagues will join me in congratulating the Garda on the seizure of cocaine at Dublin Airport, the arrest of two women and in particular the location of a crack <Col N="167"/>cocaine factory in a flat in Phibsboro, which is apparently run by what was described as a west African gang. The gang has a specific new formula for creating this drug which makes it much more easily marketable. This is a very dangerous, debilitating and addictive drug which is behind much of the violence we currently see in the city. Arguments can be made on both sides regarding the legalisation of cannabis, for example, but crack cocaine is a quite different, dangerous drug. We should congratulate the Garda on its successful operation.</P>
      <P>I was interested in the question raised by my colleague, Senator Ryan, about ethos, and ethical committees. I thought he was going to raise something which should be discussed in this House if it is appropriate, namely the situation whereby, perhaps as a result of the fact that the religious institutions were exempted from the equality laws, the Mater Hospital, by means of its ethical committee, inhibits women from taking part in drug trials for lung cancer treatment because of the requirement that they not become pregnant. The advice given by the drug companies that women should ensure they do not become pregnant lists artificial contraception as one of the prevention options, which conflicts with the ethos of the Catholic Church.</P>
      <P>It is questionable that an institution which receives considerable public funds should stop treatment of this kind or such drug trials. A professor in St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital has described the decision as sectarian.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not the only computer-illiterate person in the general vicinity. We have seen the scandal of the computer system in the Department of Health and Children, but we previously had a debate on the enormous expenditure of money on electronic voting machines, a system which proved inadequate. One of the matters we teased out in this House at the time was that the people designing those machines on the continent of Europe, in Holland as I understand, had not been required to test them against a particular Irish model.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>In this latest instance, I understand that an instruction was given that the programme was not to be tested against the idiosyncrasies of the Irish system. That is bizarre. What are those responsible doing? A huge waste of money is involved and I hope there will be a discussion on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Meara regarding the rumblings from the Health Service Executive and the possible implications for the provision of hospital services around the country if they are to be administered through four regional bases rather than through ten such bases. As Members of the Oireachtas we should be given an opportunity to let our views on that matter be known. I am aware that Senators on the Government side of the House also have strong views on this issue.</P>
      <P>I also agree with my colleague Senator Finucane, who noted the latest rip-off mentioned this morning on national radio. The ESB has different charges for connections in rural and urban areas, and some people in newer urban areas are facing rural charges. The Minister responsible could usefully attend the House for a discussion on the matter.</P>
      <P>Before the recess, I spoke about the National Educational Psychological Service. The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin, should come to the House to discuss the lack of psychologists in the service. There are serious problems and a serious divergence in the levels of service being provided throughout the country. For example, in County Kerry there is 100% cover for primary school students but in Kilkenny, where I live, there is only 18% cover. As a former teacher, the Leader will agree that the assessment and early recognition of psychological or educational difficulties in students is vital. The Minister should be invited to the House to discuss this as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a well known fact that home helps are not getting their proper entitlements. They are the least well recognised group of carers in the community. It is unfair that they have been neglected for so long. Will the Leader invite the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children to the House to explain why the Health Service Executive has failed to give home helps their entitlements under the partnership agreement? This is scandalous, particularly when one sees the waste of resources that is occurring. This waste has been ongoing for years, undetected by the Government. In the eight years this Government has been in office, it has done nothing to improve the status of people working as home helps. That warrants an immediate debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I also congratulate the Dublin north central drugs unit on conducting the raid on the crack cocaine factory in Phibsboro. Last Monday, there were three drugs seizures, one at Dublin Airport, one in Clondalkin and one in Dublin. I cannot agree with Senator Norris that there are good reasons for legalising cannabis.

	<P>It is a gateway drug to crack cocaine. I agree with Senator Norris about the many social problems which crack cocaine has caused, as we have seen in the United States and elsewhere. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should be invited to the House to outline what resources he needs and what he intends to do to ensure that crack cocaine does not take hold in our cities and towns. If it does, whatever has been achieved in the Celtic tiger economy will be undermined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>To date this year, 289 people have been killed on our roads. Last weekend was one of the darkest we have experienced in this regard. There is nothing to indicate that either the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Departments are capable of doing anything worthwhile to reduce the number of deaths on the roads. Take the example of the speed cameras. Often there is only one such camera functioning at a given time in the country. The penalty points were supposed to be a solution but they are being thrown out in the courts. We were also told that these services would be privatised but nothing has been done about it. If this rate of slaughter continues, there will be a greater number of people killed on the roads this year than in any previous year. I ask that an appropriate Minister, whether it be the Minister for Transport or the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, come to the House to indicate what proposals he has to reduce the number of deaths on our roads.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Brian Hayes raised the matter of domestic violence and Women&rsquo;s Aid. I accept there is a need for a debate on the issue. I was at the press conference and heard the speech by the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Fahey. Senator Mary White was also present. The Minister of State told Women&rsquo;s Aid that it was getting its increase. I heard him say this, so I am not relaying something told to me by others. The chairperson of Women&rsquo;s Aid thanked the Minister of State.</P>
      <P>The Senator is correct that the organisation had not received an increase for a long time. However, as the debate has developed, I have been struck by how quickly a misconception can arise about something even though the Minister of State spoke publicly to the 40 or 50 people who were present. He said that the organisation was being granted an increase in funding. I met Deputy Fahey afterwards and asked if he had the money. He said he had and that Women&rsquo;s Aid was very deserving because it has not had an increase in funding for years. There is a need for a debate on the wider issue because the rate of <Col N="170"/>domestic violence continues to rise. Women&rsquo;s Aid published a very useful booklet on the incidence and nature of domestic violence and it was very telling, although the facts were put very simply. I will endeavour to arrange to have a debate on the matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Brian Hayes also raised Item No. 19, motion No. 21 regarding the groceries order, about which a misconception has arisen. An excellent debate involving 21 speakers occurred at the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party meeting last night. The meeting began at 5.30 p.m. and continued until approximately 8 p.m. If the Senators had heard the lucid and clear arguments they would have been overawed.</P>

      <P>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole raised the matter of auctioneers. I have noticed that every time Senator Ross is on the radio discussing the matter, he says that both Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole and himself raised it in this House, which they did. I think Senator Ross is under orders to enjoin himself with Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole. However, Senator Ross did raise the matter previously and on that basis, the Minister &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker><Col N="171"/>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot resist the temptation. Based on the motion laid before this House, the Minister undertook to set up a commission. Senator Ross asked about the commission on a daily basis and has requested that the legislation be introduced in this House. I would be glad to facilitate that for Senator Ross and Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole, who is not here at present.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole raised the matter of Irish Ferries and argued that the Labour Court should have powers of compellability to ensure that parties attend its hearings. He also raised the matter of flags of convenience.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan asked about the flights that do not carry manifests and I put that query to the Department of Transport. I had hoped for a reply today but expect to be able to answer the Senator tomorrow. He also said there is a need for more inspectors for the labour inspectorate. The Senator also spoke about the ethos in hospitals. He raised the matter of the school, whose ethos is caring for the disadvantaged, marching against the provision of a hospital for alcoholics</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It was a hostel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>My apologies, a hostel. I agree with the Senator on that point and believe that the argument relating to the ethos of the Mater Hospital is nonsensical. If women need a cancer drug, which may help them, surely it is a very small requirement that it not be given to them during a period of pregnancy, which is where the contraceptive drug would come into play. Apparently the hospital is not allowing the proposed cancer drug trial to take place. I cannot understand this. The hospital is in receipt of large amounts of State money for refurbishments and rebuilding. It is a nonsensical situation in this day and age. I believe the women are also being asked to promise not to engage in sex, which is equally nonsensical.</P>
      <P>Senator Tom Morrissey raised concerns regarding charges for the Dublin Port tunnel. He pointed out that 4.65 m will be the maximum height of the tunnel and traffic congestion will worsen. His points are fair but as he is the transport spokesman for his party, I am sure he will raise his concerns with his party leader, who is at the Cabinet table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>We would raise such concerns if we could attend the meetings of the Joint Committee on Transport but they always coincide with the Order of Business in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Morrissey&rsquo;s points are very fair, nonetheless. Senator Michael Finucane asked that the labour inspectorate be strengthened, particularly in the area of language skills for inspectors who are dealing with immigrants. He also raised the matter of ESB standing <Col N="172"/>charges, which are &euro;94 for those living in rural areas and &euro;52 for those in urban areas. Many people in rural housing estates are being charged the rural rate as the electricity service has been extended. That appears to be a rip-off and I will investigate it further.</P>
      <P>Senator Jim Walsh raised the issue of sectarianism in Northern Ireland. We also have sectarianism in the Republic of Ireland. The Senator wants an all-party motion to be signed &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no comparison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree, but we have had examples of sectarianism here. I will seek agreement with the leaders on the all-party motion.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross called for a debate on the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and made specific reference to the fact that auditors twice overlooked &euro;2 million in the NRA accounts. He also called for the legislation on auctioneers to be introduced in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</P>
      <P>Senator Mansergh referred to the social partnership negotiations and the fact that it is up to the Government to enforce standards in various ways, with which I agree. Senator Coghlan raised the matter of pension planning. I will have a good time when I retire, whatever about him. If he wants to sit in a corner and count his pension, that is fair enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader is well covered. I am thinking about poor people who need pension provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Dooley would like to discuss the serviced land initiative with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government because it is fine to have guidelines for planning, but if there are no services for houses, planning permission is redundant.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Meara is concerned about the plans of the HSE to organise hospital care around a smaller number of centres. She also raised the matter of foreign adoptions, about which I will make inquiries. I will invite the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to the House. There are some countries, such as Romania, which have closed down their foreign adoption systems because they are applying for entry to the EU and have moved on in this regard. It is an issue worthy of debate.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Meara also raised concerns about the national treatment purchase fund, which is a mystery beyond all mysteries. The Senator cannot understand it, nor can I. If people do not get into hospital on their first try, they will gain admission on their second attempt if they go through the national treatment purchase fund. I have met many people who have availed of the fund and <Col N="173"/>they are delighted with the speed with which they were treated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Meara is seeking an explanation of the fund. Senator Browne raised the matter of the role of the Government in the debate on health. People in glass houses should not throw stones. People have different ways of expressing themselves &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not intend to listen to the Senator talking about the Taoiseach in that fashion. Senator Terry also raised the matter of Women&rsquo;s Aid and I hope she heard my earlier comments on the matter. I know that she has always been very supportive of that organisation. She also raised the matter of delays in An Post deliveries. I live 100 yards from the sorting office but only get one delivery per day at 3.10 p.m. or 3.15 p.m., so the tale from the Senator does not shock me at all. I shall make further inquiries on the matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris congratulated the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on its crack cocaine haul. He raised concerns about the Mater Hospital&rsquo;s ethos committee and about electronic voting, which is another mystery. Senator John Paul Phelan raised hospital services, the ESB and the National Educational Psychological Service. He wants the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, to explain to this House why the latter service is operating at 100% capacity in Kerry and only 18% in Kilkenny.</P>
      <P>Senator Bannon argued that home helps are not getting proper recognition, which is a good topic for debate. I agree with the Senator that there are many people who can stay in their homes only because they have home help. Senator Feighan referred to crack cocaine but does not agree with legalising cannabis. Senator Ulick Burke noted that 289 people have been killed on the roads this year and wants to know what has happened to the various road safety initiatives which were announced but not implemented. I will invite the relevant Minister at the Department of Transport to debate the matter in this House.</P>

	<P>I have almost concluded my contribution but will make a number of final points. It is worth noting that Ireland has its largest population since 1871 and a significant increase <Col N="174"/>in the number of children under the age of six years, who now account for nearly 10% of the population. The number of women who work outside their homes has increased by 60% in recent years. Logically, we must start planning to match child care facilities to the increased number of women at work. If women are leaving their homes and going back into the workforce, we must provide more and far better child care places.</P>
      <P>While we have witnessed a large increase in such places, the costs involved are exorbitant, which has a significant implication for grandparents. They now find themselves taking very proactive roles in their grandchildren&rsquo;s rearing as, invariably, parents cannot afford to put their children into cr&egrave;ches and will instead drop them off at grandparents&rsquo; houses early in the mornings. The Government should examine the bold possibility of paying the salaries of all the people involved in early childhood education. Mr.<?oasys _jy?>Donogh O&rsquo;Malley took the bold step of introducing free secondary school education, which was radical in its time. We have free primary school education and teachers therein are paid in this way. We also have free third level education. It makes sense for the State to become involved at pre-school level, which has been the case in France for a number of years. The advantage of this over other schemes is that it would eliminate costs and ensure that parents who used cr&egrave;che facilities would receive a direct bonus from it.</P>
      <P>I am wary of tax breaks, exemptions and credits, which are an accountant&rsquo;s dream. I am unsure that the consumer will ultimately benefit from them. The obvious way that we, as legislators, can eliminate the costs of child care is to examine the possibility of paying the salaries of the people providing early childhood education. It would allow the State to control the quality of early childhood education on offer. While there may be some great facilities available I have heard stories of certain cr&egrave;ches that are perhaps lacking in good standards. By becoming involved, the State could regulate and inspect the relevant cr&egrave;ches and early pre-schools.</P>
      <P>It is time to move on. In his speech on 28 September, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, referred to a White Paper but that was fudging the issue. We are behind schedule and must take radical steps. If the State becomes involved in the payment of salaries, it will make a profound difference for people who are paying, on average, &euro;800 per month on child care, which is the cost of a mortgage. It is having a significant impact on couples who should be enjoying themselves, as they are now burdened by a mortgage on a house and what is effectively a mortgage on child care.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not agree with the State paying masses of salaries, pension rights and so forth for teachers or others who work in the area of pre-school education as it would impose a very large burden on the State. I accept many of the Senator&rsquo;s points, including those he made last week, as they were relevant. However, I also accept that masses of tax breaks based on the general written and oral evidence required for such matters would not be sound. As Senator Browne said, accountants will be busy reckoning one&rsquo;s tax responsibilities but may be the only people to get anything out of the exercise.</P>
      <P>This is a complex business. People believe child care is easy but it is not. Many reports have been published in the area, so-called special advisers have become involved and we have been told that the big brains in different Departments are discussing how to deal with the matter. I do not know whether a body will have overall responsibility for the area.</P>
      <P>I have mixed views on this issue. I agree that more women are needed in the workforce and that more and more are going into it but I do not like approaching the matter from an economic point of view. Something is wrong with a debate centred on a woman being seeing as an economic unit who must go out and produce.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I am wary whenever history and social attitudes ask women to work. During the wars, women were needed to work in the munitions factories and elsewhere but as soon as the wars ended they were told to go back home. I would be wary of seeing women as economic ciphers with that purpose alone even though people are needed in the workforce. Senators Ross and O&rsquo;Toole have two worthy motions on the Order Paper relating to this issue, including an excellent motion containing five points.</P>
      <P>When I come to work in the morning, I constantly pass what I would describe as harassed mothers, infants and little children who are barely able to trot along while holding onto their mothers and looking perplexed. The mothers are pulling and the children are crying and out of sorts even though I am sure that, while I do not know anything about them, they are going to very good cr&egrave;ches. I do not know what time they woke up to go to cr&egrave;ches at 8 a.m. It must be very unsettling for mothers. It must also be unsettling for young people and babies who have been hauled out of cots and beds, washed, scrubbed and had their nappies changed, to be given little dinner baskets and sent off to cr&egrave;ches for the day.</P>
      <P>I read about a major survey carried out by Ms Penelope Leach, the famous child guru, and reported in <i>The Observer</i> last weekend. I do not have a copy but have sent for one. Ms Leach has changed her mind on this issue approximately ten <Col N="176"/>times over the course of her life, saying mothers should be outside the home, mothers should be inside the home and the same for fathers. Her latest opinion, to which I do not subscribe, is that babies do best when mothers are around. One may take this as a general principle because mothers will spoil infants and do their every bidding. However, I do not like how this practically heaps blame on mothers who have gone to work, which is not the full answer, although I accept that whoever conducts studies on what to do about child care understands that it is a highly complex issue. No job is as complex as parenting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Infants and young children are very complex human beings going through major changes in their lives. People are hauling themselves out of their homes every morning and back every evening, making themselves collapse with tiredness, running out to get a Chinese ready-to-eat dinner or take-away, drinking a large glass of red wine, going to bed and starting the whole rigmarole the next morning. Something must happen or the situation will give in. I am well aware that the economic well-being of the country depends on women and men being encouraged to work but all Governments to date have failed in this area. No one should bring out a half-baked proposal on child care as great danger lies in that approach.</P>
      <P>There are many caveats due to the complexity of the issue. Tax breaks were the means at one time. When I was a member of the Government, we deliberately decided on a policy of large increases in the then children&rsquo;s allowance, now known as child benefit. There was an enormous increase in that which was supposed to keep everyone quiescent but of course it did not because the economy outstripped it very quickly. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, now has some notions that effectively amount to means testing child benefit, which will not work. I could be mistaken and perhaps what he said did not amount to this. I do not think this is a good idea because the mother receives child benefit, which is intended for the child and helps a household a great deal. Means testing child benefit is certainly not the way forward. Giving more money to children under five may be the social and humane way forward. I can see the correctness of this approach. Who would begin means testing if more money was to be given to people who are in need rather than the well off?</P>
      <P>It was proposed to means test children&rsquo;s allowance on one occasion. Former Taoiseach and Minister for Finance, Albert Reynolds, introduced the proposal which was stamped down within approximately a day. It disappeared as an issue because all the women of Ireland opposed <Col N="177"/>the proposal. Nuala Fennell, a former Fine Gael Deputy &mdash; I think she was a former Senator &mdash; said &ldquo;hands off children&rsquo;s allowance&rdquo;. We could all repeat this call.</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Today it is called children&rsquo;s benefit instead of children&rsquo;s allowance, which is an old-fashioned term. Is this correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>Child benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The escalation in this allowance was very welcome when it happened. I do not know what the Government-appointed gurus are coming up with or what great solutions they will provide. I can certainly prophesise here that whatever solution they come up with, there will be an aggrieved portion of the electorate which will not like it. The mother or father who elects to stay at home must be looked after. Under the terms of the Constitution, he or she must be looked after because it makes mention of those who work in the home. There will be very fertile ground for legal cases if these people are not attended to in the mix of solutions to child care.</P>
      <P>Part of me feels that a child who is cared for in his or her own home is better off for it. I do not mean it so much in terms of the love of a father or mother, although this is very important. It has to do with a child being in his or her own surroundings &mdash; being in a room, kitchen, garden or cot that he or she knows. If I can digress into my personal experience, when I started teaching and had young children, I taught for two hours a day until my children started primary school. My mother, who had been a teacher, advised me against putting my children into a cr&egrave;che, which were just beginning to be order of the day. She told me to get a housekeeper and that my children would be better off in their own home. I often thought it was good advice; children are better off in their own familiar surroundings. This is why one sees perplexity and puzzlement on children&rsquo;s faces as they are being dragged out of cars and into cr&egrave;ches. What is going on in their minds when this is happening? Are they thinking &ldquo;where am I going today, what is going to happen and when will I be picked up?&rdquo;. I wish those who are formulating this policy good luck. Theirs is a difficult task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Government for giving us the chance to debate this very important issue. Members will have received a letter informing them about the Oireachtas cr&egrave;che in the last day or two. I think everybody has received this letter. Whereas it is fairly short on detail, there are one or two very stark statistics therein. I suppose the one that is most telling and strikes all Members who look at it as most punishing is the cost of <Col N="178"/>putting a child or baby into a cr&egrave;che in the Oireachtas for a month. The figures quoted here are &euro;728 per month for babies, &euro;687 for toddlers and &euro;630 for pre-Montessori pupils. These are 2005 prices, which will go up by 5% in 2006, which means they will be approximately &euro;765 per month per child.</P>
      <P>If one looks at these figures and examines them in the context of someone who works in this House, one will find that a staggering proportion of his or her income would be spent on cr&egrave;ches if he or she were inclined or forced to do so. We are talking about a payment for one child of possibly &euro;9,000 per year and the figure is doubled to &euro;18,000 after tax for someone with two children. The starting salaries of people in this House at the lower levels are approximately &euro;21,000 or &euro;22,000. Somebody who works in the Houses of the Oireachtas with two children and a salary of &euro;22,000 who wishes to use the Oireachtas cr&egrave;che on a full-time basis will be paying his or her entire income after tax and a few other payments on simply looking after his or her children.</P>
      <P>These statistics are not economically unrealistic but they are socially unacceptable. It means that we are offering facilities in this House to people who patently will not be able to afford them. It is a bit of a nonsense that the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas is doing this. The cr&egrave;che facilities we are offering will only be offered to the better off individuals who work here. I suppose it is a stark and telling example of what the rest of the nation must suffer. What it also tells us is that only the very well off can afford to pay for their children to get this pre-school education or care. It is quite staggering. I had lunch today with a woman who told me she had three children in cr&egrave;ches. This costs her &euro;2,500 per month after tax, which amounts to &euro;30,000 per year after tax. I presume this woman is a high earner. Presumably before tax, she must earn at least &euro;50,000. A total of &euro;50,000 of her income goes to seeing that her children are simply looked after, kept alive for the day and possibly cherished, nourished and cared for in a particularly laudable way. This state of affairs is absurd. We are now asking those we are welcoming into the workforce to create this great prosperity to hand over the bulk of it to see their children are kept safe on a daily basis. This is a benefit but it is one for which they are paying far too high a price.</P>
      <P>Women who go to work have the choice to go to work, as do men. Many women do so due to economic necessity, many of them do it because they want to and many of them do it because they are extraordinarily well-educated, well-qualified and stimulating and would not flourish in the home environment without that sort of external stimulation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not right that we should say they should pay such an enormous proportion of what they earn to see their children are looked after. As the Minister of State knows, the budget is approaching on 7 December. I hope that Fianna F&aacute;il will indicate then that an imaginative package on child care will come to fruition. Senator White deserves credit for the lobbying she has done within Fianna F&aacute;il on this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Her lobbying has been determined and particularly effective. There should not be some half-baked package in the form of a compromise between Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats. We must grapple with this problem on both fronts, that of the unfortunate person paying so much to go to work in terms of time, traffic and other factors. It must be grappled with equally vigorously by recognising the extraordinary role of people who decide not to go to work.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Many women &mdash; this mostly but not altogether concerns women &mdash; who have earned, and have the capacity to earn, a great deal have decided to make the sacrifice of not going to work and staying at home. They are pulled two ways on this issue but in the end have no option because of the money. On the one hand, they are made to feel guilty if they do not go out to work which should not be the case. They earn less and are made to feel less adequate members of society.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, they feel maybe they should stay at home and look after their children because it is better for the children. That is an honourable choice and one we should recognise. If we are to recognise the role played, and financial sacrifices made, by those who go out to work and put their children into cr&egrave;ches, we must equally recognise that those who stay at home are also making a sacrifice.</P>
      <P>The Celtic tiger is not all happiness, apple pie and ice cream. Economic prosperity has brought with it the most extraordinary social problems. Professor John FitzGerald yesterday made an interesting contribution to a SIPTU conference in Cork. He said that while affordable child care is already a big problem, it will get much worse. Among the reasons he cited for this are that many more women than men are progressing to third level education and employers will find that women account for a significantly larger share of the supply of skilled labour than men. Employers will have to attract and hold skilled women and men, many of whom have young children. Meanwhile, the supply of child care will likely decrease.</P>
      <P>One can see where this leads. Traditionally, Professor FitzGerald said, child care was provided by women with less than leaving certificate education. Those numbers will fall as more <Col N="180"/>women remain in education causing the price of child care to rise as providers will have higher potential earnings in other sectors due to their higher level of education. He added that while the largest group of people in society today comprises people in their 20s, in a decade it will be those in their 30s. This will have serious implications for society and employment because those people will have children and more children will need child care.</P>
      <P>While there are good returns to be had from discos and nightclubs, in a decade those who are up late dancing now will be up late walking the floor with their small children. The number of young parents will rise in the coming decade. They will be better educated than the previous generation and expect good careers for both partners.</P>
      <P>We must provide for this serious problem which will soon become an acute crisis. It has not reached that level yet but people who are working, particularly women, are stretched to the limits financially and in terms of their time.</P>
      <P>As to what the Government can do, I have only one minute left&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has less than one minute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I will restrict myself to broad principles. The package must be imaginative and cover money, allowances and tax credits. The important point, however, is that women and men have realistic options. At the moment they are almost prisoners of a system which requires them to go to work and pay all their money into a cr&egrave;che if they have children. They pay such a substantial amount that they have very little spending money left over.</P>
      <P>Alternatively they make a decision to stay at home leaving a large quantity of wasted skilled labour in the economy in the form of women who feel obliged to stay at home because it is not worth their while exploiting the labour in which the State has invested so much through their education. There is merit in a system which gives them options and compels employers to give them options to work part-time which Senator White proposes in her Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not suggest compelling them but negotiating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator suggests inducements for employers to allow women to work part-time so that they, the children and the economy will benefit. I plead with the Minister of State to give the Minister for Finance the message that this House wants him to produce an imaginative, comprehensive package that will solve this problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome my friend and colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, to the House. I also welcome the opportunity for this House to add its voice to the evolving child care policy, which is a relatively recent phenomenon due to the growth in the economy over the past seven or eight years.</P>
      <P>I must declare a small interest in this matter as I am chairman of the County Leitrim child care committee and have been involved in the child care area since it became an issue in the mid-1990s. At that time, as a member of Leitrim County Council, I was also on the County Leitrim partnership board which set up a child care committee to address the growing need for child care among women who increasingly sought to work outside the home.</P>
      <P>When the Government set up the statutory committees I moved into the child care committee and have been chairman for several years. I come to this debate with a certain amount of baggage. I am pleased that more voices have been added to those early pioneering voices calling for a comprehensive policy on child care.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge and compliment the Government on the initiatives it took under the equal opportunities programme. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has come in for a certain amount of vilification primarily because when one talks about child care the last place one would think the policy reposes is the Department that deals with law and order. This is due to the equality dimension of the provision of funding, initially from the EU and subsequently from the Exchequer. After all, the word &ldquo;equality&rdquo; features in the Department&rsquo;s title.</P>
      <P>Several decisions taken since then have added to the confusion in this area and there is a need for clarification and a more comprehensive approach to the provision of child care. I acknowledge too the outstanding work of my friend and colleague, Senator Mary White, in this area. It is important that someone focus on this, and who better than a person with a mix of expertise from politics and business who is more than capable of addressing the real needs? I wish her well in her initiatives.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, was recently quoted in the national media &mdash; in remarks that he repeated at a party meeting &mdash; as saying that one of the immediate solutions to the increasing problem of providing child care services, since the Government had reached its target number of places, was to put more money into facilities. I was particularly struck that the statement came from the Minister for Finance. I was so impressed by it that I had to seek clarification in case he was being misquoted, but I am pleased to say that he endorsed everything that had been reported. He genuinely believes that <Col N="182"/>the way forward is to provide more resources and increase places.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I might give Senators some evidence, anecdotal rather than statistical, of the pressures faced by those currently providing child care facilities across the country. I add the caveat that there is a media perception that child care is about urban areas and big cities such as Dublin. However, that is not true. I live in Drumshanbo, County Leitrim, which has a catchment area of perhaps 1,500 people. In 2002, following capital grant aid from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the then Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, opened a new, state-of-the-art, all-day child care facility in the town. One part of the building provides child care facilities all day for babies through to pre-school age, as well as post-school facilities, so it probably covers the entire gamut. I believe it is now a condition of much of the Department&rsquo;s funding that one provides full-day care.</P>
      <P>On the bottom level, there is an all-day special needs child care facility. Currently, 105 people access mainstream child care facilities, with a waiting list of 40 more, despite it being a small rural area. That gives some indication of the growth in demand for child care. Without labouring the point, I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statements and look forward to the next budget, when I hope the Government will introduce a child care package.</P>
      <P>I mentioned that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform had evolved along the way. During that evolutionary period, two other Departments were involved on the periphery. One was the Department of Social and Family Affairs, which was removed from the equation some two or three years ago. The Department of Education and Science, which had an even more peripheral role, is now totally uninvolved. I understand that interdepartmental discussions are ongoing, particularly between the child care section of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Education and Science, and I hope they bear fruit.</P>
      <P>I will not go over ground already covered regarding securing more resources, an issue that will no doubt be raised again. I wish to focus on the child&rsquo;s early development. I am somewhat concerned that Government policy has been directed almost exclusively towards using women &mdash; I say &ldquo;using&rdquo; in the widest possible sense &mdash; to contribute to economic growth. In other words, one gets women out of the home and into the workforce, providing child care all day if possible, and even after school. Effectively, the State provides a child-minding service so that we can get women working. That means that we will fill all those places and be rich and prosperous, living happily ever after.</P>
      <P>I hope that, within that policy framework, which I broadly support, the necessity of examin<Col N="183"/>ing the needs of children themselves is recognised. In many child care facilities, there is an inadequate focus on the development of the child&rsquo;s intellectual and other skills. For most of those involved in training at FETAC II and FETAC III level, it is a matter of child-minding rather than wider development. Some kind of publicly stated programme should be introduced by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Education and Science whereby all child care facilities, whether State or private, should provide a specific model to assist the development of the child&rsquo;s skills, particularly for those in pre-school, since it is they who attend in the morning and early afternoon. I would like to hear of developments in that area.</P>
      <P>My final point relates once again to a rural issue. The child care committees of County Leitrim and County Sligo completed research in conjunction with County Leitrim Partnership identifying lack of transport for after-school services as a major barrier to women returning to the labour force. There are currently 21 after-school services in County Leitrim. Six of those have small-scale transport projects supported through own funds, fees and minor grants. Should funding be made available for those to continue, with the remainder provided to develop transport projects, the number of parents, particularly women, able to return to work or training would increase greatly, as they would be provided with a continuous child care service extending from school, starting at 9 a.m., to after-school projects, closing at 6.30 p.m. That request was transmitted to Irish Rural Link, which agreed to support the county child care committees in the north west in putting the issue of lack of transport for after-school services on the national agenda.</P>
      <P>It is sometimes forgotten from a big-city perspective that there are large areas of the country where public transport is poor, inadequate or, in some instances, non-existent. If one is a woman who would like to get out of the home for an hour or two each day and has no child-minding facility or alternative means of having one&rsquo;s children looked after, and the nearest job opportunity is ten or 20 miles away &mdash; a reality for many &mdash; it is incumbent on the Government to examine rural transport as an integrated part of overall national child care policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Rourke referred to the debate over whether it is better for children to have their mother at home or working. Saying that it is good for the child to have the mother at home can be taken as a criticism of working mothers. The debate should not be about all or nothing. As a State, we should try to promote and facilitate a flexible approach so that a person can do both at the same time, for example, working part-time and spending the remainder of the day <Col N="184"/>at home. Parents can share the burdens in different ways, and people can dip in and out at various stages of their lives as it suits them. That is the way forward regarding the measures we implement.</P>
      <P>I will relate my own experience. I have a child aged 13 months whom my partner minds in the home. There are many reasons for that, and choice is only one. Certain factors coincided and it became our preference too. It would be great for my little girl to have a day here and there in a cr&egrave;che where she would have contact with other children. It is good that she has the chance to be at home with one of her parents, and that is obviously beneficial for the parents too. However, children also benefit from contact with their peers. If parents in the home had access to child care facilities which could be used for one day or even one morning per week, that would be a positive development.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Ross, I welcome the provision of a cr&egrave;che for Members and staff of Leinster House. However, I am worried about the cost, both from my own point of view and even more so for those who earn less than me. I do not need to use a cr&egrave;che every day but it would be helpful to avail of such a facility once a week. I hope the new cr&egrave;che will provide that type of flexibility. I have brought my little girl, Pippa, to Leinster House on several occasions and it is difficult to know where to take her. Bringing her to the office may mean others are disturbed. Is it appropriate to take her to the Members&rsquo; bar? That is usually where we have found ourselves. I hope the cr&egrave;che will provide flexible services for Members and staff, of both genders, who have children.</P>
      <P>As part of the Government&rsquo;s plan to promote breastfeeding, one of the issues it raises is the need for employers to support breastfeeding mothers. Leinster House would be a good place to start with this initiative as there is limited support in this regard, although this is obviously not an intentional policy. The Government must take positive action to help breastfeeding mothers and parents in general. Parents who wish to bottle-feed their babies should also be afforded suitable accommodation in Leinster House.</P>
      <P>The October edition of the INTO&rsquo;s <i>In Touch</i> magazine includes two items relevant to this debate. One outlines the findings of a survey of members on child care issues. This indicates that three out of four respondents use the services of carers who take their children into their homes. Policy in this area must do much more to support childminders, who are a major element of any comprehensive child care solution. Much of their work is done in the black market. One of the measures proposed by the Labour Party is that people who look after children in the home should be allowed to earn a certain amount tax free. This would regularise the position of child<Col N="185"/>minders and promote better pay. A person looking after his or her grandchild could earn some money without having to worry about tax issues, registration and so on.</P>
      <P>The survey&rsquo;s findings on parents&rsquo; main demands are interesting. Some 87% selected as very important the provision of better parental leave, including paid parental leave, 86% demanded tax relief for child care costs and 81% called for an extension of paid maternity and paternity leave. In addition, 66% of respondents would like incremental credit for years spent at home in full-time child care, 63% called for greater ease of job sharing and the same percentage demanded increased child benefit. This indicates the importance of flexibility and that people should have the opportunity to spend time with their children, whether they wish to work full-time or part-time in the home. This flexibility is particularly important to working parents. It is not a question of whether parents should be encouraged to look after their children at home or to avail of child care options that allow them to return to work. The objective should be to promote flexible arrangements and establish the financial and other measures which allow parents to have that choice.</P>
      <P>Another article more relevant to today&rsquo;s debate is an interview with Professor Christine Pascal and Dr. Tony Bertram, authors of a book entitled <i>Effective Early Learning &mdash; Case Studies in Improvement</i>. The article includes some important points and I recommend it to Members. An issue it highlights, and one that has been raised by Members today, is that it is often forgotten that early childhood education is a societal issue. It is not an issue relevant only to women but one which all societies must address because one of the measures of civilisation is the &ldquo;level of care and stimulation that it puts into the raising of children&rdquo;. The interviewees outline five key policy issues in regard to child care, including child poverty, welfare to work issues, introducing children to the &ldquo;healthy life agenda&rdquo;, social exclusion and underachievement within certain social groups.</P>
      <P>Another issue highlighted in this article is the importance of the quality of child care services and the training of service providers. The Government has largely been concerned with providing tax breaks for the providers of child care facilities. While this is welcome, we must begin to focus on the issue of quality of care, as we have begun to do in regard to nursing homes. The provision of early childhood education is not just about building and staffing facilities. A successful programme depends on the provision of quality education which deals with the five policy issues I have outlined. The importance of ensuring staff are highly trained is something the Government must address. Another important element highlighted in the article is the need to <Col N="186"/>integrate services in order to meet the needs of parents and children in a holistic way, through such measures as family support, community provision and so on.</P>
      <P>One way to implement significant improvements in early childhood education, in those situations where the infrastructure is in place and there is adequate provision for staff training, is through the use of underused school buildings. The Minister for Education and Science recently announced the building of a number of schools through public private partnerships. I hope this will not detract from the agenda that schools must be used for the community and not as a means of generating private profit. Schools offer an ideal means of providing early childhood education on a community basis.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan. I have spent the last 18 months researching child care issues. During this time, I organised four public meetings in the Dublin South-East constituency and a conference in the Berkeley Court Hotel which was attended by the Minister of State at which he set forth his belief that this is an issue that must be addressed urgently by the Government. I visited cr&egrave;ches in the mornings and met hundreds of parents and cr&egrave;che owners.</P>
      <P>As a result of this research, I compiled a document entitled A New Approach to Child Care which most Members have seen. The Government must implement a bold and comprehensive plan for child care in the next two budgets. Piecemeal initiatives are insufficient. My document contains some nine propositions but I take this opportunity to focus on one particular aspect. I ask the Minister of State not to be offended when I observe that 95% of those who will draw up budget proposals on child care in coming years will be men. Many will be grandfathers who have never had to mind a child in their lives and are not familiar with the pressure of going to work to pay for a child or having to bring a child to a cr&egrave;che. Men&rsquo;s DNA seems to dictate that it is a woman&rsquo;s responsibility to deal with the child care aspect of family life.</P>
      <P>Article 41 of the Constitution concerns the family. It purports to be a family-friendly Constitution but we are not a family friendly country. The Proclamation following the insurrection of 1916 states we must cherish all our children equally but we do not. I speak from a social rather than an economic point of view. The State takes responsibility for the education of every child from the age of five, from national school through secondary education to free third level education. However, the gap begins the minute the child is born. The children of parents with money go to cr&egrave;ches. I have visited many cr&egrave;ches and witnessed the extraordinary intellectual stimulation and socialisation children learn from <Col N="187"/>the age of six months. Research does not prove that the best education is received when a mother stays at home minding a child because some mothers are not suited to being at home all day every day. They are better off at work as they would otherwise be bored. A parent must have the choice to stay at home or go to work.</P>
      <P>Every child born in the State should get an equal chance. When I visited private cr&egrave;ches I told the parents they were lucky they could afford a cr&egrave;che. Some parents cannot even afford to send their children to a community cr&egrave;che so they get no pre-school education. The parents cannot study themselves because no cr&egrave;che is available where they live. A child born to an economically deprived family does not get a fair chance and the Constitution of 1937 is not family friendly in 2005.</P>
      <P>During my research I came across the case of Jessica Starmer who was a British Airways pilot. She had just had a baby and wanted stay at home for two years but was told that as she was a pilot she was different and had to come back to work. In April 2003 the UK brought in legislation called flexible working which allowed an employee, man or woman, with a child under six or a disabled child under 18 to negotiate flexible working hours with his or her employer. That could involve working a shorter day, fewer annual hours, or taking two years leave. The employer has a statutory responsibility to negotiate. I have been an employee and an employer and it is the way of the future from both points of view. Naturally, such conditions cannot apply to some professions, such as doctors, nurses and teachers but with 21st century technology such as broadband and conference calls there is no need for many people to be in the workplace from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Before the industrial revolution people worked in their homes and women contributed as much as men, for example in artisan industries.</P>
      <P>We need a Bill for flexible working arrangements. This week I brought a Bill in draft form, proposition no. 3 in this document, to my fellow Senators Kitt and Dooley and other Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues and they unanimously supported it. I am waiting for a response from the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, to whom I gave the draft Bill last night. I jumped the gun as I should have given it to him earlier but I am an entrepreneur and have to get going when a job is to be done. We in Fianna F&aacute;il aim to be visionaries for the parents of the country by introducing a Private Members&rsquo; Bill in the Seanad to allow the negotiation of shorter working days.</P>
      <P>There are many jobs where, if a parent has to take a child home at 3.30 p.m., they are not allowed to remain at home. Everybody in the House knows that many employees do not have to be in their job from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and after-school care is costly. The benefits to an employer <Col N="188"/>of flexible working include loyalty from staff, high morale and motivation and less absenteeism. This is a 21st century Bill in the new electronic age. It is necessary to deal with child care as a package. I want Ireland to be a family-friendly country where every child has an equal chance. Senator Terry, with whom I have been discussing this matter for a year and a half, is on the same wavelength as me.</P>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats propose introducing tax relief for people minding children at home. I have not heard anything as ridiculous in my life as the suggestion that we should open up that hornets&rsquo; nest. The complications attached to it are so obvious I do not need to spell them out.</P>
      <P>I said when we were in Cavan that Fianna F&aacute;il can be as visionary as Donogh O&rsquo;Malley in 1967 when he introduced free secondary school education. The issue is work-life balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>Life is not as simple as it was, nor is society. When I was a young parent I was a victim of the marriage ban, as was Senator White. When I married I had to give up my job and I was tied to the house. Circumstances thankfully changed quite quickly after that, but I had made up my mind, or perhaps I was conditioned into believing, that the best way forward for my family and I was for me to stay at home. I did so for several years until my youngest child was in primary school.</P>
      <P>Life was simple but it was not rosy. It was difficult to survive on one salary then. We took one holiday a year if we were very lucky and we had one car. Staying at home did not make life easy, but I believe now that it was a good time and a good opportunity made available to me. This is not to say anything about the mother who does not stay at home, about whom Senator Tuffy was concerned. She mentioned that Senator O&rsquo;Rourke stated that the woman who stays at home is doing a better job of caring for her children than the mother who goes out to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>She did not state it like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Rourke did not intend that inference and neither do I. I am glad I had the opportunity to stay at home. Many young couples today do not have that opportunity, and I believe this to be the important point.</P>
      <P>Many people discussing this issue mention it in the context of having to work and the growth in the economy. People place much importance in that. To turn this on its head I wish to put the child at the centre of the debate rather than the economy or the workplace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>The question of what is best for the child should be asked. We should work around <Col N="189"/>that concept and provide the best possible care for that child. If that means helping the parents, or one of the parents, to remain at home, we should do so. If it means that the parents have to work, we should look after the parents to enable them to deliver what is best for the child.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11-?>
      <P>I may be attacked for this statement, but I believe the child is best looked after at home for at least the first year of its life. The Government should act on this, providing such a choice for parents. If a mother or father, as in Senator<?oasys _jy?>Tuffy&rsquo;s case, chooses to stay at home, it should be facilitated. First, however, we should look after the mother who has given birth to the child. We should extend the maternity leave and, following from this, the parental leave. The parental leave should be made paid leave. The provision of parental leave up until now is only available for well-off parents. The less well-off cannot afford to take unpaid parental leave. I would like to see the Government bring forward a package that would allow a parent to stay at home for the first year of a child&rsquo;s life. Such a provision may not come about in the next budget, as it would have to be brought in incrementally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator looking for these measures to be brought in now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>The package may be introduced on a phased basis but it must be presented. The child should be placed at the centre of the debate. We do not value parenting as much as we did, yet parenting is the most important job that any person will do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>There should be much more debate on parenting. Young families should be told that there is a 30 or 40-year lifespan in the workplace, and children growing up will take up perhaps ten years of this. Both parents and children will eventually be grateful if more of the parents&rsquo; time is given to the child&rsquo;s early development, but the Government must support them in doing so. We should support the parents by giving them the choice in the first year to stay at home and by changing work practices, as Senator White has suggested.</P>
      <P>We should address the balance between work and life. I cannot understand how families survive when a child is put into a cr&egrave;che in Navan at the early stages of the morning with, for example, parents going to work in Dublin and arriving back at 7 o&rsquo;clock in the evening to collect the child. That is not right. If that is the type of society we have developed, it is not a good society. Children should be put first, and both children and their parents should be facilitated in order to ensure proper development at least until the stage of entering school. More time will be available to parents at that stage. Much more debate is needed on this issue.</P><Col N="190"/>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I take up the point that Senator Terry made on giving parents a choice and having the child at the centre of any child care proposals. That is one of the more important issues being discussed here. Although we do not need a debate on whether parents should work, we have all seen the statistics on the increase in female participation in the labour force.</P>
      <P>An emphasis existed in the past on investing in schools on the basis that children attended school aged four years or over. Through the years successive Governments neglected the issue of child care from birth to the age of four. There were strong arguments against having investment in child care, with some of the reasons emanating from educational quarters. As a member of the INTO, I am aware that the organisation was concerned that such a proposal could result in an early education system that might be carried out by non-professionals. We should not be concerned about that now as we are discussing an overall child care package that is not entirely about education at an early age.</P>
      <P>It is clear that Ireland has changed, with a large increase in population since 1994, and children under the age of six years comprising approximately 10% of the population. There has also been an increase in the number of women working outside the home, from 483,000 in 1995 to 771,000 in 2004, an increase of 60%. Public investment in child care is less than 0.2% of GDP, which reflects poorly to the European average of 0.5% of GDP. Every Senator has made that point.</P>
      <P>Much investment is needed in community child care. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform allocates grants of more than &euro;1 million to some community child care centres yet many do not have a site and have to buy one. If a new school was being built in any part of Ireland the money to buy the site would be provided. That is an issue about which many forget. While many are refurbishing buildings the cost is enormous.</P>
      <P>The issue of transport must be taken into account. In regard to disability Senator Mooney said that children with special needs may have to travel long distances in mini-buses around rural <Col N="191"/>Ireland. One does not want the same happening with child care. We have seen on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; the strain and stress on young couples who have to travel long distances to and from work and avail of child care before going to work.</P>
      <P>An issue that arose when the matter was discussed in Cavan was the black economy. Unfortunately that is used in regard to a granny, granddad, aunt or uncle looking after children. It would be foolish to stop this as families make their own arrangements. It is important to be clear about this as it goes back to choice. I have heard some experts say that people will have to be retrained in certain skills. I would not like to say that to some grannies who think they know much more about child care than I or my generation. Perhaps that issue should be left aside.</P>
      <P>In the past the Government increased child benefit which was useful. As a result one could say to people working outside the home that the increased child benefit could go towards paying for child care. For that reason it is a complex area.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the rural social scheme about which not many are aware. It was introduced with rural people and those involved in agriculture in mind. I see great benefits for that scheme in the area of child care and looking after the elderly. Sometimes we think a rural social scheme is about building walls and looking after the environment. There are innovative schemes for child care as well as the work normally associated with community employment-F&Aacute;S schemes.</P>
      <P Just="Left"><?oasys _dc20-?>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, for what he has done. We are all familiar with the private child care areas. However on the issue of community child care, even though more than &euro;1 million has been allocated by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the amount will have to be increased to take into account refurbishment of buildings, lack of a site and lack of money to buy a site. This will have to be done carefully in certain areas to avoid children travelling long distances to child care centres.</P>
    </Speaker><?oasys _dc0-?>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment Senator White on the work she has done. I do not have a problem with means testing so long as the bar is set high enough. A lady spoke on the radio today who has two autistic children. When her husband got promotion all her supports were taken away. She argued her case. Eventually her supports were reduced from &euro;180 to &euro;36. That is not support. The point made on the Government side that we are no longer quite as family supportive as a country as we think is well made.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the OECD report. It makes the point that early childhood education is a vital foundation in terms of physical development, brain growth, motor skills, language, intelligence, personality formation and so on. This is the key point. It also makes another significant point that the section of society that benefits most from this intervention is the poorest. Yet that is the area of <Col N="192"/>least take up because of less support and less assistance.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The female drop-out rate from the employment system after the birth of a first or second child is high. A point was made earlier about the unaffordability for many of the cr&egrave;che in Leinster House. The OECD report points out that typically, a second earner in a couple family with two young children in care with earnings of two-thirds of average salary has no net return from work after child care costs. That is mad. It shows Senator White is correct when she says we have to do something really imaginative. We have also an unfortunate situation in Ireland where we have the ambition of giving women the choice of going out into the work place. The ideal is to have the two parents in the home. My father died when I was six. My mother brought me up and did a pretty good job. Certainly my childhood was enjoyable. It was difficult for her. The ideal is that two parents would bring up the child equally but that is not the real world.</P>
      <P>In Ireland only 45% of lone mothers are in employment whereas the rate is 81% in Austria, 76% in France and 84% in Japan. Here again we are at the bottom of the table. The Cathaoirleach has indicated I do not have much time. The OECD report includes in this the Barcelona objectives and spells them out clearly and how they should be reached and what needs to be done. It is along the lines of what Senator White has suggested. The section of society who would benefit most are the poorest and most vulnerable.</P>

It is timely that the Seanad should debate this subject when there is an intensive national debate in progress on the issue. Senator White referred to the children of the nation. The children of the nation in the 1916 Proclamation included adults as well as infants.</P>

	<P>I am aware of that.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="193"/>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Early childhood education in Ireland has developed significantly since the forum on early childhood met in 1998. We have had the White Paper with its emphasis on promoting quality in which various actions were contained. In the special needs sector there are 14 pre-school classes for children with autism located throughout the country. Ten stand-alone autism facilities that provide an applied behavioural analysis model of response to children with autism cater for a number of children of pre-school age. The Department of Education and Science has also sanctioned the establishment of a pre-school for six children with hearing impairment on a pilot basis. Much has been achieved in the area of early childhood education in Ireland since the publication of the White Paper. As many Senators have said, early childhood education is intrinsically linked to early childhood care. It is impossible to speak about one without the other.</P>
      <P>This is not the first time we have had this big national debate. We had a similar debate a few years ago and it led to a number of Government decisions. The massive investment by the Government in the Early Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 is testimony to the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the child care issue. Funding for this programme has increased from the original amount of &euro;318 million set in the national development plan to &euro;499.3 million, following the increased capital provision made in budget 2005.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The funding approved to date will, when fully drawn down, lead to the creation of some 39,900 additional centre-based child care places. This will be in excess of the original target set at the start of the programme of 28,000 places and the revised target of 31,000 set at the mid-term review. That is a tribute to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform which has administered this project. It was the first, stand-alone, national project in this area. Many of our European Union partners have been developing their child care infrastructure since the end of the Second World War, while we only started this programme in 2000. We have obtained value for money from the programme whose performance has outstripped our expectations. We have been constrained in the programme because of the EU contribution which meant the programme had to be focused exclusively on issues concerning participation in the work force. That led to certain omissions in the programme but in future we will have to fund the programme ourselves exclusively from our own resources. We can address some of the issues and omissions in the programmes in that context.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11-?>
      <P>Senator Tuffy was concerned that quality and putting children first was not at the heart of our endeavours. However, under this programme quality is as important an issue as quantity. In fact, substantial investment has been made in <Col N="194"/>enhancing the quality of the places provided. The investment made in county child care committees is targeted not just at identifying local needs but also at enhancing the quality concerned, which is vital.</P>
      <P>Senator Terry and Senator White made eloquent pleas on the question of parental leave. For the past few months, I have been involved in the preparation of the high-level working group&rsquo;s document, which has been submitted to the Government. How we should structure parental leave is one of the options the Government is examining. From the many documents that have been produced recently, the evidence is clear that it is essential for a child to be with its mother initially and with either parent after a period in the first year. We must promote and secure that situation. Changes in our labour and employment practices to secure that objective are worthy of support. It is not something that can be done overnight but if we set ourselves a target objective we can work towards it. I was glad to hear Senators mentioning that point which is an important issue in the debate.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris referred to another important issue which is that investment in early childhood education is vital. All the research indicates that intervention at that early stage in the educational sphere is essential. I am using the term &ldquo;education&rdquo; not just in the formal scholastic or academic sense, but also educationally in the sense that it must be inextricably linked to the care of such children. There is no doubt that investment in this area is vital.</P>
      <P>The Government will have to examine how it can deepen participation in early childhood courses. Many families are already paying for such courses and teachers point to the noticeable advantage such children have when they participate in the formal school system. Our junior and senior infants&rsquo; curriculum in primary school is not a formal educational system any more.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to study the arrangements in Finland, for example, which has among the best scholastic results for 15 year olds in the world. They only just pip us on literacy, but are well ahead of us on mathematics. Primary education does not commence in Finland until what we would call first class in our primary schools. Finland has a state-provided kindergarten service for all children aged two to six. In a sense, of course, our State does provide that service for children aged four and a half to six. However, we must examine how we can deepen and improve our responses at pre-primary school level, to ensure a greater take-up by children of the essential courses they require at that stage. I was delighted to hear Senator Norris raising that issue, which the Government will address and which will have a big impact on dealing with educational disadvantage.</P>
      <P>Child benefit has increased by 272% since 1997. It has more than tripled from &euro;38.10 in 1997 to &euro;141.60 today. Despite that increase, there are currently problems of affordability and accessi<Col N="195"/>bility in the system. That is one of the reasons we are having this national debate. The question of affordability concerns a wide range of issues, including the welfare system, child benefit, income tax and tax breaks. I do not want to anticipate whatever the Government may decide in that respect, but we must recognise that however we adjust or taxation or welfare arrangements &mdash; and I am not saying there may not be merit in them &mdash; the key question is how we can increase the supply of quality child care provision. Simply introducing tax reliefs or welfare changes without increasing this supply, will not address the problem of affordability because if one has a restricted supply of quality child care no adjustments to the tax code will enhance it. The measures we adopt&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>Double the amount of places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;must be carefully targeted to increase the amount of places. Questions of affordability may well have to be addressed and in that context the Government can examine various options.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for pre-school regulations rests with me. The regulations have been in place since 1996 and marked the first time that statutory controls were applied to the sector. A review is almost complete and I will consider how the regulations have worked. There is a danger that if one regulated too far in this area, one may further restrict supply. On the other hand, essential child protection concerns have to be addressed. There is a difficult balance to be struck in that respect.</P>
      <P>I note that one political interest has suggested that we should amend the regulations to provide that a person who minds up to five children at home should be exempt from them. That proposal is not as simple as it seems, however, because the current regulations permit up to three children, other than the family&rsquo;s children, to be minded in the home. That can already permit quite a substantial number of children to be minded in the home. To permit up to five children, who are not members of the family, would increase the size of this domestic-exempt cr&egrave;che substantially, so that proposal will have to be examined carefully. Having said that, the public debate is welcome and valuable ideas are being put forward which will be examined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am conscious of the time, a Chathaoirligh, so I will draw my comments to a close. The co-ordination of services has been examined by the high-level working group, which is chaired by the National Children&rsquo;s Office under my direction. I have taken a close personal interest in the preparation of the document, which has now been submitted to the Govern<Col N="196"/>ment. There is a range of policy options in the document. First, we must make the link between education and care, and the benefits to be gained by individual children, as well as by communities and society in general. Second, we must increase the supply of appropriate early childhood education and care settings by developing capacity in the system. Third, we have to include measures which make services more affordable and, fourth, we must ensure quality is a design feature in the child care system. The high-level group has pulled these strands together and presented options for the development of a broad strategic plan for the future. That is the right way to proceed and I believe it will yield the results we all wish to see.</P>
      <P>We cannot lose sight of one critical issue which is that children must remain at the centre of all our policies and services which affect them. Actions must be child-centred, family-oriented, equitable, inclusive, action-oriented and integrated. I look forward to the outcome of the work of the high-level group and I assure Senators that the Government is totally committed to the provision of a comprehensive service to children and families.</P>

Th&aacute;inig athr&uacute; ar an saol, &aacute;fach, agus cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.</P>
      <P>I have long wanted to talk about the extraordinary and consistent discrepancy between pros<Col N="197"/>ecution and punishment for welfare offences and the prosecution and punishment of tax offences. The issue has been visible for years and has been raised consistently with the Revenue Commissioners. However, they consistently resist the question of prosecution. I will put the facts on the record. According to the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General in 2004 some 36 people were imprisoned after court cases involving social welfare recipients. We have increasing evidence of a ruthless group of exploitative employers based on stories from our immigrant workers in particular. I am not saying all or even most, but some employers have taken advantage of various vulnerabilities to be less than honest, to put it mildly.</P>
      <P>Of 476 criminal cases forwarded to the Chief State Solicitor in 2004 only 17 involved offences committed by employers. Of the people who were prosecuted and of those who went to jail, 21 were prosecuted under offences relating to unemployment assistance. These were people who presumably had defrauded the State on a grand scale. Some 12 people committed offences relating to unemployment benefit, two for disability benefit and one for other schemes, which amounts to 36 people. The grand total of money involved was barely &euro;1 million. Nobody defends welfare fraud. I must trust the courts that the people prosecuted, sentenced and sent to prison had committed offences of the scale and gravity that deserved prison offences. While it is hard to believe that offences which on average work out at &euro;4,000 are of the scale requiring people to be sent to prison, one accepts it.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary to consider the treatment of tax evasion in the same year, which was as with every other year. We seem to learn about another tax evasion scam every year. This year it is the construction industry and in other years it was Ansbacher, offshore accounts and bogus non-resident accounts. Twenty years ago we all knew that many people had several bank accounts in which they hid their money. Having been assured that the Revenue Commissioners had all the powers they needed, we discovered later that they had no such powers, that they had great difficulty in inspecting bank accounts and that we needed to make available to them a slew of new powers, which tax-gathering agencies in other countries had taken for granted for years. The IRS in that most free-market of countries, the United States, had vastly greater powers of discovery than the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>After we worked our way through it all, we discovered that nobody goes to prison. I am not a great enthusiast for sending people to prison, as I believe it rarely changes those sent there. However, the prospect of going to prison would significantly change the behaviour of the kinds of people who are consistently not prosecuted. By and large those we send to prison come from a background with a previous family history of being in prison. We send the poor, underprivileged, exploited and marginalised to prison. I <Col N="198"/>believe we do not prosecute those who are most afraid of prison for fear that they might end up there.</P>
      <P>An enormous amount is said about tax evasion. It starts from the almost tearful image of brave struggling entrepreneurs whose &ldquo;own money&rdquo;, as it is termed, is being taken from them by the rapacious State. I will not mention income tax yet, regardless of my feelings about it. In 2004 the Revenue Commissioners wrote off &euro;72 million of VAT that was due to them but could not be claimed. Let us get away from the poor tearful entrepreneur having his money taken and remember what happens here. I can think of two VAT offences which mean that the Revenue gets no money. In one case people collect VAT and do not pass it on to the Revenue and in the other they do not charge it and offer a more competitive price for their goods and services.</P>
      <P>The former case amounts to theft from their customers. Let us be clear about the matter. This is not the money of anybody. The customer is paying this tax to the State. Anybody who holds on to VAT, just as with holding on to PAYE or PRSI contributions, is a thief. It is other people&rsquo;s money that they should not have other than acting as an agency for the State and if they do not pass it on it is theft. On the other hand, if they do not charge VAT they are effectively stealing from their competitors as honest providers of goods and services who charge VAT will lose out in their businesses to those who chose not to. Let us walk away forever from this nonsense about the suffering taxpayer. These people are collecting tax on the State&rsquo;s behalf and choose not to pass it on.</P>
      <P>In 2004 the Revenue Commissioners wrote off tax in 26,000 cases. If only a quarter of these related to VAT, 5,000 to 6,000 people either stole money from their customers, the State or their competitors. Not one of those was prosecuted for such an act of fraud. The Revenue stated the money was unrecoverable for a variety of reasons and that was it. While the money might well be unrecoverable, the individual or the company must have been identified given that Revenue was aware of these problems and yet none of them was prosecuted. I can only imagine what people would say if the Garda decided, in the case of fraud or theft generally and where it could not recover the money because the person had gone bankrupt or whatever, that it would no longer prosecute the offender because there was no point. How is it that people who steal money from the State in the form of illegally holding on to other people&rsquo;s VAT or not charging VAT are let go scot-free while unfortunate wretches who improperly and illegally claim social welfare payments to which they are not entitled are sent to prison in significant numbers? There is only one conclusion. In the core of the philosophy of the State as epitomised by the Government, now in office for almost ten years, is a perceived difference between the poor and the well-off. The poor are seen as appropriate subjects to prosecute and <Col N="199"/>sent to prison while the rest of us are not. That runs through the entire decision-making priorities of the Government. This is a classic example of the way this Government talks about inclusion, social justice and rights for all yet leaves alone those who have some kind of stake in society.</P>
      <P>It is wonderful that the public is beginning to see through this. We are now seeing the public&rsquo;s realisation of the difference between a strong economy and a fractured society. The fundamental issue of which the public has taken note is that in our society there are those who can rip us off and those who are ripped off. Those who can rip us off are regarded as quasi-heroes to be understood &mdash; perhaps they made a mistake, maybe they were a little exuberant &mdash; while those who get ripped off, in particular the poor, are regarded as the criminals because deep down is a belief that the poor are suspect, that they are responsible for their own impoverishment and need to be watched and punished, while those who get rich at the expense of the taxpayer, their customers and their competitors are regarded as having at worst made a mistake and that at best they deserve our indulgence.</P>
      <P>That is the fundamental flaw in Irish society, built on inequality, growing out of injustice and leading into a situation where the difference between those who are on the inside and on the outside becomes greater all the time. We see it in little things like social welfare, in big things like tax evasion, and above all we see it now in employment practice where the Government is tacitly encouraging large-scale exploitation of people at work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to second the motion proposed by my colleague, Senator Ryan. I acknowledge that in recent years there has been a significant improvement in the use of Revenue powers and that the special investigations unit which is responsible for investigation matters, such as the Ansbacher Cayman bank accounts and the offshore accounts has, though belatedly, been successful in bringing home quite an amount of unpaid taxes. However, there are still many people who do not pay taxes.</P>
      <P>It is important to put this debate in context. We are not talking of the little guy who is late submitting his VAT or of someone who might be under pressure and postpones payment of income tax for a couple of months. We are talking of serious tax evasion, of fraud, of people who, as Senator Ryan said, in effect rob money from their fellow taxpayers.</P>
      <P>There are plenty of those people about. The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General dealing with the matter of relevant contracts tax, RTC, points out that two mega-scams were discovered during last year alone. In one case, 97 individuals and companies, and in the other case 27, conspired together to defraud the Revenue of due taxes. This is organised and shameless. These are individuals who set out from the start to <Col N="200"/>defraud the Revenue of money. They did so not because they were short of a few bob or negligent in making their returns in time. These people deliberately set out to defraud the Revenue of money and they should be prosecuted.</P>
      <P>In recent years there has been something on a consensus on this. Before I came to the House today I read the Revenue&rsquo;s statement of strategy in which it made it clear it would use its powers of prosecution more in the future. The Minister for Finance and his predecessor are on the record as saying there will be more such prosecutions in the future. The Revenue set up its special investigations and prosecutions branch a few years ago and said it would pursue more prosecutions, but that has not happened.</P>
      <P>I looked at the numbers of custodial sentences in this area, going back to 1997. In that year there were none. In 1998 there were two, in 1999 there was one, in 2000 there were two, in 2001 there were four, and one custodial sentence was imposed in each of the years 2002, 2003 and 2004. That adds up to just a dozen people prosecuted successfully and given custodial sentences, most of which were suspended. In his timely report last week, the Comptroller and Auditor General compares that with 259 prosecutions taken last year for social welfare fraud, in most cases involving a fraction of the money we are talking of in terms of tax evasion. Some 39 of the people involved went to prison last year alone, so that more people went to prison last year for social welfare fraud than have gone to prison for tax evasion as long as records go back.</P>
      <P>There is something seriously wrong here. All the rhetoric, all the commitment from Government and from the Revenue to use the powers of prosecution, has not amounted to anything. Is this an incapacity? Is there something wrong in the system which makes such prosecution impossible or difficult, or is it a lack of political will or a lack of will within the Revenue? One must conclude that a lack of will is involved because getting only one successful custodial sentence last year &mdash; a sentence which was suspended &mdash; defies belief.</P>
      <P>If the Revenue cannot do the job, the power should be given to someone who can. The notion of a fiscal prosecutor has been proposed, a sort of DPP for tax cases, who would have particular responsibility for prosecuting tax evaders through the courts. The Law Reform Commission considered this and did not recommend it. However, I found the reasoning of the commission less than totally persuasive. The Revenue will have to put in a far better performance over the next few years if it is to successfully make the case, as it has done before, that taking the powers out of its hands is not the right course to take. We should seriously be considering removing that power, because if the Revenue will not use it, someone else must be encouraged or allowed to do so.</P>
      <P>Many of us reluctantly supported the tax amnesty Act of 1993 because it was introduced during the period of the Fianna F&aacute;il-Labour government. We supported it because it imposed <Col N="201"/>an obligation on people to use the amnesty and settle their affairs. It also prescribed quite heavy penalties, including a mandatory custodial sentence for those who did not get their affairs in order.</P>
      <P>Some 12 years later, that power has never been used. To my knowledge, not one person has been prosecuted, successfully or otherwise, for failing to use the tax amnesty Act of 1993. One must ask why. Many of the people involved not only got the facility of the 1993 Act but could also have used the 2001 partial amnesty. They have twice refused the opportunities given to them, and the obligations imposed on them, to settle their affairs. It defies belief that not a single person could have been successfully prosecuted for not having lived up to his or her obligations under the 1993 Act.</P>
      <P>Everyone agrees it is important to encourage, facilitate and oblige people to fulfil their social obligations and pay their taxes. It is important that court cases are taken. I appreciate that the primary responsibility of Revenue is to collect money and that the Revenue does not primarily see itself as a prosecution service. However, it is important to send the signal that tax evasion is unacceptable and that the necessary action will be taken to ensure that people meet their obligations.</P>

      <P LI="1">To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>

      <P FLI="0" el="5">
        <?oasys _is1p8-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p2-?><?oasys _ix?>noting the success of the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; debt collection and reduction <Col N="202"/>programmes where debt now stands at a historically low level of 2.5% of gross collection compared to 30% in the late 1980s and 15% in the mid-1990s;</P>
      <P FLI="0" el="5">
        <?oasys _is1p8-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p2-?><?oasys _ix?>noting that there can be valid reasons for the write off of uncollectible debt by the Revenue Commissioners and that all such write offs are in accordance with protocols agreed with the Comptroller and Auditor General;</P>
      <P FLI="0" el="5">
        <?oasys _is0p10-?>
        <?oasys _ix?>calls on the Government to continue to take all necessary measures to build on the new levels of compliance with tax legislation achieved since 1997.&rdquo;</P>
      <P FLI="0" el="5">If one were to believe the motion, one would have a picture of a draconian social welfare system grinding the poor and, on the other hand, a lax tax system turning a blind eye to everything and everyone. That is a political caricature.</P>
      <P>Let us deal with the so-called facts that are presented in the first line of the motion. It refers to 36 people being sentenced to terms of imprisonment. It does not mention, of course, that 26 of those sentences were suspended; therefore, 36 people were not imprisoned for that period. The motion refers to social welfare fraud amounting to &euro;1 million and, technically, the Opposition is connecting it to the 259 figure. However, the Department of Social and Family Affairs claims to have saved &euro;386 million in overpayments, although all those overpayments are not necessarily fraud, with 7,000 employers reviewed. That is in the context of a total social welfare bill of &euro;12 billion.</P>
      <P>There is an effort to administer the social welfare system in a humane way. Even where people are convicted of fraud, for example, they have families who will continue to need payments. Approximately 5% of cases are prosecuted out of a total of 10,000 cases of overpayment. In many cases it is difficult to recover benefit. People who go to prison, and I am not necessarily defending that, are there for a matter of weeks, sometimes even days. Obviously there are certain categories of people who by no stretch of the imagination are near the borderline. I refer to criminals, and there are four social welfare officers attach to the CAB, or other people from whom civil recovery can be made. What one would not have learned from the promoters of the motion is that 159 people were fined and only ten were sent to prison. I am not disputing the entire Opposition argument but I will come back to it when I have examined the Revenue side of it.</P>
      <P>One would think from listening to the Opposition Members that prison was the only recourse available to the State to deal with tax evasion. However, approximately 200 names appear on lists at quarterly intervals and some of these people have to pay large sums of money. A sum of &euro;9 million was mentioned in the last list. Senator Ryan said he is generally not keen on sending people to prison. He is, perhaps, a little keener on sending wealthy people to prison.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="203"/>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely. It is worse for rich people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>It costs &euro;80,000 to keep a person in prison for a year. Frankly, that is not a good use of the State&rsquo;s money. It is far preferable to recover the money with interest and penalties and to name and shame. I am aware from one or two people who have been caught that there is considerable shame involved. That is a more effective way of dealing with this.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of tax evasion cases do not go through the courts. The Revenue Commissioners deal directly, or through accountants in some cases, with the individual concerned and recover the money without legal cost. The question is if one wishes to maximise the revenue of the State for services or if one is mainly interested in retributive justice. The Revenue Commissioners have done a fantastic job in the last few years. They have secured &euro;2 billion from special investigations. They were given many extra powers in 1999, when former Deputy, Charlie McCreevy, was Minister for Finance and when it was possible to tighten up those provisions without causing damage to the State&rsquo;s interest. It is not an accident it occurred in that year because 1999 is the year we became part of the euro and the danger of money going out of the country, if measures that were too draconian were adopted, disappeared. There has been a new situation since 1999, regardless of whether people wish to acknowledge it.</P>
      <P>It is rubbish to claim that the Government has a differential attitude to the poor and to the wealthy. However, there is a small amount of truth in the claim with regard to the courts. The district justices send social welfare offenders to jail. While one or two of them might be well off, generally they are not. They do that to give an example to others and it is reported in the local press. However, on the tax side, I am informed that experience in the criminal investigation of tax cases to date is that exacting evidential standards are set to satisfy the criteria for successful prosecution. In other words, the courts, judges and legal profession are slow to find somebody guilty. There are all sorts of technical problems. I am willing to admit that the problem may exist. The courts need to be vigilant that they do not find themselves administering, although not at the wish of the Oireachtas, any form of class justice.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners can do a great deal more. I do not believe they have by any means exhausted ways of tracking down evasion. I support the Revenue Commissioners getting the resources they need because they will benefit several fold over whatever it would cost to hire different expertise or personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the motion put forward by my colleagues in the Labour Party. They are, no doubt, surprised by some of the content in the Government&rsquo;s amendment. The core issue <Col N="204"/>in this debate and in arguments about tax evasion and the taxation system is equity. The facts presented in the motion clearly show that some people are, to borrow a phrase, treated more equally than others by the State. People who are wealthy can afford expertise in the taxation area to avoid and, in some cases, evade paying tax. Regardless of what Senator Mansergh said, it is clear from the figures where the emphasis of this Government lies, and it has been in office for nine years, with regard to tax evasion as opposed to social welfare fraud. It is clear that the poorer parts of society do not count.</P>
      <P>This is remarkable when one considers the origins of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party. I have always had an interest in history, particularly political history. Fianna F&aacute;il has traditionally presented itself as the party of the less well off in society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a caricature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>The fact is that the sympathies of this Government continue to lie with those who are very well off as opposed to those who are at the lower end of society, struggling to make ends meet. I regret this and have no doubt that when people get a chance to express their views on it, they will be more than willing to do so.</P>
      <P>If one examines the figures presented by the Labour Party, the point becomes clear. Last year, 36 individuals were sentenced for social welfare fraud while only one was sentenced for tax evasion. That is a startling statistic. I was surprised that the Government considered it necessary to amend the motion, which puts such stark statistics in the public domain. Anyone with a conscience would have to agree that a system that allows such inequality to exist cannot be defended or supported.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed because I do not get any sense from the Government representatives here or from those with responsibilities in the Department of Finance that there will be a reversal in the figures I quoted from last year. I do not detect any urgency about ensuring that those who deliberately evade tax will suffer the full rigours of the law. Those who can afford to pay the top tax consultants, the best accountants or the best legal minds in the country have a better chance of avoiding a custodial sentence or any other penalty than those who have difficulties with social welfare over-payments. I wish to emphasise that social welfare fraud is a serious offence which I do not condone but the full rigours of the law that are applied to those engaging in such fraud <Col N="205"/>should equally be applied to those who are known to be evading tax. It is clear that this is not the case.</P>
      <P>Neither the motion nor amendment makes specific reference to the issue of tax revenue fines. In 2003 the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Purcell, made a statement in his annual report to the effect that one third of tax revenue fines remained uncollected. Perhaps the Minister for Finance can tell us what is the current situation in that regard. Mr. Purcell further stated in his report that there is little point in imposing such fines if they are not going to be paid. Given that such a large amount of tax revenue fines remained outstanding in 2003, surely the figure for the number of people convicted and given custodial sentences for tax evasion should be much higher than it is. I wish to know why the figure is not so. As with previous speakers, I do not necessarily believe that custodial sentences are appropriate in all cases, but there are situations where they must be imposed. It would be significant if the Government indicated that there would be a crack down on tax evasion, that wealthy people who evaded tax and did not avail of the amnesties to settle their affairs would be brought through the courts and face the full rigours of the law. I await the comments of the Minister in that regard.</P>
      <P>I compliment the special investigations unit in the Revenue Commissioners, which has done an excellent job over the last few years. The unit has been given additional powers and has used them well in recent times. However, it is still clear that people are evading tax. Despite the rosy picture presented by Senator Mansergh and Government in general, many people are still evading tax in this State. I was struck by the reference in the Government amendment to a level of tax evasion of 2.5%, down from over 30% in the mid 1980s because I believe that 2.5% is still too much. To include such a reference in the amendment is inappropriate because people who evade tax are robbing from everyone. They are robbing from tax payers and people who pay their fair share as well as from education and health services.</P>
      <P>I fully support the motion and compliment the Labour Party for tabling it because contrary to the popular perception, as espoused by Senator Mansergh, tax evasion still exists in this State.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the opportunity to address this motion and to speak in support of the amendment put down by the Government which points to the very significant and increasing successes of the Revenue Commissioners in recent years in protecting the State&rsquo;s revenues and tackling tax evasion.</P><Col N="206"/>
      <P>The Labour Party motion contains a wholly unsupported and outrageous allegation that there is a policy in place to protect the well off from the rigours of the law. Decisions to prosecute in individual cases are the prerogative of the Revenue Commissioners and the DPP. I know of no evidence that would support this unwarranted allegation. The Senators who put down the motion should think again about this wording, which strikes me as entirely inappropriate. Unless it is a claim that can be supported with real and substantive evidence, they should not lend their names to it.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners are charged by law with tax collection. The role of the Minister for Finance in this area is circumscribed by law and by practice, for obvious reasons and that is as it should be. The Revenue Commissioners have made it very clear, both by their actions and commitments, that they have no tolerance of tax evasion and non-compliance. The Government entirely supports them in this regard. In their most recent statement of strategy for 2005 to 2007 they affirm the commitment to &ldquo;improving compliance and maximising tax collection&rdquo; and to achieving this by a balanced approach combining a sharp and uncompromising response to evasion and default while providing high quality services to compliant tax payers. The Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; primary goal of ensuring that everyone complies with their tax and customs responsibilities remains at the core of their activities. Their main compliance interventions are firmly focused on those who pose the greatest risk to the Exchequer, namely, those who fail to comply. This requires a balancing of resources between various programmes so they are deployed effectively and efficiently in identifying and combating risk to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>This approach to risk has clearly been successful, with over &euro;2 billion recovered for the benefit of the Exchequer through the special investigation projects initiated in recent years. Over &euro;1 billion of this amount was recovered in the past 18 months. This sum is in addition to the recoveries made under the normal audit programmes of the Revenue Commissioners, which result in around 16,000 audits being conducted annually.</P>
      <P>The modern approach to revenue collection, supported by extra powers given by the Government, has succeeded in reducing debt to an historically low level of 2.5% of gross collection, a figure which stands up well in international comparisons. This 2.5% compares to 4% in 1999, 15% in 1994 and 30% in 1989. The reduction has been achieved by improving timely compliance rates combined with vigorous and focused collection initiatives, using all of the available powers.</P>
      <P>The level of tax debts for VAT, for instance, for 2004 amounted to &euro;289 million, or 2.1% of gross VAT receipts in 2004, which totalled &euro;13,635 million. This is down from &euro;345 million, or 2.8%, in 2003 and reflects the continually improving rate of collection. To indicate the scale of activity in VAT, a total of &euro;9,984 million in <Col N="207"/>new tax charges were raised during 2004, of which &euro;8,184 million was in respect of 2004 tax periods.</P>
      <P>The essential function of the Revenue Commissioners is to collect tax. Inevitably, cases will arise where, because of the particular circumstances, collection is not possible or the tax cannot be collected without disproportionate cost to the State. Even in a time of significant economic growth, the reality of commercial life is that some businesses fail. As Members of this House will be aware, requests to Revenue to be understanding in such circumstances are not unheard of. Moreover, because of Revenue&rsquo;s unique position in being a creditor to all, most business failures will involve at least some tax debt. In these circumstances and where recovery of the debt is not possible or the cost of recovery is not proportionate to the return, arrangements are made to pass the tax as irrecoverable, also known as writing-off the tax. This is done to distinguish the uncollectible tax on Revenue&rsquo;s records and thus allow collection and pursuit efforts to focus on the outstanding tax liabilities that remain collectible. For example, the level of tax debts for VAT for 2004 amounted to &euro;289 million or 2.1% of gross VAT receipts in 2004 of &euro;13.635 billion. This is down from &euro;345 million or 2.8% in 2003 and reflects the continually improving rate of collection. To indicate the scale of activity in VAT, a total of &euro;9.984 billion in new tax charges was raised during 2004, of which &euro;8.184 billion was in respect of the 2004 tax period.</P>
      <P>The essential function of Revenue is to collect tax. Inevitably, cases will arise where, because of the particular circumstances, collection is not possible or the tax cannot be collected without disproportionate cost to the State. Even in a time of significant economic growth, the reality of commercial life is that some businesses fail. As Members of this House will be aware, requests to Revenue to be understanding in such circumstances are not unheard of. Moreover, due to Revenue&rsquo;s unique position in being a creditor to all, most business failures will involve at least some tax debt. In these circumstances and where recovery of the debt is not possible or the cost of recovery is not proportionate to the return, arrangements are made to pass the tax as irrecoverable, which is also known as the writing off the tax. This is done to distinguish the uncollectible tax on Revenue&rsquo;s records and thus allow collection and pursuit efforts to focus on the outstanding tax liabilities that remain collectible.</P>
      <P>However, write off of tax is not irreversible and if information subsequently comes to light, such as an improvement in financial circumstances, Revenue can reinstate the tax debt and collection can then be pursued in the normal way. There is broad agreement between Revenue and the Comptroller and Auditor General on the criteria and procedures to be followed in the writing off of tax and the decision to write off tax is only taken on the basis of detailed guidelines that contain a series of checks and balances. In addition, <Col N="208"/>all write off decisions are subject to review by a team of internal auditors in Revenue and by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
      <P>The majority of cases where evasion is discovered are concluded on the basis of a negotiated settlement with the taxpayer, which involves collection of the unpaid tax together with heavy interest and civil penalties. The level of civil penalties imposed is usually far greater than the level of fines imposed by the courts in similar cases and settlements are published on a quarterly basis in the tax defaulters list in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i> if the terms requiring such publication are met. Generally, the civil penalties imposed vary with the amount of tax involved and in cases of serious evasion can equal the total tax evaded. I mentioned earlier the &euro;2 billion yield from various special investigations. Senators may be interested to know that nearly 60% of this figure, &euro;1.2 billion, was interest and penalties. These non-compliant taxpayers certainly did not get off scot free.</P>
      <P>However, we fully recognise that in addition to initiating programmes whose focus is largely on the recovery of unpaid taxes and the imposition of heavy penalties, offenders should also be prosecuted where possible. The Revenue statement of strategy for 2005-07 signals as one of its key strategies the &ldquo;increased investigation and prosecution of tax evasion and fraudulent activity&rdquo;. This is regarded as a vital element in maximising compliance and ensuring the proper taxes and duties are paid on a timely basis to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P><?oasys _dc20-?>The Government supports the approach of the Revenue Commissioners in increasingly pursuing a greater numbers of cases for criminal investigation with a view to their referral to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP. To this end and as part of their restructuring programme, the Revenue Commissioners have established a special investigations and prosecutions division. This division, which has spearheaded the major project investigations in recent years, is also charged with co-ordinating all criminal investigation activity undertaken by Revenue and has been provided with additional resources to enable it to conduct more criminal investigations into serious cases of evasion. All other areas of Revenue have been mandated to identify cases that are potentially suitable for prosecution and refer them to the investigations and prosecutions division.</P>
      <?oasys _dc0-?><P>For the record, 35 individuals and companies have been convicted of a variety of serious tax offences since 1996, seven of these since the beginning of 2005. Jail sentences were imposed in 13 of these cases, although seven of these sentences were suspended. One conviction and sentence is currently under appeal and in another three cases terms of community service in lieu of custodial sentences were imposed. Fines were imposed in the rest of the cases. Currently, there are 52 cases of serious tax evasion under investigation with a view to prosecution. The DPP is considering a further 12 cases and has given direc<Col N="209"/>tions to prosecute in another four cases. There are six cases in the courts process. Additionally, there are a further two cases in respect of which bench warrants have been issued by the court because the defendants have absconded.</P>
      <P>This is the highest ever number of cases of serious evasion that has been tackled on a criminal investigation footing by Revenue, which is consistent with the commitments given by it to the public. With the procedures now in place in the investigations and prosecutions division and the arrangements between it and other areas of Revenue, new cases are being identified and added each month. This represents a considerable ratcheting up by the Revenue Commissioners in a relatively short timeframe of their prosecution activity. In addition to the aforementioned prosecutions, over 6,500 individuals and companies have, in the same period, been convicted of offences of failing to file tax returns. Since the beginning of 2004, over 700 individuals and companies have been convicted of customs and excise offences following action by the Revenue Commissioners. These prosecutions must also be factored in when, as is frequently the case, comparisons are made with prosecutions under the social welfare code.</P>
      <P>Experience in the criminal investigation of tax cases to date indicates there are very exacting evidential standards to be met to satisfy the criteria for a successful prosecution. Particular difficulties arise where vital documentation is not available, often due to the lapse of time or where witnesses are not available due to their location or reluctance to become involved where the suspect is an employer or business associate. This is in line with the experience of dealing with white collar crime generally. A practical approach must be adopted to avoid Revenue resources being tied up in what is an extremely labour-intensive process and where the outcome may ultimately be non-productive. Consequently, resources tend to be focused on cases in which it is reasonably clear from the outset that evidence of wrongdoing is available or likely to become available in the course of an investigation.</P>
      <P>Equally, the courts must be satisfied that the standards applied by investigators in conducting the investigation and gathering the evidence meet the requirements of fair procedure and due process in light of the potentially serious consequences for a suspect. Revenue officers must take care at all stages of the investigation that in addition to the evidential aspects, the appropriate standards are also met. Investigating a case with a view to possible prosecution and then taking suitable cases through the courts can be a slow and resource-intensive undertaking regardless of who is involved. This is a simple mundane fact of life. Getting exercised over it or calling with indignation for more convictions is no substitute for doing the leg-work actually required. Maybe those in the Opposition do not like it but this is the way the system works to protect the innocent while punishing the guilty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister sure he has that right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Another factor that influences the process of criminal investigations is the level of the powers available to the investigators. Revenue officers, in the course of their work in this area, may identify deficiencies that curtail their capacity to assemble the best evidence in some cases and, as a result of these experiences, suggest matters for inclusion in Finance Bills.</P>
      <P>As the Seanad is aware, this Government has a solid track record second to none in introducing legislation to augment Revenue powers in Finance Acts. The chairman of the Revenue Commissioners has pointed out in appearances before the Committee of Public Accounts that almost all of the developments in the pursuit of the major projects undertaken by Revenue could be attributed to the powers introduced by the Minister for Finance in 1999, which allow the Commissioners to examine financial institutions in a way that was not possible previously. In the Finance Act 2005 I introduced a provision I understand is currently being used by Revenue in the ongoing investigation into the use of insurance-based investment products by some taxpayers to evade tax. In addition, I also introduced amendments to section 1078 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to strengthen the approach to prosecuting those who aid and abet others in evading tax and to create a more general offence of evading tax. These amendments will further assist the drive of the Revenue Commissioners against tax evaders and those who facilitate them.</P>
      <P>As the Minister for Finance, my predecessor Mr. Charlie Mc Creevy received the report of the Revenue Powers Group, which examined the powers available to Revenue generally but also considered the area of criminal investigation of tax evasion and made certain recommendations that have a bearing on the matter. In this year&rsquo;s Finance Act I initiated the first measures in a process of reforms in the area of Revenue powers, including a number of the recommendations of the Revenue Powers Group. I intend to return to some of the remaining recommendations that require further consultation and careful consideration for future implementation.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners advise me they are satisfied with the level of success achieved to date in criminal prosecutions for tax evasion in the courts but are determined and confident that their new approach and the establishment of the investigations and prosecutions division will increase the numbers of such cases investigated. It has done so already. The level or severity of the sentences imposed is a matter for the courts but it should be remembered that the impact on a defendant is not limited to the sentence imposed by the court. For example, in one of the cases accepted for investigation in 1999 in which a conviction followed in 2003, a total fine of &euro;1,750 was imposed. However, the convicted person and his company settled their liability to the <Col N="211"/>Revenue Commissioners by paying in excess of &euro;1.65 million, included in which was a substantial civil penalty.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The courts are influenced by the fact that the Revenue Commissioners impose heavy penalties. In the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in the case of the Director of Public Prosecutions <i>v.</i> Redmond, the court stated: &ldquo;It is plainly not possible for a sentencing court in a case such as this to ignore the fact that other penalties, which may be much greater in amount than the cumulative sum of the maximum fines for those charges, have already been made&rdquo;.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11-?>
      <P>In the course of the large-scale investigation projects undertaken by the Revenue Commissioners in recent years, such as the investigation into the bogus non-resident account holders and offshore account holders, taxpayers who have paid additional taxes are likely to have committed revenue offences. Due to the vast scale of these investigations and the potential they have to lock up Revenue resources for years, the approach taken has been a pragmatic one, aimed at collecting the undeclared taxes together with interest and substantial penalties in the shortest possible time. It would have been impractical for the Revenue Commissioners to adopt a criminal investigation approach in each of these cases and it would have secured far less by way of settlements.</P>
      <P>These programmes are continuing and will now focus on the small number of cases that have not come forward. They will be pursued and will be considered as potential prosecution cases and, where selected, will also face the prospect of being prosecuted, where the required evidence can be assembled.</P>
      <P>It can be seen from the results and the progress referred to already, that the Revenue Commissioners are very serious about the pursuit of non-compliance with the tax code and the balanced approach being adopted has proven to be extremely successful. Their resolve to increase the number of cases being investigated and referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions is already bearing fruit, with the numbers of such cases at an all time high. The present arrangements are working effectively. The Law Reform Commission in its paper on a fiscal prosecutor and a revenue court, published in December 2004, looked at the treatment of revenue offences, including the workings of the public prosecution system and surveyed the existing system of bringing revenue prosecutions. The paper includes a recommendation that the arrangements currently in place for the prosecution of revenue offences be maintained for a period and then reviewed in a few years. The message should be clear by now. Anyone who hides taxable income or evades tax will be pursed by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>Unlike others who had the opportunity but failed to do so, the Government backed the <Col N="212"/>efforts to tackle evasion with important and effective legislative initiatives, to which I have already referred. We have provided significant extra resources to the Revenue Commissioners and an additional 400 staff in the audit and compliance area. By comparison to earlier years and having regard to the excellent results achieved on general tax compliance initiatives by the Revenue Commissioners and the emerging results in prosecutions, the Government is not convinced that the existing arrangements for prosecutions needs to be changed.</P>
      <P>The real story, then, is of an active pursuit of non-compliance by independent Revenue Commissioners, supported by appropriate legislative change. The real story is one of non-compliant taxpayers being prosecuted and paying substantial interest and penalties. Of course there are more tax evaders out there; no doubt there always will be some but there is substantial and ongoing progress towards achieving a tax-compliant environment in the State, which I believe has improved beyond all recognition, particularly in the last decade.</P>
      <P>The Government is determined that tax evasion be tackled and offenders pursued. Unlike those opposite, we back up this resolve by doing something about it. Perhaps that is why the Opposition contents itself with some unfortunately wild, unsubstantiated allegations here and in the other House. It will do it no good and will be seen through by the electorate. I, therefore, ask Senators to support the Government amendment to underline its abhorrence of tax evasion and to recognise the clear policy of the Government to tackle evasion in all our citizens&rsquo; interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I found his speech very interesting but before I turn to it I would like to say that I may support the Government&rsquo;s amendment. Although the Labour Party has made very serious points, it has gone in the direction of a particular ethos rather than any particular party. I do not know of any Government under which there has been the kind of aggressive attack upon private tax defaulters that the Labour party seems to think is deficient and a deficiency of this Government. I do not wish to be part of this on this occasion. The Government is fairly strong in going in the right direction and in the direction that the Labour party seems to wish for.</P>
      <P>The Minister said there is no policy to protect the well-off from the rigours of the law. There may not be a policy but that is certainly the effect. Nobody could be in any doubt about this. Wealthy people are protected both in the courts and in terms of their tax provisions and the banks. The bigger the crook, the bigger the write-off he or she will get. A small person gets squashed and trampled. We all know this is true; there is no argument about it. There could be no argument from either side of the House. I disagree with the Labour Party in that I do not think this is a spec<Col N="213"/>ific policy of this Government. I believe the responsibility lies elsewhere, perhaps in the past. The history of the Revenue Commissioners may play a part in it. I do not want to see people hounded into prison, particularly people on relatively low incomes. The Revenue Commissioners is a beast that is feared in many quarters but also treated with disrespect by others.</P>
      <P>I do not believe there is a policy to protect these people but it is a fact and part of our ethos. I remember when tax evasion was not regarded as a sin in the Catholic Church. A person who had evaded income tax did not have to confess it. I have some nationalist friends who are delighted to boast to me about the amounts they defrauded from the Revenue Commissioners. There was no feeling of civic responsibility in this country and we must understand this. We are now at a path where something needs to be done about it. A friend who is a senior and well-advised political commentator said to me very recently that he felt that there should be what he described as &ldquo;stench marking&rdquo; in addition to benchmarking because of the awful aroma of corruption that floats around so much of our life in this country. We are sliding down internationally on the corruption index, which is most regrettable. All of us should stand together to try to do something about this.</P>
      <P>The tribunals, of which we have had approximately 12, are a good indicator. So far, these tribunals have cost &euro;200 million and that is before third party costs are paid. The total cost will probably be &euro;1 billion. This is the extent of what is going on in this country. The Exchequer seems to be awash with money and everyone is trying to get their fingers into it in one way or another. I have before me an economic report which looks at the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General. The Comptroller and Auditor General talks about the West Link bridge where &euro;2 million disappeared and nobody seemed to bother about it. There is information in the report about the computer system in the Department of Health and Children and how the Prison Service abandoned a &euro;500,000 computer service because it did not like the way it operated. I heard some time ago on the radio about a situation where a road service was faulty and had to be redone. A steamroller had to be brought in and the entire cost of re-tarmacking that section of road was &euro;50,000. However, the authorities were billed &euro;3 million and they paid up. This is the kind of ethos that we have and should address.</P>
      <P>The report I have is very interesting because it is not partisan and does not come from any particular political party. It is a kind of business report. It says, &ldquo;there is a stark contrast in the way the State pursues social welfare fraud, compared with tax fraud&rdquo;. I am not saying it is Government policy but it is a fact and is noticed by the business community independently. The amounts are also quite disproportionate. I have before me a table of prosecutions from the Department of Social and Family Affairs. Table 53 deals with criminal cases forwarded to the <Col N="214"/>Chief State Solicitor and lists them under the headings of unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit, disability benefit, one parent family payment, other schemes, offences committed by employers and so on. In 2004, there were 476 and there were 355 in 2003. The amounts involved were &euro;1,116,492. In other words, the amount was just over &euro;1 million and there was a marginal rise from the previous year. If one looks at the other aspect of this, the special investigations, the money which was deliberately and systematically defrauded by big interests and big private investors is &euro;2 billion and nobody has gone, or will go, to prison. By contrast, the small people, those at the margins of society, have been prosecuted and 36 of them have been sent to prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>

	<P>So am I.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I know. There is no competition at all but my point still stands. There may be a small difference, six or ten, or a little more, whatever the Senator wishes, but he has not addressed the principle of what I was saying.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think so but Senator Mansergh obviously does and can be satisfied with that.</P>
      <P>The situation of what is termed &ldquo;pick-me-up&rdquo; schemes is interesting. This involves party supporters outside the political arena who pick up expenses legitimately owed by the political parties. It is illegal but there have been 71 cases of this practice. That comes very close to home in this House.</P>
      <P>Fintan O&rsquo;Toole, in an excellent article in <i>The Irish Times</i>, referred to a series of frauds in the construction industry which is close to some of the political parties here. He wrote &ldquo;The brazenness can be breathtaking.&rdquo; Indeed it can. Four building sub-contractors were involved in claiming tax relief funds for jobs that were never undertaken. They never paid the tax, the jobs did not exist but they received the tax relief funds. In his article Fintan O&rsquo;Toole states:</P>
      <P LI="1">[They] faked tax refund claim forms pleaded guilty to deception and theft during 2003. They submitted forms to the Revenue claiming refunds on the 35% which main contractors must automatically deduct from payments to subcontractors. But the jobs they were claiming for did not exist and when the offenders received the refund cheques, they simply passed them on to the builders who organised the fraud, keeping a small cut for themselves.</P><Col N="215"/>
      <P FLI="0">I understand this is called &ldquo;trousering the proceeds&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>If one looks around there is no doubt that the Labour Party is right in what it says in this sense: the small people are crushed, the big crooks get away with it. That is part of our ethos. I am not inclined to blame Fianna F&aacute;il or the coalition Government for this. However, Senator Mansergh with his eloquent interruptions has persuaded me that it would be wrong for me tonight to vote with the Government. In tribute to his wisdom, I shall be happy to vote for the Labour Party motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KateWalsh"><NameTxt>Ms K. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to be able to contribute to this debate and I support Senator Mansergh&rsquo;s amendment to the motion. I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Killeen, to the House.</P>
      <P>In 2004, a total of 259 people were prosecuted for social welfare fraud amounting to &euro;1 million, an average of almost &euro;4,000 per offender. That is a large sum of money, especially when one considers that an adult&rsquo;s allowance for a full year is &euro;5,000. The Labour Party should consider that only 13% of the offenders who defrauded the State of almost a full year&rsquo;s allowance were sentenced to jail.</P>
      <P>This year the Government will spend over &euro;12 billion on social welfare support. That is double the amount spent four years ago. That &euro;12 billion represents &euro;1 for every &euro;3 of the taxpayer&rsquo;s money spent directly on welfare support. The taxpayer contributes a large amount of money to people and families whom our society believe need help. That is one good thing.</P>
      <P>At the same time, taxpayers deserve to have their hard-earned money spent wisely. The other House is debating this topic tonight. Social welfare fraud should be called stealing taxpayers&rsquo; money. Families across the country need this money.</P>
      <P>The Labour motion implies, maybe unintentionally, either we are too hard on social welfare fraud or not hard enough on tax offenders. Neither of these implications is true. Tax fraud is an example of stealing taxpayers&rsquo; money and should not be treated any differently from social welfare fraud. For example, the Labour Party motion makes no reference to the &euro;1.5 billion in back taxes, interest and penalties received following investigation into bogus non-resident and offshore accounts. That omission is a pity.</P>
      <P>We put every effort into catching tax dodgers. In January of this year the Government announced amendments to the Finance Bill 2005. These amendments extended the powers of the Revenue Commissioners to pursue prosecutions against persons who engage in, or facilitate, tax evasion. In April 2004 Frank Daly, the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, said that tax eva<Col N="216"/>sion damages our country and is equivalent to robbing one&rsquo;s neighbour.</P>
      <P>As the saying goes, &ldquo;the only stable state is that in which all men are equal before the law&rdquo;. Social welfare and tax fraud are examples of people robbing their neighbours. People who commit either crime should be pursued and treated equally. As legislators we must not move too close to instructing the legal system on how to do its job. That would be dangerous for democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for being here for this important debate. The issue of tax evasion and compliance is important for us as law-makers and is extremely important for the community. The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report on this area issued last week exposes serious matters.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in his address to the House, did not refer to tax evasion in the construction sector which is pointed out in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report and has been substantially covered in the media since then. We probably all agree that there will always be attempts to evade tax. It is almost a given in human nature that certain people will do their best not to pay their fair share. It is the role of the Revenue Commissioners to ensure that tax is paid. That is why they have been given widespread powers in recent years. I agree with Senator Kate Walsh that failure to pay tax and defrauding social welfare are the same as stealing from one&rsquo;s neighbour.</P>
      <P>In some cases the Department of Social and Family Affairs has been extraordinary in its pursuit of individuals to recover money for the public purse. I wish to compare that with the activities of the Revenue Commissioners. The Minister said that in some cases the cost of recovering money for the public purse could be far greater than the amount recovered.</P>
      <P>One must, however, remember the principle at the heart of this issue. The Revenue Commissioners are not recovering the money for its own sake but on behalf of all compliant taxpayers. It is important that the Revenue Commissioners use the full extent of their powers and pursue cases where they have evidence of a sector that is not complying. In that respect one must look at the issue of relevant contracts tax in the construction industry.</P>
      <P>I wish to cite an example of the way the Department of Social and Family Affairs pursues individuals, without giving too much detail. It concerned a man whose brother died. It emerged that the deceased had claimed a pension to which he was not fully entitled, since he had sold land in the years previous to his death and so had means. When the property was legally examined, the Department of Social and Family Affairs was able to see that the man had such means that he had not declared. The family was then landed with a bill. His poor unfortunate brother, also a pensioner, was mithered when I met him. He was <Col N="217"/>up the wall with anxiety and concern regarding the sum owed to the Department. One could say that the family had got its fair dues, but the officers of the Department were extremely diligent in their pursuit of the individual and the sum owed to the public purse, which amounted to tens of thousands of euro. The case was extremely vigorously pursued, and that is only fair.</P>
      <P>However, when one looks at the construction industry and in particular the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, one sees that the level of pursuance in that sector, especially regarding relevant contract tax, is simply not the same. Senator Norris referred to a case before Dublin District Court last week involving several building contractors engaged in a scam relating to that tax. That comes as no surprise to anyone working for the Revenue Commissioners on this sector. There are clear indications that the level of non-compliance and abuse in the area is quite extensive. Eric Fleming of SIPTU, a figure well known for his activity on behalf of workers in the construction sector, has extraordinary things to say on the subject. On some building sites, contractors have no employees, since everyone is a subcontractor. That clearly points to a degree of tax evasion that must be examined very closely and addressed.</P>
      <P>One must think of the individual subcontractors involved. To what extent are the employers&rsquo; obligations for holidays, pensions and other benefits to which people are entitled being avoided? What about overseas workers, who can now be found in large numbers on building sites? Without union involvement, are those people fully aware of their rights as workers, or are they being exploited by being termed subcontractors?</P>
      <P>There is also the issue of the relevant contract tax. The chairman of the Revenue Commissioners made the astonishing comment to the Comptroller and Auditor General that one reason that subcontractors and contractors are not paying tax is that evasion is a means of gaining competitive advantage. The Government and in particular the Revenue Commissioners must examine that very closely. I am not satisfied from the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report that enough investigations or audits are being carried out in the area. Nor am I satisfied that workers&rsquo; rights are fully protected.</P>
      <P>It is not good enough to say that the building industry has always been like that and always will be. We have had that attitude to tax evasion in the past. The Minister&rsquo;s own figures show that when the Revenue Commissioners go to work, they really get results. It is time that they really went to work on the construction industry and got results on behalf of compliant employers, contractors and workers, and especially on behalf of the wider community. I am not saying that social welfare fraud should not be pursued, but one wonders when one sees the work done on that compared with what appears not be done on the other side, particularly by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>From listening to Opposition comments and reading the Minister&rsquo;s speech, there seems to be a clear dichotomy between perception and reality. Anyone reading this would have the living daylights scared out of them. I will quote the specific figure into the record. As the Minister has stated, the overall tax debt is 2.5%, down from 30% in 1989. We are second in a list of the top 22 countries, including several individual American states where tax compliance is very high, as well as wealthy countries such as Sweden.</P>
      <P Just="Left">When I was living in England under old Labour, the perception was that if one voted in the Labour Party, money would flee the country, while if one voted in the Tories, that would generate economic growth. I remember very well that Neil Kinnock publicly stated at a time when the highest rate of tax was approximately 98p in the pound there, and approximately 65p or 70p here, that anyone who paid so much was mad. He was the leader of the Labour Party and a putative Prime Minister. Whenever we talk about tax evasion and avoidance, we seem to forget the context in which this all happened. We had punitive rates of tax in this country, and the tax burden has been significantly reduced, with most of the change occurring during the lifetime of this Government. We now have the lowest tax regime in Europe. People can argue around that statistic, but it is a fact. They now have far more choice over how they spend their money than ever before, something true in comparison with citizens of other EU countries and beyond.</P>
      <P>This motion is in two parts. On the one hand it is about social welfare fraud, which is totally separate from Revenue investigations. I came to the conclusion that it was a little like why the United States holds on to the death penalty. It is not about justice or fair play but about revenge. The view is that one should go after those people with all the money &mdash; all those multi-millionaires and billionaires. It is seen as disgraceful and outrageous that they have made all that money and are now trying to diddle the country out of its tax revenue.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am reminded a little of Ian Paisley speaking after the initial attempts at agreement last December. He wanted sackcloth and ashes, photographs and blood on the floor. That seems to me to be the motive underlying the <Col N="219"/>motion. The Minister addressed this point so well that I will not elaborate. The wording in the motion before this House includes the following - &ldquo;believes that the failure to prosecute tax offenders represents a deliberate decision to protect the well off from the full rigours of the law&rdquo;. Senator Ryan can dress it up any way he chooses; it states specifically, unambiguously and without equivocation that the Government complies with the wishes of vested interests on the question of tax avoidance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">If the Senator believes that, he and I are on a different side of the line. That is why I am here and the Senator on the other side of the House. I am no expert in this area, but I suggest that social welfare fraud is easier to detect. As all Members agree, social welfare fraud involves taking money from the State to which one is not entitled. It is not any more complex than this in that a person is either employed or unemployed. If unemployed, one is entitled to welfare assistance. However, a person working in the black market has no such entitlement. Nor is a person who has no physical disability and is able to work entitled to claim disability allowance. The structure and architecture of the social welfare system means there are regional and local officers with the resources to investigate the circumstances of social welfare applicants. Nobody can have much sympathy for those who must repay moneys or are stopped from taking further contributions to which they are not entitled.</P>
      <P Just="Left">However, I have some sympathy with the sentiments expressed by Opposition Members in so far as it seems unfortunately to be part of western European culture that it is invariably those who have little resources who end up before the courts.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that totally. I often wonder at the cases one reads about in newspapers of people living on the margins who have been imprisoned because they were perhaps driven by need to engage in social welfare fraud. On the other hand, a person in an important corporate position who has been involved in wrongdoing will not usually end up in the same situation. There are two types of cases.</P>
      <P>However, we as politicians should not go down the road of questioning the separation of powers. If the law is not right and is in any way distinguishing between those who are well off and those who are disadvantaged, we as politicians have a moral obligation to change it. I advise Senator Ryan that cursing the dark is not the way <Col N="220"/>forward. In addressing the last part of the Opposition motion, the Minister outlined in detail all that the Government has done in this area. It is taking the necessary steps, including legislation, to ensure that tax offenders are prosecuted through the courts. The caveat is that there seems to be a widespread perception that a person with money will avoid penal sanctions while those without are more likely to be given a custodial sentence.</P>
      <P>I repeat the question put by Senator Mansergh. Why is there such an obsession with putting people in prison? As the Minister of State observed, the <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> of the Revenue Commissioners is to collect tax. If they can successfully reclaim the tax owed by a person and extract suitable penalties, where is the logic in calling for a custodial sentence? The type of philosophy embodied in this motion is illogical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I fully support this self-explanatory motion. There is no doubt that the State has come down heavily on social welfare fraud in the last number of years. It is right that it should do so. Between them, the 259 people brought before the courts for welfare fraud fiddled more than &euro;1 million, an average of &euro;70 per week per person. Of this number, 36 were imprisoned. I have no problem with that. However, if one agrees that social welfare fraud should be eliminated, one must also agree that fraud should be stamped out in all other areas.</P>
      <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General found that no less than &euro;173 million in tax was written off because it was considered too difficult to collect it from the fraudsters who had fiddled the State through non-payment of VAT, PAYE and so on. How many of these fraudsters were jailed? Certainly fewer than the 36 who were imprisoned for social welfare fraud. The message this conveys to the public is that it is advisable to evade tax, salt the money away or, better still, use it to cut prices so that competitors can be driven out of business and one&rsquo;s own prices can ultimately be raised. The chances of getting caught are small enough to make crime pay for these people.</P>
      <P>Enjoying only meagre resources, the Revenue faces legions of companies subcontracting to other firms which in turn subcontract again to smaller operators. If the Revenue catches up with a person who is evading tax at this stage, he or she can pay what is due and that will be the end of it. This is not the case for those found guilty of social welfare fraud. Senator Mansergh has said it is better to name and shame people and recover the moneys owed to the State. I agree this is fair. However, why is the same process not open to the those who engage in social welfare fraud? Instead of imprisoning them, can the moneys overpaid to such persons not be recovered through a weekly deduction from their social welfare payment? Everybody must be treated equally under the system.</P>

      <P>Other Members have observed that it seems possible to evade tax if one is able to employ tax consultants and the best lawyers. The objective should be equity and consistency in the system, not revenge. Senator Mooney got carried away when he spoke about death sentences in the United States. That is nonsense. There must be equity in the way the State deals with both rich and poor and consistency in the manner in which fraudsters are penalised. This does not seem to the case at present. There is still a perception that there is one law for the rich and another for the poor and it is difficult to refute this when one observes what is happening in the different areas of Revenue and social welfare. Some &euro;173 million in evaded tax can be written off by Revenue while 36 of those found guilty of social welfare fraud are imprisoned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>It is good that this debate is taking place. The motion and amendment provide an extreme contrast. The many discussions, revelations, tribunals and so on that have taken place in recent years make it clear that, in the past, two Irelands existed when it came to tax evasion. The debate has been about whether wealthy people who evaded tax escaped custodial sentences because they had sufficient money to go to court, unlike recipients of social welfare who did not have access to the same resources. Senator Mansergh questioned whether the custodial sentence was fundamental to the debate. I prefer people to pay their debt to society in a way that does not cost society more money.</P>
      <P>The thing which worries wealthy people most is publicity, whether it be in the form of naming and shaming or community work. I have not often read of a wealthy person doing community <Col N="222"/>service, but I have read of several reports involving poorer persons. I do not know why that should be. Community service should be productive and tangible and the community should be aware it is taking place. In that context if there are inadequacies in the sentencing regime I suggest that wealthy people be seen to give that tangible service. Many of these people, owing to their position and wealth, have many skills that the community may be lacking or cannot afford and if that person has to show up at a given time to provide those services free of charge and in the public gaze it would be an effective deterrent, not only to that person but to the people who observe it and who might have similar orientation.</P>
      <P>There are two Irelands when it comes to the law. People with money are generally in a better position to defend themselves and to fudge and delay charges. There are several such cases at present. As for tax evasion, we are living in a totally different Ireland from the one we lived in ten or 15 years ago. It is certainly more transparent. I do not think we can be more draconian in the legislation we have provided to the Revenue Commissioners. Sometimes, indeed, we are sailing close to the wind of entrapping relatively innocent people, for there are such people. Only two weeks ago a woman visited me who was extremely distraught because she was caught up in a tax issue. She was a hard working woman and certainly not a millionaire and the amount in question was very small. She had worked very hard in a little business of her own, which I will not mention. Her whole world had fallen in on her and her biggest worry was that her name would be published in the newspapers. Her worry was not for herself but that her family might also feel stigmatised as a result.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Minister said due process had to be at the heart of the system at all times. I fear that the more we clamour for draconian measures there is a danger we will push legislation to the limit. I am not suggesting that the Labour Party or the Opposition in general want them but a clamour has been generated by the media, by talk shows and by vox pops. I do not think such measures would serve the country or individuals well.</P>
      <P>It is very difficult for the Revenue Commissioners to bring a case to a stage when they can bring it to a court of law. The documentation they require in order to pursue a prosecution may not be immediately available, deliberately or otherwise. Witnesses one would expect to come forward, particularly in a case of an errant employer, may not be available. I fear we might cut corners in the process and that due process itself would suffer as a result. It will not be the big person who will suffer in that scenario but the small person.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I sensed a reticence in the arguments of Fine Gael Members. They supported the essence of the motion but at the same time tried to balance it to ensure that what I envisage will not come to <Col N="223"/>pass. This debate should have taken place without a comparison between social welfare fraud and tax evasion as it has distracted from more fundamental issues. I empathise with the arguments about social welfare recipients. We need to be careful that the small person does not suffer through lack of support or legal protection. The two issues are too far apart.</P>
      <P>We should return to the fundamental principle that everybody should pay his or her fair share of tax. It should be transparent and there should be no room for escape. The maximum legislation, that will ensure due process is observed, should be made available and fine tuned if necessary. I have not heard the Revenue Commissioners asking for extra powers. They have recouped &euro;2 billion in seven years, which is a lot of money. There have been many successful cases. There may be a shortage of inspectors but I understand that is being addressed as well. Everybody in this country is likely to get an audit once in every three years. That is a long way from where we were when people might not have a tax audit in their entire life.</P>
      <P>I understand approximately 50% of Revenue resources in the south east were directed toward the construction industry. I worry that we might automatically assume a subcontractor is evading tax. The subcontractor plays a significant role in the construction industry and the development of the country and should be given the benefit of the doubt. Just because there may be a central contractor evading tax we should not assume the subcontractor is guilty by association. It is clear the Revenue Commissioners are prioritising resources in this area.</P>
      <P>The debate is good but we should have focused more on fine tuning the procedures to ensure nobody slips through the net but that due process will apply. The people who suffer from this abuse are invariably the weaker people, in a social welfare context, who do not have sufficient money to defend themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank everybody for participating in the debate, even those who disagreed with me. I especially thank Senator Norris for being swayed by Senator Mansergh into supporting the Labour Party, and I thank Senator Mansergh for his contribution to the improvement of numbers on this side of the argument.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I would like 20 minutes to reply to each point raised, but I will instead make a few specific points on issues that crossed my mind as I listened to my colleagues debating. In the 1980s, those on the left such as myself were accused of living in cloud cuckoo land when we stated that the country was awash with tax evasion. Even when evidence of inconsistencies were produced, we were told it was the product of imagination. It took years to discover that the country had so <Col N="224"/>much tax evasion. Everybody denied it and denounced it as fiction, including Governments and Revenue Commissioners. It was argued that there was no pool of untaxed income or other forms of revenue out there. There was, however, an enormous pool of such money.</P>
      <P>I deliberately left income tax out of this debate, although people such as Senator Mooney are bringing up my begrudgery towards people who make much money. The good example is not income tax where one can argue forever about who has the right to specific money, but the theft of VAT. When VAT is collected and not transmitted to the State, an act of fraud and theft has been carried out. When somebody does business and does not charge VAT, it is essentially theft from competitors, as the person or company is taking an illegal and fraudulent competitive advantage. Why should people who carry out these actions not be brought before the courts? I do not care if they go to prison as long as we stop sending social welfare recipients to prison as well. According to overwhelming evidence, prison does not work and serves no purpose in correcting people. I have the least amount of interest in seeing elderly gentlemen, be they former<?oasys _jy?>Taoisigh in this country or former presidents of Chile, go to prison in their old age.</P>
      <P>I have interest in creating a public perception that if an offence is committed, whether a person ends up in court is entirely unrelated to whether he or she is rich or poor. A person should go to court, be charged and be punished in accordance to the offence, be it fraud, theft or something else. It should not matter where that person comes from. I was outraged some years ago by a person who defrauded a major charity having a queue of eminent people looking to give character references.</P>
      <P>With regard to arguing whether a person should go to prison or be punished, it has been argued by some lawyers that their client has come from a good family and should not go to prison. Logically speaking, those who come from good families should be further up the queue for punishment than those who did not get a good chance in their life. I have a view on the prison system and I will not allow it to be distorted in this debate.</P>
      <P>Why is it that the Revenue Commissioners see the deliberate theft involved in VAT fraud as being unworthy of prosecution? According to statistics, 31 cases were accepted for investigation for prosecution by the appropriate section of the Revenue Commissioners in 2004. In the same year, 476 cases were referred to the Chief State Solicitor for prosecution for social welfare offences. The prison issue should be omitted as it is to a degree a red herring. Fifteen times more people were threatened with prosecution for social welfare fraud than for tax fraud. I want to know why this is so.</P><Col N="225"/>
      <P Just="Left">The Minister was at his most lugubrious in stating that: &ldquo;I know of no evidence that would support this unwarranted allegation. Surely the Senators who put down that motion should think again about this wording, which strikes me as entirely inappropriate." When I hear a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister state something such as this, I know I have been successful in making a point. The wording of the motion is entirely appropriate as it is within the Government&rsquo;s power to insist that people should be prosecuted wherever they are discovered. I can only imagine what would come about if the Garda stopped prosecuting people for fraud generally, provided these people paid the money back along with a penalty. Again, I can only imagine what would occur if white-collar criminals knew that if they were caught they could pay back the money along with a penalty of 50%, for example.</P>
      <P>Every person who settled with the Revenue Commissioners could do so, and we do not know how much money they managed to make from the sum of money that was not paid ten years ago, for example. How much money could a person have made in ten years if, for example, &euro;1 million was put into property? The property could be worth &euro;10 million at this stage because of the property boom. The person would have avoided <Col N="226"/>&euro;1 million in tax and paid back &euro;2 million, leaving a clear profit of &euro;8 million. We should not grieve too much over penalties, which would have been paid by people who could afford to pay them.</P>
      <P>This is a fundamental point, rather than the issue of imprisonment, punishment, vengeance, greed or envy. Two different organs of the State, both accountable to Government and allegedly implementing policy, take entirely different views on dealing with criminal activity. One prosecutes almost 500 people, the other considers prosecuting 31.</P>
      <P>If it is not a matter of policy, the Revenue Commissioners are out of control. If the Revenue Commissioners are subject to legislation and general oversight by the Oireachtas and the Government, it is a matter of policy. This amounts to a policy to prosecute the poor and be lenient on the rich. This relates to the motion.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to the House. As he will be aware, an expert group on midwifery and children&rsquo;s nursing convened in September 2004. The primary objective of this group was to develop a comprehensive strategy for the future of midwifery and children&rsquo;s nursing education. The group reported in December 2004 and there can be few groups which have ever reported more quickly on such complex issues. I suspect, however, that it did so because it was aware of the serious situation regarding the lack of midwives and children&rsquo;s nurses in this country.</P>
      <P>In 2002, general nursing, psychiatric nursing and nursing for those with intellectual disabilities was made a four-year degree course in some of our universities. This meant that it looked far less attractive to go into midwifery and children&rsquo;s nursing after doing a degree course than it had been in the past. This group was examining what recommendations should be made concerning the teaching of midwifery and children&rsquo;s nursing. There was a severe shortage in both nursing categories.</P>
      <P>The expert group&rsquo;s main recommendations sought a four-year degree course in midwifery and a four and a half-year course in general and children&rsquo;s nursing. It was recommended that such courses start in September 2005 by direct entry to third level institutions. It was recognised that making nursing a degree level qualification had raised standards substantially.</P>
      <P>NUI, Galway, NUI, Cork, the University of Limerick, UCD and Trinity College were nominated as institutions where midwifery could be studied. This plan was to be associated with the relevant health service providers. Children&rsquo;s nursing was proposed for UCD, Trinity College and NUI, Cork also in conjunction with the relevant health service providers.</P>
      <P>A memorandum of understanding was to have been drawn up with the universities. It was reckoned that this would take approximately eight months because they would have to know what finances were available to recruit staff and so forth. It was hoped that these courses would be in place this year. However, we are still in the same position as we were in December 2004. We still have a situation where, in order to obtain a registered midwifery degree, one must do a four-year course as a general nurse followed by two years to become a midwife. The expert group recommended that if this was to continue, the latter period should be cut to 18 months and, instead of having to do another two years for children&rsquo;s nursing, it should be one year.</P>
      <P>We do not seem to be any further on than we were at the end of last year. The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children has told the <Col N="228"/>Irish Nurses Organisation that she would ensure the necessary funding would be written into the Book of Estimates, but all this is rather vague.</P>
      <P>I admit that I have an interest as a member of the midwifery committee of the Rotunda Hospital, as well as being on that hospital&rsquo;s board. We have a really serious situation regarding the lack of midwives. One cannot tell babies to put off being born. Unfortunately, that is an impossibility. At the same time, there is a great shortage of specialised children&rsquo;s nurses. From time to time, one hears that children&rsquo;s investigations and operations are put off. The final recommendation of the expert group&rsquo;s 51 recommendations reads: &ldquo;The expert group recommends that a national committee, chaired by the Department of Health and Children, be established to oversee the implementation of the recommendations set out in this report.&rdquo; If that does not happen immediately, we will not be in a position to have an intake for these courses if they are set up in 2006. I look forward to hearing what the Minister of State has to say on what the Department has done about these recommendations.</P>

	<P>I welcome this opportunity to provide an update on the implementation of the recommendations of the expert group on midwifery and children&rsquo;s nursing education. The expert group was established in September 2004 to develop a comprehensive strategy for the future of midwifery and children&rsquo;s nursing. This follows the introduction in 2002 of the four-year undergraduate nursing degree programme in general, psychiatric and intellectual disability nursing.</P>
      <P>The group comprised representatives from the Department of Health and Children, the education sector, health service providers and unions. It was established in response to concerns about the capacity of the current system of education to produce an adequate supply of midwives and children&rsquo;s nurses to respond to existing and future needs within a changing health service.</P>
      <P>As Senator Henry indicated, the group presented its report to the T&aacute;naiste in late December 2004. The major recommendation is the introduction of a four-year undergraduate midwifery degree programme, offering 140 places available per annum and a four and a half-year integrated children&rsquo;s-general nursing degree programme offering 110 places available per annum.</P>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste welcomed the report of the expert group. She is committed to implementing those recommendations of the report relating to the undergraduate midwifery and integrated children&rsquo;s-general nursing degree programmes. While it is the intention that both programmes would commence in autumn 2006, there are issues which are of concern to the T&aacute;naiste. These include, in particular, the scale of the additional costs identified for the implementation of the two programmes, having regard to the significant <Col N="229"/>infrastructural and other resources already in place to support undergraduate nursing education.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health and Children is currently involved in negotiations with the third level sector to reduce the costs being sought by the higher education institutions for the transfer of midwifery and children&rsquo;s nursing education to the third level sector. The Department has also consulted with the Department of Education and Science, the Higher Education Authority and the Health Service Executive regarding this issue.</P>
      <P>It is the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s view that regard must be had to the capital investment of over &euro;240 million, which has been committed by the Government in recent years for the provision of new, purpose built infrastructure for undergraduate nursing students with state-of-the-art clinical skills and human science laboratories. The T&aacute;naiste hopes, as I do, that the current negotiations will result in a reduction of costs and will provide a way forward for the introduction of the midwifery and integrated children&rsquo;s general nursing degree programmes in autumn 2006.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I ask him to remind the T&aacute;naiste that the population has increased greatly, the birth rate is increasing and women need assistance when giving birth. It is not right to take midwives from developing countries. I am sure neither he nor the T&aacute;naiste would like to see that practice continue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like the Minister for Finance to outline the recent policy changes regarding the taxation of expenses for members of boards of governors of the institutes of technology and the VECs who sit on interview panels. I also ask the Minister to treat the issue with consideration and flexibility. For years it has been accepted practice that members of bodies receive their expenses at agreed rates on a tax-free basis. All employees in the country, including officials from the Department of Finance, are entitled to receive expense allowances on an unvouched basis from their employers for travel and subsistence when away from the office or place of work when on business.</P>
      <P>I understand the change in attitude came about because the place of work, as in this case, is an institute of education which has asked members of its board to attend an interview away from that institution. These members do not have offices at these institutions and will travel from their homes or, depending on the time of day, from their places of work to the place where the interviews are being held. In my opinion this is a unique employment situation and I believe it should be treated by the Revenue Commissioners as such and should not be covered by the general rules applying to the payment of expenses by employers.</P><Col N="230"/>
      <P>It is in the country&rsquo;s best interest to get people of such high calibre to serve on boards. I go so far as to say that it is essentially a voluntary contribution. It is advantageous to have an input on interview panels from laypeople who are not full-time academics or officials. We must do all in our power to encourage participation by local representatives and laypeople in these activities. Dare I say that none of them is getting too rich or is ever likely to get rich on the small expenses paid. These people are not looking for an increase in expenses. They are just asking that the <i>status quo</i> should remain.</P>
      <P>The Department should encourage the Revenue Commissioners to take the view that this is a unique activity and should not be compared with the generality of the employment rule. We are all aware of the replacement of the health boards with the HSE. We do not yet have local representatives sitting on the HSE, which is causing uproar in many counties as no feedback is coming back. When local issues need to be addressed nobody knows where to go. If we do not do something about this change in taxation we will not have local and lay representation sitting on boards, which would be a shame. While the Revenue Commissioners may have a legal basis for their interpretation I ask them to tread carefully as we do not know where this will stop and we could end up with no lay or local representation on these very valuable boards, which play a very important role and give outstanding services to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am making this reply on behalf of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen. There has been no change in taxation legislation or policy regarding the basic rules governing expenses for members of boards of governors and VECs who sit on interview panels. While the reimbursement to an employee of expenses of travel is a matter for the relevant body or employer, a separate and distinct issue is the tax treatment of such reimbursement. Day to day decisions regarding the tax treatment of expenses are matters for the Revenue Commissioners and they have set out their practice in this regard in their publications. The Minister for Finance will arrange for copies of the relevant material to be sent to the Senator for her information and I will give an overview of the position.</P>
      <P>The basis for the reimbursement tax-free of expenses of travel and subsistence is as follows: the officeholder or employee must have a statutory entitlement to a tax deduction in respect of the travel expenses &mdash; in particular, the travel expenses must be necessarily incurred in the performance of the duties of the office or employment; the subsistence expenses must be incurred for that travel; and for ease of administration, rather than have employers deduct tax at source from the reimbursement of expenses of travel and subsistence and the officeholders and employees submitting individual claims to their tax office for a tax deduction in respect of such expenses, the <Col N="231"/>regulations governing the operation of the PAYE system empower Revenue to disregard certain expenses payments as emoluments for tax purposes. Hence employers may, within certain limits, reimburse to officeholders and employees the expense of travel and subsistence relating to that travel necessarily incurred in the performance of their duties without deductions at source under the PAYE system.</P>
      <P>In most instances, therefore, officeholders and employees who bear the cost of the travel and subsistence will be reimbursed by their employer in respect of qualifying expenses of travel necessarily incurred in the performance of the duties of their office or employment on the basis of either an acceptable flat-rate allowance up to, but not exceeding, the prevailing Civil Service rates for travel and subsistence or the actual expenses vouched with receipts, and Revenue will not seek to have tax applied to the amount of the reimbursement.</P>
      <P>However, it is long established principle of tax case law that the expense of travelling from home to the normal place of work and from that place of work to home is not treated as an expense of travelling necessarily incurred in the performance of the duties of that office or employment, so an individual cannot claim a tax deduction or receive a payment tax-free in respect of such expense. In addition, where an individual holds more than one office or employment, a tax deduction may not be claimed and expenses may not be paid tax-free in respect of the expense of travel between those separate offices or employments.</P>
      <P>While I have summarised the position regarding expenses payments, one cannot, without knowing the precise circumstances surrounding the interview panels on which members of boards of governors or VECs sit, give a definitive view of the appropriate tax treatment of the expenses paid in respect of such interviews. This will be determined by the facts of the individual case, including whether the person concerned is travelling as a member of a board of governors of VEC to his or her normal place of work in that capacity, or to another place, and if to another place, whether this represents a temporary absence from the normal place of work for the purpose of performing the duties of the board or VEC of which he or she is a member, and also whether the membership of the interview panel concerned in effect constitutes a separate engagement of the person.</P>
      <P>The onus is on employing organisations to ensure that their practices are in line with Revenue rules. In some cases an incorrect tax treatment can come to light, for example, from an audit by the employer&rsquo;s own auditors or from an audit carried out by the Revenue Commissioners. While such events can give rise to changes in that employer&rsquo;s practice to bring him or her back into compliance, these do not themselves arise from any change in the underlying legislation. The Minister for Finance has been <Col N="232"/>informed by the Revenue Commissioners that if the Senator has a particular case in mind, they would be happy to examine such case and make a determination as to the correct tax treatment of the reimbursement of expenses in such case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the opportunity to raise one of the most important issues facing our economy which also challenges our sense of social justice. This is about protecting workers, Irish and foreign, and about protecting families, our economy and our sense of social fairness. I refer to the current crisis at Irish Ferries. I can hardly overstate my concern and that of the Progressive Democrats at claims of sharp business practices at Irish Ferries. The idea that a profitable company can decide to force workers to choose between redundancy or poorer conditions without even the perception of fairness is totally unacceptable. I have raised the matter on the Adjournment to allow the Minister for State to outline the implications of the recent crisis for labour force protection and relevant national and European legislation.</P>
      <P>It is crucial that we keep repeating the message that we are disgusted by alleged moves at Irish Ferries, or any company, to replace workers under the guise of dubious tactics. I understand that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment received legal advice at the end of June last year regarding the applicability of Irish terms and conditions of employment aboard ships, both in respect of Irish-registered vessels and foreign-registered vessels.</P>
      <P>With regard to foreign-registered vessels, legal advice received appears to suggest that if terms and conditions of employment issues arise on foreign-registered ships, they are a matter for the flag state in accordance with international maritime law and practice. I am asking for clarification on this matter from the Department and an update on an EU directive on manning conditions for regular passenger and ferry services operating between member states drafted in April 1998, the so-called ferries directive. It is unacceptable that workers, Irish or otherwise, can be abused with impunity because of a the use of what is termed a &ldquo;flag of convenience&rdquo;. That must stop.</P>
      <P>The implications are far broader than might first be obvious. On the one hand we have the work and service of Irish people being completely undermined. They are being treated on a take it or leave it approach. On the other hand, workers from other countries, who are in less fortunate economic circumstances, are being asked to work in the same jobs for around half the Irish minimum wage, at &euro;3.60 an hour.</P>
      <P>I have heard, as have many, the Irish Ferries rebuttal, and I say to the company only that the <Col N="233"/>minimum wage is exactly that &mdash; the minimum. I am concerned for the welfare of Irish and foreign workers alike. In the media in recent days I have heard the Progressive Democrats being described by those on the political left as encouraging some sort of economic race to the bottom. It would be laughable were the situation not so serious. The Progressive Democrats support competition as the best way of driving efficiencies in the economy. This is a policy that has seen approximately 400,000 more people at work now than in 1997. At the same time we have reviewed and tightened provisions for the protection of workers. No other Government has done more to guard workers from inappropriate employer practices, and I hope we will continue in that manner.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State to outline the implications of, and lessons from, the recent crisis at Irish Ferries for labour force protection and relevant national and European legislation, including the future of the ferries directive. I also ask him to outline what further steps are planned to ensure that all workers, Irish and from overseas, have adequate protection from sharp labour practices, bullying and intimidation in the workplace. This is currently a ferries issue, a union issue and a social partnership issue but, most importantly, it is an issue of fairness and social justice. We must send a clear message from this House that we abhor sharp labour practices and will do all we can to prevent them and stamp them out.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Morrissey for raising this issue which has caused great public concern in recent weeks. The House is well aware of the speculation surrounding the affairs at Irish Ferries and in particular the intolerable consequences for the staff who, against a background of threats to their livelihood, are being asked to take very important decisions regarding their future.</P>
      <P>Issues such as those which have arisen between Irish Ferries and their staff need to be addressed in the first instance within the organisation, which is the legal requirement with regard to most other sectors of employment under the Protection of Employment Act 1977. The parties involved have the assistance of the State&rsquo;s industrial relations machinery in addressing such issues.</P>
      <P>My Department sought and received legal advice at the end of June 2004 regarding the applicability of Irish terms and conditions of employment aboard ships, both in respect of Irish-registered vessels and foreign-registered vessels. In the case of Irish-registered vessels, the legal advice was that, so far as the terms and conditions of employees on an Irish registered vessel are concerned, if the owner of the vessel is an Irish individual or body corporate, the employees on the vessel are subject to the provisions of Irish law whether in Irish territorial waters or on the high seas. The same would be true when an Irish-registered vessel is in the internal waters of <Col N="234"/>another state. Accordingly, workers from outside the EU working on Irish-registered vessels are also covered by Irish employment rights legislation by virtue of section 20 of the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001 which provides that the full range of Irish employee legislation applies to foreign workers posted to work in or otherwise working in this country.</P>
      <P>The legal advice received on foreign registered ships indicates that as a general rule the flag state, the state where the ship is registered, has the exclusive right to exercise legislative and enforcement jurisdiction over its ships on the high seas. The legal advice received suggests that if terms and conditions of employment issues arise on foreign-registered ships, they are a matter for the flag state in accordance with international maritime law and practice. These arrangements apply internationally and Ireland is not an exception in this area.</P>
      <P>While recognising the exceptional situation that has arisen in the maritime sector, the full panoply of Irish employment law still applies to persons employed in Ireland, regardless of nationality. This body of law is and will continue to be enforced.</P>
      <P>Governments cannot, of course, prevent job losses as such, they are happening every day as enterprises and sectors prosper and decline. However, this is very different from a situation where workers in viable enterprises are deliberately replaced by cheaper labour from other countries. As the Taoiseach told the D&aacute;il earlier today, free access to the Irish labour market by nationals of the new EU member states was not intended to give employers a green light to replace Irish workers with cheaper labour.</P>
      <P>The primary objective of employment rights legislation is to protect employees against arbitrary or capricious behaviour by employers, to protect the safety and health of workers and to foster labour market harmony by promoting policies that minimise conflict and maximise fairness. The consensus on economic and social policy issues that we have had in Ireland through successive national partnership programmes could not have been achieved without the existence of basic social standards. This consensus approach involving employers, employees and Government has been a major contributor to Ireland&rsquo;s recent economic success and has been backed up by a well-balanced suite of employment rights legislation which, together with measures designed to stimulate employment, provides an appropriate framework for achieving an efficient and competitive business environment.</P>
      <P>Employment rights legislation has an important role to play in promoting labour market stability. The economic benefits of employment security and agreed employment relationships in terms of co-operative work place relations, greater internal flexibility, acceptance of technological change, cumulative skills acquisition and greater incentives for investment in human resources are widely recognised and accepted. As Senator <Col N="235"/>Morrissey is no doubt aware, the system of industrial relations in Ireland is essentially voluntary in nature, with terms and conditions of employment of workers being determined in the main by a process of voluntary bargaining without the direct intervention of the State.</P>
      <P>However, the State facilitates the bargaining process by providing a framework and institutions through which good industrial relations can prosper. Institutions have been established that can assist in the resolution of disputes between employers and workers such as the Labour Relations Commission, including its Rights Commissioner service, the Labour Court and the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P><Col N="236"/>
      <P>In this context, Irish Ferries and the unions attended the Labour Court on Monday last, 3 October. Arising from the meeting, the company agreed to enter talks on its proposed redundancy package, aimed at finding agreement by the end of October at the latest. In the light of developments in the last few days, we are now in a situation where normal industrial relations procedures are being followed in the situation at Irish Ferries, which I welcome. The Government will continue to monitor the evolving situation and to consider what further action may be desirable and feasible. I am confident that we will have the full support of the House in this approach.</P>
