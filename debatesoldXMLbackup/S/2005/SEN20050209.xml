	<P>I have received notice from Senator Quinn that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to place an obligation on local water treatment schemes to put in the public domain at regular intervals a full technical analysis of the water provided, such as is provided to French consumers.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Morrissey of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to confirm the decision that has been arrived at in regard to increasing the size of the port tunnel and his reasons for this decision.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Terry of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to ensure the Pensions Boards should be obliged to devote equal funding to the promotion of the disadvantages as well as the advantages of pensions as part of its &euro;500,000 national pensions awareness campaign and that it should provide a warning on all its advertisements that private sector pension benefits are not guaranteed.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Bannon of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to discuss the provisions of essential funding to St. Mary&rsquo;s national school, Drumlish, County Longford, for the employment of a full-time secretary and cleaner.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Brennan of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to outline the position on the proposed study to consider the viability of the proposal to <Col N="434"/>develop a Shannon rail link in consultation with local interests.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Ulick Burke of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to extend medical card coverage to cover cancer sufferers, asthmatics and coeliacs under the GMS.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by Senators Quinn, Morrissey, Terry, Bannon and Ulick Burke as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matters raised by Senators Quinn, Morrissey and Terry and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>
      <P>Senators Bannon and Ulick Burke may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise. I regret that I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Brennan as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Late in the previous D&aacute;il the original Disability Bill was withdrawn by the Government on the basis that substantive negotiations would take place between those who were campaigning for legislation with teeth and a rights-based approach and that the Government would deal one to one with these people to produce a Bill that would be satisfactory to all concerned. However, it has emerged following last night&rsquo;s meeting and the significant campaign that has been mounted against the current Bill that there are problems. Will the Government genuinely sit down one to one with the campaigners on this important Bill to work out a solution with which everyone will be satisfied? The Bill is on Second Stage in the other House and will shortly be sent to committee. The Government said it will consider amendments on Committee Stage but the Bill is important. It has been promised for seven years and I do not want it to become a party political football. It is important that the Government should sit down with the campaigners to work out a solution that has all our support. I ask the Government to consider that in advance of Committee Stage in the other House.</P><Col N="435"/>
      <P>It is reported that Prime Minister Blair will formally apologise to the Conlon family in the House of Commons today for the appalling miscarriage of justice involving those known as the Guildford Four. We all welcome that and the campaign that has been run in Britain and Ireland in recent months by the Conlon family, supported by the SDLP and its leader, Mr. Mark Durkan. The apology is long overdue. Not only should it be given to those directly involved in Guildford, but it should also be given to those involved in all the miscarriages of justice on both islands over the past 20 years given the circumstances that we faced. It is a welcome development and I particularly congratulate the SDLP on its role in ensuring this public apology is made today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Northern issue, in recent times I raised the importance of developing the east-west aspect of the Good Friday Agreement. I have said in a number of places on numerous occasions that I feel we can create progress and a new political impetus from community, professional and economic involvement across the two islands. I felt there was nothing happening in this regard. However, I stand corrected because I have received an extraordinarily interesting letter from Scoil Eoin, Kilbarrack, which explains that it and a number of schools on both islands are involved in a most positive, progressive and encouraging east-west programme through which people talk to each other, explain their communities to each other, meet each other, take joint action on all aspects of community affairs and are publishing a magazine and developing a website. This is the way forward. I spoke to the organising teacher, Mr. Patrick O&rsquo;Donovan, and this project could grow into something big. We should take example from it and do the same at different levels.</P>
      <P>I would welcome a discussion on the east-west aspect of the Good Friday Agreement. It is something I have asked for previously. I believe this initiative is something that could be built on. It is time to resuscitate groups like Anglo-Irish Encounter and, perhaps, to give a different role to the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body in order to make progress. We should involve groups in society in moving matters forward and from this perhaps grow a political impetus.</P>
      <P>I was moved last night to reread a document from over 250 years ago, A Modest Proposal, by Dean Swift, in light of what Mr. Myers said in his newspaper article yesterday. It is strange how biting satire and sarcasm written well will last for over 270 years and make an impact in a way that Mr. Myers never could hope to do in terms of approach and ability. I will read one paragraph from Dean Swift&rsquo;s biting sarcastic vision of how we might deal with the troublesome, unnecessary children in our community. He stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">I have been assured by a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London, that a young healthy child well nursed is at a year <Col N="436"/>old a most delicious, nourishing, and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled: and I make no doubt that it will serve equally well in a fricassee or a ragout.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This is mind-churning and in context shows how a point can be made to extremes that will last over 270 years. I wish Mr. Myers could learn from it.</P>
      <P>I bring to the notice of the House the wise words of a very experienced woman who stopped me in Dublin this morning and said: &ldquo;When I think of Mr. Myers and think that he was created by two parents and brought up by two parents, give me one any time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry I was not here yesterday to say that I fully share the views so well expressed again this morning by Senator O&rsquo;Toole. I add one comment. Great satirical writing that lasts is, inevitably, writing that is a challenge to the powerful. What makes it great writing is that it is well written and challenges the established and powerful. To write well to challenge the least powerful and to humiliate the powerless is an abuse of a talent somebody has the good fortune to have.</P>
      <P>On the question of what people write, I wish to quote some things that have been written. If somebody in this House said &ldquo;the IRA is throwing down a gauntlet to the Irish establishment&rdquo; or that &ldquo;Bertie Ahern has probably pushed the process over the edge by throwing his lot in with the Northern Special Branch and the British military establishment&rdquo;, most of us would be outraged. When that is written by a member of the group of political writers in this House, working for a public sector broadcaster, I take great exception to it. It is the rule of this House that I may not name the individual. However, if anybody wants to know where this was written, I will tell them afterwards. I will not abuse the House. Neither will I abuse my position the way somebody here through public service broadcasting abuses his position and simply says it is his personal opinion.</P>
      <P>Those personal opinions are inseparable from the job that person does as a political journalist and are profoundly wrong. I am not part of any political establishment and neither is anybody else here. We are elected by the people of Ireland. When one flies in the face of the Oireachtas, one flies in the face not of the political establishment, but of the people. Therefore, for political journalists who work in this House to issue such rantings is a disgrace to both politics and journalism. It must stop.</P>
      <P>The city in which I live is currently a tip.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been overwhelmed gradually by rubbish which is now being diligently collected by the city council which then employs people to search through it to find some address so that it can prosecute somebody. Given that local auth<Col N="437"/>orities have managed not to notice hundreds of thousands of tonnes of material being dumped illegally, the diligence is, perhaps, admirable. However, the current system of domestic waste disposal is running into increasing public resistance.</P>
      <P>Around the peripheries of Cork city there is a gradually developing necklace of black bags dumped indiscriminately. I gather the same is true of many of the rural areas on the periphery of Dublin. What is not being dumped is being burned. I invite people to read the Government&rsquo;s website on the Race Against Waste to see the damage caused by backyard burning. Approximately 90% of the dioxins in the atmosphere are a consequence of backyard burning. To be honest, the current strategy is not working. It is not working because it does not have political assent and is being imposed by dictatorial city managers who are not accountable to anybody. If we want to deal with waste, we must re-engage the public. The current situation in which our cities are being turned into dumps&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does Senator Ryan want a debate on the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I want a debate on the issue of domestic waste and, incidentally, the role of Repak in that regard. I have significant questions to ask about Repak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>The apology the British Government will issue today to the family of<?oasys [jy?>Giuseppe Conlon and, hopefully, Annie Maguire is welcome. Giuseppe and Gerry Conlon were both innocent and imprisoned. Giuseppe Conlon was a sick man and died in prison. Annie Maguire was innocent, but her life and that of her family was wrecked. These are but a few cases of the many miscarriages of justice perpetrated by the British justice system against Irish people.</P>
      <P>We owe a debt of gratitude to the campaigners who through the years against all the odds continued to seek justice for people who were helpless and vulnerable. Credit is due to people like the solicitor Gareth Pierce and Niall Andrews and others who were consistent. If we are to show our gratitude for the work they have done, we must be ever on the alert in the future. We must be wary of trial by silence.</P>
      <P>It is important we also protect and uphold the right of due process. I said previously that I believe friendship has grown and strengthened between Ireland and Britain as a result of the peace process. Some obstacles still exist. We must ensure there is closure on the many other cases, including that of the Guildford Four. People are campaigning at the moment on other outstanding miscarriage of justice cases and it is important that we would also become proactive on their behalf. At the end of the day the only hope we have is that we are able to bring closure to the past and that we would have hope for the future.</P><Col N="438"/>
      <P>I am still hopeful that in the very near future all parties and groups can once again sit around the table and continue the good work that has been done. It is very easy at present to forget the progress we have made but nobody wants to go back to the type of life we had on this island ten years ago, to the fear, suspicion, lack of hope and helplessness that existed politically, particularly in the North of Ireland. We will need the same leadership, commitment, patience and persistence that existed heretofore to bring this process to a closure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I support my colleague, Senator Brian Hayes. The Disability Bill was going through both Houses prior to the last election three years ago. It was withdrawn at the time due to concerns expressed by people involved in the disability sector. Many of us considered that all that was behind us. However, a large protest group convened a meeting last night in the RDS because of people&rsquo;s great concern regarding the new Disability Bill. It is not right to reassure them on the basis that their concerns will be teased out on Committee Stage. We need to look seriously at the Bill and see how it can be made compatible with the requirements of those involved in the disability sector. Satisfaction has been expressed at the type of funding that has been programmed for the next few years but concerns exist regarding specific elements of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Problems exist with refuse collection in Cork. Many of us are concerned about the privatisation of services and the cost of refuse collection. A person who pays tax gets a tax credit for payment of a refuse collection charge, up to a maximum of &euro;195 at the standard rate of 20%. However, a pensioner recently pointed out to me how unfair the system is, as he does not get any tax credit or allowance. People now pay between &euro;400 and &euro;500 per year in refuse disposal charges. The sum of &euro;400 per year works out at &euro;8 per week, which is unjust. In the past we were hailed as innovative as we introduced concessions for telephone and electricity charges. It is now time for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to examine this area, especially in regard to old age pensioners, to see if an allowance or subvention could be provided in regard to refuse collection. It is becoming more and more prohibitive for pensioners and others who cannot afford it to pay that type of charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I call on the Leader to provide time for a debate on Iraq at the earliest opportunity, in light of the results of the recent election. The turnout and participation by the electorate was very high against all the odds, intimidation and threat. In that context I am reminded of a letter that appeared on the letters page of one newspaper which quoted from <i>The New York Times</i> in 1967. Reference was made to a high turnout, difficulties of participation and the fine result. That 1967 article referred to South Vietnam. While there has been a major change and a <Col N="439"/>significant move forward in Iraq there are fraught times ahead and we should debate the matter in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I find myself in the happy position of wanting to agree with two of my colleagues on the Fianna F&aacute;il benches. First, I agree with Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, although normally I deprecate the idea of apologies. We have had apologies for the famine and the flood, which are completely irrelevant tripe. However, on this occasion people, some of whom are still alive, suffered a massive injustice so the apology actually has meaning. Mrs. Annie Maguire will be in the lobby of the House of Commons today when this apology is received, which is to be very much welcomed.</P>
      <P>It is also important that we continue to monitor the situation in Northern Ireland. I listened last night to Vincent Browne&rsquo;s radio programme. He asked Danny Morrison a very direct, specific and clear question &mdash; if he believed that the Northern Bank raid was a crime. The answer is very instructive. He said it depended on who did it. As long as we have this kind of morality and definition of criminality, we are in very serious trouble. That appears to me not to be confined to Mr. Morrison, but to be endemic throughout Sinn F&eacute;in. It is a crime if other people did it but it is not a crime if its members did it. That is what vitiated the McCabe trial.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I also agree with Senator Hanafin. He made an extremely good point which is similar to one I wish to make. We should have a debate on the situation in the Middle East, encompassing Israel and Iraq. The real criteria is the welfare and well-being of the people in the Middle East. If that means people like me are proved to have been wrong in certain emphases, what does it matter? The main thing is the welfare of these people. The point Senator Hanafin made was underlined by one of the senior United Nations observers in Iraq at the time of the murder of Mr. de Mello, who said in an article in the <i>International Herald Tribune</i> that elections under hostile occupations should be forbidden since they have no other purpose than to further entrench the occupier&rsquo;s interests. The results are not yet in from the election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Many speakers are offering. Is Senator Norris seeking a debate on this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Can I raise one final point? I heard the Leader of the House on the radio this morning. She performed extremely well. She called for clear and explicit sex education. We should have a debate on that. I was in Waterford a week ago and three wonderful and courageous women from Cork spoke on the issue of sexuality. All three of them had lesbian daughters. One in particular said that her child was doing extremely well until just prior to the intermediate certificate and <Col N="440"/>then everything went disastrously wrong. Her daughter eventually recovered. She was 19 when she told her mother that she was gay although she first realised it when she was 12. The school provided nothing for that child or her parents. The mother attacked the system and asked where was the help from society when they needed it.</P>
      <P>The briefing on the partnership Bill will take place between 3.30 p.m. and 4.30 p.m. in the audio-visual room. I mention that for the information of Members because apparently there was a mistake in one of the e-mails that went around.</P>

	<P>Yes, there are tickets for sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am concerned at the escalating costs of waste water treatment schemes. Will the Leader invite the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the House to discuss deregulation of the cap on grants for small group water schemes, which at present is capped at 85%? Members of small schemes experience great hardship in funding their schemes, especially where old age pensioners form a significant proportion of the applicants. Where there are schemes with fewer than 30 members the 15% cost can mean an extra &euro;2,000 or &euro;3,000 for applicants. The Minister should consider increasing the cap on the grant scheme for small schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>On the relaxation of the retail planning guidelines announced by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, will the Leader seek to clarify if it is the intention that one megastore would be built in each integrated area plan area or is it possible that we could have clusters of them in such designated areas and-or gateway towns?</P>
      <P>Specifically in regard to Ballymun, can she clarify if there will be one store or a number of them in excess of the retail warehouse cap? If so, what will be the consequences of such developments in terms of traffic, land use and impact on town centres? I seek a debate on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader invite the Minister for Transport to the House for a debate on road safety? When we speak of road safety, motorists&rsquo; speed comes to mind but other road users also have to take into consideration that they are not the only ones on the road. I refer to joggers in particular. In their case, the sleeves of the tops they wear often fall down over their armbands, thereby preventing them from being seen. It should be mandatory for people to wear reflective vests. There is also evidence to suggest that many people are buying cars at auctions and putting them on the road without tax or insurance, begging the question as to whether they are roadworthy. These are serious questions about which we should have an early debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I was delighted to hear Senator Glynn refer to road safety, a topic I have raised <Col N="441"/>on many occasions. Sometimes one believes one is not heard or listened to in this House. One of the topics which I raised with a Minister in this House, and about which I wrote an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> some months ago, is the prevention of road accidents by investing in installing speed cameras around the country for safety purposes. I had felt I was not being listened to until I picked up the newspaper this morning to discover that a speed camera blitz is imminent and thousands of speed cameras are to be installed.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to read this because I thought someone was listening to me but, unfortunately, when I read the article further I discovered that the Minister referred to as implementing this scheme is the Minister for Transport in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>He was listening to the Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope he was listening to me. The reason I raise the issue is that the number of deaths on our roads is an issue for which we have a responsibility. We know we can do something about it, that speed cameras are good value for money, that we can invest in such a system and that we must argue very strongly for it. I am delighted to see that the British authorities have decided to do this although I had hoped we could have led the way instead.</P>
      <P>In regard to concept of prevention being better than cure, will the Leader bring to the attention of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, the early warning system which has been launched in Britain? The system is attached to the cots of premature babies and detects their distress rather than heart-stoppage. The difference is that up to now when the heart stopped beating the alarm went off, whereas the alarm now detects when the child is in distress and one can take action ahead of time. When I saw the figures for cystic fibrosis in the Republic of Ireland as compared to those on Northern Ireland I realised we could do something about many diseases by investing in the correct preventive solutions rather than attempting to cure them after the fact.</P>
      <P>Some time ago I read that in China a doctor is not paid on the number of visits on which he or she attends to a patient but rather on the number of days the patient is well and does not have to visit. That seems to me to be the ideal answer &mdash; one pays the doctor for keeping the patient well rather than for attending to the patient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with the comments made by Senators Quinn and Glynn in regard to road safety, which arises regularly.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader consider the extreme but useful practice employed by the Knesset in Israel whereby at the beginning of business each day the names of those killed in road accidents are read out <i>in memoriam</i> by the speaker? It is an acknowledgement of sorts which focuses people&rsquo;s minds on the reality.</P><Col N="442"/>
      <P>I support the comments made on both sides of the House in regard to the acknowledgement by the British Government of the apology to Mrs. Annie Maguire and Giuseppe Conlon. To take up Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;&rsquo;s theme, this is a momentous event when one considers the fraught relations between this country and Britain over many hundreds of years. It follows the apology relating to the Famine from Tony Blair some years ago and is made by a Government rather than an individual.</P>
      <P>A number of courageous people have not been mentioned and should be referred to. Mr. Chris Mullin is the crusading journalist who wrote the book on the Guildford Four case which opened this debate. He later went on to become an MP and a Minister in the Blair Government. Mr. Alistair Logan is the solicitor who represented those involved in the Guildford Four case and travelled repeatedly to this country to attend and speak at public meetings. He is now forgotten in a sense because events have moved on. I also refer to the crusading QC, Michael Mansfield, who represented many Irish people when it was not popular to do so.</P>
      <P>I had only been a Member of this House for a number of months when I and a number of other parliamentarians attended the Birmingham Six appeal hearing in the Old Bailey, which was presided over by Lord Lane, the then British Chief Justice. It was a very chilling experience to hear that appeal being turned down. Ironically, one of the three sitting judges &mdash; there was no jury &mdash; was a Mr. Justice O&rsquo;Connor whose Irish name obviously had no influence on the outrageous conclusion reached at that time. I acknowledge those people &mdash; all of whom are English &mdash; and it is a tremendous tribute to them that they made their case against the mood of the day.</P>
      <P>I lived in England at the time Mrs. Maguire and her family were arrested. The headline in the London <i>Evening Standard</i> following their arrest was &ldquo;Aunt Annie&rsquo;s Bomb Factory&rdquo;. When they were arrested, one of the police constables could not understand why the children had English accents given that they were Irish. The answer was that they had been born and reared in England. Ironically, Mrs. Maguire was a paid-up and active member of the Conservative Party. We should remember these things at this time. This is a momentous day and at least Giuseppe Conlon can now rest in peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>This morning Senators will have received from the Minister for Education and Science a comprehensive list of appointments she has made at national level. Parents, school management boards and principals can have access to those people and resources in respect of special educational needs. However, for this to be fully effective it is important that, in tandem with the initiative, the Minister reviews the Department&rsquo;s current strategy which militates against rural national schools. Many schools have in recent months received notification from the Depart<Col N="443"/>ment that they are to lose resource teachers or special needs assistants.</P>
      <P>While there is a very fine plan for access and assessment of needs, assessing people without follow-up implementation is of very little value. In that context, will the Leader ask the Minister for Education and Science to review the plan which militates against rural national schools and the appointment of personnel in order to provide facilities as they were heretofore, although patchy, to children with special needs in national schools in rural Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with other speakers in requests for a debate on waste management. My native city is not a tip and I do not support that contention. The vast majority of people in Cork support and comply with the waste management strategy and are law abiding. There are a few dissenters but the onus on us is to support the democratically-elected councils and managers. To suggest that we have dictatorial managers is unfair and untrue. Managers have a difficult job and such comments are unhelpful to people who are trying to comply with and support the wishes of an elected council such as Cork City Council.</P>
      <P>There will always be difficulties in the area of waste management. I welcome a debate on the issue as it would give the House an opportunity to examine the finer points of such a strategy. Equally, I join with other speakers in welcoming the apology today by the British Prime Minister. However, we should not forget that the real perpetrators of the crimes of which those innocent people were wrongly accused were known to the Provisional IRA whose members happily allowed them to serve long periods in jail.</P>

	<P>I wish to put a housekeeping question to the Leader. Several committees of the Houses sit this week. Of these, the Committees on Procedure and Privileges, Agriculture and Food and Broadcasting and Parliamentary Information will sit in private. I do not understand why any committee must sit in private.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I add my voice to those who request a debate on the waste collection issue. It is remiss of the House not to acknowledge the crisis in waste management. Waste management strategies of various local authorities have been given an added bump by the Government. The former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, took the decision-making ability to set waste disposal charges from elected members of local authorities. The role of local government was depleted while adding a bureaucratic layer of dictatorship that decided the price of refuse collection, with a like it or lump it attitude. The same local authorities have failed miserably in providing alternate methods of recycling. I would welcome a debate on this topic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Brian Hayes, the Leader of the Opposition, spoke about the previous Disability Bill, withdrawn at the end of the last D&aacute;il session. A campaign has started regarding the new Disability Bill. He correctly stated that it should not become a party political issue. Today, I read a report that former Senator, Maurice Manning, is the head of a body that has started a public debate on the issue. The Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Fahey, who is responsible for the Bill, stated he would consider any submissions. Meetings with interested parties were undertaken when the Bill was being fashioned. While it may need further refinement, I am sure the Government is keen to speak to anyone wishing to put forward a case on the Bill. Fundamental differences may be beginning to emerge. The Government laid out its stall with various statements last October when it presented the Bill. However, there is room for further consultation.</P>
      <P>Senator Brian Hayes also welcomed Prime Minister Tony Blair&rsquo;s forthcoming formal apology and hoped that Annie Maguire will be included in it. He also welcomed, as do I, the <Col N="445"/>input of the SDLP in the matter. It was one of those cases it took up and stayed with throughout the years.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole has constantly spoken about the need for the east-west dimension to be highlighted in the peace process . He also referred to Scoil Eoin in Kilbarrack which has made out an excellent agenda for work with other schools along these lines. There are a large number of activities going on that we do not know about but are indicative of what ordinary people are endeavouring to do. There must be some way this can be highlighted to get over the current impasse and get the process back on an even keel. Work in this area is also being done by local authorities and others. The Senator&rsquo;s remarks about Dean Swift were apt. A proper satirist uses extreme examples so that one knows he or she does not mean it but instead one is taken by the language. This was different from yesterday&rsquo;s article in <i>The Irish Times</i>. No doubt there will be more anon about that.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan stated that great satirical writing is normally directed against the powerful in society. Yesterday&rsquo;s column in <i>The Irish Times</i> was not. He referred to an article written by a political journalist in the Houses but I have not read the article. The Senator referred to the domestic refuse collection in Cork city being in disarray resulting in the city becoming a tip. A debate has begun about refuse collection. I believe the system of waste collection should be more uniform. In Westmeath, we have a sensible system where one pays each time one puts a bin out for collection. It seems to be the most sensible system as it caters for small families who may not need to put a bin out very often. I agree we should debate waste management with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
      <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; welcomed the forthcoming apology to the Conlon family. A debt of gratitude is owed to campaigners, such as Gareth Pierce and Niall Andrews, for advocating the right of due process. However, many other outstanding cases remain. The Senator hoped this would lead to all parties and groups coming together again but it will require patience and perseverance. I share the Senator&rsquo;s admiration when one thinks of the patience and the perseverance of the people representing these groups displayed in the pursuit of their cases.</P>
      <P>Senator Finucane supported Senator Brian Hayes&rsquo;s comments on the Disability Bill. However, we cannot have a debate on this as it is still before the Lower House. He also perceived the refuse collection system to be unjust. If there were a more equitable nationwide system, there would be greater regard for it.</P>
      <P>Senator Hanafin called for a debate on Iraq which Senator Bradford raised yesterday. I commented then that the results of the election have not yet been declared. It would be a more informed debate were we to have the results.</P><Col N="446"/>
      <P>Senator Norris agreed with Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and spoke about the definition of criminality. He called for a debate on both Israel and Iraq. I agree we should debate these matters when the time is right, hopefully by next week when the results will be known.</P>
      <P>Senator Brennan raised the issue of caps on funding for group water schemes and asked that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government inform the House about the available grants for the schemes.</P>
      <P>Senator Coghlan inquired about the relaxation of planning guidelines regarding IKEA and asked whether there would be clusters of stores in every gateway town. We will endeavour to have the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government attend the House to answer these questions.</P>
      <P>Senator Glynn called for a debate on road safety and motor tax and insurance, matters which were raised yesterday by Senator Moylan. The Driver Testing and Standards Authority Bill is on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il and it will soon be before this House. It will cover the debate being sought.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn spoke of how authorities in the UK are investing in more speed cameras. He also brought to our attention an early warning system for premature births that may later lead, sadly, to cot deaths. He also claimed that doctors should be paid for keeping patients well. I agree but much of keeping well is due to the individual and how he or she copes with ill health. Considering the difficulties with medical people, I do not know if they would take kindly to his proposals.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney noted that the Knesset reads out daily the names of people killed in traffic accidents. He also mentioned the matter of apologies to the Conlon family and we must also remember the courageous people who have lobbied and worked hard on their behalf over the years, including Chris Mullin, Alistair Logan, Michael Mansfield and many other names we would know of from listening to the radio and reading their articles. Those who took up such causes were unsupported at the time yet what they said has all been proved correct since then.</P>
      <P>We all received the document mentioned by Senator Ulick Burke. It was very interesting and we all turned to see what was being made available to our own counties. He noted that the special educational needs system, because of the nature of the strategy, currently discriminates against rural national schools and that this should be addressed.</P>
      <P>Senator Minihan called for a debate on waste management, which we should have. He too welcomed the apologies to be made to the Conlon family and I hope to Annie Maguire&rsquo;s family. Senator Ross queried the system of committees sitting in private and he has a point. The Leas-Chathaoirleach correctly informed him that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges always sat in private, but he wants to know why.</P>

	<P>Senator McCarthy asked for a debate on waste management and criticised the bureaucratic layer which has developed because county managers rather than elected representatives now have responsibility for both the pricing and arrangements for waste disposal.

I have no brief to speak for county managers but that was how the situation came about.</P>

    <Title>Privacy and Defamation: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this opportunity to again address Seanad &Eacute;ireann on this topic. Members may recall that I last spoke here in this regard on 9 December 2003, a few days after a major conference which I organised as part of the public consultation process on the topic of defamation.</P>
      <P>Our debate today is on privacy and defamation, which though related are not the same thing. I said during our discussion in December 2003 that I came to the debate with a personal prejudice in favour of free speech and against unnecessary regulation, and as a constitutional republican with liberal values I still hold that point of view. I also wish to ensure that we have a vigorous and inquiring media functioning in our society. What I am attempting to do and will do in the near future is to bring forward a reform which is sufficiently balanced to gain the necessary acceptance both politically and in the community. For that reason I have engaged in a process of public consultation on the subject.</P>
      <P>The broadcast media in this State operating under the broadcasting Acts are statute bound to have regard to ensuring that the privacy of an individual is not unfairly encroached upon in the <Col N="448"/>process of programme making. Remedies are provided for breaches in this regard. I am not aware of any particular difficulties that have arisen for our radio and television stations in that regard but if there are such difficulties I will discuss the matter with the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey. I am confining my approach in these matters largely to the print media though the defamation law applies to all media.</P>
      <P>In my response to a parliamentary question yesterday I indicated that there is a tort of invasion of privacy and that I would be keeping the law under review in light of developments in the jurisprudence of our courts and in the European Court of Human Rights. Legislation governing privacy issues exists in certain specific areas. We have, for example, stringent data protection legislation covering the handling of the information held in regard to citizens across a wide range of institutions. There are reporting restrictions contained in legislation such as the Children Act, the Child Care Act, the Criminal Assets Bureau Act, in the Criminal Justice Acts, in the Garda Bill which this House debated in recent times and in family law matters.</P>
      <P>What is the current position concerning privacy law in Ireland? Our Constitution guarantees the right to freedom of expression on the one hand and, though the right is unenumerated, to the enjoyment of privacy on the other. When we think of the development of the constitutional right to privacy we think of the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision in McGee <i>v.</i> Attorney General, which related to marital privacy in the area of contraception, and in other cases which followed, including Kearney <i>v.</i> Ireland, in which a prisoner whose mail was stopped and read by prison staff was awarded damages for breach of his constitutional rights. Of particular interest in this debate are the actions for breaches of the constitutional right to privacy taken in 1987 by<?oasys [jy?>Geraldine Kennedy and Bruce Arnold following the wrongful tapping of their telephones and in the Bermingham case in 1997.</P>
      <P>Irish newspapers, as distinct from other actors in society, have traditionally steered clear of the kind of intrusive coverage &mdash; or as the respected media commentator Roy Greenslade puts it, the &ldquo;British disease&rdquo;&mdash; of personal lives that has long been the daily fodder of British tabloids. However, as British newspapers, or the Irish version of British newspapers, increasingly gain in circulation in Ireland and with the profit motive seemingly uppermost in some people&rsquo;s minds, that tradition has somewhat changed. No amount of high-minded and often self-serving justifications from certain commentators can hide that fact. There have been intrusions by the print media, for example, through sensational &ldquo;colour&rdquo; press coverage of the criminal trial process. This was visibly demonstrated by the decision of Mr. Justice White yesterday in a trial in the Central Criminal Court to impose a significant fine of &euro;100,000 on the <i>Irish Sun</i> for contempt of court. <Col N="449"/>I must refrain from further comment as I understand the judge may be contemplating further action against other newspapers.</P>
      <P>Moves to develop the tort of privacy require consideration against a very broad canvas given that redress is offered under our Constitution. It is also a right guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights. Since 1 January 2004, that convention requires every Irish court to interpret every judge-made and statute law in a manner compatible with the provisions of the convention. It means that long-established rules of common law will fall to be interpreted as necessary to make them fully compliant with the European Convention on Human Rights and the jurisprudence of the Strasbourg court. Article 8 of the convention effectively guarantees and imposes on the state an obligation to uphold the right to privacy, balanced by Article 10 which allows for freedom of expression. It is the tension between those very often competing rights that is at the core of the debate today around press freedom, defamation and the protection of privacy.</P>
      <P>Media privacy issues have also come to the fore, in the judicial sense, in recent times in the UK. There can be few in this House who are not aware of the outcome of the Naomi Campbell case against the<i> Daily Mirror.</i> The emphasis of the Law Lords in their decision in that case had regard for the law of confidentiality in deciding to allow Ms Campbell&rsquo;s appeal. They did not set out a new generic law of privacy and seemed careful not to do so. That is the difference between the law of the United Kingdom and that of this Republic. In Ireland, we have a written Constitution and Article 40 imposes upon the State an obligation to uphold the rights of the individual through its laws, including explicit and implicit rights, referred to by lawyers as the &ldquo;unenumerated rights&rdquo; in the Constitution. Privacy is most certainly one of those rights. We have a justiciable right not to have our privacy infringed, whereas the English Judiciary has been slow to take that route without guidance from Parliament.</P>
      <P>While the importance of freedom of expression was stressed very often, the importance of privacy was less stressed in the English cases but no less important to liberty in a democratic state. Other noteworthy cases of interest in recent times were the Douglas, Zeta-Jones and Northern and Shell plc <i>v</i>. Hello! Limited and, of much greater significance, the Venables and Thompson <i>v</i>. News Group Newspapers Limited, where the plaintiffs were effectively granted anonymity for life. Both cases were concerned with privacy rights and suggest a willingness on the part of the courts in the United Kingdom to allow for at least some degree of horizontal application of convention rights. Again, in neither case did the court go so far as to create a new cause of action for a breach of privacy rights, though it did not rule out the development of such an action.</P><Col N="450"/>
      <P>However, that caution on the part of the Law Lords in the UK, and to some extent here, will change following the judgment by the European Court of Human Rights in June 2004 in conclusion of a decade-long action pursued by Princess Caroline, one of the Grimaldi family of Monaco. That case effectively concerned the privacy rights of a public figure. The German media, in this case, had argued that the princess was a &ldquo;figure of contemporary society par excellence&rdquo; and was not entitled to privacy while in public places, even while engaged in mundane activities such as doing her shopping.</P>
      <P>The European Court of Human Rights unanimously rejected that approach. It decided that the zone of interaction of a person, even in a public place, fell within the sphere of private life. The magazine argued the contrary, namely, that people&rsquo;s privacy applied in their homes but that, when they went out onto the public street and became a public person, they left their privacy behind them. The European Court of Human Rights effectively said that even public persons had a portable sphere of privacy, meaning that if they go out to do their shopping in the supermarket or go with their daughter to have a meal in a restaurant or a coffee, they cannot simply be the subject of massive and intrusive paparazzi surveillance.</P>
      <P>It also decided that a positive obligation was owed by the state &mdash; in this case, the German state &mdash; towards measures designed to secure respect for private life, even in relations among individuals themselves. Finally, the court held that, in considering the appropriate balance of rights, the publication of the photographs in question did not contribute to the public debate vital to a democratic society. That was bad news for the untrammelled rights of the paparazzi in European society.</P>
      <P>It is clear that a new jurisprudence is emerging. The question is whether any developments in that area should be left to the courts in Ireland or whether the State, through its legislative institutions &mdash; particularly the Oireachtas &mdash; has a duty to act pre-emptively by forging ahead with a privacy tort law reform. I believe that in the area of tort our courts have amply demonstrated their capacity over the years to develop principles of law and redress on a case-by-case basis as necessary. This is one of the areas of our common law that has remained largely untouched by legislation. It seems, with few exceptions, the better for it. I wonder whether there are clever people in this House or the other who could sit down and draw up a new tort of invasion of privacy without, two years later, exclaiming how the judges were interpreting it in a way never intended. At least if one leaves it to an organic, case-by-case build-up of jurisprudence, the Legislature is in a position to correct trends with which it does not agree rather than unleash forces that it never had in mind.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that the United Kingdom Government has declined to follow the recom<Col N="451"/>mendations contained in a parliamentary commission report of 2003 which recommended the introduction of a privacy law in the United Kingdom. It would appear that there is a general inclination on the part of the British Government to rely on the normal route of development of the law by the courts rather than introduce a law on privacy. One has the proposal that there should be such a law and Government reluctance to introduce it in the context of a differential in the development of the concept of justiciable breach of privacy rights between British and Irish law.</P>
      <P>Will the new concentration on privacy affect the way that those who work in the media carry out their activities? My answer to that question is that it depends what they do. I spoke at the Royal Irish Academy in May 2004 on the occasion of its launch of the excellent pamphlet produced by Baroness Onora O&rsquo;Neill, one of the most respected commentators in the United Kingdom on media issues. I recommend that pamphlet to all Members, and not simply because I launched it. Of the documents that I have launched I found it one of the most interesting.</P>
      <P>I noted her conclusion that much of what purports to be journalism &mdash; sometimes worthy journalism &mdash; is no such thing. It is invasive, intrusive and does nothing to further the role of a free press in society. It does not lead or shape political discourse on the issues of the day, and some people might say that it is sleazy and intended simply to make profits for the media owner. On occasion one has to look at the reality. Baroness O&rsquo;Neill said that it was all very well to have a notion going back to the period of the American War of Independence of local news editors producing the <i>Pittsburgh Bugle</i>, articulating political views, developing public awareness and educating public opinion. That is a classic view of the media with which I have great sympathy.</P>
      <P>However, there is also the other side of the media, which is that they are organisations selling newspapers as a commodity for profit. The height of the pile in every newsagent outlet is the issue with which they are concerned. They are selling a product and, as some people have argued, setting the agenda and developing the debate in society with a view to profit rather than social improvement. There are therefore two sides to that story. I do not wish to come down categorically on one side or the other, except to say that it is naive to portray the media in an 18th century mode when they have a very different role in modern society. I need hardly mention that when they are owned by multinational conglomerates, it is very far removed from the <i>Pittsburgh Bugle</i>.</P>
      <P>Thus, while I am unconvinced of the need for the statutory development of a privacy tort at this stage, the same cannot be said of the reform of our law on defamation. It is on that subject that I can now usefully comment. The focus of my efforts over the past two years has been reform in this area. There is, of course, some overlap <Col N="452"/>between privacy and defamation. I am currently preparing proposals to bring to Government that will provide for the extensive reform of the law relating to defamation, taking into account the work of the Law Reform Commission, the Commission on the Newspaper Industry, the legal advisory group on defamation and the public consultation process that I initiated on publication of the group&rsquo;s report. A majority of the responses received during the consultation process addressed the recommendations put forward by the legal advisory group regarding the establishment of a statutory press council.</P>
      <P>That recommendation came on foot of one of the specific terms of reference of the legal advisory group, namely, to consider the nature and extent of any statutory intervention that might attach to the establishment of an entity concerned with the regulation of the press. That is a subject where there is a divergence of views and sometimes heated debate regarding the optimum approach. The group recommended the establishment of a statutory, Government-appointed press council with functions that would include the preparation of a press code of conduct and the investigation of complaints concerning alleged breaches. The report set out in some detail the main features of such a council, including matters pertaining to its operational structure. However, I expressed the view on several occasions &mdash; the first time was at the launch of that report &mdash; that the model examined and proposed by the advisory group was by no means the only or most obvious one for a press council. My own stated preference is for an independent rather than State-appointed body, composed of persons representative of civic society, with minority representation from media interests and journalists only.</P>
      <P>Appropriate recognition, which could bring certain privileges such as immunity from action in respect of their judgments, decisions, directions and so on could be conferred by a statute on such a press council. I envisage that such a council would have, as its central focus, a press code of standards supported by and subscribed to by all print media organisations with operations in the State who are members. I also envisage that such a code would provide an added protection to citizens&rsquo; privacy from media intrusion and harassment and an ombudsman service to deal with complaints from those affected by breaches of standards as set out in such a privacy code.</P>
      <P>I emphasise that I do not intend to propose a Government appointed press council. My preferred model would involve providing statutory recognition by way of a resolution to be moved in both Houses of the Oireachtas for an independent organisation which might formally request me to be so recognised as the press council of Ireland for the purposes of the future defamation Act.</P>
      <P>Obviously, to move a resolution granting recognition the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Government and the <Col N="453"/>Oireachtas would have to be satisfied as to certain considerations or criteria. These would involve the composition, broadly representative character and funding and adherence to a code of standards by such an organisation seeking recognition as a press council. The act of recognition would not affect in any way the independent nature of such a council.</P>
      <P>One of the primary benefits of a statutorily recognised press council would be that qualified privilege would attach to its reports and decisions or those of a subsidiary body such as the press ombudsman service it would operate. Subscription to the press council and adherence to its code of standards by a current affairs type publication would strengthen its entitlement to avail equally of the defence of reasonable publication, which is a new defence in the proposed defamation Bill, in any court action. Non-members of the press council, for whatever reason, would be required to have in place an equivalent fairness regime or to operate an equivalent and publicised code of conduct to avail of that defence.</P>
      <P>This would be partly in line with the recommendations of the legal advisory group on defamation, which suggested that a court might decide to accord the new defence of reasonable publication to a newspaper because of the extent to which that newspaper towed the line in regard to a press council appointed under the Act. The report linked the notion of reasonable publication to a willingness to accept press council decisions and to act on foot thereof. There is a certain logic to that linkage. It connects to the notion of a fair press being allowed a greater degree of latitude in which to operate.</P>
      <P>I say also, and not for the first time in the context of non-defamatory wrongs, that I am conscious of the danger in arguing that all press activity should somehow be capable of regulation in the interests of, for example, good taste, good behaviour or conventional mores, a subject which arose in this House only yesterday. That is not and never will be my approach. It is not the business of a press council to start telling columnists what they should or should not say.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly. The public are the best judges of these matters and they do not need a press council to speak on their behalf. On occasion I, and I have no doubt many others, feel a certain degree of distaste for individual articles or editorial decisions. While politicians have to develop thick skins, vulnerable people in society need not have to do so.</P>
      <P>It is in vogue these days to query the principle of self-regulation. I am on record as being unconvinced that independent non-State self-regulation is a bad thing in a democratic society. The media should seek to avoid being hoisted by their own petard because they have been uncritical opponents of all self-regulation without seem<Col N="454"/>ingly hesitating to see what the effect of that logic would be if it was turned on themselves.</P>
      <P>On this occasion I call to mind the dialogue between Thomas More and Master Richard Rich in <i>A Man for all Seasons</i>. Richard Rich said he would tear down every hedgerow in England to get at the devil and Thomas More replied, &ldquo;And what happens when the devil turns on you? Where will you hide?&rdquo; The same applies to the whole question of self-regulation. The media has been excoriating the notion that non-State regulation is appropriate for any corner of our society except, curiously, themselves. I hope I am a little more consistent. I stand up for non-State independent regulation in some sectors such as the Law Society. At the same time I can see that a non-State independent press council, if it is given some statutory recognition, could be the answer to our difficulties regarding minimum standards in the press.</P>
      <P>I go against the current grain in that I believe self-regulation in many areas functions very well and the State, in principle, does not have to control everything in society. I equally believe, however, that self-regulation must carry with it the notion that there are some rules to which injured parties can point in seeking redress from abuse of press power. That is the nub of the issue. If a newspaper proprietor or editor were to thumb his or her nose at generally accepted ethics or an agreed press code of standard and seriously injure an ordinary individual, would that be a case of fair game and &ldquo;too bad&rdquo; as far as the individual is concerned? In other words, if we have a toothless press council which can do nothing and effectively be ignored with complete impunity, is it worth having at all? There was an interesting dialogue on this subject in Vincent Browne&rsquo;s magazine recently. Conor Brady&rsquo;s article in that magazine should be read because he makes the point that press councils internationally, which are not supported by any regulation, are useless institutions in the great majority of cases.</P>
      <P>It is in its own interest for the print media to behave responsibly. While I am fervent in my efforts to protect and enhance the role of a free press, which often means putting up with bad taste or dubious propositions, the press themselves must and can do more. The stock and somewhat injured response, especially to recent criticism, has tended to be variations on a theme that while everything the press does may not be perfect, they must be allowed to do it anyway without let or hindrance because they might discover something of public interest. I agree that we cannot have statutorily imposed perfection but equally we should not be in the position where a newspaper can constantly interfere with someone&rsquo;s privacy, claim it is the house style and that people do not have to buy it if they do not like it, and expect us to walk away. The victim of the intrusion by the media is left with no redress of any kind.</P>
      <P>I have been in continuing consultation with the National Newspapers of Ireland press industry <Col N="455"/>steering committee. That committee, to which I want to pay tribute, is currently working on the further development of its initiative to establish an independent press council, with a press ombudsman as its key operational factor, using an agreed press code of standards. I recognise that may be a formidable task but the committee may also not enjoy the luxury of unlimited time. A code of standards will be seen not only by the political establishment, which in this matter is very important, but also by the public as the critical factor in an independent self-regulatory process. The bottom line is that it must be good and it must work.</P>
      <P>If the approach of the National Newspapers of Ireland can be brought to an acceptable fruition, I hope to confer on such an independent press council, through the Bill I am preparing to reform the law on defamation, by way of resolutions to be moved in both Houses of the Oireachtas, a degree of statutory recognition necessary for it to properly fulfil its objectives in an independent way.</P>
      <P>I am conscious that a code of standards to which the print media organisations can subscribe and adhere will be the critical element of independent regulation of the press. It is not for me or the Government to dictate what should be contained in such a code of standards but I envisage providing for the development of such a code among the broad recognition criteria in the defamation Bill. I am sure Senators will agree with me that the public interest must be served and must be uppermost in this process.</P>
      <P>In any consideration of the issues at the heart of today&rsquo;s discussion, there is the question of what is acceptable behaviour by our print media. Is it intrusive telephoto lens photography at private occasions? Is it reporting on the family travails of famous or public figures? Is it salacious stories of little public relevance beyond titillation and profit?</P>
      <P>It has been generally recognised by the Irish media &mdash; I say this in fairness to it &mdash; that even public figures have a right to a private life beyond their public duties. In return, there has always been, by international standards, an above normal access to our public figures, as befits our open and democratic traditions. We have had, therefore, a reasonable and decent press, in general terms, and the degree to which public figures have been accessible has stunned those who have witnessed it.</P>
      <P>Responsibility rests with media owners, editors and journalists to establish and maintain standards and to invest in better journalists and journalism. While I have no wish to whitewash the inevitable colour from much of our print media coverage, I am obliged to ask whether it can seriously continue to publish completely made-up stories, fictitious by-lines &mdash; I cannot understand how anyone can stand over an article and pretend it was written by someone who does not exist &mdash; and a reliance on &ldquo;denial&rdquo; type journalism. As <Col N="456"/>regards the latter, if one were a journalist, one might put to Senator Ryan some accusation in the form of a fax sent on a Friday evening&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister could do a good job in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and record that he either responded to the facts and told one to get lost or denied them or that he did not respond to the facts. That then becomes the story, which is simply not an acceptable way to try to educate public opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>For some public figures, the situation in more recent times has become more complicated by security issues such as kidnapping or surveillance by criminal or terrorist groups. This must be weighted in the balance in the coverage of their activities. Newsworthy or profit worthy and information versus entertainment, essentially these are the choices facing the media in deciding on the extent of their coverage of individuals lives.</P>
      <P>I wish to conclude by referring to two quotations. The first is a statement attributed to Abraham Lincoln to the effect that &ldquo;let the people know the facts and the country will be safe&rdquo;. I strongly uphold that assertion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a very <i>laissez faire</i> attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the founding fathers of the American Republic also said that if he had to choose between a society with a free government and an unfree press or one with an unfree government and a free press, he would choose the latter. I have always been of the opinion that while the latter statement sounds courageous and attitudinal, it is fundamentally flawed. The truth is that it is not possible to have a society with a free government and an unfree press. The converse also applies, namely, that there cannot be a free press in a society which is unfree. The choice the individual in question posed and made was a false choice.</P>
      <P>I thank Members for their attention and I look forward to an interesting debate on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and thank him for his contribution. I also welcome the opportunity to debate issues relating to defamation and privacy. However, we cannot adequately discuss privacy in any real way if we are not also to discuss the regulation of the press. We had a debate on this matter previously and it is regrettable that little progress has been made in the interim.</P>
      <P>As regards privacy, it is an indisputable fact that many parts of the media are capable of being reckless in respect of the facts and the reputations of individuals. Some in the media display <Col N="457"/>absolute disregard for the boundaries of basic privacy. The Minister outlined some instances of this and there have been some notable cases in recent times. I refer to the attempt by <i>Ireland on Sunday</i> to fabricate stories about a Government Minister having a relationship with a woman and stories involving Charlie Bird and the Kilkenny hurler D. J. Carey, who was subjected to disgusting and intrusive coverage. These stories proved to be extremely hurtful to the individuals involved and also to their wider families. It is here that press intrusion becomes really unacceptable. Where a public figure puts himself or herself forward in the public domain, they can expect to have accusations, etc, thrown at them from time to time, which, I recognise, can be unacceptable. However, when such coverage affects someone&rsquo;s wider family it becomes particularly intrusive and unacceptable.</P>
      <P>I do not know how one should deal with the article by Kevin Myers in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday. While the article did not refer to particular individuals, there is no doubt that many individuals are affected when they are spoken or written about in such a fashion. Such articles affect parents and children and they place a slur on them. As far as I am concerned, this type of journalism is unacceptable. The articles to which I refer are, as the Minister stated, merely cheap stunts designed to boost the circulation of newspapers and they damage people&rsquo;s reputations and good names. The truth or appropriateness of a story always seems to come second and newspapers always seem to want to publish sensational articles while not caring about the damage they might do.</P>
      <P>As already stated, it is difficult to discuss privacy without also referring to regulation of the press. The press continues to operate in what is largely an unregulated environment. While that is healthy, it would also be desirable to retain an environment which values such freedoms. However, when press freedom has been abused in the way experienced here recently, there must be an acceptance of the need for some accountability and regulation of the press. This could come in the form of an independent press council &mdash; with some statutory backing &mdash; charged with setting and enforcing minimum standards. Fine Gael has very clearly set out its position on press regulation. We are in favour of the establishment of a press council which would be representative of the social partners, the wider public interest, editors, publishers and journalists and which would have an independent chairperson. We made clear our complete opposition to a statutory press council comprising Government appointees. I am glad to the Minister agrees with us in that regard.</P>
      <P>An effective and efficient mechanism for regulating the press and for allowing legitimate complaints to be dealt with must be instituted. In putting it in place, however, we must be careful that we do not introduce a system that militates against the vital role the free press plays in a <Col N="458"/>democratic society. Fine Gael is by no means a stranger to the important issue of press regulation. In October 2001, we published our proposals for the regulation of the press in a document entitled Press for Change. We recognise the fact that in any healthy democratic society, a free and vibrant media is a key weapon in achieving greater accountability across all sectors. We, therefore, support an independent, effective and free press.</P>
      <P>In addition to the proposal to regulate the press, consideration must be given to the merits of introducing laws that safeguard the privacy of every person. If we lived in an environment where standards of journalistic decency and good taste prevailed, there would be no need for such a law. However, the abuse of particular freedoms by a small number of journalists means that the situation needs to be managed by legislation.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I previously made the point that defamation law reform and the regulation of the press do not have to be interconnected issues. The case for the reform of our defamation laws has been well made. The Minister felt so strongly about reform of the defamation laws that he published a Private Members&rsquo; Bill in 1995. Despite that consensus we are still a long way from seeing any moves to address this issue. I am sorry, but Deputy McDowell was not the Minister at that time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>It was the Minister for Justice of the day. My apologies. The tort of defamation essentially involves the reconciling of two conflicting constitutional rights. This is why it becomes such a contentious issue. The constitutional rights in question are freedom of speech as against the right to one&rsquo;s good name. Despite advances in technology and the increasing breadth of the media, with the advent of the Internet, etc, defamation in this country is primarily governed by an Act which is more than 40 years in existence and has not been amended to any great degree. In our document, Press for Change, published in October 2001, we suggested proposals for a major overhaul of Ireland&rsquo;s outdated libel laws.</P>
      <P>We broadly support the proposed reforms as contained in the legal advisory group&rsquo;s draft Bill. However, we believe the Bill as drafted failed to deal with many important issues. We believe an apology should constitute real grounds for mitigation in court. We also believe that the rules governing court lodgements should be changed in defamation cases, so that acceptance of a lodgement is accompanied by a declaration from the court vindicating the complainant. We have full confidence in juries and believe they should be retained in defamation cases. An important amendment to defamation law in Ireland would be to allow genuinely mistaken inadvertent libel to be alleviated by an immediate apology.</P><Col N="459"/>
      <P>Another important matter which the advisory group failed to deal with is that of deceased persons. We are firmly of the view that the good name of the deceased should be protected. All too often we see evidence of the attitude that once a person dies he or she is fair game for all kinds of untruth and allegation. That is very wrong and any defamation Bill which fails to address this would be grossly inadequate. I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s views on that point.</P>
      <P>Although our pleas have fallen on deaf ears in the past, I want to drive home the need for reform of our defamation laws. We can shout and argue about the regulation of the press and the detail of privacy laws. However, we are all united on the need for defamation law reform. If the Minister brings forward a Bill to reform defamation laws which addresses the concerns I have raised, we will not be found wanting and will not obstruct the legislation. We will support it and so I look forward to such a Bill being brought forward by his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House. It is timely that we have this debate. It is approximately 12 months since we had a similar debate, which followed the public consultative process in which the Minister had engaged. That included the conference in the O&rsquo;Reilly Hall in Belfield which was attended by many interested parties, predominantly media representatives. It amplified many of the issues that have to be addressed as regards this topic.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in his contribution, has dealt quite well with the tort of privacy. In fairness, there have been some notable unwarranted intrusions into the private lives of individuals. However, the Irish media, in general, perform in a responsible fashion. That must be said at the outset. Often, in debates such as this, we tend to concentrate on transgressions and, as a consequence, the good that many journalists do &ldquo;is oft interred&rdquo;, as Marc Antony said. The one aspect I am conscious of in this whole debate is the need for balance.</P>
      <P>I believe, however, that a couple of trends are influencing the situation. One is increasing competition, particularly from the British tabloid press. That inevitably will drive the Irish tabloid media in the direction the British have gone. That sounds a note of caution and needs to be taken into account by any measures that are put in place, to ensure fair and responsible reporting. As the Minister has said, that is to be balanced on the other side by the decision in the Princess Caroline case by the European Court of Human Rights, which acknowledges that public figures have a right to a private life. It always strikes me as distasteful to see a media scrum outside courts and other public places.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to be definite, but in certain scenarios involving court cases, I believe the outcome has been influenced by excessive media intrusion. It must also be recognised that judges, while they <Col N="460"/>are open and fair-minded people and are trained in that regard, are also human beings. Obviously, they might tend to have regard for, or at least cannot ignore, what has been said. It is therefore important that this whole area is covered in a balanced manner.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to Abraham Lincoln when he said, &ldquo;Let the people know the facts and the country will be safe&rdquo;. Undoubtedly, that underpinned the requirement of a free press in a democracy. I also subscribe to his quotation as regards Thomas Jefferson. I believe a free press, free society and free government are not interchangeable. They are all part of the same healthy process needed for a good vibrant democracy. Of course, as Abraham Lincoln was making his statement in the 19th century, he was probably referring to reports in which the facts were presented. When one reads a report today it is often difficult to extrapolate the facts from the writer&rsquo;s opinion. That tends to have an influence.</P>
      <P>I made the point before in the past debate, but there needs to be a distinction between reporting and opinion. The press is entitled to give an opinion, but this should be distinguishable from reporting in a newspaper. I often find the two areas are indistinguishable. Newspapers have an enormous influence on people and the propensity to have sensational headlines, which I suppose help to sell newspapers, often sets the agenda in people&rsquo;s minds as regards the particular areas of public interest being reported. In a busy society many people are influenced by the headline simply because they do not read beyond the first paragraph of a report. This is another area that needs attention. Freedom brings responsibility and this has to be exercised.</P>
      <P>It must be acknowledged, however, that good investigative journalism is essential. We have had some fine examples of that in Ireland, some of which led to the establishment of tribunals of inquiry. Some of these have done good work, albeit at a tremendous cost to the State. That type of reporting needs to be allowed to flourish in a manner that is not too inhibited by regulation and by the law on defamation, etc. This is an area which must be examined in that context. However, the change must be initiated with caution because the public needs to be protected against lazy or biased reporting. As the Minister said, the Constitution takes a balanced approach to this question.</P>
      <P>It states that the State, by its laws, must take steps to defend the good name of the citizens. In Article 40, it states that subject to public morality and order, the State protects the freedom of speech to express convictions and opinions. The Constitution is a document that we discussed here when discussing the European Convention on Human Rights. A wisdom was injected into it which took account of many issues in a fair and balanced way. In many ways, it sets out the backdrop on constructing any press council and the regulations that would go with it.</P><Col N="461"/>
      <P>There has been much discussion in the media over the past ten years on the need for a self-regulating press council. It is interesting that no initiative has ever been taken in that regard by the media themselves. The time has now come for the Government to take the issue on board and to develop it. Members of the media make great play of the fact that many of the issues which have come to light through the tribunals could have been avoided if they had been in a position to articulate their views and suspicions. That may or may not be the case. However, the whole subject of land rezoning was an area they consistently criticised without any regard to the need for rezoning to provide the land and the houses for a growing population. As someone who was involved in local government for a long time, I know that restricting and limiting rezoning enhances land prices and adds to housing inflation for those who are buying houses. That is an argument which has never been balanced in media comment.</P>
      <P>We need to look at the power of the media against the vulnerability of the individual when we legislate to set up redress for citizens. The media is generally run by international corporations which have tremendous financial resources at their disposal. Since the cost of litigation in this country has never been seriously tackled, there is a need to ensure that the individual is not prevented by prohibitive costs from accessing the law and re-establishing his or her good name. I am echoing sentiments expressed by Senator Hayes in the last debate on this matter. He told the House that on occasion, he was prevented from pursuing a case on defamation due to the cost involved. There are many people in that position.</P>
      <P>During the conference in Belfield organised by the Minister, a former Queen&rsquo;s counsel and Press Council chairman commented that the standard of journalism in Britain had seriously declined. Some of the speakers from the NUJ acknowledged this fact. The Minister quoted from Baroness O&rsquo;Neill, who stated that some invasive media reporting has done a disservice to the cause of a free press. An editor of one of our national newspapers claimed that the press is there to challenge those who see themselves as in power. It is as if we did not live in a democracy and that our politicians were self-appointed to ministerial positions. That statement received widespread applause at the conference, which meant that those sentiments were not just that individual&rsquo;s bias, but were shared by many of those in the media. It alarmed me that such thinking permeates the media. The outcome could be catastrophic for the democratic process.</P>
      <P>I noted the Minister&rsquo;s comment on the setting up of a press council. That needs a bit of focus. Ultimately, the composition of such a council and the individuals involved will determine the success or failure of that particular system. I agree with the broad thrust that there should be interest from civic society, the media and others. <Col N="462"/>However, I am not convinced that the press should be allowed to make those nominations and to structure it. As a citizen, I vote to elect the Government. Once the Government is elected, I expect it to take responsibility and to make decisions. There is a propensity by governments of all hues to appoint independent bodies to make decisions which they themselves should be making and for which they should be accountable. That has been done against the backdrop of criticism about cronyism and so on. The democratic process and the free press should be strong enough for the Government to make decisions and then be accountable for those decisions. I am all in favour of taking responsibility.</P>
      <P>Suggestions were made at the conference that some people could be members of this council <i>ex officio</i>. The Ombudsman was one such person mentioned. Such a position would be part and parcel of a press council. The NUJ and the NNI might have nominees, as well as a retired judge. There was also an acknowledgement that there should be some political input, so retired politicians could and perhaps should be members of the council.</P>
      <P>I would like to comment on some of the recommendations of the legal advisory group on defamation. It is important to define clearly the new defence of innocent publication and the defence of reasonable publication. If they are clearly defined, there will be a mechanism to obtain redress for those who are defamed. Mention was also made about juries continuing in the role. While that was designed to reduce costs, there might be scope to look at the PIAB, which was established to remove the legal costs from the overall costs of insurance. There is no reason a press council could not be given such a role. Rather than going to court via a solicitor, people could make a direct complaint to a press council which could adjudicate and award damages to the individual. This could be based on a system such as that which operates in the PIAB.</P>
      <P>There will be a need to ensure that those who ignore the code of ethics and the directions of the press council will suffer severe sanction. We developed such sanctions for publicans who breach licensing laws as they can be closed for seven days. If a newspaper seriously infringes individual rights and is then prevented from publishing for seven days, then that will ensure compliance with good standards.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who, as usual, has been a refreshing presence in the House. He made a remarkably interesting and professional contribution in which he cited a number of case precedents and legal arguments of a refined and, to some, almost arcane nature. Certainly, he addressed the principal features of the subject under discussion. I will comment first on the Minister&rsquo;s speech before moving to a few points of my own.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to Mr. Justice White&rsquo;s decision, which I also noted. While I respect the fact that one must be careful in discussing it as there may be subsequent cases in the offing, there is a certain area in which comment can be made. I disagree with the Minister&rsquo;s view that the fine imposed on the Irish edition of <i>The Sun</i> of &euro;100,000 was substantial. It was a fleabite. <i>The Sun</i> has a record in this area. It manufactured completely false stories about Elton John and published them with the result that its circulation increased. That probably allowed it to cover the cost of the libel case and the £1 million sterling fine imposed.</P>
      <P>I am not xenophobic. While my father was English and I could hardly be described as being anti-British or anti-English, there is no doubt that this country now has what the Minister referred to as the &ldquo;British disease&rdquo;. I recently listened to Mr. Seamus Dooley who is an excellent man, former journalist and secretary of the National Union of Journalists, which has good standards. He said the reason the material in the case referred to above appeared in the Irish edition of <i>The Sun</i> was that it was sub-edited in London. That fact is a clear indication of the malign intervention of British newspapers and their lack of standards in this country.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned professor Roy Greenslade, a very distinguished and eminent commentator. I read the article by the professor which appeared in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>. We should take heed of his comments. While Senator Walsh was correct to say earlier that we have good journalists with sound standards, we must ask about the nature of Irish newspapers and the manner in which their standards are being affected by the penetration of the market by the British media. According to Professor Greenslade&rsquo;s opening shot, Dublin newspapers are now employing the sordid tricks of a trade pioneered so cynically by London tabloids. The professor considered in his article the idea of a press council, in which context I disagree with the Minister who made sound arguments against self-regulation before appearing to support the idea.</P>
      <P>Self-regulation is no regulation. There are very good reasons all media have attacked every single profession including the Minister&rsquo;s own in this regard. If it has been deemed inappropriate for <Col N="464"/>doctors and lawyers to regulate themselves, I wonder why it is appropriate for the media. One requires a clear demonstration of why a principle does not apply in a particular case if it applies everywhere else and the newspapers have failed to make their case satisfactorily. According to Professor Greenslade, although constrained to an extent by an ethical code drawn up by editors in 1991, newspapers have found ways to circumvent and flout it. He said that sadly the Press Complaints Commission, the machinery of voluntary, self-regulation erected to police the code, had tended to allow newspapers far too much licence. That is the English experience of self-regulation. The professor concludes by saying the failure to deal with tabloid scurrility in Britain in the 1970s and 1980s created a culture in which a generation of journalists and editors came to believe they could do as they liked. Their subsequent clean-up act has been a mask for further misconduct. The professor begs Ireland not to allow its newspapers to make the same mistake.</P>
      <P>I remember reading and thinking silly some words of Arthur Cleary, a contemporary of James Joyce at UCD. Mr. Cleary, who had a way with a phrase, said a country which took an English newspaper for its Sunday breakfast might one day find a change in its Friday menu. I am old enough, as perhaps is the Minister, to realise that his reference was to Friday being the day on which one ate fish. While I thought the statement to be silly and parochial when I read it, it is unfortunately proving to be true. There is one newspaper of particular note in this context although I should not, perhaps, give it the credit or the blame given the manner in which it feeds on infamy. Every newspaper which has written about this matter has pointed its finger at <i>Ireland on Sunday</i> and there is no doubt that it is the source of this culture.</P>
      <P>I had my experience with <i>Ireland on Sunday</i> when an interview I did with it was seriously and deliberately misinterpreted. I was given the entire front page of the newspaper which featured a photograph that made me look like a raging sex maniac. All kinds of distortions appeared. I was not expecting it. I remember the appalling personal pain I felt when I stopped at a petrol station while driving to Limerick and saw serried ranks of this mischievous edition. These people have no conscience and do not realise the pain they cause. Luckily, I got over it having gone on air to defend myself. I thank those other members of the media, including print media, who gave me the opportunity to explain what I had to say. The subject of the interview was human sexuality, the age of consent, paedophilia and pederasty, but subtle distinctions were deliberately obscured.</P>
      <P>The result of such activity is that very serious matters of public import are made so dangerous that public figures are afraid to open their mouths about them. They will be trivialised and trashed by rubbishy, third-rate, sensational journalism. This is what my late friend the wonderful television dramatist, Denis Potter, meant when he <Col N="465"/>accused Rupert Murdoch, of whom, as the genealogists say, more anon, of debasing public discourse in Britain. This is why it is dangerous to allow these people to get away with the behaviour outlined. They will continue to do so if they are not regulated by a system which includes sanctions. It is extremely important therefore to include such sanctions in any mechanism we develop to address this matter.</P>
      <P>The Naomi Campbell case involved the question of whether a public interest existed. While this unfortunate woman is a celebrity, a very beautiful fashion model known by everyone, she was struggling with addiction. Is she not entitled in her desperation to seek assistance without her treatment being interrupted and damaged in the interests of profit by unscrupulous newspapers? I do not object to the making of profits by newspapers &mdash; that is the world in which we live. To make a profit by exploiting the misery of others while exposing them, as in the case of Naomi Campbell, to the risk of relapse into serious addiction, however, is disgusting and immoral. What makes it worse is the pious, holier-than-thou tripe the people involved go on with. The media argued in the case of Princess Caroline that she was a &ldquo;figure of contemporary society <i>par excellence</i>&rdquo; which meant there was a public interest in photographing her buying a half dozen eggs. I disagree that there is any interest in it at all. I am very glad the European Court of Human Rights rejected the media&rsquo;s argument and found that no public interest had been served.</P>
      <P>In a very carefully balanced contribution, the Minister said the courts were the appropriate venue in which to deal with this subject on a case-by-case basis. I take a slightly different view of where the balance is achieved. The Minister&rsquo;s argument is a demonstration of his intellectualism. While I can see that intellectually such a case can be made, I ask the Minister to consider the pain of those individuals who are forced by the absence of statutory protection to drag themselves through the courts with the attendant risks and expense such a process entails. Very often people will be advised by very good libel lawyers that while there is no doubt they have been libelled, they are not advised to proceed with a case due to the risks involved. If one loses a libel case, one has not only been damaged but financially ruined. It is not fair to expect individual, ordinary members of the public to pay with their blood, sweat and money to provide a track record of case precedents. It is a great pity.</P>
      <P>The Minister said the Government of the United Kingdom had declined to follow the recommendations, as he has himself, of a statutory independent review. I wonder why Mr. Blair has taken this line. I will put my suspicions on the record. Before he was elected to the position of Prime Minister, Mr. Anthony Blair flew to Australia and had a meeting with Rupert Murdoch. As a result, the tone of the Murdoch chain of newspapers changed drastically and the newspapers assisted him to get into power. I have no <Col N="466"/>doubt whatever that there is a Faustian pact between New Labour and Mr. Rupert Murdoch, which has not done British public life any good at all.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the pamphlet by Baroness O&rsquo;Neill, about which I did not know, but I certainly will get a copy of it as it sounds interesting. She makes the point that much of this journalism is &ldquo;invasive, intrusive, does nothing to further the role of a free press in society, does not lead or shape political discourse on the issues of the day, rather it is sleazy and intended to make profit&rdquo;. The Minister then went on to the question of a statutory or Government-appointed press council. I would have a problem with Government appointments because there is the difficulty of perceived political interest. It is difficult to work out how to arrive at a press council. It should be independent and statutory but I wonder about the method of appointment.</P>
      <P>The Minister also referred to the question of the need for the council to be representative in nature and the question of funding. It should be funded by the Exchequer, not the press, because there must be no suggestion of influence. The Minister stated subscription to the press council and adherence to its code of standards by a publication would strengthen its entitlement to avail equally of the defence of reasonable publication in a court action. That is fine but what about publications that do not do so? The Minister has indicated clearly there is a possibility of people opting out. What happens to them? There is no reason people should opt out. What sanctions are there against these people if they do so? This is pretty toothless. The Minister stated the code of standards is not an issue for him or the Government. While it is not a matter for them exclusively, the Minister, the Government and the Oireachtas should have an input into what are the standards on behalf of the people.</P>
      <P>It is a pity to concentrate on one newspaper but it has brought this upon itself. Fintan O&rsquo;Toole wrote an interesting analysis in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 5 February. He examined the contents of the previous week&rsquo;s <i>Ireland on Sunday</i>. He catalogued and analysed the various stories, including the story about Charlie Bird. Most offensively, there was a frightful and utterly unjustifiable story about Malcolm MacArthur&rsquo;s son. This is an innocent young man who has tried to make the best of a life that cannot have been easy and who is studying for an advanced degree in Trinity College. All he has done is be the son of somebody who became infamous. He is exposed and photographed and there is innuendo in comments such as the Wildean hairdo and the dandyish look. It is being suggested that this makes him a clone of his father. The newspaper is visiting the sins of the father upon the son.</P>
      <P>Where is the public interest? How dare the newspaper behave in this way? If it does so in Britain, it should be clearly told it cannot and must not do it with impunity in this country. Imagine the pain of that man but I hope and <Col N="467"/>expect he has the courage to continue his studies. He did not deserve this and it is an absolute disgrace on the part of the journalists who wrote the article. I do not read this newspaper but I am not sure whether this was one of the columns, which the Minister rightly referred to with indignation, with a bogus byline. They are ashamed to put their own names to it. That is an outrageous practice.</P>
      <P>There was an article on the family of the former Minister, Ray Burke. What did they do? Where is the public interest? According to Fintan O&rsquo;Toole:</P>
      <P LI="1">Thus, in the first 22 pages of this one issue of Ireland on Sunday, there were photographs of people going about their private lives. All of them were clearly taken without the consent of the subjects. None of them, or the stories that accompanied them, gave readers any new information at all on any public issue.</P>
      <P FLI="0">In addition, a girlfriend of somebody famous ran away and tried to shield her face but the newspaper made a point of her distress. This is prurience to the point of press pornography.</P>
      <P>We have a good press, which has a good union. Seamus Dooley has done us great credit in the way he responded honourably and outlined the standards which, unfortunately, are not adhered to by British newspapers, in particular. British standards are being adopted here and they are simply not acceptable.</P>
      <P>I will not go into all the stuff about Kevin Myers but even in <i>The Irish Times</i>, which is an exceptionally fine newspaper, there are practices that lead to the ordinary individual suffering a little. I have been involved in controversy and I have written to the newspaper commenting on columns that appeared. I have been replied to not in the letters page but in these very columns. I have had entire columns devoted to me by Mark Steyn, Kevin Myers and John Waters, which is very flattering but there is an imbalance. It is not too much to ask newspaper columnists to demean themselves to join the hoi polloi in the letters page rather than using the added weight of their columns to extinguish ignorant people.</P>
      <P>Charlie Bird rang <i>Ireland on Sunday</i> and complained to the editor. I know a little about this because I spoke to people within the trade when I was blackguarded by that newspaper. The newspaper brought in a new person from England with a brutish reputation as editor and got rid of all the NUJ members and, therefore, the code of practice does not exist. However, when Charlie Bird contacted the newspaper, he was told he was &ldquo;fair game&rdquo; and &ldquo;a legitimate target&rdquo;. I would like to say to that Englishman editing that newspaper that we do not associate that language with a decent press in Ireland. We associate that language with the Provisional IRA, which undemocratically takes upon itself to describe and label people as &ldquo;legitimate targets&rdquo; and &ldquo;fair game&rdquo;. It <Col N="468"/>is not his business to do it and we will not stick with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Senator Maurice Hayes.</P>
      <P>I should declare an interest. I was a journalist for 30 years with the <i>Irish Farmers&rsquo; Journal</i>. The sex lives of bovine animals and the cross-fertilisation of cereals do not engage the public in the same way as other more salacious activities but, nevertheless, I gained an insight into how the newspaper industry works. The profit motive is dominant and that is understandable. It is legitimate that newspapers should make profits but I very much support the Minister regarding the need for a free press. It is the basis of our democracy. The Fourth Estate has an important role to play in a democracy. It is understandable that Governments try to control the press but it is wrong and the Government must tread cautiously before it intervenes in that area of freedom.</P>
      <P>I also very much support the Minister regarding taste. There should not be a statutory determination of what constitutes taste because taste changes over time. While some articles may be distasteful, it should not necessarily be the case that they should be prevented from being published. The editors of newspapers have obligations and responsibilities regarding comment and the veracity of facts but, unless the frontiers of taste are pushed out time from time, it would be a retrograde step. We have enough experience in our history of censorship to know one is going down a slippery road if one intervenes regarding taste. One famous example of this in the House involves <i>The Tailor and Ansty</i>. Reading that debate again demonstrates how a Government can go into an area in which it should be reluctant to intrude.</P>
      <P>The questions of balance and degree are essential to the debate. The Minister should be commended for wishing to consult and I am glad the House will have a role. We have had many debates on this issue since I became a Member and the Law Reform Commission report was debated fully. Senator Manning was active in this area when he was here, both as Leader of the House and Leader of the Opposition. I have participated in debates in Cleraun study centre, as has the Minister, and those debates have been useful for forming a view on these matters. There is merit in detachment, as is evident in the Minister&rsquo;s speech.</P>
      <P>One of the difficulties with modern newspapers is that there is an increasing tendency to portray opinions as facts. This is particularly evident in the <i>Sunday Independent.</i> If one tries to find news in it, apart from the lead story which itself is sometimes not news, one finds a preponderance of articles from self-proclaimed experts who tend to be from middle class backgrounds &mdash; dare I say Dublin 4 types, which is a state of mind rather than a geographic location. These articles tend to reflect the attitudes of a particular section of society and regard those attitudes as dominant. <Col N="469"/>There does not appear to be a balance in the attitudes represented by the newspaper. However, the plain people have enough sense to sift out what is good and what is bad. Frequently, the attitudes represented by the newspaper do not reflect the attitudes dominant within the country as a whole, but thankfully, the plain people have enough good sense to resist them.</P>
      <P>There is something more sinister about this in the sense that there is an increasing tendency to subvert democracy, which is a danger. To return to the question of a free press and balance, they have a role within the democratic process. Their role is one of scrutiny and to ensure that Government and institutions of the State are accountable. There is, however, an increasing tendency to want to have the State run on the terms they regard from their narrow perspective as desirable.</P>
      <P>This brought to mind the famous comment by C.P. Scott, editor of the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> for almost 50 years that &ldquo;comment is free, but facts are sacred&rdquo;. The preamble to that comment is interesting and perhaps we are not so different nowadays from what we were then:</P>
      <P LI="1">A newspaper is of necessity something of a monopoly, and its first duty is to shun the temptations of monopoly. Its primary office is the gathering of news. At the peril of its soul it must see that the supply is not tainted. Neither in what it gives, nor in what it does not give, nor in the mode of presentation must the unclouded face of truth suffer wrong.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This was written in 1921 but still is true today.</P>
      <P>On the matter of a press council, I agree with the Minister that it should be an independent body and should embrace all the elements of society mentioned by him. There should also be a press ombudsman. What sort of sanctions will there be for such a body? This critical question is hanging in the air.</P>
      <P>We must also examine the question of libel, what it is and whether it should be redefined. There appears to be a different standard for public and private persons. The right to privacy is absolute. However, there are people who use the press. Some people are famous for being famous and while they want to be pictured going into a nightclub in London, they do not want anybody to intrude. It is a double-edged sword and if one lives by the sword, one dies by the sword. As Wellington said: &ldquo;Publish and be damned.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to Senator Dardis for sharing time with me. I have several interests to declare before I start. I am a member of the board of Independent Newspapers and I write newspaper articles. I have also been acting as a facilitator to the press team to which the Minister made reference. From now on I am on my own, in the sense that anything I say does not reflect the policy or the practice of any of those groups.</P>
      <P>I hope there is nothing particularly symbolic in the fact that we are having this debate on Ash Wednesday. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s invocation <Col N="470"/>of Sir Thomas More who was the greatest public servant of all time. It is always a pleasure to engage with the Minister, even when one disagrees with him, because he brings a freshness to debate in the House. His introductory statement is extremely helpful and I find myself able to support and applaud almost all of it. I certainly support his fresh approach, his open mind and the direction in which he seems to be heading.</P>
      <P>I mentioned my difficulties with the libel laws earlier, which I see from both sides. I generally write very carefully and do not slag people off, but try to engage with their ideas. However, in the case of a book review and of an article in which I did not even mention names, I found myself being taken on and, in one case, sued. In another case, when I was a member of the Patten commission there was an entirely dangerous article in the newspaper which definitely exposed me to libel. I could live with that, but there were people around who might shoot one for doing the sort of thing attributed to me at the time so I had to pack it in. As an ordinary citizen I did not get the hassle. We must somehow bridge the gap.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister&rsquo;s approach to the law of privacy. This will be developed, particularly following European Court judgments, through the courts. This is probably the better way of dealing with the issue. It is difficult when these matters are set in concrete and then it is found they do not fit the circumstances. The courts will develop provisions regarding privacy over time, given this process and the constitutional right we have to privacy.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Norris that the ordinary person should not have to slog through the courts. If we have a press council and the press has a code of conduct, that code should reflect the judgments being made. I join the Minister in commending to Members Baroness O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s proposal which is an excellent treatment of the situation.</P>
      <P>The direction the Minister is taking towards a press council, which is not statutory in the sense of being appointed by Ministers or politicians, is the right way to go. However, it must have sufficient background to give it the teeth people expect for protection. It is important that it is independent and in this regard the first appointees and how they are appointed will be of great importance. There may be technical difficulties in ensuring these people emerge in a way that is credible and transparent without having some form of appointing procedure. It is important to all concerned that the first appointees are outstanding people with unimpeachable integrity so that people will believe the council does mean something. The code of conduct against which the council will operate is also important.</P>
      <P>People have talked about the press and a democratic society. It is a question of checks and balances. The great thing about a democratic society is that one set of institutions can live with another set of institutions and keep it in check. <Col N="471"/>Each institution will not be right all of the time and each will not produce balance across the board all of the time. There will be difficulties. What is important is that the ordinary person should feel there is a means of control.</P>
      <P>I expect the media, generally, to be not anti-Government but critical of Government. I had the misfortune to live under a single party state for 50 years where people get very complacent. We have seen it happen across the water, both in the Thatcher Government and in the current Administration, that governments that are in power for a long time suddenly think they make the rules. Governments that are in power for a long time suddenly think they make the rules. This matter is important. We all applaud Woodward and Bernstein as portrayed in &ldquo;All the President&rsquo;s Men&rdquo; and Ben Bradley. Two investigative journalists from the Independent Group have been murdered. One was killed by criminals in Dublin and the other by loyalist paramilitaries in the North. In order to remove doubt I should say the second crowd was also engaged in criminal activity.</P>
      <P>People will make mistakes and go over the top and it is important that they can be held to a set of standards. We should not try to be entirely restrictive. The use of false bylines is unpardonable. Much more than defamation, I worry about the danger to the criminal process of some of the things that are happening in court reporting and the presentation of cases. I also worry about the dangers that arise not through the actual journalism itself, but the things that are used to promote newspapers in the sense of lines being slashed up and taken out of context and all the rest of it.</P>
      <P>In the closing section of the Minister&rsquo;s speech I thought I detected a slight false dichotomy in terms of the difference between a story being newsworthy or profit-worthy; information versus entertainment. I heard a quote the other day which was so bizarre that I hesitate to attribute the remark. It was said that newspapers should simply give information. That is <i>Pravda</i>. The trouble with newspapers being newsworthy or profit-worthy is that if they are not attractive enough to be read; people will not buy them. It does not matter how true is the news they contain. Efforts should be made to make clear what is news and what is comment. I sympathise with a great deal of Senator Dardis&rsquo;s sub-editorial views. We should avoid these false dichotomies.</P>
      <P>From my experience, the industry has moved a long way. The Minister has helped that by promoting reasonable debate. He has consulted and thrown the issue open. It is important for him to go with the tide and bring this matter to a conclusion.</P>
      <P>Reference was made this morning to Dean Swift. He was held up to us, quite rightly, as the great satirist, a person who probed at authority and the rest of it. What nobody mentioned was that Dean Swift wrote most of that under a false byline. He wrote as Drapier. Second, Swift was <Col N="472"/>censored. While we applaud the great satirist we must remember that it is a slightly dangerous business. The greater mistake would be to overreact rather than underreact. I commend and welcome the approach the Minister is taking and wish him well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s speech was thoughtful, reflective and challenging. I will have to stop saying that as I keep saying it about his speeches. I am beginning to wonder about one of us. Nevertheless, it is a fact.</P>
      <P>I write a weekly column for a newspaper in Cork. It is a newspaper that has been sued and therefore our editor is as sensitive as anybody else to some of the things I say here. He might not be too keen if I said them down there. I like the Minister&rsquo;s rhetorical flourishes on press freedom. For a moment I thought he would quote from Chairman Mao about letting a thousand flowers bloom.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>My view on the libel laws is that the basic intent is no problem; the problem is the cumbersome nature of the process of redress. Some people sue looking for enormous damages but most people who sue do so to seek redress. The media could work with the State to put together a process of inexpensive redress and therefore at least ensure that people were vindicated without the necessity for extensive legal cases.</P>
      <P>The Minister put the case very well on the issue of privacy. I have yet to be persuaded that we need to write down the need to privacy in statutory form for the reasons outlined by him. We need to realise where the press is going if we are to talk about freedom of the press in the 21st century. For example, if the printing press were only now to be invented, would we licence print journalism in the way we licence broadcasting? The argument is made that airwaves are a limited resource but this effectively will be ended by the advent of digital broadcasting, especially for radio for which an endless amount of air space will become available. The process of cumbersome regulation is based on protecting the commercial interests of local radio stations as much as it is on maintaining diversity. This matter must be re-examined. The minimum regulation is all that is required. The freedom of the press relates to the freedom to do what the press wants to do within the law, not some kind of regulated freedom.</P>
      <P>I like the reference that television in the United States is essentially about selling audiences to <Col N="473"/>advertisers. To the degree that this is true &mdash; this is where I disagree with Senator Maurice Hayes &mdash; it drives agendas, which is why, for example, public service broadcasting in the United States tends to be very different from private broadcasting.</P>
      <P>The traditional enemy of freedom of the press was parliament and the executive. With some reservations, that is not the case here anymore as we have moved on to an extent. However there are other enemies to do with ownership and the agendas of ownership. It is those agendas which often determine what is addressed. Many of the issues to do with tax evasion were barely dealt with in the media in the 1980s and early 1990s, other than in a dismissive way as the rhetoric of extreme left-wingers like me even though competent economists suggested that expenditure and income as declared here did not match. One has to wonder about that point.</P>
      <P>The dangerous and worrying issue in regard to ownership and agenda is that one of the agendas of powerful media owners is a denigration of politics. A common consensus is apparent that politics is populated by inferior beings and has little to do with the real world. That is a common theme of many <i>Sunday Independent</i> columnists. Whatever their views on issues, the last people to whom they would give credit are the people involved in the political process. The sinister thing is that the owners of these large media conglomerates take an entirely different view and spend enormous sums of money cultivating the very political process that they try to persuade their readers is entirely irrelevant to their lives. It is not that one or two journalists are writing nonsense about the Minister, Deputy McDowell, or Senator Ryan; it is that there is an agenda which effectively denigrates politics while the owners of the media, perhaps more than ever, appreciate the centrality of political decision making to the protection of their interests. That is sinister and the freedom of the press can be inhibited by such agenda-setting.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>In regard to the issue of privacy, what was done to a member of the Government in recent weeks was perhaps a new low in Irish journalism, although there have been similar instances before. For example, the private life of another prominent politician was intruded into by an Irish edition of a British Sunday newspaper. However, in this case, an Irish newspaper seems to have resorted to new lows.</P>
      <P>We were concerned about the issue but many politicians have been troubled about the fact that the sudden eruption of concern about privacy has followed an intrusion into the private life of a very prominent journalist. It appears that the famous &ldquo;fair game&rdquo; quote, which Senator Norris quite rightly denounced, was essentially one that was at least tolerated if not practised by many in the media in respect of politicians and others until the situation was turned back on a particular journalist. Nonetheless, I am glad we have had <Col N="474"/>such a debate because there are many issues to be discussed.</P>
      <P>We should leave the powerful and the famous out of this matter. Intrusions into private grief, family tragedies and details about gruesome suicides are grossly wrong unless there is some profound public reason. <i>The Irish Times</i>, to its credit, has decided it will not publish the names of suicide victims, which is a very fine decision. I do not believe for a second that we should regulate for such cases because it is a dangerous area. However, there is a level of intrusion not into the lives of prominent, famous or powerful people, but rather small people who have neither the personal capacity nor the resources to go to the courts to seek injunctions, damages and so on. This is among the more repulsive forms of journalism.</P>
      <P>The intrusion into the family life of the perpetrator of a crime is also wrong. I have no problem with dealing vigorously and firmly with an individual who breaks the law. However, the victims of the crime and the family surrounding the perpetrator should not be involved. The fact that an individual member of a family commits an offence is no reason to intrude into the privacy of the family to find out the juicy bits with which to titillate the population.</P>
      <P>Similarly, the fact that some young people such as rock stars seek publicity in a naive way is not in itself justification for an intrusion into their lives when they are suffering from a troublesome marriage. Stories were regularly published about one of our best footballers who has now retired and whose name I do not want to mention, although people will figure out to whom I am referring. This man had a drink problem and is one of the nicest and most decent guys ever to play football. However, the tabloid newspapers used to delight every time he relapsed into his drink problem &mdash; it was a wonderful story for them.</P>
      <P>When the young boy was tragically killed in Cork, one could feel a section of the media waiting for the moment at which they could launch into salacious material about sexual abuse. One could almost feel the disappointment when it turned out not to have been as salacious as they had anticipated. There is a duty on those who work in the media to take responsibility for such matters. There is an unequivocal duty on them to take responsibility.</P>
      <P>It is perfectly correct that journalists criticise politicians because we should be held accountable. The more powerful people are in politics, the more they should be held accountable. Therefore, they should target the Minister rather than me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>They already do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I encourage them to do so within the limits within which the Minister and I agree, about which the journalists would not have much to say.</P><Col N="475"/>
      <P>It is perfectly acceptable for the media to be very critical of politics but it is a bit rich for us to be accused of undermining democracy when we criticise the media because that is not the case &mdash; we are actually strengthening it. It is extremely important to challenge the one-sided idea that we must take whatever is thrown at us but if we suggest that a media report is unfair, distorted, unbalanced or selective, we are accused of something else which is untrue. None of the institutions of the State which are sacred or central to democracy work perfectly and nothing will work perfectly if no one criticises it.</P>
      <P>The Roman Catholic Church lived with the illusion for many years that it was a perfect institution because it was above criticism, particularly in this State. The best thing that ever happened to the church was the realisation that, like every other institution in the State, it was made up of humans who made mistakes and who, in some cases, did dreadful things. It is far better for having the vigour and challenge which goes with a free society, whatever its illusions, than if it was left to its own devices.</P>
      <P>I look forward to the media&rsquo;s response to the Minister&rsquo;s challenge. I am glad that he has made it clear he is not interested in a statutory press council. He is correct about a properly functioning press council. However, we return to the issue of what we do with those sections of the media which choose to absent themselves from these structures and ignore codes of practice. My view is that is a function of the responsible media is to deal with them by telling the truth. I share the Minister&rsquo;s view about letting the people know the facts in order to be safe.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with the Minister about self-regulation, although self-regulation with a vigorous input from outside the profession is a very fine thing. I am a member of a self-regulated profession, namely, engineering, although it is not as tightly self-regulated as the legal profession &mdash; we never quite managed to get that sort of legislative protection. Nevertheless, I am sceptical about it. It is very difficult to separate self-regulation from self-protection. There is an issue there.</P>
      <P>In a debate about freedom, access to the news and ideas, the Government&rsquo;s job of filleting the Freedom of Information Act calls into question for many of us whether that commitment is more rhetorical than real. There was nothing in the Freedom of Information Act which had previously operated that was undermining anything to do with the security of the State or anything else. Rather, it was an embarrassing inconvenience in many ways and it was adjusted and filleted to make life less difficult and make Government less accountable. To a degree, that very action suggests that we must still be wary about where the real intentions of the Government lie.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett"><NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I do not know whether we should be kind to him <Col N="476"/>and offer him a bed or be unkind and charge him rent, given that he is spending so much time in the House. I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. It is a topic which is offering different opinions. Before legislation is afoot, much difficulty and emotion will be expressed before it is all done and dusted. This is a serious issue with which we must deal. We must maintain a balance when we are dealing with it. A person is entitled to his or her reputation and good name at all times, which must be balanced with the fact that freedom of expression and a free press are very important features of a democratic society, as Senator Norris pointed out.</P>
      <P>From reading the coverage on this issue, one could be forgiven for thinking some journalists and commentators believe they have an absolute right when presenting their views and anything they say takes precedence over any other consideration. Taking this as the thoughts of some in the profession, one can well understand why individuals have been defamed in the media. The Minister referred to the case when the Taoiseach was accused of taking £50,000 from an individual in a car park. While it turned out to be untrue, the Taoiseach paid the price for the allegation. Recently on the Joe Duffy show, the issue was raised of D.J. Carey&rsquo;s private life on the morning of an All-Ireland Hurling Final. As Kilkenny were playing Cork that morning, did a Cork man write the story? The recent hounding of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, is another example.</P>
      <P>The nature of the newspaper industry is such that there is a great increase in the number of titles in a declining market. As a consequence, the behaviour of newspapers lends itself to what coverage we receive. On the Internet, I read of an incident with P.J. Mara, the then press secretary to Fianna F&aacute;il, during the 1990 presidential election. He was asked by a newspaper for information relating to the health of the late Brian Lenihan. The newspaper argued that the public was entitled to know, to which P.J. Mara replied &ldquo;the public are entitled to know &mdash; all&rdquo;. Due to the late Brian Lenihan&rsquo;s candidacy, the fault line lay between matters of public interest and curiosity. A private citizen&rsquo;s medical records would never be considered in normal circumstances. Several weeks ago, a member of the band, U2, took an injunction against a newspaper for printing details of a family member&rsquo;s situation. He was forced to go to the courts to prevent this happening.</P>
      <P>The NUJ has a code of conduct that requires journalists not to intrude into people&rsquo;s privacy unless there is an overriding reason as to why they should. That code is gathering dust in some office as it does not feature in much newspaper coverage. The media has no system of regulation. If anyone has a legitimate claim against a newspaper, he or she must go through a right of reply process which is normally found in the newspaper&rsquo;s back pages. A balance needs to be achieved where individuals can achieve some <Col N="477"/>form of redress for defamation without the expense of resorting to the courts, irrespective of whether they can afford to do so. The argument in favour of self-regulation suggests that statutory controls would be hostile to press freedom. At the same time, if the press has its freedom, it must deal with it in a proper manner. Press freedom is a necessary requirement in a democratic society. However, it must also be recognised that the free exchange of ideas and opinions builds on the values that inform society. Statutory intervention will not run contrary to this. It is possible to establish a statutory body that will respect the freedom of the press while being transparent and independent, giving the public confidence in the procedure.</P>
      <P>The best response to any defamatory statement is a quick and strong rebuttal. If a journalist is shown to have his or her facts wrong, the statement will lose credibility. However, to challenge statements made against oneself, unfortunately one needs to own a similar platform such as a newspaper or broadcasting station. On many occasions, people&rsquo;s reputations have been destroyed by the media. If a newspaper prints an apology the following morning for a misstatement, one will still not recover one&rsquo;s good name in the short term. There will always be the assertion that there is never smoke without fire; the fact it was stated means there is some element of truth to it. The argument is often bandied around that a lower level of proof is required if the individual concerned is in public life. This is hogwash. If one does not print the truth, one should pay the price. No one should be allowed to print lies about a person which could affect his or her standing in the community or, in some instances, destroy families.</P>
      <P>At the same time, good investigative journalism must be encouraged. Good journalism brought about the chain of events that gave rise to the tribunals of inquiry. This journalism is welcome and helpful to society. I naively believed that the instruction manual for journalists stated they should be objective, fair and balanced and not allow personal dislikes or distastes to enter the arena. Given the influence that such reporting has on the public, great interest must be shown in this area as a journalist can destroy a person&rsquo;s life. Headlines frequently bear no relationship to the story they underline. Often, they are wholly unfair and damaging. These headlines are used for the sole purpose of selling newspapers. If there is any integrity in newspapers or broadcasting, they should report on an issue without using a headline that captures the imagination but bears no resemblance, good, bad or indifferent, to the story itself. Unfortunately, democratic politics needs journalists as much as journalists need politicians.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the House and thank him for staying for the duration of this important debate on privacy and defamation. <Col N="478"/>With increasing incidents of invasions of people&rsquo;s privacy, the Fine Gael Party is anxious to see the early establishment of a press council. Will the Minister give an update as to the status of his proposals to do so? Members spoke of particular incidents of the invasion of individual&rsquo;s privacy. I recall a former Minister in County Roscommon who suffered several intrusions into his privacy and various untruths written about him. His only means of redressing the issue was through the courts. Thankfully, he shone in the courts and compensation was received. However, it is not fair on any individual, be it a celebrity, politician or an ordinary member of the public, to have to resort to the courts for redress. A body must be established to do so. A debate on the issues of defamation and privacy must include a discussion on press regulation. Despite an Oireachtas debate in the recent past, not much has been done to advance the establishment of a press council and related matters. The council envisaged would form part of the defamation Bill currently being drawn up by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Minister has been quoted as saying that he favours a voluntary press council backed by statutory powers to sanction publications that breach privacy. He rightly refers to a council without statutory powers as a &ldquo;toothless dog&rdquo;. It is up to the Minister to ensure that the dog has a full set of molars and it is his responsibility to put them in place.</P>
      <P>Historically, the press has always operated and continues to operate in a largely unregulated environment. One could say that freedom of the press is valued in any democracy, but there are boundaries and it is the crossing of those boundaries that we are here today to discuss and rectify. Many incidents were quoted during the debate.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael is in favour of the establishment of a press council. We have clearly set out our guidelines for this council as being representative of the social partners, the wider public interest, editors, publishers and journalists, with an independent chairperson. Mindful of the freedom of the press, it is important that we draw a line between a democratic society and the preservation of the vital role that the free press plays in our democratic society. However, freedoms have been abused by a small number of journalists and the privacy of every person must be safeguarded by the legislation.</P>
      <P>The case for the reform of defamation law has been strongly made over the past few years and by many Members present today. The then Minister published a Private Members&rsquo; Bill on defamation in 1995. Despite a consensus which I am sure could be said to be cross-party we are still a long way from addressing this matter and the Government has still not published the much promised defamation Bill. Despite technological advances and the increasing breadth of the media, the tort of defamation, which essentially balances freedom of speech against the right of a person to his or her good name, is primarily governed in this country by a 40 year old Act.</P><Col N="479"/>
      <P>In 2001, Fine Gael published a document, Press for Change, which contained proposals for a major overhaul of our outdated libel laws. While we essentially support the proposed reforms contained in the legal advisory group&rsquo;s draft Bill, it fails to address many important issues such as the retention of juries in defamation cases, the changing of the rules governing court lodgements in defamation cases and the provision to allow a genuinely mistaken libel to be alleviated by an immediate apology.</P>
      <P>There is urgent need for a forum of regulation of the press in which the public can have confidence. Last year the Minister initiated a public consultation process on the new legislation and met the press industry to discuss its proposals for a press ombudsman and press council, but no outcome is apparent. The Minister referred to this earlier.</P>
      <P>In Ireland, by and large our media serve us well. They are in general an honourable group and do not engage in the sort of carry-on seen before the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, and the sort of photograph hunts that have blighted the lives of so many celebrities throughout the world. Times are changing and a few rotten apples can do a great deal of damage. It is important that legislation is brought forward so that such people are stopped in their endeavours because their only agenda is to sell their papers. To do so they will write any sort of dirt. I welcome any proposals to stop that sort of carry-on in civil and democratic society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Members for their very considered contributions to today&rsquo;s discussions. Senator Hayes told me to take events on their tide and I intend in the next few weeks to bring to Government the finalised version of the proposed defamation Bill which will contain provision for a press council along with many of the elements mentioned today as necessary reforms of our law of defamation.</P>
      <P>Time constraints do not allow me to reply in detail to some of the questions raised. Many good points were made in the debate today. In particular I echo the general point courageously made by Senator Ryan that there is a tendency among some elements of the media, though by no means all, to denigrate politics as an activity and to suggest that journalists and columnists are by implication morally superior to elected politicians. I will not draw a relative graph showing where people stand on that scale but politicians are not inferior to those who write about them. We are not below journalists. I will not put the case any further than that.</P>
      <P>Members of both Houses have absolute privilege. If I knew the truth, I could speak of the exact state of the marriage of any journalist, or what his or her children did or did not do, or whether he or she were a drug addict or a drunk. I could do any of those things and no one outside <Col N="480"/>these Houses could call me to book. We have our internal disciplinary systems which, if I took the action spoken of, would leave me subject to censure from within, but there would be no redress for anyone outside the Houses if I levelled that kind of abuse at a person or told an uncomfortable truth about anyone in the media world.</P>
      <P>I say that only to emphasise the point that, in the final analysis, everyone, even a politician or a journalist, is human. There are no superhumans, supermen or superwomen in our society. We are all humans. The fact that people aspire to be statesmen &mdash; or editors &mdash; does not give them any greater or lesser humanity on that account. We must have a system which is fair to those who engage in politics because there is no system which does not involve humans as the actors in the democratic process. Senator Ryan is right. Those who constantly attack and denigrate participants in the political process should at least admit that they would probably make a far worse fist of it themselves if they were doing the work. Some people have driven newspapers and magazines into the ground financially, yet tell us they know how the country should be run. I will not elaborate but everyone knows what I am talking about. Most of the columnists who comment on political matters must admit that they would probably be as good, yet probably no better, than ourselves. There is no point in tearing everything down if one is not prepared to put something up in its place. I invite every journalist in Ireland who thinks he or she would be better than the public representatives in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann at doing their jobs to stand, seek election and show the colour of their money.</P>
      <P>Although tough things have been said today, our media in Ireland, both broadcast and print, are very good indeed. They are media of which generally we should be proud. Our newspapers are readable. Generally speaking they do not accord with the standards identified as a danger by some of the contributors to this debate. We are well served by our media. From time to time some of us find certain of their stances irritating, or we simply do not agree with them. However, the same applies to them. They find what politicians do irritating on some occasions or simply do not agree with them. Let us remember that this is not a dog-eat-dog situation. As Senator Kett said, the media generally and the democratic institutions need each other since one would not be there without the other. Let the media remember that they would not exist if we were not a democracy or if people such as the Members and I did not participate. They would not be there if some general or some other ideologue were sitting behind a desk running Ireland as a dictatorship. Likewise, let politicians remember that we would not be here and there would be no democracy if there were not free media. It is a relationship in which there has to be give and take and we must all be honest and truthful about it.</P>
      <?oasys [cl10.7]?>
      <P>Listening to Senator Ryan, I was struck that we have reached the point where, via the Internet, <Col N="481"/>every single speech of mine, Senator Kett or Senator Terry is available to anyone who wishes to see it in their home. In a few hours anyone will be able to view the proceedings of this House in their home, consider it, study it and write about it. Any speech that anyone makes at a branch or cumann meeting or at a public event can be posted on an Internet site and anyone can see it. We therefore live in a world in which the facts &mdash; if speeches are to be regarded as such &mdash; are now available to everyone. The newspapers are thus not a means for people to find out exactly what happened in an institution yesterday; we have gone past that point. If one wants to know what happened yesterday in the D&aacute;il, one should not read one&rsquo;s newspaper but press one&rsquo;s buttons to get through to the Internet. There is no such thing as a newspaper without an agenda. To ignore today&rsquo;s debate in this House and publish in its place a story on medical cards, for example, is a choice. Now that we all live in this Internet world where all speeches and reports are available, deciding what should be in a newspaper is an agenda-driven activity that characterises each publication.</P>
      <P>We have gone beyond all the old classic arguments that the media are the only way for people to gain access to the facts. They have a different role. They are individual in the sense that they have styles, attitudes, agendas, messages, values and slants on issues one way or another. Therefore, the notion that they are somehow different or purely the product of totally impartial reporters who give us an account of everything that happens is for the birds. Things have moved on from there and some of the political discussion may not yet have caught up with that fact. Our media, and particularly our print media, are not simply a massive Internet through which one can find out anything one wishes. They are different, being products that must sell themselves and attract advertisers and readers. They are set up for specific purposes, whether to unite Ireland or support liberal values, and all have their slants, left-wing or right-wing.</P>
      <P>In that context, whatever legislation we pass must recognise that free and independent media are a cornerstone of Irish democracy. I will not forget that point. I see a few people who imagine that I am somehow itching to control the media, when nothing could be further from my mind.</P>

	<P>My proposal does not necessarily incur a cost to the State. It could be a cost to the private sector. I do not want to challenge the Chair but I would like an explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole has been a Member of this House long enough to know he cannot question the Chair&rsquo;s ruling on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not questioned the Chair&rsquo;s ruling yet. I asked for an explanation. The amendment would be out of order if it involved a cost to the Exchequer but not all of these amendments do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>In accordance with Standing Order 38, the amendment is out of order as it involves a potential charge on the Exchequer. Amendments Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, are out of order for that reason. They have been ruled out of order in accordance with long-standing precedent. I trust that clarifies the matter. It is in order for Senator O&rsquo;Toole and the other Senators to raise particular points as we discuss section 2.</P>

    <P>Amendments Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 4, line 8, to delete &ldquo;16 years&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;18 years&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Senator Kett drew this matter to my attention. The Senator has worked in the Central Remedial Clinic for 20 years dealing with handicapped children. I have visited the organisation and it does tremendous work for disabled children. I respect Senator Kett&rsquo;s opinion on this issue and if the Minister cannot agree today to change the age from 16 years to 18 years, I hope we can go through the proper procedures in the future to change it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett"><NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
	<P>I raised this matter because the age limit is 16 years but for children with a disability there is a transition period between the age of 16 and 18. That comes about in two ways. Many special school programmes now incorporate the junior certificate and many of these children, as we call them, come out of the junior certificate level at 16 years of age into an immediate transitional period where parents are caught up in meetings to try to locate a placement for them, whether that be a skills-based programme or a programme involving some other form of activity. I know from experience that there are many meetings at that time which both mother and father are required to attend.</P>
      <P>Another issue is that as handicapped children mature, the age between 16 and 18 can often be a time when surgery may be required as bones <Col N="483"/>get bigger or whatever. Surgery is not involved in all cases but it is something that could come up for consideration.</P>
      <P>In addition, in respect of disabled children in particular, will the Minister of State consider, and I realise his hands may be tied on this issue, extending the period of time off from 14 to 20 weeks? That is not something that would be abused in any way but it is worth consideration. If those two issues could be considered, it would be worthwhile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator White&rsquo;s amendment, and Senator Kett put the case very well also. The situation for people with disabled children can be very serious and this proposal could make a great difference at a time when the child may have a serious problem that has to be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The tone and content of the amendment is significant and would lessen the burden of care on parents of disabled children. I welcome the fact that Senator Kett has entered the debate because he has vast experience on the matter. I am aware, from my time in labour affairs which would have handled these issues, that the consultative process involving IBEC, ICTU, the community pillar and others has laboured long and hard to reconcile these points of view. Obviously, the reconciliation is often not to everybody&rsquo;s liking because each has had to give way to some degree to accommodate the other side. Could ICTU, IBEC and all the other pillars who are involved in the process &mdash; our lives are ruled mainly by partnership &mdash; be asked for their views on this issue? Is there any way those views could be accommodated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>Before speaking on Senator White&rsquo;s amendment I would like to advise the House that it is intended to propose a Government amendment on Report Stage to section 2 of the Bill at page 4, line 3. An unintentional anomaly has just come to light in the case of the upper age limit for adopted children and this needs to be corrected.</P>
      <P>As regards Senator White&rsquo;s amendment, section 2(2)(<i>c</i>) of the Bill implements the commitment made in Sustaining Progress and the recommendation of the parental leave working group to increase the age limit to 16 years in the case of a child with a disability. The working group&rsquo;s recommendation is linked to the arrangements in place in respect of domiciliary care allowance. The latter is a monthly allowance paid to parents &mdash; it is administered by the health service &mdash; in respect of certain disabled children up until their sixteenth birthdays. The increase will facilitate working parents of children with disability who may need greater flexibility to take time off work for a longer period of their child&rsquo;s life.</P><Col N="484"/>
      <P>While I thank Senator White for tabling the amendment, which has some merit, I cannot accept it as it goes beyond the consensus reached by the social partners in the context of Sustaining Progress and the partnership agreement. It would be unfair for the Government to unilaterally decide to vary one element of a package of agreed mechanisms and amendments which were negotiated in good faith and which involved a degree of compromise on all sides. It would not be acceptable for one party to a multi-party agreement to subsequently alter an agreed commitment reached after negotiation. To do this would damage the social partnership process to the detriment of making further progress in future partnership negotiations. However, I am prepared to request IBEC and ICTU to consider this proposal and to be guided by their findings.</P>
      <P>There are many aspects of the legislation I would like to change. Senator O&rsquo;Toole was one of the architects of social partnership, which has served the country well. I accept that it often inhibits the Oireachtas in terms of making changes which certain Senators or Deputies might wish to make. Ireland is the envy of Europe because responsible union leaders here have helped, often in difficult circumstances, bring about great change for their members. Employers have also been prepared to compromise. Consequently, it is extremely important that we should not alter anything agreed in prolonged negotiations without referring back to the bodies concerned and that is what I propose to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments in favour of social partnership and I congratulate him on getting the timing exactly right. However, I wish to highlight one matter. Whereas the agreed positions of social partners should always be implemented, there are many precedents where agreement was not reached and the Government took action. On some occasions that action favoured the unions, while on others it favoured employers. Unless somebody has registered their disagreement in respect of an issue, the Minister of State would not be going against an agreed position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>I will check the matter out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>IBEC is listened to at times when we wish that would not be the case.</P>
      <P>I am glad to note that those things agreed by the social partners will be implemented by the Minister of State. He will realise that a later amendment tabled in my name deals with precisely that matter in respect of the same sex issue. I presume I can now infer that said amendment will be accepted by the Minister of State or that he will introduce an amendment with a new form <Col N="485"/>of words to achieve precisely what I am seeking to achieve. I have chapter and verse on where that was agreed by the social partners, advising the Government. I presume the Minister of State will carry forward his logic so that at least one of our amendments will be accepted. He does not look too happy, so I hope I interpreted what he said correctly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>Always act logically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>We will wait and see what happens.</P>
      <P>On the section, we discussed this matter when the initial legislation was introduced. The main issue is where Ireland, as a country, is going in terms of what to do with its wealth. Will the Minister of State indicate whether the socialist Taoiseach has considered this legislation? What is at issue here is a time during which parents &mdash; single or married and regardless of whether Kevin Myers likes them &mdash; must deal with particular costs and charges. These are the costs associated with maternity and the medicinal aspects &mdash; these could include hospital costs &mdash; attached thereto. There are also costs in respect of the purchase of cots, prams and clothes and those which arise in respect of child minding. There are further additional costs in connection with paying for a child care place in order to retain it during parental leave. These are, therefore, extra demands placed on parents during the period with which the section deals. What do we do? We fine these people further by ensuring that they are not paid their salaries during the period. These people, therefore, are obliged to take a double hit.</P>
      <P>In the past the country could not afford to take action in respect of this matter but that is no longer the case. Senator White has been to the fore in making the case, time and again, in support of child minding supports, structures and needs and is aware of the point I am making. That is completely wrong and indefensible, particularly when EU countries such as Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and others have made particular arrangements in respect of this matter. I wish to make it clear, and not mislead the House, that such arrangements do not, in all cases, include full pay. However, a payment of some description &mdash; whether from the employer or via a benefit of some description &mdash; is paid to people on parental leave in these countries. I do not wish to make a distinction at present because I want to discuss the general principle.</P>
      <P>The position in Ireland is fundamentally wrong. In addition, in terms of our pro-family and child-centred Constitution, it is unacceptable. If we could not afford to do what I am asking because of a lack of resources, that would be fine. However, that is no longer the position. Ireland has a stronger economy than any of the countries to which I refer and to the UK, which introduced paid paternity leave in recent times. Our econ<Col N="486"/>omy is outstripping theirs, so why is it not possible to invest some money in this area? How much would it cost to do what I seek? The birth rate is approximately 60,000 per year. How many people who have children take parental leave? How much would it cost to give them some form of payment?</P>
      <P>There must be something that can be done for the people to whom I refer. Even if one parent of the 60,000 children born here each year availed of a payment of, for example, &euro;500 or &euro;1,000 provided by the State, the total cost would only amount to between &euro;30 million or &euro;60 million. I do not have the exact figure but Members are aware that the number of people who take parental leave is quite low. I concede that offering a payment would lead to an increase in that figure but we are only talking about &euro;30 million or &euro;40 million out of billions accrued from gross national product in this country. I cannot in all conscience accept that what is happening here is anything other than penny-pinching. There is no justification for not having some payment in respect of parental leave at present. I ask the Minister of State to reconsider the position and to not press the matter to a vote at this time. He has indicated his intention to introduce amendments on Report Stage and he should draft an amendment to allow payment to people on parental leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Toole. I wish also to express my disappointment at our amendments being ruled out of order. However, I accept the ruling.</P>
      <P>As our economy moves forward and we continue to encourage parents, particularly mothers, to re-enter the workforce, we must put in place structures to enable family life to survive. We must also ensure that every support is given to parents and their children. When we discussed this matter in recent days, most Members of the House agreed that this leave should not involve a loss of pay. By leaving it as it is, we are once again widening the gap between rich and poor. Those who can afford to take parental leave with loss of pay will take it. People on low incomes will not. How can they possibly afford to? People on low incomes are already struggling to survive. There is no way they can afford to give up their jobs and lose their pay. Therefore, a distinction is being made between those who can afford it and those who cannot. Those who cannot are among the most vulnerable in our society and once again we are hitting them. This section is flawed, I believe, for that reason. We should be ensuring equality when dealing with legislation. This is a kick in the teeth to equality in terms of dealing fairly with families.</P>
      <P>For the reason outlined, I am opposed to this section. I will not call a vote today, but I will the next day if the Minister has not addressed this matter. While I respect the negotiations and recommendations of the advisory group, it is somewhat rich of the Minister to say we will stick rigidly to them. After all, he is the Minister and <Col N="487"/>can make and take decisions he believes are in the best interests of all the people. That is what we are all here for, to work in the interests of everybody, not just one section of society. This is in the interest of one section of our society and works against another. It is wrong and we should not be party to it. I hope the Minister will think again, before Report Stage, and take a decision to correct this inequality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I too hope the Minister will look again at this issue because it is going to be null and void for a large section of the population. Many people would subject themselves to poverty if they were to leave their employment to take up these added benefits. I must declare an interest in a particular group, namely single parents. I am the chairperson of One Family, formerly Cherish, which represents single parents. There is not just one type of single-parent family in the country. At present there are approximately 154,000 one-parent families in Ireland, based on the 2002 census. This represents some 12% of households and 11% of the population. A sizeable proportion of children are represented in this group. Almost half of those who head one-parent households are in employment. However, it will be impossible for them to take up the various leave arrangements.</P>
      <P>While the loss of income in a two-parent family situation is bad enough, as Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Terry have pointed out, it is totally out of the question in a one-parent situation. It is important to recognise this because figures have recently been bandied about on the terrible increase in the number of one parent families. While it is true that in the 1970s only 3,000 people were getting the unmarried mother&rsquo;s allowance, as it was called, some 15% of the 80,000 who currently receive allowances are fathers. Also included in the figure are prisoners&rsquo; wives. Does anyone remember when prisoners&rsquo; wives did not get anything while their spouses were in jail? I often wondered what these women were supposed to do. Were they supposed to become involved in crime to support themselves so that there would then be two parents in prison? I cannot remember when the support for prisoners&rsquo; wives was introduced, but it is only a few decades ago. In addition, separated wives are in the same grouping as well as other groups who go to make up the figure of 80,000.</P>
      <P>Good work has been done by the Department in identifying what is important to family well-being. The Department commissioned an interesting survey in 2003 which was undertaken by McKeown, Pratsche and Hasse. In their investigation at the Ceifin Centre in Shannon, they found there was no variation in the impact on children&rsquo;s well-being among the various family types studied, including one-parent families. The one issue that really mattered was the level of poverty within those families. We know that one-parent families, unfortunately, are more likely to <Col N="488"/>run the risk of poverty. This is shown in European Union statistics which emphasise that 42% of one-parent families are more at risk of poverty in comparison to 23% of the population overall. I am quite sure we do not want to do anything which might in any way increase the risk of poverty even more in these families.</P>
      <P>The reason these people will be taking time off from work is quite probably to deal with some problem or other and this will be an additional stress on families. I suggest that the Minister looks at this section again. It does not have to be a charge on the State. It can be negotiated with employers in pay deals, but I do not believe we can bring this in and argue that it will be useful when we know that for a large number of people it will be null and void. The Minister should look at this again because when legislation such as this is introduced, while it benefits individuals who may avail of the leave, the main benefit is for their children and for society in general.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>It must be said that this Bill is an improvement on its predecessor. I am not one of those who argues for all or nothing. This is an improvement on what preceded it and it must be conceded that it is better than nothing.</P>
      <P>My main concern is with the approach, while agreeing that we have to introduce paid parental leave. The main group discriminated against by not having a paid parental leave system is fathers. I do not know whether there are statistics available or if any surveys have been done as regards how many men take parental leave. The way society is organised at present militates against them doing that. I know of many fathers, including those on middle incomes, who say they cannot afford to take unpaid parental leave. Women, at least, get paid maternity leave. It is not sufficient, but at least they are entitled to it. However, fathers have limited entitlements and this is an area that must be improved. That is as much as I wish to say on this subject.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>On reading section 2(8)(<i>d</i>), I was not sure what was meant by &ldquo;the relevant Act&rdquo;. The language is somewhat unclear, so perhaps the Minister of State might explain what is meant by &ldquo;this Act as amended by the relevant Act&rdquo;. Perhaps it was explained on Second Stage, but I wonder whether it could be better worded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue of paid parental leave was raised by Senator O&rsquo;Toole. I gave a comprehensive answer to this question on Second Stage. As parents, we would all agree that paid parental leave would be very desirable. I am sure we will reach a situation in this country where paid parental leave will exist. We should reflect on the combination of supports we have in this country. If the Senator wishes to make comparisons with Europe, then I am very happy to do so. The reality is that the total cost to the social insurance <Col N="489"/>fund and to the Exchequer for paid parental leave in 2001 would have been over &euro;200 million. That is a considerable amount of money. I am sure the social partners will agree to the desirability of paid parental leave in the future. We can look at the European social model, which Senator O&rsquo;Toole has suggested we emulate, yet there are major problems for the French, German and Austrian Governments in trying to pay for the level of social contributions that exist in those countries. They are all looking to Ireland to see how we have had so much success with our economic and social model. While we would all wish to see increased payment for parental leave, a balance must be struck with the cost to the economy. I am sure the Senator will be aware of that more than anyone else. In principle, I do not have any difficulty with paid parental leave, but that is a matter for negotiation with the social partners as part of our economic and fiscal policy.</P>
      <P>The Senator and I can have a pint tonight and talk about this further. As the House is aware, I have great regard for Senator O&rsquo;Toole. However, I often think it would great to see him in a ministerial position where he has to make choices&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a long record of making hard choices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;as against all those lovely aspirations he so eloquently puts about. I cannot reconsider this. It is not possible for us to have paid parental leave under this legislation. It may well be possible under a partnership negotiation in the future, but not under this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to explode a few myths about what the Minister has just said. I have a long record of taking unpopular decisions, selling them and sticking with them. If our Government took the same line with IBEC, we would have far fewer difficulties.</P>
      <P>The Minister received one-sided advice on costs. It may well cost &euro;200 million to give full pay for the full period of time if everyone took it. That represents three conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not how I calculated it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I will sit down and the Minister can stand up and tell us how he made the calculations. If he made it any other way, then we do not know what he is doing. There is no other calculation to be made. It is either more or less than that amount. The number of births is multiplied by the number of parents by the number of weeks by the cost per week. There is no other way to make the calculation. These are the things to be taken into consideration. The Minister claims that it works out at &euro;200 million and I will not argue with that figure. However, the arrangement in Italy is that people get 50% of pay, which would drop the figure down to &euro;100 million. If people were to get a quarter of pay, the figure would drop to &euro;50 million. The problem with IBEC is <Col N="490"/>that its members are too tight to pay out of their own pockets. People on parental leave, having paid for hospital and medical fees and so on, could benefit from this. Senator Henry listed a number of benefits that were available. Why is this less important? Can we not afford to put &euro;50 million to &euro;100 million of next year&rsquo;s budget into this? Is there anything better than having a parent available to a child during the period when they are bonding?</P>
      <P>If the Minister does not put enough into parental leave, but does put something into it, then I will stand up and defend him. I will defend him before the people on my side of the House who will not be happy with it. Is that not a fair deal for the Minister? It is time to step up to the mark on this one and put a few shillings into it. We have the money. One of the differences between Ireland and the rest of Europe has been the development of social partnership. The trade union movement that is asking the Minister to ensure that parents on parental leave get a payment for it is the same movement which has taken hard decisions to ensure the modernisation of Irish work practices. Over the past 15 years, there is no other workforce in Europe that comes close to the increase in productivity of Irish workers. There has only been one year when we did not have the greatest productivity increase per worker of any country in Europe. That is something that cannot be done in France, Germany or in Italy. We can do that. We have created the wealth and now we should share it out. We should give it to the young people who have just been born and who will pay our pensions in 50 years time, although it will not be my problem at that stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind Senators that most people have already contributed on this section. We have given 30 minutes to it already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Acting Chairman for the lecture.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the nub of the legislation as it is the most important section. I do not like to waste anyone&rsquo;s time, but I take the equality issue very seriously. The Minister made no response to the points I made. Does the Minister believe he is treating all parents equally by introducing this legislation? Is a child of a parent who can afford to take this parental leave with loss of pay equal to the child of a parent who cannot afford to do so? I want the Minister to address that. Will he stand over the unequal treatment of two children? This question deserves an answer because it concerns inequality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a very interesting discussion and we are in the Seanad to raise these issues and develop policies on them. If we cannot achieve it <Col N="491"/>today, we will try to get the ball over the line in the future. I totally support what Senator O&rsquo;Toole said, but the reason we have such improved productivity is that we did not have the traditional industries that existed in France and Germany. We have successful high-tech capital industries where productivity is very high. That has given us the unnaturally high level we have in contrast to aging industries in Germany and France where industrial relations are very bureaucratic. Thanks to people like Senator O&rsquo;Toole, we have very sophisticated, modern industrial relations based on the partnership model. This is a result of consensus between management and unions and the modern nature of much of our industry.</P>
      <P>As many Members know, I do my level best to champion child care provision. It is an issue on which everyone in the Chamber agrees with me. I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole that ideally a child should have its parent at home with it in the first year. While we all know the reasons people must go out to work, it is a cliche to say &ldquo;exclusive social inclusion&rdquo;. While we do not want to exclude anybody, the failure to provide a contribution means only 20% of parents take up parental leave. The irony is that the people who cannot afford to do so are the ones who most need help.</P>
      <P>I research the issue of child care constantly. I was walking along the Grand Canal to a meeting at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs two weeks ago when I saw a man wheeling a baby at 11 a.m. I stopped him to ask if he was bringing the child to a nursery as I wanted to obtain as much information as I could which did not come from books. He said he was Swedish and that his wife was working at Trinity College for four months. He had parental leave from Sweden which entitled him to 70% of his salary. He said that there were very high taxes in his country and I acknowledged that we paid less tax than people in any other country in the northern hemisphere.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>I spoke to parents at a child care centre this morning. One woman made the fascinating point which I had not thought of that it is in men&rsquo;s DNA to think it is women&rsquo;s responsibility to mind children. I looked at her and knew it was a profound statement. She was right. While things are changing and men are taking more responsibility, they are all born thinking that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator might vote with us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not. I am a total Fianna F&aacute;il person and will fully support the Minister of State. I am speaking to ensure we make progress in future. Senator O&rsquo;Toole has distracted me.</P>

	<P>Take your time, Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>As Senator Tuffy said, we have made significant progress. I have said here many times that I had to give up my job in the Civil Service when I married. I understand what discrimination is about. My boss at the Board of Works tried to keep me on but was not permitted to do so. It was an EU directive which ensured women could continue to work after they married. People in Ireland who have not suffered such discrimination do not understand how it felt to have to give up one&rsquo;s job. One must have that experience to know how awful it was.</P>
      <P>I wish to correct the record by noting that I support the Minister of State completely. His sentiments are the same as ours. He has undertaken to revert to the social partners and stakeholders in Sustaining Progress to establish how to proceed further. We will achieve some form of payment, which does not have to be everything. It is especially important for people on lower incomes who cannot afford to take time off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett"><NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
	<P>We can hope Senator O&rsquo;Toole wins the argument next time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I am always delighted when Senator White refers to the fact that she had to leave her job when she married as I did too. I am quite relieved Senator John Paul Phelan is not here as the last time I made the point, he stood up to say his mother had to do so also. It demonstrated that there has been a change in the age profile in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>We are discriminating against people who cannot afford to leave their jobs. We will have to provide them with some form of allowance while they are out of work if they are in one-parent families. Of single parents in Ireland, 40% are widowed and 25% are separated or divorced. In both scenarios the children involved have already had a serious problem with which to deal. I suggest that any parent who is doing his or her utmost to maintain the standard of living the family previously enjoyed will be very inhibited from taking any of the leave for which we are providing today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to support this important amendment. I am intrigued by Senator White&rsquo;s version of full support for the Minister. It was very interesting that while her argument supported comments on this side of the House, she intends to vote in support of the Minister of State. I hope attention is paid to her words as she made the very effective point that we will in fact disbar people from availing of parental leave if we do not provide some financial assistance. We are out of step with many other European countries in this context.</P>
      <P>The issue of discrimination, which exists in many areas, was raised. I have tabled an amend<Col N="493"/>ment which Senator O&rsquo;Toole will have to move on my behalf. I apologise to the Chair and the Minister of State but I am involved in briefings on another Bill and cannot be in two places at once. I support strongly what has been said on this side of the House. I welcome the fact that Senator White accepts our arguments and believes she can persuade the Minister of the justice of the case. While that is very valuable, I rather wish she would vote on this side. I suppose it is too much to ask.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>She might.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>It is wishful thinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an important point of principle that the very people who most require parental leave will be disbarred from availing of it. I do not believe the saving to the Exchequer will be enormous considering the level of wastage in the public service. An obvious example is the &euro;50 million it will cost to store electronic voting machines, which are mere junk. Can the Minister of State enlighten the House by telling us how much he estimates will be saved by the little bit of cheese paring proposed? It would be valuable to know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said, at 2001 prices the cost of parental leave would exceed &euro;200 million. The sums involved would be much higher now. The calculation is based on the basis of payment and level of take up of maternity leave.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris said we are out of step with certain Europe countries, but the evidence is that they have been out of step with us in the past couple of years. Senators Norris, O&rsquo;Toole and Terry will be aware of the significant controversies which have occurred in France and Germany as a result of attempts to change social models and reduce burdens on economies which are failing to compete globally. The level of take up of leave in some of those countries is quite low because the level of payment for parental leave is not attractive enough. While the levels of parental leave may be quite high in Sweden and Italy, that is not the case everywhere.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole challenged me to provide &euro;100 million at the next budget. While I would welcome paid parental leave as a parent, if I wanted to ensure equality I would use that &euro;100 million to support the unemployed mothers of working class children. They cannot leave the home to work due to the high cost of child care. I would make a payment to mothers in the Traveller community whom we are endeavouring to help into the workforce and whose children we are encouraging to stay in school. I do not even profess to be a socialist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>One cannot be in Fianna F&aacute;il without being a socialist. If the Taoiseach hears <Col N="494"/>the Minister of State saying he is not a socialist, he will be out of a job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>I would make choices, as the Senator should be prepared to do in this debate. I favour paying more money to parents in working class areas and in parts of rural Ireland who cannot go to work because of difficulties relating to child care and the poverty trap in which they find themselves. It would be better to do so than to make parental leave available to the Michael Smurfits of this country. It is a matter of choice and for future negotiation between the social partners.</P>
      <P>Parental leave will be introduced and I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole that the Exchequer can afford it. Every time I attend a European Council meeting, my ministerial colleagues look on with awe at our economic miracle. The Senator has been a contributor in no small way to that but our economic model should not be changed easily. Change should only be made through the partnership model, which has served us well through the years.</P>
      <P>Senator Terry asked about the meaning of &ldquo;the relevant Act&rdquo; in section 2(8)(<i>c</i>). It is defined in section 2(9) as the Parental Leave Act 2004, which will be replaced by this legislation when it is enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the Minister of State&rsquo;s own business whether he is a socialist. That is a private matter between him and his party leader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not profess to be a socialist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the reason France, Germany and Italy have trouble in this area. It is not a coincidence that Ireland has the best strike record in Europe. In other words, there are fewer strikes than in any other European country. There was no strike in the public service over the past two years, which is the prize we aimed for in the benchmarking deal. It was a superb strategic and tactical decision.</P>
      <P>The Government, business interests, the trade union movement and the community and voluntary pillar have achieved structures that could not be achieved elsewhere in Europe. I could list example after example. For example, the primary and post-primary curricula were changed in Ireland over the past ten years without opposition from the teacher unions. Every education Minister in Europe who sought similar changes could not achieve them.</P>
      <P>I could list every Department with which the unions sat down. I refer to the recent problems in the health service regarding the establishment of the Health Service Executive. That was an extraordinarily difficult changeover to effect but it was negotiated. Governments in Europe are failing to do this. We have done it and we are entitled to a pay off. People who wish to spend <Col N="495"/>time with their children should be paid. The Minister of State and I can argue about where the money should be paid but I cannot accept his logic about the difficulties created for parents because they cannot get child minding. His Government has refused to make child care places available. Senator White spoke passionately about this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>A total of &euro;800 million has been invested over the past five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State said the Government could not afford to make places available. He also referred to Michael Smurfit but I do not know whether he would avail of State support on this issue, although I could design a structure which would prevent him from doing so if the Minister of State let me at it. He need not worry about it. I would exclude Tony O&rsquo;Reilly and JP McManus through residency rules and so on. In other words, I would be practical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has not succeeded yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Investment should be made in this regard to look after people. The Minister of State&rsquo;s party should show a little generosity and adopt a little socialist thinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State said a small payment to those on parental leave discouraged take up in Europe. That would imply no payment would be more discouraging. If the Government wants people to take up parental leave, the greater the payment the better. It is less likely that people will avail of the option if there is no payment.</P><Col N="496"/>
      <P>Ministers usually respond on legislation such as this that it is subject to negotiation and a balance must be struck and so on. However, this legislation should lead the way. Employers will not concede on this issue unless legislation forces them to do so. A stage will be reached where the Minister of State will have to move ahead of the employers and tell them this has to be done not only for the benefit of the economy, but also for the benefit of individuals and society.</P>
      <P>I have read the definition of &ldquo;the relevant Act&rdquo; but the wording is not clear. Is it the correct reference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>The evidence is people are taking unpaid parental leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>They have a big choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been a considerable increase in the numbers availing of the term time provision during the summer and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not being taken by those on low incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>It is incorrect to state unpaid parental leave is a major disadvantage. This legislation is a step forward. It was negotiated with the social partners and I do not want it to be seen in the completely negative light it is being seen in the House. We should dwell on its positive aspects. The legislation meets a demand and many people are availing of parental leave. While we would all like people to be paid for parental leave, agreements have been reached and we must adhere to them. While acknowledging the cogent case made by several Senators, this is good legislation and the lack of pay while on parental leave is not the most serious disadvantage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not see how this amendment would involve any charge. Its purpose is to allow either parent to take the leave so no charge would arise.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 6, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;7.&mdash;Section 7 (1) of the Principal Act is amended by the addition of the following paragraph after paragraph (<i>b</i>):</P>
      <P LI="2">(<i>c</i>) A qualifying employee may apply to their employer for more favourable arrangements. An application under this section must&mdash;</P>
      <P LI="3">(i) state that it is such an application,</P>
      <P LI="3">(ii) specify the change applied for and the date on which it is proposed the change should become effective,</P>
      <P FLI="0">
        <?oasys [is0p10]?>
        <?oasys [ix?>An application under this section must be made before the fourteenth day on which the planned leave will begin. An employer who receives such a request may only refuse where he can demonstrate a consequential negative impact on the business.&rdquo;.</P><Col N="498"/>
      <P FLI="0" el="5">I agree with the Minister that the legislation contains many progressive aspects. I accept that point and despite the arguments I put forward on the previous section I appreciate the inputs and the progress that have been made in this area. However, the current wording is restrictive.</P>
      <P>I will not make a long speech on this matter but a different arrangement could be found that would better suit. Instead of parents being obliged to take a set period of leave, perhaps it could be taken in stages over a longer period in smaller sections or in some other way that would suit. People are entitled to seek parental leave but at present it appears to be restricted and we cannot get any movement in terms of the way the Bill is drafted. Perhaps the Minister of State will tell me that is not the case.</P>
      <P>If a proposed term of leave should present a problem for an employer he or she could say that it would have a negative impact on his or her business which would be understandable. We are at pains to ensure there would not be any cost implications or negative impacts on business. However, people should at least be able to seek more flexible arrangements and this should form part of the Bill. If the Minister of State is not happy with my wording he can revisit the matter on Report Stage. This is a straightforward attempt to introduce some flexibility into the system.</P>
      <P>To hark back to a point made by the Minister of State on the previous section, one of the great gains within the Irish working community has been the element of flexibility that has been introduced to it over the past 20 years and this is just more of the same. We are saying, &ldquo;Let us do this where the employer and employee agree that it can be done and there is no cost involved&rdquo;. We should take away the current restriction on this approach. I ask that the Minister of State look favourably on this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope I understand the amendment correctly. It was my understanding from the debate the other day that parents would be allowed take shorter periods of parental leave, be it for one day a week, one day a month or even part of a day. However, that is not reflected in the legislation. Senator O&rsquo;Toole is attempting to make parental leave flexible. In response to a question, the Minister of State replied the other day that parental leave is flexible provided that it is taken with the agreement of the employer. However, the legislation does not reflect that <Col N="499"/>short periods of leave can be taken and I seek clarification on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 9 raises a similar point to that raised by Senator O&rsquo;Toole. The point is that there is space for flexibility as it stands, but it is very much dependent on the employer being open to it. This amendment, which is along the lines of what was proposed by ICTU, proposes to give the employee the right to request the flexibility and underpins that right. It recognises the need for the two sides to come together on the issue but, as it stands, ICTU has given the example of an old-fashioned workplace which does not allow requests for flexibility to be made and does not consider such requests because of their culture, background and lack of understanding. We are placing the onus on the employer to explain why it would not allow the flexibility. It is a much more positive way of approaching the issue in the Bill than as currently drafted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>We have examined this amendment carefully and tried to establish exactly what Senator O&rsquo;Toole has in mind. Now that he has spoken about it, I feel even more strongly that to amend the Bill as proposed would not be in its interest.</P>
      <P>Section 7(1)(<i>b</i>) already offers employers and employees a great deal of flexibility in how parental leave may be taken. This flexibility is enhanced by section 3(<i>a</i>)(ii) of the Bill. An employee already has a legal basis in section 7(1)(<i>b</i>) to apply to take leave in a format other than a six or 14 week block. The spirit of this subsection is a co-operative one between the employer and the employee so that, where it suits both parties, they may agree together on the parental leave being taken in whatever fashion they jointly decide.</P>
      <P>To impose a statutory obligation on employers to expressly demonstrate a business case or a consequential negative impact to justify refusing an application for parental leave in a broken format would be futile and would merely add to the unnecessary administrative burden on the employer. The reality is that many employers and their employees already have a very flexible parental leave scheme which has been negotiated and is in place. Those that do not are unlikely to be more amenable to flexibility because they are obliged to receive and respond in a prescribed way to requests for greater flexibility.</P>
      <P>In addition, amendment No. 7 is in conflict with the six weeks&rsquo; advance notification requirements provided for in section 8 of the 1998 Act. My big worry is that this amendment would create unnecessary bureaucracy. If I really thought there was benefit to be obtained from it, I would consider it. However, in view of the cogent case in terms of the existing flexibility, I am not prepared to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="500"/>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the points the Minister of State has made and can see from where they are coming. I also recognise the improvements in the Bill in regard to the flexibility on the six and 14 weeks. However, the issue is about flexibility. A couple who have just had a baby face costs for cots and prams as well as childminding and cr&egrave;che facilities, all of which must still be paid during a period of parental leave since cr&egrave;che places must be maintained. If parents could take leave in smaller sections, they would not have to do without income for such a long period. That is the only issue.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, I can see the arguments as to how that might not work in certain employments. For this reason, the amendment provides that it is possible where it is acceptable to the employer. All that is involved is more flexibility on an agreed basis at local workplace level with no cost. Will the Minister of State reconsider accepting the amendment on Report Stage? I will not push the amendment to a vote. If it does not suit all sides it would be wrong to force it, but I am trying to reach a position at which a certain provision would suit all sides. For example, an employee could take a shorter period of time with his or her child spread over a number of periods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment does more than just require the employer to respond in a prescribed way. It places the onus on the employer to have a reason that he or she will not be flexible. In the current situation, it is very much dependent on the employer being flexible. The amendment seeks to require the employer to be flexible unless it is not possible for him or her to be so because of the nature of the business, for example. This type of provision is intended to deal with people who do not have a culture of allowing such leave by trying to force them to operate more flexibly, unless it is not genuinely in their interests as a business.</P>
      <P>I do not see why we cannot introduce this type of provision since we have such provisions in other legislation, whereby one can put it up to the employer to explain his or her position. The Minister of State suggested that they would go through the motions of explaining why it is not possible, but they must have a genuine reason that it is not possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I support these amendments. The flexibility could easily be needed, for example, if people were trying to plan ahead regarding various doctors&rsquo; visits and so on. They are not designed to make life more difficult for businesses. I would have thought it was designed so that better planning could be engaged in regarding the person going back to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett"><NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not see the need for this provision because most employers by their very nature would be very flexible in such a situation. If I was an employer, I would rather see someone take leave for two weeks rather than eight, partic<Col N="501"/>ularly if I had to employ another person and continue to pay both while the employee was on leave. Much of this places an onus on the employer to give a reason he or she should not allow the person to go. However, there is no onus on the employee to back up the reason they want the leave. It could very well be that an employee would use this provision to go off on a boozy weekend, although I am not suggesting he or she would do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a fair point. Let us put that into the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett"><NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
	<P>There is reasonable flexibility on both sides without having to go down this road. Most employers would in genuine terms rather see an employee take two rather than eight weeks. I do not think it would create a problem. If it did down the road, we could return and amend the provision if there is an argument thereafter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>Nothing I have heard from Senators Tuffy or O&rsquo;Toole convinces me that a statutory obligation will do anything for flexibility. Good flexibility means good communication, common sense and a spirit of compromise. Statutory obligation imposes the exact opposite. In an era in which all the progressive companies in this country are being proactive on work-family life balance, it is unnecessary for us to legislate for this provision. If I honestly thought there was any advantage, I would consider the matter and I am prepared to consider it again, but I do not see the benefit in it. A proactive approach to the need to be flexible and respond to the demands of their employees is being taken by public sector employers. All the successful companies in the private sector will also be very positive about work-family life balance. If some companies are still stuck in the old mould, they will soon feel the impact on their bottom line. I do not want Senator O&rsquo;Toole to get the impression that I am prepared to consider the matter again. I will consider it in extenuating circumstances where a statutory obligation could make a difference to flexibility. However, it could have the opposite effect; employers having to demonstrate the consequential negative impact could be a recipe for conflict. One would then be into dispute resolution and rights commissioners and so on in such a scenario.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 6, to delete lines 14 to 26.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This amendment makes similar provisions as the previous one. It proposes to delete section 7(<i>b</i>) of the principal Act. In amending section1(<i>a</i>), the Minister of State is prescribing inflexibility. <Col N="502"/>However, section 1(<i>b</i>) allows for the employer and the employee concerned to agree a shorter period. It puts the ball back in the employer&rsquo;s court. It does not give enough power to the employee to request flexibility and to feel he or she has the law behind them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot accept this amendment as it proposes to remove the provision for a ten week interval between the blocks of parental leave. This is contrary to the agreement reached by the parental leave working group in the context of the recommendation that parental leave may be taken in separate blocks, each consisting of a minimum of six continuous weeks. The group considered that to balance the needs of employers and employees, there should be a statutory right to take parental leave in some format, other than a continuous block. The group agreed that the legislation should set parameters on the statutory entitlements on the break-up of parental leave, such as the ten week interval, while maintaining greater flexibility where the employer and the employee can agree. The recommendation of the working group represents a compromise reached between the employer and employee. It strikes a balance between offering the employee greater flexibility in availing of his or her parental leave entitlement, while recognising the business needs of the employer. The arrangement Senator Tuffy seeks already exists. Accepting this amendment would only negate it.</P>

	<P>Amendment No. 10 is declared out of order as it involves a potential charge on the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 10 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 9, before section 7, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;7.&mdash;Section 13(1) of the Principal Act is amended by the insertion after &lsquo;elsewhere&rsquo; of &lsquo;or in the case of a child where requested by a school&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
      <P FLI="0">This amendment provides for a regular occurrence of when a parent is sent for when his or her child has an accident at school. It is an absolute case of where <i>force majeure</i> applies. Unfortunately, I have come across situations where no flexibility was shown and individuals lost pay. I admit it is not a common experience but this is <Col N="503"/>not an anti-employer amendment. The majority of managers ensure that in the case of an accident involving an employee&rsquo;s child at school, everything possible to be helpful and supportive is done.</P>
      <P>However, I am asking for the Minister of State to include this straightforward provision that does not create any problem for employers or employees. Any reasonable person will agree that it cannot be abused. If a school believes that, as a result of an accident, it is a matter of urgency that the parent attends immediately, it will not be abused. This simple amendment, if accepted, would reinforce what a good employer will do anyway and ensure that all employees are treated equally in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Toole in this amendment. I am horrified that any employer could not see such situations as an emergency. The provision must also be considered in the context of proposed medical treatment. If a doctor is dealing with a minor, he or she must have parental consent for any required treatment. We do not want the situation to arise that since a parent was docked pay on one occasion, he or she refused to attend the school if his or her child was involved in another accident. This could result in difficult situations for all involved in dealing with the child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I support this reasonable amendment that would benefit the legislation. I cannot imagine any employer not allowing a parent to attend a school if his or her child had been involved in an accident or fallen ill. However, in the event that an employer refused to allow the parent to attend, it would be better that the eventuality be covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I support this amendment. Amendment No. 10 in my name was similar. In both cases, one can argue a cost to the Exchequer would be involved. Amendment No. 10 sought to broaden those circumstances the provision covers. While it was more broadly worded than this amendment, it would have the same effect. Why was amendment No. 10 ruled out of order and not amendment No. 11?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett"><NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s sentiments on this matter. Like Senator Terry I know of no employer with any semblance of decency who could refuse a parent time in such circumstances. While not wishing to sound pro-employer, an employee, however, could use this provision to get out of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>How?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett"><NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
	<P>The employee could say his or her child is in the school. The employer must have some proof that he or she is legitimately&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>The school would phone.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="504"/>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett"><NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
	<P>That would be fine. However, an employee could come to an employer, as I have experienced, and say his or her child is sick in school and must be collected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not critical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett"><NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
	<P>It happens. If one is going to protect the employer&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>One might look for parental leave and not have a child at all if one were being that crooked about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett"><NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
	<P>That is taking it to the extreme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 13(1) of the Parental Leave Act of 1998 provides for leave with pay known as <i>force majeure</i> leave in situations where for urgent family reasons, owing to an injury or an illness of a specified person, the immediate presence of the employee at the place where the person, whether at his or her home or elsewhere, is indispensable. This transposes clause 3(1) of the parental leave directive which provides that workers must be given the right to time off for such urgent family reasons in cases of sickness or accident.</P>
      <P>Section 13(1) of the 1998 Act caters for a situation where a parent may be requested by a school to deal with an emergency situation relating to the illness or injury of the child while in school. The proposed amendment is unnecessary on the basis that provision is already made in the existing legislation to cater for such an emergency.</P>
      <P>In the event of a child&rsquo;s illness, the parent is entitled to<i> force majeure </i>leave to go to whatever location the child is at, including a school. I appreciate the point the Senator is getting at, and I would agree with him in the context of his amendment, but given that it is covered already it is not necessary to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a fair point and I thank the Minister of State for clarifying it. I was not aware of that. I fully accept the point made and I am glad the Minister of State is not as resistant to change in this matter as Senator Kett. I hope people will not take advantage of this position. It is important to have the point on the record.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 9, before section 7, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;7.&mdash;Section 13 of the Principal Act is amended by the addition of the following paragraph after subsection (2)(<i>f</i>):</P><Col N="505"/>
      <P LI="2">(<i>g</i>) persons involved in a same sex relationship who act in the role of parent of the child.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Senator Norris and I have worked together on this and he asked me to propose this amendment in his name. I do not fully understand why the previous amendments are out of order but I understand they create new sections in the Bill. That does not matter. This is the point to which we all wanted to get in order to deal with this issue.</P>
      <P>I listened carefully to what the Minister of State said at the end of Second Stage of the Bill. He said: &ldquo;There is no doubt that there is a discrepancy in that heterosexual couples can avail of <i>force majeure</i> leave to look after each other as well as parents, brothers and sisters for example while same sex couples cannot do so for each other.&rdquo; The Minister of State went on to say that he would be recommending to his colleagues in Government a change in that area. He said a few other things but that is the gist of what he said on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>We have discussed this issue to a significant extent in various formats and contexts over the past few years. Currently, Senator Norris is briefing people on his Private Members&rsquo; Bill about civil registration in a response to the debate about how we recognise gay relationships in our society. As the Minister of State is well aware, the issue is not necessarily about sexual relationships but could relate to people who are simply in platonic relationships, for practical reasons, and all sorts of things arise out of this. I cannot imagine anyone being opposed to this measure.</P>
      <P>I will return to the points made earlier by the Minister of State regarding the agreement by the social partners. It states in Sustaining Progress that the steps necessary to give effect to the issue of <i>force majeure</i> leave will be addressed. There is an agreement among the social partners, an acceptance signed off by Government, so that we are now at the point of implementation.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister of State open to the argument or do I need to make a more substantial one? The world has moved on. There is agreement that this is a humane approach to the issue. It is a practical, pragmatic issue rather than a moral one to allow people to live their lives in an orderly fashion without worry or fear, understanding that they will be treated as equally as possible. In the words of the Minister of State, a &ldquo;discrepancy&rdquo; exists, but it is more than that, being very close to discrimination. I could make a case that it is so if the people in question were not allowed to be covered by this legislation. I ask the Minister of State to accept the point and implement the agreement. That would be a significant move forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to point out a typographical error in amendment No. 15 where the word &ldquo;acts&rdquo; should read &ldquo;act&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="506"/>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the thrust of this amendment. We should be doing much more to adjust our legislation to make same sex couples more part of our society in general, or at least make our legislation more friendly towards those couples. I would welcome anything that could be done with the legislation before us to forward that.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State may help me regarding the only question I have. Will same sex couples be covered under section 2(9), where someone is acting <i>in loco parentis </i>to the child? If one member of a same sex couple is the father or mother of the child, the partner could then be acting <i>in loco parentis </i>to that child. Will we be duplicating the point which Senator O&rsquo;Toole wants to provide for? If the section in question does not adequately cover that matter, the amendment should be included in the legislation. I would like to hear the comments of the Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad that Senator O&rsquo;Toole pointed out with regard to this issue that people did not need to be in a sexual relationship because the important aspect of the amendment is that it involves people acting in the role of parent or the child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment. The point of this type of legislation is to support every type of family regardless of its make-up. We must support families. That is good for society and for the individuals involved. I understand from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that a commitment was made as part of Sustaining Progress that steps would be taken to give effect to the issue of<i> force majeure</i> leave in respect of same sex partners. The Minister might tell us why that is not dealt with in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>We have looked at this question since the debate on Second Stage in light of what was stated by Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Norris. We found that the 1998 Act already entitles employees acting as parent to a child to <i>force majeure</i> leave, irrespective of whether the employee is in a same-sex relationship. Section 13(2) specifies the ill or injured persons for whom an employee is entitled to <i>force majeure</i> leave. Section 13(2)(<i>c</i>) defines such an individual as &ldquo;a person to whom the employee is <i>in loco parentis</i>&rdquo;. That specification for the purpose of <i>force majeure</i> leave does not disqualify or otherwise prohibit an employee in a same-sex relationship from availing of such leave. Where one half of a couple is the natural parent of an ill or injured child, that parent&rsquo;s entitlement to <i>force majeure</i> leave is secured by section 13(2)(<i>a</i>) of the 1998 Act, so that is already provided for, and Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s amendment is superfluous.</P>
      <P>There is one issue, however. Where a couple in a same sex relationship desire <i>force majeure</i> leave to look after each other, I understand that it is not provided for. As I stated last time, I am prepared to recommend to the Government that a <Col N="507"/>ministerial order be made under section 13(2) of the Parental Leave Act 1998 to provide for that. However, I emphasise that it is subject to approval by the Government. I am certainly well disposed towards it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for that outline. I was particularly interested in the last part. Section 13(2)(<i>f</i>) of the 1998 Act allows the Minister to specify other groups. Under that section, there would have to be an order or statutory instrument to allow <i>force majeure</i> leave to be available to same sex couples. Can the Minister confirm that he is prepared to recommend that to the Government? Is that his point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said in my reply, that is already provided for&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;except in the case of a couple in a same sex relationship where one partner wishes to take <i>force majeure</i> leave to look after the other. This is already provided for to look after a parent or child. Where one partner needs to care for another, I am prepared to recommend that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I certainly appreciate the points the Minister is making and his advisers&rsquo; efforts to bring all this together. The importance of the outstanding issue that can be addressed under section 13(2)(<i>f</i>) is as follows. Let us take an elderly couple in a same sex relationship, sexual or otherwise, who have lived together for years. It may be a gay or lesbian relationship, or they may be sharing for pragmatic and platonic reasons. The type of situation that I envisaged in trying to have the Bill extended to cover same sex relationships was where one partner becomes ill and there is no one else to look after him or her. The Minister has been very progressive and open on the issue today by saying that he will seek to have section 13(2)(<i>f</i>) of the principal Act brought into play to introduce a new category.</P>
      <P>I believe that on the last occasion when I spoke on this matter, I asked for that, but we could not get matters moving at that stage. I recognise that the decision must be made by the Government, and I accept that. However, if the Minister says he will act and that, if his recommendation is accepted, <i>force majeure</i> will be available to those in same sex relationships, that is a massive move forward and should be noted. It is an important statement regarding gay marriages, civil unions and their registration and it can deal with many of the issues about which people trying to get cover were concerned.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s response, and I will take him at his word. If the Government turns him down, we will know where the target lies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>On the second part of Senator Terry&rsquo;s question, perhaps I might clarify that the <Col N="508"/>legislation does not need to be amended, since the change can be made by ministerial order under section 13(2) of the Parental Leave Act 1998, and that is what I will be recommending. If the employee is <i>in loco parentis</i>, he or she already qualifies under the 1998 Act for <i>force majeure</i> leave for a child and under the Bill parental leave is available regardless of sexual orientation.</P>

    <Title>Overseas Development Aid: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
      <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann deplores the decision of the Government to renege on the solemn commitment given by the Taoiseach in 2000 to increase Ireland&rsquo;s Overseas Development Aid budget to 0.7% of GNP by 2007; and now calls on the Government to make statutory provision for increases in the annual spending on ODA so as to meet the commitment given to the United Nations.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I welcome the opportunity to move this motion on behalf of the Labour Party Senators. The <Col N="509"/>House will recall that, in 2000, the Taoiseach gave a solemn commitment to the United Nations that Ireland&rsquo;s contribution in terms of GNP to overseas development aid would be raised to 0.7% by 2007. He gave that commitment not only on behalf of the Government, but on behalf of the Irish people as a whole and it is fair to say that many of us not involved in Government or with the Government parties were happy and proud to support the commitment when made and indeed since. It is all the sadder then that, only five years later, the Taoiseach resiled abysmally from the commitment given so solemnly and proudly by him five years ago.</P>
      <P>It is important to recall the context in which that commitment was given by the Taoiseach. It was given against a lamentable background of a continual slide in the overseas development aid commitment of the developed countries in the preceding ten years and in the context of the agreement reached in 2000 on the millennium development goals. Without listing all eight goals, it is perhaps worth mentioning one or two. The goals dealt with issues such as the reduction by half of those living in poverty and hunger by 2015; the provision of a universal primary education; and the elimination of gender disparity in primary and secondary education by 2005 and at all levels by 2015. There were eight goals in all. Seven of the eight require primary action by developing countries and the eighth requires primary action by the international community, and particularly by developed countries, in the creation of a fair global partnership for development. It is understood that refers to both trade and our commitment for ODA. It was in that context that the Government made the commitment of which we were all very proud.</P>
      <P>The impression has been given by Government that in some way the economy grew too quickly, we were too rich, we did not expect this commitment to cost us so much and that it was a terrible surprise to discover a few months ago that we could not afford all the money or spend it properly. Any cursory examination or analysis of the facts will show quickly that this is nonsense. As soon as the commitment was given as 2002, the then chairman of the advisory board of Development Cooperation Ireland, Mr. Des O&rsquo;Malley, was lamenting the lack of progress made at that point in terms of the commitment that would have been necessary to meet the target in 2007. His successor in that position, Mr. Chris Flood, in the pre-budget submission made in 2003, again lamented that the interim target had not been met and that there was, even at that time, little or no prospect of reaching the Government&rsquo;s commitment by 2007. It is hardly surprising then that the current Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, who I welcome to the House, announced a few months ago that there was no prospect the Government would reach its target.</P>
      <P>It gives me no pleasure to say so but it is clear from any cursory analysis of the facts that this commitment was never a serious one among <Col N="510"/>those whose commitment was necessary to make it happen. Sadly, this was no more than a political deception. Strangely, the only year in which the required increase was made was 2002, the year of the general election.</P>
      <P>We now find ourselves with another commitment which we already know will not be met. The Minister announced a few months ago that instead of reaching a target of 0.7%, we would reach a target of 0.5%. A few days later, if memory serves me correctly, we were given the real numbers in terms of the actual financial commitments that will be made in the next three years which make it clear that there is no prospect of reaching a target of 0.5% in 2007. That is not because economic growth has been higher than anybody expected it to be. The general assumption in 2000, and more or less ever since, was that we would reasonably reach a rate of economic growth of 5%. We always knew the amount of money that would be required. The former Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell, who did a fine job as Minister with responsibility for overseas development aid, chaired a committee within Ireland Aid in 2002. She always worked, as did everybody at that time, on the assumption that we would require an approximate doubling of our aid in monetary terms before 2007 if we were to meet the commitment. We were at &euro;500 million around 2000. Everybody knew we would need to get to &euro;1 billion. We never looked likely to do that, and now we know that we will not.</P>
      <P>The argument is also made by Government, and this is even more disingenuous in some ways &mdash; it was repeated only last week by the senior Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern &mdash; that we cannot use the money effectively or efficiently because the projects are not there. It is essential that we nail this lie here and now. However, as the Minister of State will be aware, it was nailed very effectively at a meeting of the Sub-committee on Development Co-operation before Christmas when representatives of NGOs made it clear that they would be capable of using any finance the Department might be prepared to give them. At the meeting in question, Mr. &Eacute;amonn Meehan of Tr&oacute;caire stated that every year his organisation is forced to turn down very good projects that request development assistance because of insufficient resources. Hans Zomer of D&oacute;chas made it clear that his organisation could deal with a considerable increase in aid and, most important of all, Mr. Ronan Murphy, who is now director general of DCI, indicated that there are quite a few areas where more money could be absorbed not just over the coming years, but almost immediately. Mr. Murphy outlined the fact that Ireland has increased its number of programme countries to include four countries in south-east Asia, namely, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos and Timor Leste. He also indicated that, as we are all too tragically aware, it is perfectly possible to increase our commitment towards emergency aid with immediate effect.</P><Col N="511"/>
      <P>The comments in question were made in early December and Members are aware of what happened on St. Stephen&rsquo;s Day. The commitment of &euro;10 million since then by the Government is welcome. I am aware of the Minister of State&rsquo;s commitment &mdash; perhaps he will repeat it here &mdash; that this money will not be diverted from other sources and that it will be additional. Sadly, emergency aid is always required because situations such as that which arose in south-east Asia occur year-on-year. Money can be usefully spent in providing emergency assistance when it is required.</P>
      <P>There is also the issue of HIV-AIDS. Anyone familiar with southern Africa will be aware of the devastating effect HIV-AIDS is having on the populations of countries in the area. Literally thousands of people are being infected and dying on a weekly basis in the countries to which I refer. It is frequently the most productive and essential people in society, namely, those of working age, who are infected. There is an ongoing urgent need for assistance to deal with both the effects of HIV-AIDS and the issue of prevention.</P>
      <P>There is also a need to invest in the area of sexual and reproductive health. I am a member of the Oireachtas committee chaired by Senator Henry which takes a particular interest in these issues. In that context, I visited Ethiopia last year and it is difficult not to be affected by the obvious need one sees all around one in that country in respect of sexual and reproductive health. We visited Ghandi Hospital, the main maternity hospital in Addis Ababa, where the conditions mothers giving birth are forced to tolerate are quite abysmal. The infant mortality rate in that country is also extraordinarily high. It does not take long to discover why that is the case. Such is the infrastructure and so poor are the roads that if a woman in labour is in an emergency situation, it is frequently not possible to travel the 10 km or 20 km from her home to the nearest clinic where an emergency intervention of the kind we take for granted, such as a caesarean section, could be carried out. Many of these women or their children &mdash; sometimes even both &mdash; die as a result. I urge the Minister of State to consider increasing the percentage of the aid we provide in respect of sexual and reproductive health.</P>
      <P>It is clear that there is plenty of scope for immediate investment in many projects and for the expansion of our overseas development programme. The only serious capacity constraint arises in respect of the staffing of DCI. It has been continually recommended that the staff numbers at DCI should rise in accordance with increases in the financial commitment we make. In that context, when it carried out a review some years ago, the OECD recommended a staff figure of 350 to 380 as appropriate for a country making a commitment of the level being made by Ireland. At present, the number of staff stands at 150 to 160. Sadly, this is only approximately half of what is required.</P><Col N="512"/>
      <P>We increasingly work with people from the individual programme countries, which is right and proper. However, in order to ensure we obtain value for money and that Irish taxpayers&rsquo; money is being spent on the programmes for which it is intended, it is important that we have the support of the individual aid workers on the ground and those based at headquarters in Dublin. We have not made the commitment necessary in terms of staffing and I urge the Minister of State to reconsider the position.</P>
      <P>No one, least of all people in my party, pretends that the issue of aid can be looked at in isolation. There are other matters which are crucially important in terms of the development of the Third World. I refer to trade and, for that matter, fair trade. The developed world transfers many billions of euro to the developing world on an annual basis. However, it also sucks many billions back out by way of debt repayments and by insisting on imposing unfair and unreasonable subsidies on our own produce so as to effectively exclude the primary products that are produced by Third World countries. The latter is an issue not only for the European Union and developing countries but also for Ireland. We impose subsidies on our own produce and we impose tariffs on imports from the Third World which have the effect of negating much of the good work we seek to do by way of overseas development aid.</P>
      <P>While we obviously do not accept that the Government should be allowed to resile from the 0.7% commitment in 2007, the proposal put forward by my party is that we should reconsider that commitment and enshrine it in legislation. We must also seek to achieve the broadest level of agreement on the financial commitment we will make and on the timetable for making it. I suggest that this be done in the context of the review of the development goals that will take place next September. It should be possible, in dealing with the NGOs, to reach agreement on attaining the target at the earliest possible date and this commitment should also be enshrined in legislation. It is not an unreasonable requirement. We have, for example, made a statutory commitment to set aside 1% of GNP for pensions in 20 years&rsquo; time. It is not without precedent, it can be done and it should be enshrined in legislation by way of a commitment from which no Government, least of all the one currently in office, can resile.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P LI="1">To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P><Col N="513"/>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;welcomes the recently announced aid increases of at least &euro;200 million over the next three years, which will result in &euro;1.8 billion being spent by Ireland on development assistance over the coming three years; and reaffirms Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to making progress towards the millennium development goals and to reaching the United Nations target of 0.7% of GNP&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development aid to the House for this important debate. I thank our colleagues in the Labour Party for tabling the motion, even though there is an underlying political agenda in the text. I am sure the Minister of State will be able to respond to the latter in great detail.</P>
      <P>I wish to reiterate what I said on a recent Order of Business, namely, that while it is fair and right that political charges should be levelled at any Minister of State, I deplore the more personalised attacks to which the Minister of State was subjected at the height of the tsunami disaster when he looked after his brief so admirably and with great commitment and was then pilloried for taking a couple of days off with his family between Christmas Day and New Year&rsquo;s Day. The Minister of State has a young family and I do not believe anybody in the political arena would begrudge him a few days off with them. He was obliged to leave his family in the middle of their holiday in order to attend an important meeting. What was said about him went beyond formal political comment.</P>
      <P>We are concerned here with statistics. In that context, the old clich&eacute; about statistics and damn lies arises. I am not suggesting that the motion contains anything that is an untruth. There is definitely no gainsaying the fact that at the UN in 2000, the Taoiseach committed Ireland to achieving 0.7% of GNP by 2007. This commitment was made with the very best of intentions. Like all Government commitments, it was made in the context of the phrase &ldquo;as resources allow&rdquo;. However, the Taoiseach appears to have been hung out to dry in respect of this matter, the legacy of which the Minister of State is suffering. This is despite the fact that there are positive and encouraging signs that the Government is moving towards achieving the goal, if not by 2007 then shortly thereafter. It might be salutary for the House to know that in recent statistics that have come my way, 95% of worldwide financial assistance is from countries which are members of the OECD&rsquo;s Development Assistance Committee. The list of countries that have achieved the 0.7% of gross national income target is very short. Denmark heads it, along with Norway, the Netherlands and Sweden. The next country on the list is Ireland, with 0.41% as a result of the battle the Minister fought with his Cabinet colleagues to ensure an increase in money terms for ODA in the budget.</P>
      <P>For those who might pillory the Government for its alleged inactivity or failure to achieve its target, the reality is that Ireland is the fifth high<Col N="514"/>est contributor to overseas development aid. Only a handful of countries have achieved this target. The world&rsquo;s two largest economies, the United States and Japan, only spent 0.15% and 0.2% respectively on aid. More than 500 million people will escape abject poverty, 250 million will no longer go to bed hungry and 30 million will be saved if rich nations double their development aid over the next decade, according to a UN-sponsored report. The report, Investing in Development: A Practical Plan to Achieve the Millennium Development Goals, by Professor Jeffrey Sachs, was commissioned by Kofi Annan, the UN Secretary General, and will be presented to the G8 meeting of industrial nations in July and to world leaders at the UN General Assembly, two months later. Professor Sachs eloquently states:</P>
      <P LI="1">The world continues to overlook the silent tsunamis and deaths from malaria which take every month the number of people that died in the Asian tragedy. Lifting aid spending would enable countries to meet the millennium development goals to combat poverty, disease and hunger that all nations agreed to at the UN Summit in 2000.</P>
      <P FLI="0">He says the goals are not utopian, but are eminently achievable. He lays out plans for achieving these goals by setting deadlines for specific, often simple, projects that experts say have been proven to work, rather than just calling for scattershot aid. Ireland could not be accused of that. I suggest that its ODA budget and the manner in which it is implemented is focused and efficient and is making a real difference in those areas where it is being spent.</P>
      <P>One of the more significant decisions taken in recent months is that the Minister for Finance has agreed to a multi-annual commitment of &euro;60 million in the current year, &euro;65 million next year and a further &euro;65 million in 2007. The Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, is owed a thumbs-up for this initiative. I agree with the Minister of State that the restoration of the multi-annual funding arrangement was a key priority identified by those involved in the development sector. Significantly, the three-year arrangement is not capped and there is a commitment from the Government to improve on these amounts if Exchequer resources are available. In real terms the total increase over the three years will be a minimum of &euro;190 million. I agree with the Minister of State&rsquo;s analysis that this contribution will, by 2007, put Ireland within striking distance of the target figure of 0.7% of GNP.</P>
      <P>Considering the competing claims from the health and education sectors in particular, I believe this to be a generous contribution. I also want to put on the record a quotation from UNICEF. Ms Maura Quinn, executive director UNICEF Ireland, warmly welcomed the allocation when she said:</P>
      <P LI="1">This ever-growing commitment by the Irish Government reflects the growing need for a <Col N="515"/>greater response internationally to escalating humanitarian issues. It also reflects our prosperity as a national and our unstinting commitment to supporting development countries in greatest need.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The Minister of State can stand proud over his record in office so far. I have known him for some time and am aware of his knowledge of and commitment to this vulnerable area of Government expenditure. If this is how he has started this part of his mandate, I have no doubt that by 2007 when he is completing it, we will be very close to the 0.7% target.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>With the agreement of the House, I will share my time with Senator Quinn. I apologise, first of all, for my colleague, Senator Bradford who cannot be in the House this evening. He has asked me to speak in support of the motion instead of him. The motion before the House is simple and effective. It is shameful that the Taoiseach made a commitment and then blatantly broke it. The world is a small place, even though we may take a selfish attitude and argue that we are all right here in Ireland, while forgetting about everyone else. We saw the effects of the tsunami on 26 December. Although it happened thousands of miles away, it had an enormous impact on Irish people living abroad. It gave many Irish people at home anxious nights worrying about loved ones, and unfortunately some lost their lives. Ultimately Ireland was lucky in having so few fatalities in comparison to other countries.</P>
      <P>However, the onus is on us to play our role in ensuring the world is a safer and better place. It is vital that we allocate money in line with the commitment made by the Taoiseach on overseas development. The public&rsquo;s response as regards the tsunami appeal was tremendous. That reflects the attitude of the general public and it is vital the Government matches that. It is also vital it ensures that the money given is spent correctly. I was coming back from Clare recently when I heard the Minister of State on the radio with Mr. Sean O&rsquo;Rourke. I was not too sure where the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, was going in the interview because he appeared to be indicating there was a difficulty with some of the aid agencies. If there is a difficulty, then he should clarify that immediately because uncertainty of this nature does not do the aid agencies any good. As far as I am aware, all of the aid agencies are doing great work in very difficult circumstances. I do not believe it is helpful when the Minister of State with responsibility for a portfolio makes comments that might be misconstrued. Perhaps this could be a useful opportunity for the Minister of State to clarify his remarks. Irish people are generous. They want to see their money being spent appropriately and believe that is happening.</P>
      <P>I welcome another initiative the Government took recently as regards the tsunami appeal, the <Col N="516"/>appointment of Mr. Chris Flood, a former constituency colleague of the Minister of State, as an envoy. That is a welcome step, which perhaps could be replicated in other areas.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael supports the Labour Party motion. It is regrettable that the Government is tabling an amendment. I suppose it is playing with words, really. The bottom line is that a commitment was given and it is up to the Government to deliver on it. We cannot allow a situation to develop whereby the Government is all over the place. We witnessed the difficulty the Taoiseach landed himself in recently over the killers of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe. He first gave a clear commitment, then backed down on it and now he is back on record again. Hopefully, he will stick with his resolve this time.</P>
      <P>Tonight&rsquo;s motion basically calls on the Taoiseach to honour his commitment. The Minister of State has a difficult time ahead in the next few years because Ireland will be expected to do more and more work in the overseas area. In a way we are moving on from the traditional Ireland of the past, when the religious orders went abroad, founded monasteries and spread Christianity around the world. We have moved on from that and now we are spreading humanity and putting in basic services. I was part of a delegation from the Oireachtas that recently went to Lesotho. I am amazed at the amount of work that Irish agencies had carried out there.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to look at issues like upgrading the embassies and consulates and putting in proper services for the people involved in the everyday dispersal of these funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Browne for allowing me to share his time. I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I am delighted that he is in the position in which he finds himself. I know his heart is in the right place and that he intends to do a great deal. I hope he manages to achieve a great deal in his time. In supporting this motion tonight, the words we use will help him.</P>
      <P>Let me first deal with a few red herrings. It is a red herring to suggest, as has been done, that we could not spend the large amount of money involved in increasing our overseas aid to the 0.7% target by 2007. If there was any difficulty in ramping up the bilateral aid programme to this level by 2007, the obvious solution would be to spend any surplus through the many multilateral aid channels that are available. Spending money in that way involves no more than simply writing a cheque. Another red herring is to suggest that our basic promise remains in place, but that we have just shifted the date by which it is to be reached. This is blatant nonsense. An integral part of the promise was the timescale. Vague, undated targets have been set many times before, both by ourselves and by others. This promise was different because there was an unequivocal time commitment written into it. By removing the time element, we make the overall promise meaningless.</P><Col N="517"/>
      <P>A third red herring is the suggestion that somehow we cannot afford to live up to our original promise. That was the justification for cutting overseas aid in 2002, when the Government tried to row back on its pre-election over-spending. It might have made some sense in the context of the uncertain economic outlook which prevailed in 2002. However, it makes no sense at all now. We are back on course as one of the richest countries in the world, as the Government is pleased to tell us. The Exchequer has money coming out of its ears. To put on a poor mouth at this stage of the game is simply not credible.</P>
      <P>With those red herrings out of the way, let us move on to ask what this fuss is all about. After all, political promises are not worth much in anyone&rsquo;s currency. Part of the reason the political process is held in such low regard is the cavalier attitude that politicians of all political hues take to their promises. The problem here is the nature of the promise, to whom it was made and on whose behalf it was made. When the Taoiseach stood up at the United Nations in 2000 and first made this solemn commitment, he was not speaking in a personal capacity. He was not speaking as the leader of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party or even as the head of the Irish Government. On that occasion, he was speaking as the leader of the Irish people. It was on behalf of the people that this promise was made and not on behalf of the Government, Fianna F&aacute;il or on his own behalf. That was why I felt a tremendous surge of pride when he spoke at the United Nations and made this commitment. It is why I, along with a large number of other people in this country, feel a sense of deep shame and betrayal now that the solemn promise has been reneged on.</P>
      <P>What made matters worse was to whom this promise was made. This was not a little local promise made to a few supporters at a political meeting. It was not even a commitment made to the nation generally, either through the D&aacute;il or a public pronouncement. Instead it was a promise to the whole world, in particular to the poor peoples of this world who were foolish enough to be taken in by it. What makes this different as a promise was what it was all about, the most important challenge facing the world today &mdash; how to cope with widespread poverty in a world of plenty. That promise was a beacon of light in a world of darkness.</P>
      <P>It was a recognition that something could be done about world poverty and that Ireland could play a part in leading the charge. By making this promise and living up to it, Ireland could aspire to a kind of moral leadership that is out of proportion to our size or our resources. It was a promise that resonated perfectly both with our history as a colonised State and with our traditional values of caring for our fellow man. By reneging on the promise, we have lost that opportunity and perhaps we have lost it for ever.</P>
      <P>If we had never made the promise, no one might have noticed. Given that we did make it, and make it so publicly and so solemnly, we <Col N="518"/>cannot but lose in moral standing if we back down on it now. This is a promise that we simply cannot afford to break. I appeal to the Government to rethink its approach to this issue. If nothing else, it should reflect on the contrast between the spontaneous generosity demonstrated by the people after the tsunami disaster and the small minded mean spirited thinking that produced this failure to meet our commitments.</P>
      <P>I listened to Senator Mooney and I understand the point he made. We are fourth in line in overseas aid spending, but that is not the point. It is easy to say that we are generous as things go. We made a promise and we can afford to keep it. It is not a question of saying that we are generous compared to others. The fact that the US and Japan have not lived up to anything like what we have done is not the point. We made a promise. We owe it to the poor people of the world and to those who listened to that promise.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. It has been 14 months since I last had an opportunity to speak on this important subject so I welcome the Labour Party decision to table this motion before us as well as the Government amendment. When speaking on overseas aid it is easy to use emotive language because it is an emotive subject. We live in a global village with 24-hour media coverage, so nobody can have any excuse for not knowing the difficulties faced by people in other parts of the world. However, such is the enormity of those difficulties that it is often difficult for people living in the developed world to fully comprehend them.</P>
      <P>In preparing this speech this evening, I felt it would be a useful exercise to update my own knowledge of those difficulties. The World Bank estimates that in 2001, 1.1 billion people lived on less than $1 a day while 2.7 billion people lived on less than $2 a day. While this represents a small reduction from the figures I presented to the House in November 2003, I feel no sense of satisfaction as they remain too high. The World Bank correctly stated that much more remains to be done.</P>
      <P>While there has been some overall reduction in global poverty, there are areas of the world where more people are living in extreme poverty. In sub-Saharan Africa, where GDP <i>per capita</i> shrank by 14%, poverty rose from 41% in 1981 to 46% in 2001, while an additional 150 million people are living in extreme poverty. While figures such as these could cause one to despair of ever alleviating the crushing poverty that afflicts so many parts of the world, the reaction of governments and their citizens to the recent Indian Ocean tsunami gives renewed hope for the future. That &euro;70 million could be committed by this Government and its citizens to disaster relief in the region is a great testament to the priority that we give to overseas aid. When speaking last week of how much of an example Ireland is in its approach to development aid, James Wolfensohn <Col N="519"/>of the World Bank stated that it was remarkable for four million people to come up with &euro;70 million. Ireland and its Government have a remarkable record. Whereas our overseas development aid budget stood at just &euro;158 million seven years ago, today it stands at &euro;535 million. According to the figures as outlined, the budget will be &euro;665 million in 2007 which is three times the 1997 level.</P>
      <P>It is worth noting that had our GNP remained static since 2000, the Government&rsquo;s visionary commitment to increase the overseas aid budget to 0.7% of GNP would have been met by 2007. The argument is obviously false, however, as GNP has increased significantly since 2000. It is quite likely that by the time the Government reaches its target, the overseas aid budget will exceed &euro;1 billion. It is a daunting figure, but one I welcome as there is still so much to be done to alleviate world poverty.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Government on its continued commitment to the development co-operation programme to reduce poverty, inequality and exclusion in developing countries. During last week&rsquo;s debate on the Asian tsunami, I called on the Minister of State to include the Maldives in the programme. As I did not have the opportunity to do so on that occasion, I thank the Minister of State for his comments on the Maldives and his commitment to include it in our overseas aid programme. I trust the commitment will not be to the detriment of established programmes. The main focus of aid must be sub-Saharan Africa where, as I stated previously, conditions appear to be worsening.</P>
      <P>The 0.7% of GNP target was set by the Cabinet, which has not decided to fail to meet it. While I accept it will require significant increases to get back on track, a positive result of debate on the matter has been the establishment of three-year, multiannual budgetary commitments. While a minimum provision is guaranteed, it is open to the Exchequer to achieve the original target. We have been thrown off course, but we should not abandon our objective. There is an onus on politicians of all parties to continue to highlight the work of Irish people, NGOs, the Minister of State and his predecessors, Minister of State Deputy Tom Kitt, and my party colleague, Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell.</P>
      <P>I welcome the stated intention of Mr. Tony Blair and Mr. Gordon Brown announced at the recent G8 summit to recommit the West to addressing the growing AIDS crisis in Africa. We need a commitment to a consistent, unanimous approach to helping the less well-off. We have much to be proud of in Ireland and should not continuously knock our efforts. It was only recently that I heard it said one must live away from Ireland for a period before one can really appreciate how good it and its people are. We seem to knock our achievements consistently.</P>
      <P>The work of our NGOs, missionaries and people who are committed to the less well-off in the small world in which we now live must be <Col N="520"/>acknowledged. I was privileged to see on the ground in Lesotho the tremendous work to which Senator Browne referred. It could not be done if the Irish people had not committed to overseas development to the extent they have. To empower people in such places to do the work themselves is to give them a great gift. We have much to be proud of nationally and internationally.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister of State and the officials of his Department on their work. They should not lose sight of the objective. While we have been thrown off course, debates such as this allow us to continue to highlight this issue. Hopefully, we will reach the overseas development aid target by 2007 or shortly thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and wish him well in his new position. While I am the sort of politician who acknowledges positive Government action, I must make my feelings known if it does anything which is not advantageous. In 2000, the Government decided to allocate 0.7% of GNP to overseas development aid by 2007, which is only two years away. The promise was made before the international community in the United Nations and was something of which I was very proud. I was a member of Roscommon County Council at the time and felt the commitment was a great gesture. Ireland was leading the way in development aid for countries and people who were not in the same position as us. Over the past five years, Ireland&rsquo;s resources have increased enormously but poor progress has been made and the Government has now acknowledged the target will not be met. While a target of 0.5% of GNP may be reached by 2007, the Government has failed to set a new deadline by which to achieve the 0.7% figure.</P>
      <P>While I accept that it is very difficult to calculate a percentage of the GNP of any country, if people cannot reach a target, they must stand up and admit as much. Instead, we have histrionics and people have felt the need to put a spin on the issue to give people a soft landing. The result is that I am confused about whether  the target of 0.7% of GNP will be met by 2007.</P>
      <P>Despite what I have heard in the debate as it has proceeded back and forth in the House, I do not believe the target will be met. Perhaps it is simply politics, but there is no need to spin the issue to give us an easier landing. I was surprised to hear a Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy say he was surprised and embarrassed by an Opposition party&rsquo;s campaign to highlight the Taoiseach&rsquo;s decision to renege on the target. The cat was let out of the bag about the extent to which the Government was reneging.</P>
      <P>A great deal of good work has been done and I highlighted in the Chamber less than a month ago the number of Irish overseas agencies. I realised how many there were only as a result of the Asian tsunami disaster. I was also somewhat confused about the work of bodies such as <Col N="521"/>GOAL, Concern and Tr&oacute;caire. While overseas development provision is generous, though not as generous as we would like, it may be time to consider value for money in the context of these agencies. While these agencies do great work, it may be time to consider greater regulation.</P>
      <P>From talking to people in the field, including a friend of mine who was in Ethiopia, I understand the Red Cross is a very professional outfit with international recognition. Without saying money should be diverted to it, I am told the Red Cross has the resources in place to carry out serious work and utilise properly the money it spends. After people have been so generous and the agencies have been so committed and professional about securing funding, perhaps it is time to address the matter. Is there a structure in place under which these agencies can liaise and work together more efficiently to obtain the best value for money given that 0.7% of GNP is a significant amount? If the Government intends to meet the target, perhaps it is time to bring all the aid agencies together to improve co-operation and progress. I do not cast aspersions on the excellent work being undertaken.</P>
      <P>The Christian Aid policy officer, Mr. Ois&iacute;n Coghlan, stated it took the Government four years to break its promise to reach the UN target of 0.7% by 2007 but it only took two weeks for it to break the new promise to achieve a reduced level of 0.5% of GNP and while breaking one promise is unfortunate, breaking two seems like carelessness.</P>
      <P>If the ODA allocation were based on the GNP of the previous year, it would be simpler but I do not know whether that has been taken into account. It would remove doubt regarding the financial outlay each year. For example, the ODA allocation for 2008 should be based on the GNP of 2007 and so on. The Minister of State&rsquo;s commitment was solemn and from the heart. I acknowledge that one can make a promise with the best will in the world but sometimes circumstances change. However, I appreciate it when somebody is up-front about whether a promise can be kept. Politically, it is not the way to do business but it could eliminate much of the spin.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael published a policy document, which advocated the introduction of legislation to ensure Ireland met an interim aid target of 0.45% of GNP by 2002 and increased its allocation by 0.05% a year until 2007. This would have been a measured approach. We come to the House and think we have problems but the Minister of State has witnessed first-hand the serious problems that must be addressed around the world. There was a major famine in Ethiopia 21 years ago but this year another famine has occurred, although a warning system is in place whereby such difficulties are recognised much earlier. That is the result of various agencies working together.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister of State well in his work and I am sure he will do everything to ensure Ireland meets the UN target.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Feighan for his kind closing comments. I hope I have been up-front in the brief to date, although I may have been too up-front in the early period. However, it was important to state that we would not achieve the target rather than deceiving the public by stating it would be achieved and then not doing so, resulting in an enormous chasm of confidence in the political system as it spins its way towards pretending it is reaching targets which cannot be met based on the figures.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I welcome the motion and the opportunity to contribute to the debate. This is my most comprehensive statement to date since becoming Minister of State on overseas development and how we should proceed. There is a need for a more informed debate on development topics in Ireland and I welcome the increased number of visits by Members of both Houses to the developing world to witness at first hand circumstances on the ground. Such journeys are not junkets, as often depicted by the media, but are difficult and distressing visits. I urge Members to continue to travel to such countries.</P>
      <P>I was greatly surprised when I took up office at the depth of understanding of development issues among Members of both Houses and I was also pleasantly surprised when I attended a recent ODA meeting to find 20 or 30 Members of both Houses present. They were present not because I was attending but because they are interested in development aid. That reflects well on our parliamentary system because for years ODA has been a minority interest.</P>
      <P>My ambition is to widen and deepen public understanding of the Government&rsquo;s sustained commitment to assisting the poorest people in the poorest countries in the world. People need to be educated about the size of the Government&rsquo;s programme and public involvement, understanding and ownership of the programme, which is the largest in the history of the State, must be enhanced.</P>
      <P>I would like to outline a number of key elements of the ODA issue and the Government&rsquo;s overall commitment to development assistance. The Government&rsquo;s official development assistance programme is more than 30 years old. I reaffirm Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to address the needs of the poorest people in the world, to making progress towards the millennium development goals and to reaching the United Nations target of 0.7% of GNP. Since the target was first agreed at the General Assembly in 1970 it has proved difficult for many countries to reach. To date only five countries have managed to reach or exceed the target.</P>
      <P>In this context the issue of how best to meet the UN target, and in what timeframe, is under review. Hopefully, decisions will be made in the next few months regarding how a legitimate, realistic, practical and phased approach can be adopted to achieve the target. However, both the <Col N="523"/>volume and percentage of GNP increases in recent years in our ODA programme have been substantial, sustained and without parallel in other OECD member states. This year &euro;545 million will be spent on development assistance, which is more than a threefold increase on 1997, when the total budget allocation for ODA was &euro;158 million. The allocation will be more than 0.4% of GNP in 2005. Ireland, on account of these unprecedented aid funding increases over the past ten years, is the world&rsquo;s eighth largest aid donor on a <i>per capita</i> basis and it lies well above the EU average of 0.36% of GNP.</P>
      <P>Recently, the Department held a small function to thank the diplomats who gave so willingly of their time over the Christmas period to respond to the tsunami crisis. Ireland has consistently punched above its weight in diplomatic and global terms, whether through our stewardship of the Security Council or the EU Presidency. This applies not only to the current Government but also to Governments headed by former Taoisigh John Bruton and Garret FitzGerald. They also led successful Presidencies of the EU.</P>
      <P>Ireland needs to continue to punch above its weight and our approach and commitment to ODA reflects this approach. While Ireland is the eighth largest contributor in the world, richer countries such as Japan and the US spend much less on ODA. Ireland must maintain its position because that guarantees influence and respect and that is what the people expect in a moral sense. As a country that experienced and was the victim of a most atrocious famine and which carries that legacy deep in its heart, ethos and outlook, that is what the people expect from us.</P>
      <P>The recently announced aid increases of at least &euro;200 million over the next three years will bring Ireland&rsquo;s spending on overseas aid to &euro;665 million in 2007, an historic high and a further increase of 40% on the current level of spending. Ireland, unlike many donors, has successfully focused its aid programme on the needs of the poorest countries. Some 50% of our total aid budget goes to the world&rsquo;s poorest countries. Ireland is one of only six countries in the world to have surpassed the target endorsed by the UN of contributing at least 0.15% of GNP in ODA to the world&rsquo;s least developed countries.</P>
      <P>Unique among donors, Ireland&rsquo;s ODA has always been untied and this principle will be vigorously maintained. While some countries give more than Ireland in volume, and sometimes <i>per capita</i> terms, they sometimes link the provision of overseas aid to entering into contractual relations, commercial and otherwise, between the donor and recipient countries. This is not a practice Ireland should imitate.</P>
      <P>One of the central purposes of the White Paper process I have initiated is to ensure the core principles we hold dear in terms of overseas development should be enshrined in a White Paper, should be clear and unalterable and should be a matter of cross-party consensus, which I think <Col N="524"/>they are. We should enshrine these principles in stone and make clear to the public and the wider world they are the ones we hold dear and will hold to as our programme expands and develops.</P>
      <P>Ireland was the first donor to support the objective of total debt cancellation for heavily-indebted poor countries. We have consistently promoted this position in the Bretton Woods institutions at a time when the policy was not favoured by either major creditor countries or by multilateral organisations. I pay tribute to the likes of Bob Geldof and Bono who have taken a personal interest in this area. However, before these two individuals started proselytising in the area of debt relief and cancellation, the Irish State, through its aid programme, had already led the way and established a principled stance that poor, heavily-indebted countries should be given immediate 100% debt relief. The Irish aid programme and Irish policy makers, on a cross-party basis, have led the way in terms of thinking in this regard and continue to do so in the policies we outline today through our aid programme. We have underpinned our policy with generous financial support over the past few years for debt relief activities even though Ireland has never extended development assistance in the form of loans.</P>
      <P>HIV-AIDS is a massive threat to global development. We were one of the first donors to have an integrated strategy to fight HIV-AIDS as part of our aid programme. We now spend in excess of &euro;50 million on HIV-AIDS prevention and care programmes each year. We are also one of the first donors to take on the very difficult task of long-term provision of anti-retroviral treatment which is currently being scaled up in Mozambique, one of six programme countries in Africa where we concentrate most of our overseas aid effort. Some 85% of what we fund on the bilateral programme goes to the poorest of the poor in sub-Saharan Africa.</P>
      <P>This House should acknowledge the excellent international reputation of the Government&rsquo;s official aid programme, as evaluated independently by the development assistance committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. We have been unique in world terms in how these programmes have been appraised. This is of critical importance as we seek to develop our programme. We have been the subject of two praiseworthy successful evaluations by the Paris-based OECD which conducts these evaluations on behalf of the member states of the OECD. The evaluations have praised us highly as being up there with best practice. We must maintain that position.</P>
      <P>I noted with some concern the assertion by Senator Quinn, who was kind in his contribution with regard to me, that in order to fulfil our obligations to reach the 0.7% target, we should enter into a cheque signing exercise. The suggestion seems to be we should simply sign a cheque and post it off to the UN or the other multinational agencies. We are already serious donors to those agencies and virtually everywhere I travel in the <Col N="525"/>world I am thanked by the major UN family agencies for the enormous contribution we make. In volume and <i>per capita</i> terms, we are among the leading donors to some of these agencies.</P>
      <P>Senator McDowell mentioned in his contribution the issue concerning sexual and reproductive health. In this regard, Thoraya Obaid, a Saudi national who is a director of the UNFPA, thanked me recently at a meeting in Holland for the Irish contribution, which she said was unrivalled. In her experience this response is wanting in other countries. She said she wished every other member of the UN was as punctilious, proper and prompt in their contributions to the UNFPA. Ireland has had a chequered history with regard to reproductive health and one can imagine that some conservative voices might suggest we should not fund this programme. There has been active debate on the topic. However, we remain an active contributor and a true believer in supporting that and other UN funds.</P>
      <P>This House should understand that the basis of Irish public policy on overseas development is framed by and aligned to the millennium development goals. They are the template for Irish policy decision making. Ireland is living up to its international obligations. We believe in the goals and believe they can be achieved. Towards that end, and as part and parcel of the White Paper process which I mentioned already, we must align our entire policy with the millennium development goals so there is nothing in Irish policy that contradicts or hinders their achievement. We regard them as the template. The goals can be achieved and there are obvious benefits to be gained from achieving them. It is also good practice to align our policy with them.</P>
      <P>The millennium goals agreed by the governments of 189 nations are the best and most comprehensive plan we have to try to end human misery and build strong foundations for development and peace. To put it most simply, the millennium development goals are a deal where the developed world agreed to provide the resources to help fund programmes in health care, education and infrastructural development and where developing countries agreed to implement measures to counter corruption, reduce poverty and promote democracy, peace and accountability where these have been, unfortunately, absent.</P>
      <P>All of the policies and activities of the programme are to be judged against this commitment and their ability to achieve progress towards the goals. In a report recently compiled for the UN General Secretary, Kofi Annan, Jeffrey Sachs clearly outlines in rigorous technical detail not only that the millennium development goals set out in 2000 can still be achieved by 2015, but also how this can be done. This is the first time that a comprehensive costing exercise has been done and it is worth noting that the experts conclude that significant progress towards the achievement of the goals can be made with an investment of <Col N="526"/>just 0.5% of the incomes of developed countries like Ireland.</P>
      <P>As I said earlier, the issue for Ireland of how best to meet the 0.7% target, and in what timeframe, is currently under review. What is clear is that we must set a timeframe that is achievable, does not adversely affect the quality of our aid programme and is carefully managed. Some have made the critical observation that while the volume of our aid is obviously important, what is critical is the quality of our aid programme. In this context it is well to remember that it is a universally accepted principle in business that what constitutes a major threat to the viability of any organisation or business is rapid unplanned growth and expansion.</P>
      <P>I do not need to remind people of that fact. I was therefore surprised at the approach taken by Senator Quinn. I do not wish to be too critical because in the main his contribution was positive and benign. It would be bad for Ireland&rsquo;s development role and moral commitment to developing nations to engage in an operation where we sign a cheque and send it off to a multinational agency with the result that we could not guarantee good value for money and best practice in development terms. The one area where we can guarantee best practice and value for money is in regard to our bilateral programme. Senator McDowell stated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that we have been involved in planned expansions of that both in Asia but critically and, more important, in Africa.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I note that a number of other countries, including France and the UK, are looking at timeframes of somewhere around 2012 and 2013 for reaching the target of 0.7% of GNP. I have already stated publicly that a timeframe along these general lines seems reasonable and sensible for Ireland.</P>
      <P>Events in south-east Asia since St. Stephen&rsquo;s Day have both shocked and galvanised the world. Public interest in development aid, and the response of wealthy countries to emergencies such as the tsunami, have never been greater. During the next few months we will engage in a broad consultative process around the country regarding the future direction of the Government&rsquo;s official development programme with the aim of drawing up a White Paper on development policy in 2006. The extraordinary response of the Irish public to the recent tsunami is clear evidence that the people do care about those who <Col N="527"/>are less well-off than themselves. I am very much looking forward to listening to their views on the matter.</P>
      <P>The White Paper is not about undoing or rewriting what was achieved in the Ireland Aid review in 2000; it is about improving and enhancing both the principles that underpin our programme but also enhancing the quality of the programme we deliver for developing countries. If we do not do that and oversee and plan carefully the expansion of the programme, we would do a disservice to taxpayers but more critically to the people to whom we give this aid.</P>
      <P>It is important to remember the sheer, stark figures required for the achievement of the 0.7% in ODA. We are talking about moving from a contribution of &euro;545 million to in excess of &euro;1.3 billion. The sum of &euro;1.3 billion is not small, it is a significant sum. I noted with interest the suggestion that there is no capacity constraint. It goes without saying that if one moves to a position of doubling one&rsquo;s budget that capacity, resource and other issues regarding the achievement of value for money and the efficacy of what is spent will obviously arise. It is not rocket science. People who state that it is possible to move from a position of spending &euro;545 million to spending &euro;1.3 billion in one fell swoop are talking utter nonsense. We must plan carefully for what we spend and have a stepped approach.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the Development Co-operation Ireland staffing and resources issue. Senator McDowell made a fair point but the figures he quoted are in respect of the achievement of the 0.7% goal. The embargo on Civil Service recruitment will expire at the end of the year. I accept there are staff and resource restraints at present in the Department and look forward to the end of the year when these issues can be resolved through further recruitment of staff.</P>
      <P>I have probably exhausted the Acting Chairman&rsquo;s patience. The commitment to 0.7% in ODA was made in 2000 at a time and place when economic optimism here was unbridled. It was made as a moral commitment and remains a moral commitment which we will redeem and achieve. We would do no service to anybody by achieving it in an unplanned fashion. In fairness to the Taoiseach, it was a moral commitment which he made from a wellspring of idealism&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It was to get votes on the Security Council. It was completely immoral.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The idealism stemmed from our desire to focus on our international obligations. We will become a net contributor to the European Union and as we step up to the rostrum to do that we must also fulfil our international commitments. The Taoiseach&rsquo;s commitment in 2000 was a brave one which has energised the whole area of development aid, as is obvious from the debate this evening. More people are discussing the issue and the volume of overseas <Col N="528"/>development aid is significantly increasing. It has tripled since the coalition Government came to power in 1997. That speaks volumes for the Government&rsquo;s policy on overseas development aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am anxious to keep the tone of the debate constructive and appropriate. The Minister of State is welcome but his speech was provocative and would be offensive to many of the people working in the NGO sector. It was full of the most extraordinarily selective references to other people&rsquo;s views of Ireland, many of which were expressed at a time when we were still trumpeting our commitments to the UN target by 2007.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, the comments made by Mr. Wolfensohn, which I quoted last week, and Mr. Sachs, were made after the speech about the 0.7%&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Senator Ryan should be allowed to speak without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I was very restrained with the Minister of State. I feel threatened by him and ask the Acting Chairman to please restrain him.</P>
      <P>I am fascinated by the Government&rsquo;s decision to measure our generosity against the meanness of the world rather than against the instincts of our people, which we have witnessed. As I said in the House when we were debating the tsunami, for the United States as a country to match the generosity of the Irish people it would have had to pledge some US$5 billion or US$6 billion dollars to the tsunami disaster relief. It is offensive to Irish people to suggest we are doing well because we are doing better than a collection of countries that are characterised by miserable, limited, unimaginative and usually politically charged masquerades for ODA. To suggest that that should be our index is to insult the whole concept of our development programme.</P>
      <P>It is worth repeating what Senator Quinn stated. He is not a politically partisan individual. He is a man who takes his own position. He stated that when he heard what we were doing he felt a sense of shame and betrayal. That is what one feels tonight. Dressed up in a long speech is a sense that we have walked away from our commitment. In 2000 the Taoiseach promised we would meet the target by 2007. That was a seven-year target. In early 2005 the best the Minister of State can do is hope we will reach it by 2013, which is another eight years. We have retreated from a position where we were going to do it in seven years to one where we will do it in 15 years. After he said that, he mentioned a moral commitment. It is a peculiar concept of a moral commitment which means that we are not really bound by it, as distinct presumably from some other <Col N="529"/>kind of commitment where we are bound by it. That is what he said. A moral commitment was made in 2000. It was made in the United Nations when the Government wanted the prestige of membership of the Security Council and it promised every developing country that wanted to listen and that might consider voting for us that we would reach the target by 2007. Those of us who had to deal with the Government in the recent general election are aware that this is not an occasional or exceptional position; it is standard practice for the Government. Let us also remember that this commitment was made to the poor of the world in an international forum and we walked away from it.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State gave a wonderful quotation just after he commented on Senator Quinn&rsquo;s remarks to the effect that a major threat to the viability of any organisation is rapid, unplanned growth and expansion, about which we all know. However, the Minister of State would have us believe that rapid and unplanned are the same thing. Unplanned growth in the economy or any other sphere is full of risks, but that is not the same as rapid growth.</P>
      <P>For five years we have had a commitment to reach a target. There has been plenty of time to plan and organise it. Many NGOs are adamant in their assertion that they can handle that level of aid and there are sufficient target countries with sufficiently developed institutional structures to handle the increased amount. It is gratuitously offensive of the Minister of State to suggest that Senator Quinn&rsquo;s remarks about writing the cheque were not very thoughtful, given his expertise in these areas.</P>
      <P>Programmes such as the HIV-AIDS programme have an endless appetite for money and it would be universally used well because of their nature. There are structured and staffed programmes which could expand dramatically if the funding was available, but are constrained by the absence of basic resources. For example, fundamental primary care programmes involving activity like oral re-hydration therapy and the provision of simple, cheap clean water all over the world could be funded now.</P>
      <P>Therefore, it is disingenuous and unworthy of the Minister of State to insert arguments like that into what has been up to now a political consensus about ODA. I still do not know when precisely the Government decided it would dump this target. I am beginning to suspect it was the day after the Taoiseach left South Africa and made the commitment the second time. I suspect the Government decided at that stage that it would not do so and left it until after the general election to address. We then had the little hiccup and two arguments. It is a wonderful thing that in 2002 we could not meet the target because we were too poor and in 2004 we could not meet it because we were too rich. One of those arguments is untrue.</P>
      <?oasys [cl11.5]?>
      <P>The biggest problem about the debate and dealing with the Government and Minister of <Col N="530"/>State is that we cannot deal with the issue because of the tangents on which they are embarking. The NGOs are criticised for their lobbying because without them the Minister of State would not suffer the daily embarrassment he is enduring.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is claimed that the development movement is not giving value for money. Everyone knows that the development movement, through multilateral organisations, has been very poor. However, vast numbers of people working in development could use four times the amount of money they have and give us an enormous multiple effect in terms of development. It would help this debate enormously if we could get a coherent position from the Government &mdash; a coherent target not so far in the future that I will definitely have left politics along with many of those making the promise. We might not make it next year or the year after but 2010 is the upper limit of a renewed commitment. The year 2013 is so far away that it will leave billions dead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon"><NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
	<P>It is worth reminding ourselves that, from its very modest beginnings in 1974, the Government&rsquo;s official development co-operation programme last year spent &euro;475 million and we will spend upwards of &euro;1.8 billion on development assistance between 2005 and 2007. This will place us among the world&rsquo;s most generous donor countries. Responsibility for foreign policy rests with the Minister for Foreign Affairs but within that Department, the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, is in charge of development co-operation. He is doing a very good job. Like Senator Mooney, I abhorred his pillorying in the press at the time of the tsunami disaster, which was totally unfounded and unjustified.</P>
      <P>The reduction of poverty in its various manifestations is and will remain the overarching objective for Development Cooperation Ireland. The problems afflicting development companies have never been greater. As a nation which has known hardship throughout its own history but has also experienced prosperity in recent times, we now make a very significant contribution which helps millions of poor people around the world to escape the daily grind of poverty and disadvantage.</P>
      <P>DCI works in co-operation with governments in other countries and other donors, NGOs and international organisations as part of the global effort to achieve the millennium development goals to which the Minister of State referred. It is worth reminding ourselves of what these involve &mdash; the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger; to achieve universal primary education; to promote gender equality and empower women; to reduce child mortality and improve maternal health; to combat HIV-AIDS, malaria <Col N="531"/>and other diseases; and to ensure environmental stability and develop a global partnership for development. The millennium development goals provide the context in which the DCI priority sectors are decided. These include education, health, HIV-AIDS, agriculture and food security, water and sanitation infrastructure and roads, trades and development.</P>
      <P>Since 1997, the Government has spent more than &euro;2.4 billion on ODA. Between 1997 and 2007, the aid programme will have quadrupled. Despite all the talk, we are one of the world&rsquo;s most generous aid donors &mdash; well above the European average of 0.35%. Ireland is fifth in a list of who gives how much as a percentage of gross national income. Denmark donates 0.96%, Norway, 0.91%, the Netherlands, 0.82%, and Sweden, 0.74%, all of which are very high figures. Ireland is next with a figure of 0.41%, followed by France at 0.36%, Finland, 0.35%, Switzerland, 0.32%, United Kingdom, 0.3%, Canada, 0.28%, Germany, 0.27%, Spain, 0.25%, Japan, 0.23%, Italy, 0.2%, and so on.</P>
      <P>These figures in themselves do not always contain a great deal of information. For example, the figure for the United States is only 0.12% of its gross national income but amounts to $20.4 billion. Sometimes one must look inside the figures to see what is happening. Our total spending last year was &euro;475 million, some &euro;400 million of which was spent by the Department of Foreign Affairs through the programmes funded by Development Cooperation Ireland. The remaining &euro;75 million is disbursed to international organisations such as the World Bank and the World Food Programme through other Departments&rsquo; Votes.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State mentioned Mr. Wolfensohn&rsquo;s fine and deserved comments about the Irish contribution. The largest share of the money, with an expected outturn of &euro;150 million, went to seven programme countries, which are the chief focus of Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme, namely, Lesotho, Tanzania, Uganda, Mozambique, Ethiopia and East Timor. In 2001, we opened an office in Dili.</P>
      <P>We also provide humanitarian assistance to Palestine, to a number of projects in eastern Europe, the former CIS states and, in addition to the longer term development programmes, we respond to emergencies, for example, in the recent past significant humanitarian aid has been delivered to Afghanistan, southern Africa, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Darfur in Sudan and, more recently, on the Caribbean islands of Grenada, Haiti and the Dominican Republic following the recent hurricanes. There is no doubt that we contribute a great deal of money and work very hard. Ireland is involved in many good programmes, including recovery training and sectorial development, amounting to approximately &euro;75 million. A <Col N="532"/>major element under this heading is combating the surge in the number of HIV-AIDS infections. Ireland also assists new states. Last year, I had the honour of representing Ireland at the Asian-European parliamentary conference. At the subsequent Asian-European ministerial conference, the Taoiseach announced that Ireland planned to open an embassy in Vietnam and begin a full development programme there. Vietnam&rsquo;s neighbouring states, Laos and Cambodia, will also be a focus of this programme. There will be a fresh look at the possibility of more long-term co-operation with countries in west Africa. A new development office will open in several months in Sierra Leone, which will also deal with Liberia.</P>
      <P>Increases of &euro;190 million over the next three years in overseas development aid were announced in the 2005 budget. Between 2005 and 2007, the Government will spend a minimum of &euro;1.8 billion on overseas aid. It has made an additional &euro;10 million available for relief efforts in south Asia following the tsunami disaster. A welcome aspect of these increases is the restoration of multi-annual funding, with an increase of &euro;60 million in 2005 and minimum increases of &euro;65 million in 2006 and 2007. The real benefit of this three-year commitment is that Ireland and its partner countries can now strategically plan on a clear and growing financial base.</P>
      <P>Our multilateral aid programme with UN aid agencies, the World Bank and the EU has deepened and expanded. Ireland has worked hard in various ways, particularly during its EU Presidency, to achieve a more effective response from the international system to the challenges of reducing global poverty and achieving the millennium development goals. The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Conor Lenihan, is doing a good job in this regard. From his commitment, everything in our power will be done to reach the levels to which we are committed. The sum of &euro;1.8 billion is large. The work we have embarked upon is centred in many new and different states. Ireland is up there with the best of them. We are the fifth largest donor in terms of percentage of gross national income. This is even more admirable when one considers larger states below that level that do much talking but little contributing. As Senator Minihan stated, we can never be complacent. Our ambition is to increase aid to a level beyond every other state. Considering how far we have come in the past ten years, we should be proud and not complain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Conor Lenihan, to the House. He has already made his case on overseas development aid to the Committee on Foreign Affairs. I did not realise he had been pilloried and savaged over the Christmas, which I greatly regret. I deprecate that <Col N="533"/>because I know he is a decent man and has real concerns in this area. However, I do not believe the Government&rsquo;s performance is satisfactory. I am glad to see someone resemble a distinguished parent. The Minister of State, like his father, is able to put the most wonderful spin on matters. One will leave the House tonight saying we are the most generous people on earth and commenting on how the people and the Government responded to the tsunami disaster.</P>
      <P>Senator Lydon, who I greatly respect, referred to how Ireland has established an office in East Timor. However, it is piddly when compared to the generosity of the Timorese people during the tsunami disaster. Those bankrupted, deprived and ruined people who were exploited, colonised and the victims of attempted genocide, gave $50,000 to tsunami relief funds despite their poverty and misery. That should shame us. What that figure represents for those living on such tiny incomes is magnificent. Mr. Xanana Gusmao went to the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, to present it as a gesture of friendship. As we live in an interrelated world, these are the gestures we need.</P>
      <P>I do not mean to be entirely negative when I refer to the spin, so full of glic, that the Minister of State employs. His performance was fascinating to watch when he declared the promise of 0.7% was made in the flush of economic prosperity. Was it really? What are we in now? Is the Government now saying that as a result of its policies we have gone backwards and are no longer flush? As we are doing pretty damn well, I understood the coffers were bulging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are back on track after a brief interruption in services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>In those circumstances, it is regrettable that the objective of achieving the 0.7% figure has stalled. For a while it even went backwards. The comparatively small amounts of money involved make it shameful.</P>
      <P>I respect that good northside Dublin Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern. Like the Minister of State, he has the capacity to make one feel as one walks out of his office that one has the sun, the moon and the stars. First, the stars dissolve, then the moonlight dwindles. As things begin to get darker, one finds that one has not got everything one originally believed one had. Ireland has withdrawn from a commitment made by the Taoiseach which is unfortunate and serious. I am sure of his sincerity at the time. However, there was also some politicking as Ireland sought a seat on the UN Security Council. For promising the 0.7% figure, we got all the votes from those little countries. It was clever horse trading at which the Taoiseach is good. However, one must deliver at the end. If one does <Col N="534"/>not, not only is the international community disillusioned but the national community is likewise.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister listened to the reports of this dispute between the hospital consultants and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children? I support the Government on this matter. It is laughable that hospital consultants who receive these enormous fees and have 80% of their insurance premia paid by the Government should object to it brokering a good deal from the British insurers. It is a daft dispute. One argument made by the consultants is that one cannot rely on politicians. The first example given was what was described as the welching on the 0.7% overseas development aid target. I doubt too many consultants were actually heartbroken over the matter. However, they used it as an example. The other example used was the matter of the release of Jerry McCabe&rsquo;s killers, which is again off the table. It is interesting that the failure to reach the 0.7% target has entered the public perception as an example of how politicians cannot be trusted.</P>
      <P>It is particularly sad when one considers AIDS infection, literacy levels and poverty in the developing world. The number of people infected with AIDS between 1990 and 2000 doubled. This is a horrifying situation when one considers that it is treatable. When AIDS first struck Ireland, I recall attending a procession of funerals for those lovely young people cut down in the flower of their youth in a most awful death. Now, those with AIDS are not dying and look as healthy as any of us because of the advances in drug treatments. The advances made in the West can be copied in Africa. We have the capacity to keep these people alive. Last night a television programme on AIDS in Africa showed an unfortunate little girl left on her own in a village. One marvellous woman, with her fantastic headgear and flamboyance, said that as all these people came to her, she had to take them in to look after them. She did so on nothing. The cost of AIDS treatment in Africa would amount to &euro;150 million a year. Figuratively speaking it would get lost in a hole in one&rsquo;s tooth. This State, and its consumer society, will not miss &euro;150 million a year.</P>
      <P>As an independent Senator, I sometimes support the Government and sometimes the Opposition. I often praise the Government for the good work it does in this area. However, I cannot stand this shilly-shallying. The House, through this motion, wants to support the Minister of State in increasing overseas development aid as Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell did. She was fantastic in doing so and we, along with many Fianna F&aacute;il Members, will support the Minister of State if he tries to do the same.</P>
      <P>Some 2.2 million children die each year from a lack of immunisation, a simple injection which costs a few cents. That is where the money could go. Some 1.2 billion people live on less than $1 per day and we in this overblown, bloated econ<Col N="535"/>omy, bulging with cash, cannot afford &euro;150 million annually to live up to the commitment solemnly given.</P>
      <P>That is a pity and the excuse given is bizarre. There is a kind of Swiftian irony involved. Recently I heard the argument that the real problem is that we made the promise when we were comparatively poor, although the Minister of State says the opposite. The argument is that our success means more money is involved in the contribution because it is expressed as a fraction, so that 0.3% is more now because we have a bigger income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>In volume terms, it is enormous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a reason for giving it. We have so much more money. The figure involved is minuscule. As there are numerals in it such as five and four and seven, we think it is a lot of money. If an individual budget were involved it would be. The figure however is 0.7%. The Bible refers to tithes, stating that if one has not fed and clothed the least of these people, out one goes. We need to look at that. Recommendations have been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris was not present earlier. We have achieved the target with regard to &ldquo;the least of these&rdquo;, the least developed countries. The target is now 1.5% of GNP and we have achieved it, so in terms of the biblical quotation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The biblical quotation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am always available to be instructed from the Minister of State&rsquo;s vast religious repository. The report at this stage is wrong because a tithe is 10%.</P>
      <P>D&oacute;chas, among others, has made useful recommendations. The current situation is that we will be reneging on our commitment, which is a pity. The figures represent a major shift in policy as the projected growth falls well short of what was promised. If we are to fulfil what we promised as an effective, credible and well-resourced ODA programme, we need no more broken promises, a multi-annual growth plan with clear and credible benchmarks and a clear timeframe for reaching the 0.7% target. The Minister of State will recall a point made very effectively at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs by former Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell, that the ODA figure needs to be taken out of the annual Estimates. The wrangling is thereby avoided. Legislation is also needed to ensure that having given the commitment, we go for it.</P><Col N="536"/>
      <P>We will get political kudos if we live up to our commitment. We are a very small country with a reputation for generosity. Let us not lose that. The annual sum of &euro;150 million is meagre. Let us live up to the commitment and again become leaders.</P>
      <P>I will address the issue often raised, namely that of capacity and whether we can cope with this commitment. Yes, we can. Clear evidence was provided to back this up. I do not have time to develop this theme but anyone interested should read the record of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, where representatives of the NGOs made it clear that saying the recipients of the money could not possibly cope with it, and that it would destroy them, is rubbish. We have that on good authority and we have an analysis of the figures, so the Minister of State should not offend our intelligence. We are well capable of reading the records mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of information, Jeffrey Sachs accepts in his report that there is an absorption capacity issue even with regard to the millennium development goals in Africa. He predicates it on a capability of 30% more in terms of absorption capacity. If that is so, we cannot increase it by 40%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot have interruptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be well worth trying. To me, the real experts are the people on the ground. If the Minister of State has any difficulty in finding absorption I can produce God&rsquo;s quantity of good projects where one will get a bounce for one&rsquo;s buck for any spare capacity. The Minister of State can tell that to Mr. Sachs of whom I have never heard. Is he part of Goldman Sachs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>He is the UN man reviewing the millennium development goals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Good for him. I am delighted for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Senator Mansergh. Before I came to the House this evening I did not do much thinking on whether we have lived up to our ODA commitment. However, I am delighted to see the figure of &euro;1.8 billion projected over the next three years and that the commitment will be made to reach the United Nations target. That is where we are coming from in this debate.</P>
      <P>I listened to what everyone said here tonight about the amount promised this year and so much promised last year. The tsunami disaster occurred just after Christmas and everybody went to help as best they could in terms of reaching out to those in need. I was amazed. I went to Rathfarnham shopping centre two days after St. <Col N="537"/>Stephen&rsquo;s Day and there was a queue a mile long to contribute. Ireland is a model country. We rise to the occasion whenever we must.</P>
      <P>Since the tsunami disaster, I spoke with many of my friends and asked them if they knew about overseas development aid. How many people out there know what we are talking about now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>They know the commitment the Taoiseach gave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>My friends did not know what I was talking about, but they knew about the tsunami disaster. They know that we must give money to eradicate the poverty among poor nations. They want to help. However, they asked how the money we allocate is being spent. Maybe we have not reached our target but perhaps some of the money going to ODA annually is not being properly spent or properly managed. I do not know, but questions are being asked.</P>
      <P>I should have started by welcoming the Minister of State to the house and wishing him well. I know he will do a good job. However, the White Paper of which he speaks may be another way of creating awareness so that the public may say that while we have not reached our target we will do so. The public would like to know what we are doing in terms of overseas aid. I want to talk to some group about this matter but my knowledge has been limited. The Minister of State should use his time to tell the world that Ireland is number five on that contributor list and is as good as the best in reaching out.</P>
      <P>I was in South Africa two or three weeks ago. I met missionary workers there who talked about the programmes in which they were involved. I asked them how they became involved. They had to find out about the work through indirect means. I spoke to a teacher recently who had to take early retirement and told her that there was a golden opportunity for someone like her to go abroad to help for two months of the year. She said she loved the idea but did not even know how to go about such matters.</P>
      <P>While we talk of the White Paper, the consultative process, the proposals for progress, whether it be on HIV, education, health services, water schemes, sewerage schemes or whatever, there are people who leave work at the age of 55 and do not then want to take up a regular job. They want to change career paths. Here is a golden opportunity to involve people. That is what I want for the money being spent. We all know the commitment is there. We may not have reached it, but quality is about the way in which our money is being spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan. Today we have an ODA programme of which we can be proud. I would like us to go on making progress and do better, but we are doing well. The EU target, for <Col N="538"/>example, is 0.39% of GNP by 2007 and we are already past that point. As far as promises are concerned, obviously the Opposition wishes to make a political point. However, I will do them the credit of believing that, like me, they genuinely and sincerely want to see the target reached as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I have been looking up Garret FitzGerald&rsquo;s autobiography. There was a Government decision in November 1973 to raise overseas development aid by 0.05% a year. In 1982, the Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition promised to reach 0.7% by 1987. When the national coalition came to power in 1994, it was to go up by 0.05% a year and should have reached 0.4% by 1997. Deputy Burton and the Government got the figure up to 0.3% and I am not disposed to criticise her. She did her best during that time and I have the height of respect for her. She and her husband had worked on overseas development on the ground. It is quite difficult and all countries have had the experience of raising spending to the level that one would wish.</P>
      <P>Jeffrey Sachs, who we all ought to know is the millennium development goals special envoy, wants every country to achieve a target of 0.5% of GNP by 2015. I quoted from the interview in <i>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</i> on the last occasion that I spoke on this subject. He said that, if all countries could do that, it would help achieve the millennium development goals. We had an interim target before of 0.45% and we should set another because I do not believe we will achieve it all in one go. The obvious interim target, as I said in the debate on the tsunami, is 0.5%.</P>
      <P>I hope that it might be possible for us to achieve that by the end of the Government&rsquo;s term in office. I would like us to be out among the leaders &mdash; the four or five countries that are over 0.7% &mdash; as soon as possible. I greatly welcome the way in which, perhaps because of the tsunami disaster, development assistance has received political attention and priority. However, it has to compete against many other areas. There are many good and worthwhile causes and it is not realistic to pick out one area of Government policy and fix it legislatively. The same case could be made on behalf of disability and several other sectors.</P>
      <P>We have a very good programme and have made great progress in the past ten or 12 years. However, it will need sustained political will. The Minister and his Department can be sure of my complete support in the internal battles that he will have to fight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I too welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, to the House. I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate tonight, which is an issue particularly close to my heart.</P><Col N="539"/>
      <P>It is clear that we in Ireland, a country that has suffered its own share of poverty and famine, have a special obligation to contribute to a more just world and the Irish aid programme is a key part. We can all be proud of the excellent work of Development Cooperation Ireland, the agency responsible. It is now under the good leadership of the Minister of State, having previously been the responsibility of the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt. There has been a special focus on quality rather than quantity, while at the same time having a sustained increase in the budget for overseas development over the past five years. Although members of the Opposition seem to think that the problems of the developing world can be addressed by throwing more money in their direction, the Government has focused on ensuring that Irish taxpayers&rsquo; money makes a difference on the ground in some of the world&rsquo;s poorest regions.</P>
      <P>I am proud to say that I speak from experience on this matter. I have visited one of the Irish programme countries, Lesotho, on two occasions. I know that the Minister of State returned from there only a few weeks ago. It is a small country in southern Africa and our first priority country when we commenced the development co-operation programme back in the 1970s. However, notwithstanding our presence in Lesotho for almost 30 years, it is still among the poorest in the world. What does that tell us? It tells me very clearly that money is not all that is needed. It is also clear that there are no easy answers to the problem of world poverty and those who claim otherwise are not being honest and simply do not understand the complex nature of the deep poverty in Africa and elsewhere. The average African is now poorer than 30 years ago, notwithstanding the billions of dollars in aid given to the continent over the period.</P>
      <P>Something more must be done. We need a fresh type of international partnership, innovation and new thinking based not on the charity model but on the understanding that international co-operation is about partnership and solidarity between the rich countries of the north and the poorer ones of the south. In Ireland we can see the emergence of a new recognition among our European partners and those in the United States that conditions in the rest of the world really matter economically, ethically and in security terms. We know that the best way to counter international terrorism is through the support and development of peace and security. They are the most important links in any chain.</P>
      <P>I know from my visit to Lesotho that the Irish programme is doing just that and I have seen that we are putting programmes in place that support the basic needs for access to health care, education and clean water. I have visited, as I am sure the Minister of State has, schools and clinics <Col N="540"/>built with Irish taxpayers&rsquo; money. Sadly, I have also visited the orphanages established to cope with the unfortunate increase in the number of orphans as a result of HIV-AIDS, which is rampant in that little country.</P>
      <P>In that context, it is only fair to mention the upcoming visit of the president of Lesotho next week, in which I know the Minister of State is involved. It is the first official visit from that country. It goes back to when the Taoiseach visited Lesotho in 2000. When I was there, people would bow before one to give thanks for the wonderful work that one was doing for them. I know how committed the Minister of State is, having spoken to him on many levels about overseas development and his support for it. I know that the Government is committed. Like other speakers from this side, I feel that we should be talking more about congratulating ourselves on the wonderful structure that we have in place and how the programme is working out. When one talks to NGOs and the recipients of that aid on the ground, one sees that it works. Perhaps if the Opposition had thought about quality rather than quantity, it would not have tabled this motion tonight.</P>

	<P>I thank all those who contributed to the debate, which has been interesting and useful, a measure of the commitment on all sides of the House to meeting the goals set by the Government at the earliest opportunity. A number of interesting points were made to which I wish to refer briefly.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Senator Feeney made an interesting and thoughtful contribution, although I profoundly disagree with her last comment. She said rightly, however, that this is not just about money. Other serious issues arise about governance, corruption, money being siphoned off and trade which impact seriously on development in the Third World, but we should not use those issues as an excuse not to spend money because money is also essential. We can achieve a great deal by writing the cheque. Debt relief is largely about writing the cheque. Providing the drugs that are life-saving in many African countries is about writing the cheque.</P>
      <?oasys [cl11.5]?>
      <P>There are issues with capacity which relate in no small measure to our ability, for example, to provide the staff in Development Cooperation Ireland &mdash; that was mentioned during the course of the debate &mdash; but they are not such as to prevent us meeting the target set by the Taoiseach or act as an excuse for not making the sort of progress we should be making. Senator Mansergh made an interesting point when he said that Governments over the years had difficulty meeting the targets. He is right. Government after Government set targets and missed them. Perhaps we are thinking about this issue in the wrong way. In a sense we are thinking about it as <Col N="541"/>being the cream on the top of the milk. If we can spend whatever we want on every domestic programme on which we want to spend money, we will use whatever is left over for the poor of the Third World.</P>
      <P>I genuinely thought the Taoiseach&rsquo;s commitment in 2000 signalled a shift in priorities and political will in that from then on we recognised that this was a priority all of us wanted to meet and would meet. That has been the major failing of the past five years because it is clear that political will no longer exists. That is a great pity because the reality is that domestic demand will always be greater. There will always be something we can put higher on the priority list than the poor of the Third World. The only way to deal with it is to say, in legislation or otherwise, that this is a firm commitment which we will meet come what may.</P>
      <P>It is a pity the Minister of State repeated the two central excuses that were offered by Government in explaining the reason it has resiled from this commitment. He said, yet again, that unforeseen economic circumstances intervened at some point between 2000 and now to explain it. That is simply not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>No doubt the events of 11 September 2001 did not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>We expected and hoped in 2000 that we would have year on year growth of about 5%, and we did. We are where we expected and hoped to be economically. We always knew the figures and the volume. We knew we would be talking about a doubling of aid. It could not have come as a surprise to anybody. It certainly did not come as a surprise to the Minister&rsquo;s colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs. We knew the commitment we were making. It is now <Col N="542"/>what it was then, and we knew then what we know now. That excuse does not explain the failure of the Government and the deception it has engaged in over that time.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney said in his thoughtful contribution that he hoped that by the end of this Government we would be within shouting distance &mdash; I think that was the phrase he used &mdash; of the 0.7% target. The sad fact is that we will not. GNP figures are consumer price index related and therefore to stay where we are, with 5% growth, we must increase it by approximately 8% or 9% per year. We are talking about an increase of 10% over the next two or three years. If we make just the minimum commitment we are talking about, the &euro;60 million or &euro;65 million over the next few years, we will be at 0.43% in 2007. If we continue at that rate, not only will we be gone from politics, most of us will be gone from this earth by the time we meet the commitment. It requires a serious ratcheting up of money if we are to have any hope of meeting this commitment not in 2007, but in 2009 or 2010.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed the Minister of State repeated his target of 2012 or 2013. That is far too long away. Most Members of this House and elsewhere could live with the target being missed by one, two or three years but to postpone it by up to eight years beyond the original target is not acceptable.</P>
      <P>I thank those who contributed to the debate. Looking at it positively, it is one more stage in trying to build the political consensus and will, which is the fundamental <i>sine quo non</i> of meeting our commitments. Without a commitment on a cross-party basis, we will never meet the target. Perhaps this debate will serve as one extra rung on the ladder in terms of getting us there.</P>

      <sTitle>Dublin Port Tunnel.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Callely, to the House.</P>
        <P>I have raised this issue on a number of occasions over the past two or three years. On 21 October last, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, on taking office said that the height of the port tunnel would not change and that this decision had been taken primarily on safety grounds. As a result of the controversy and the public debate on this matter the previous Minister, Deputy Brennan, had appointed a consultant named Atkins to advise him. What surprises me is that the Minister&rsquo;s decision was taken primarily on safety grounds as well as cost considerations.</P>
        <P>However, the Atkins report appears to be at variance with many of the reasons given by the Minister. For example the National Roads Authority&rsquo;s advice to the Minister was:</P>
        <P LI="1">Reducing the lane width from 3.65 m to 3.5 m would constitute less overall tunnel safety, in the context of the tunnel carrying a very high % of HGVs, including fuel tankers and other hazardous cargoes; and it is intuitively apparent that wider traffic lanes offer greater vehicle separation than narrower lanes and, therefore, greater safety.</P>
        <P FLI="0">However, Atkins said a 3.5 m lane was &ldquo;fully justified and will not compromise safety&rdquo;. He said an increase of the width of traffic lanes over 3.5 m did not increase tunnel capacity or improve safety. That is completely at variance with what the NRA advised the Minister. The current Irish national standard is 3.5 m in tunnels and that is the standard used throughout Europe and the rest of the world. An EU directive on safety in road tunnels of the trans-European road network, September 2003, requires no additional lane <Col N="544"/>width over 3.5 m for heavy goods vehicles to be taken to enhance safety on the basis of a risk analysis.</P>
        <P>The Minister was advised to change the lane width from 3.65 m to 3.5 m. Any formal adjudication requires revised planning procedures and is a matter for An Bord Plean&aacute;la. Environmental impact statements and An Bord Plean&aacute;la approvals are based on preliminary designs where lane width details and bridge height are not issues other than that they must be to standard. An Bord Plean&aacute;la has never commented on the height of standard bridges and this is supported by its recent decision on Limerick&rsquo;s Shannon tunnel crossing where the planning board confirmed that its decision excluded height considerations on the grounds that this was a national policy issue.</P>
        <P>The NRA advised the Minister that to increase the height amounted to a radical change in the middle of the contract and said the scale of the works was to increase the headroom. However, Atkins said the scale of the works to increase the maintained headroom was low to moderate.</P>
        <P>Atkins recommended:</P>
        <P LI="1">The process of considering initiatives to increase the maintained headroom of the DPT has shown that space is available in the tunnel to accommodate an increase in the maintained headroom and that the scale of the civil and mechanical engineering works required to implement it are low to moderate. On a purely technical basis, a recommendation to raise the maintained headroom to either 4.75 m or 4.90 m could be made, that would accommodate up to 79% or 100% respectively of the HGV trailers that would be affected by the current maintained headroom limit. In the latter case, this would allow for &lsquo;supercube&rsquo; trailers to use the DPT.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The NRA advised the Minister that the prevailing movement across the world was towards controlling the maximum height of vehicles, primarily on safety grounds, and that evidence of the need for such a limit was reinforced by the many bridge strikes which occur each year, with significant cost and safety implications.</P>
        <P>This evidence is at odds with the Atkins report. The report stated that in 1999, the UK introduced a 5.03 m maintained headroom for the design of road tunnels. Promoting high-clearance vehicles has been official policy of the UK&rsquo;s Department of Transport since 1998. Its strategy document <Col N="545"/>entitled Towards Sustainable Distribution, contains a strong endorsement of promoting high-clearance vehicles.</P>
        <P>The NRA advised the Minister that there is no factual basis for the assertion made that to increase the height does not involve very substantial additional cost and time. The Atkins report stated that the construction of the modified verge and drainage is likely to be very similar to the existing ones and that no significant additional cost or time should be attributed to them. It also stated that the cost implications associated with the modification can be categorised as low and that it contains design and construction implications that are relatively minor. By reducing the internal diameter of the lane widths to 3.5 m, the road space in the tunnel is reduced by 3,000 sq. m. That is a total reduction of 4% in the overall road space. That actually reduces costs.</P>
        <P>The Dublin Port tunnel is a strategic link in our transport infrastructure. Up to 60% of this country&rsquo;s exports leave through Dublin Port. The NRA claimed that there was no reason to increase the height of the tunnel because we would be making allowances for vehicles that are not on our national road network. The opposite is the case as such vehicles are on our road network. The motorway bridges in this country are 5.3 m high. The new Luas bridge in Dundrum is 5.5 m high. At the recent public inquiry into the upgrade of the M50, it was decided that two new tunnels were to be built at the Castleknock/<?oasys [jy?>Blanchardstown interchange. Those two tunnels are 5.3 m high. The port tunnel will be 4.65 m high. Something is wrong.</P>
        <P>The large trucks for which this tunnel was meant to cater will still be on our streets. The idea of a HGV ban cannot now happen. The ridiculous situation will arise where the biggest trucks will be on our streets and the smaller trucks will be in the tunnel. From an economic point of view, this is completely baffling. We have been losing manufacturing jobs in this country on a weekly basis for the past few years. We are now becoming a nation of distributors. How do all the goods from our big companies leave the country? The answer is that they leave on supercubes. While the debate on this issue has been about supercubes, it should have been about the goods that are in those trucks and on the jobs in this country that depend on the goods in those trucks getting to foreign markets at competitive prices. It is ridiculous that we will have two vehicles on the road instead of one. I do not know why there was an Atkins report if the Minister states &ldquo;intuitively&rdquo; that wider lanes are safer than narrower lanes. A mistake has been made and we will live to regret it if this is not examined.</P>
        <P>The final irony is that the company constructing the tunnel sought an alternative on how to do this. It was told that it was not employed to do that and that it should do what it was contrac<Col N="546"/>ted to do. The fact that the company was told not to bother is referred to in the Atkins report. The whole purpose of the tunnel was to get trucks off our streets, but that is not what will happen. If we are to have a HGV ban in the city of Dublin, I would like to know how it will happen. I appeal to the Minister to look at this again. The NRA has seriously misled the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Morrissey for raising this issue on the Adjournment. I listened with interest to what he was saying, some of which was contradictory, some of which was not quite correct. I share some of the views that he raised. I have raised some of these aspects with officials. I am familiar with the Dublin Port tunnel. I was a member of the council through which it was processed and the tunnel is located in my constituency. My own wish is for all HGVs to be accommodated in this tunnel as it has cost in excess of &euro;750 million. Unfortunately, we have found ourselves at this stage and we hope it becomes operational in early 2006.</P>
        <P>Following Government consideration, the Minister for Transport announced on 21 October 2004 that the operational height of the tunnel would not be changed and that the construction of the tunnel would be completed with an operational height of 4.65 m. The decision was based on safety grounds, but cost and time delays to the opening of the project were also factors. The options for increasing the height of the tunnel were considered by the NRA, by the independent consultants, Atkins, and by Dublin City Council. The contractor, NMI, priced the work that would be involved in increasing the height of the tunnel. It was clear that raising the height of the tunnel would not be justified having regard to safety, cost and delay factors.</P>
        <P>The main safety issues related to the reduction in lane widths and increasing kerb height, which would be required to secure an increase in tunnel height. The implications of overheight HGVs for the rest of the national road network also had to be taken into account. Reducing lane widths would constitute a reduction in overall tunnel safety given that it will be carrying a very high percentage of HGVs, including fuel tankers and other hazardous cargos. It is apparent that wider traffic lanes offer greater vehicle separation than narrower lanes.</P>
        <P>Increasing kerb heights, which Senator Morrissey did not mention, would also impact on safety. The NRA is of the opinion that the lower kerb height of 150 mm represents a safer provision than the 200 mm kerb height which would be required to secure a height increase.</P>
        <P>The implications of facilitating through the tunnel higher vehicles than the national motorway and road network can safely accommodate had to be considered. Bridges and other structures on <Col N="547"/>motorways and national roads are not designed to cater for vehicles higher than the current tunnel height by and large and safety concerns would arise were such vehicles discharged from a revised tunnel onto the national road network. I see the Senator is shaking his head, but while there may be aspects of the road network which feature infrastructure such as he outlined, other infrastructure has the same parameters as the tunnel. Some bridges may even be lower than the safe operational height of the tunnel. A traffic management plan is to be put in place as well as the port tunnel.</P>
        <P>There are potential additional costs associated with the Senator&rsquo;s proposal of at least &euro;33 million and up to &euro;65 million and completion of the tunnel would be delayed by seven months or more. The Senator seeks to ask a contractor near the completion of a project to provide an estimate for additional work and to say how long it would take. I am not sure people would want to enter such a loose arrangement in the context of so vast a project. We could not be satisfied the estimated additional costs would not be exceeded.</P>
        <P>The priority is to secure completion as quickly as possible of a safe tunnel facility in line with best international practice. The operational height of the tunnel when complete will be 4.65 m which is greater than that obtaining in most EU member states. As the Senator knows, the announcement was made on this matter following collective consideration by his colleagues in Government. I understand from the NRA and Dublin City Council that the tunnel will be completed in December 2005. We will carry out a number of operational safety tests over a period of six to eight weeks at that point after which, hopefully, the tunnel will be commissioned.</P>
        <P>A consultant engineer brought to my attention views similar to those of the Senator and I arranged for him to meet an official of my Department. I understand the concerns he raised were adequately addressed. As a public representative, Senator Morrissey should feel free to bring to the attention of my office any information he has which he believes requires further evaluation. If he does so, I will arrange for the issues he has raised to be teased out in greater detail. An Adjournment debate may not be the best format in which to address some of the issues he has raised.</P>
        <P>While tunnel height is a matter for my colleague, Deputy Cullen, as the Minister for Transport, Senator Morrissey referred to the height of vehicles which falls under my direct area of responsibility. I published a consultative document on the broader question of a maximum height limit for vehicles which has generated 41 submissions from corporate entities, representative groups and individuals. The submissions are being considered with a view to establishing a <Col N="548"/>definite position. I hope the foregoing clarifies the matter for the House and is somewhat helpful.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to respond to this evening&rsquo;s Adjournment matters. The Minister of State may be aware that the Government is to provide &euro;500,000 to the pensions board to fund a national pensions awareness campaign this year. I am concerned that the pensions board will use the money to sell pension products by pointing out their benefits and informing people of the reasons they should provide for their retirement. I have heard the arguments involved for a long time and have raised in the House on a number of occasions the pitfalls of pensions.</P>
      <P>Many people rang in to a radio discussion last week to tell the programme producer about their disappointment with the pensions plans into which they had paid for many years. As they approached retirement age, they were told by their providers that their pension schemes were underfunded or were being wound up. We never hear the pensions board advising people of the risks attached to pension schemes. In the interests of fairness and transparency, 50% of the &euro;500,000 being provided should be spent to highlight the disadvantages or risks attached to pension schemes. The risks are not highlighted currently and people buy into pension schemes unwittingly without sound advice or information. As the Minister of State knows, the result of the McKenna case was that 50% of funding to inform a referendum debate should be spent equally on either side of the argument. I ask that the same happens here. We must have transparency. People are not receiving adequate information on how they should invest their money. They are realising after many years that they will not even get back the money they invested in their pension schemes.</P>
      <P>In anticipation of this matter, I read last night through a document all Members received from IFSRA in which it set out its strategic plan for 2004 to 2006. While I would like to see the policies set out by IFSRA applied by the pensions board, I see nothing of the sort in any of its documentation. IFSRA plans to introduce in 2005 an integrated and harmonised code of practice for all financial services providers. As part of this project, IFSRA will endeavour to ensure that product costs, risks and benefits are explained clearly by financial service providers in the documents they provide to customers. IFSRA intends to produce new advertising rules and guidelines for financial service providers to ensure products and services are clearly explained. IFSRA points out that it acts in the best interests of consumers and works with integrity and transparency.</P><Col N="549"/>
      <P>While I do not contend that the pensions board does not act with integrity, there is a lack of transparency in its operations. While the board is required to work in the best interests of consumers, it appears to be working in the interest of the pensions industry. The board pushes pension products constantly and the industry gains from the process. The board is not highlighting the risks.</P>
      <P>When the pensions industry and the Pensions Board highlight, advertise or promote their products, they should point out that occupational pension schemes do not guarantee benefits, similar to a Government health warning. Financial institutions are quick to point out that a product is State guaranteed but the reverse is not the case and people are not given a warning that the benefits of a product are not guaranteed and may be at risk. A requirement or obligation should be placed by the Government on the pensions board to adopt such warnings in its code of practice and ensure financial institutions adopt that approach. The board works on behalf of consumers and its funding, which is provided by the taxpayer, should be spent fairly to highlight the risks of investing in occupational pension schemes so that people know what they are doing and the board is being fair to everybody at the end of the day.</P>
      <P>The number of people who do not have pensions speaks for itself. People have not bought into PRSAs in the numbers anticipated unlike SSIAs. People opened SSIAs because they knew what would be the return on the fixed rate accounts and the risk attaching to the equity-based accounts. However, few people know what the return will be on a pension plan or what it is worth until the time comes and they are disappointed.</P>
      <P>I have raised the issue a number of times and it needs to be addressed. I hope the Minister for Social and Family Affairs took my previous comments on board and I ask that my comments in this debate are conveyed to him so that something is done to improve the lot of people on occupational pension schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator asked a number of relevant questions, which I will answer as best I can. The allocation of &euro;500,000 is specifically for the campaign to raise awareness of pension issues and the need for people to supplement their current pension plans if they wish to maintain their living standards following retirement. The campaign does not focus on or recommend a particular product but encourages people to consider the options available or to consult with their employers or a pensions provider to identify the most appropriate arrangement for their circumstances. Pension schemes, in general, depend on investment returns to fund future pension needs. Equities are an important part of the investment portfolio of pension schemes and, accordingly, <Col N="550"/>the assets of schemes can vary depending on market conditions.</P>
      <P>This Minister will be before the House in the next few months to introduce the social welfare and pensions Bill, which he intends to publish shortly. It contains measures to ease difficulties being experienced by many schemes in meeting the funding standard laid down in the Pensions Act. A statutory review of the overall pensions strategy was due to be carried out in 2006. However, given the limited progress on coverage targets over the past two years, as the Senator pointed out, the Minister has decided to bring the review forward. It will be undertaken this year and it will focus on a range of issues, including coverage and measures to improve the current position.</P>
      <P>The Government is anxious to encourage people to participate in occupational pensions schemes or to consider personal arrangements such as personal retirement savings accounts, PRSAs. The pensions board in its report on the national pensions policy initiative in 1998 suggested that up to 70% of those in the workforce aged 30 years and over needed to supplement the basic social welfare pension if they were to maintain their pre-retirement standard of living. Government policy in recent years on pensions has, with the support of the social partners through successive partnership agreements, focused on achieving this target.</P>
      <P>A national campaign to raise the profile of pension issues among the public has been an important part of the Government drive in this area over the past two years. In this regard, &euro;500,000 was provided to the pensions board annually in 2003, 2004 and this year to run such a campaign. The objective of the national pensions awareness campaign is to raise public awareness of pensions generally, to educate people about options available and to encourage them to consider the most suitable arrangement for their circumstances.</P>
      <P>The Minister does not consider that statements along the lines suggested by the Senator would be an appropriate part of this campaign. The objective is not to sell a particular arrangement or product but to raise awareness and to educate so that people are equipped to make informed pension choices. The disclosure requirements for pensions and PRSAs and the sales procedures for personal products, laid down by Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, are intended to ensure people are aware of the issues associated with particular arrangements and that they choose the most appropriate arrangement for their requirements.</P>
      <P>The campaign has been extremely successful in raising public awareness of pensions issues. The Minister suggests that as a result of the debate engendered by the awareness campaign over the<?oasys [jy?><Col N="551"/><?oasys [fc?>past two years that not only are people aware of the need for supplementary income in retirement, but they are also conscious of the risks involved. While there has been success in increasing overall coverage rates, unfortunately, the progress does not suggest that the overall targets are likely to be reached within a reasonable period.</P>
      <P>An overall review of our pensions strategy is required to be completed by September 2006. <Col N="552"/>However, given the progress made the Minister decided to bring forward this review. It will address issues of coverage and ways of improving the current position. The Minister expects to receive the pensions board report in June and, at that stage, he will consider what further action is required in this area.</P>
