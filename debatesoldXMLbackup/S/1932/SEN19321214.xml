      <P>The first item on the Order Paper is the motion by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. This motion was formally moved by Senator Comyn and seconded by Senator O'Doherty, and it is only necessary now for the Minister in charge to give some explanation of the motion.</P>
      <P>Debate resumed on the motion:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Seanad approves of the Trade Agreement between the Irish Free State and the Dominion of Canada, signed at Ottawa on the 20th day of August, 1932, a copy of which was laid on the Table of the Seanad on the 26th day of October, 1932.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms of the agreement between the Irish Free State and the Dominion of Canada are easy to understand.  The agreement contains three Articles.  By the first of these Articles, the Irish Free State is committed to this:&mdash;That goods, the produce or manufacture of Canada, imported into the Irish Free State, cannot be made subject to other or higher duties than those paid on similar goods the produce or manufacture of any other country.  Article II requires that goods, the produce or manufacture of the Irish Free State, imported into Canada, cannot be subject to other or higher duties than those paid on similar goods the produce or manufacture of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Article III provides that the agreement, when brought into force, shall remain in force for a period of five years from the date of its coming into force, and thereafter until the expiration <Col N="452" /> of six months from the date on which either Government shall have given to the other notice of its intention to terminate the agreement.  This Article also provides that the agreement shall be subject to the approval of the Parliaments of the Dominion of Canada and of the Irish Free State.</P>
      <P>In view of the terms of the agreement, it is necessary to have reference to the agreement, concluded on the same date, between the Dominion of Canada and the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland, which was also laid before the Oireachtas.  That agreement, which will operate for the same period, provides for the reduction of the duties in operation in Canada upon a large number of articles when consigned from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and in view of the agreement between the Irish Free State and Canada, the same reduction will operate in respect of these goods when consigned from the Irish Free State.  It is true that, in so far as a large number of these goods is concerned, we have no interest; but there are some of them in respect of which we had, in the past, a fairly substantial trade with Canada, a trade which was seriously impaired by recent increases in the Canadian duties and which it is now hoped to regain either in whole or in part.  Trade between the Irish Free State and Canada was never very substantial and has, since the establishment of the Irish Free State, been very heavily in favour of Canada.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal items of Saorstát produce exported to Canada were the following&mdash;and I give them in the order of importance:&mdash;Agricultural tractors and parts, woollen tissues, biscuits, horses, raw wool, and drink. The total value of our exports to Canada for the year 1930 was about £133,000, whereas the value of our imports from Canada in that year was £772,000.  In 1931 and the early parts of the year 1932, in consequence of the operation of certain duties which carried an imperial preference clause, imports from Canada were increased considerably, particularly in the case of bacon, although the emergency duties imposed in July operated to <Col N="453" /> terminate that trade.  However, although the position has tended to redress itself, it is still, as it always has been, that the balance of trade was substantially against us.  In recent years imports from Canada have been declining in value, whereas exports to that country have been appreciating in value, but the movement was not sufficiently great to alter the position to any material extent. It is not possible, of course, to say definitely to what extent the operation of this agreement will affect our export trade.  It is undoubtedly correct to say that there is available in Canada a valuable market for a number of the products which I have mentioned, a market which has not been availed of in full up to the present but in respect of which we hope action will be taken by the industrialists concerned to improve their position in the near future.  Following the conclusion of the agreement and the return of the Delegation from Canada, various meetings were held with persons interested in the exportation of these particular goods and some effort has been made in respect of a number of the industries concerned to explore the position in Canada by sending representatives to that country.</P>
    <P>The effect of the agreement upon our position is <i>nil.</i>  I mean by that, that the adoption of this agreement and the bringing of it into force will not involve any change in the duties now in operation here.  In fact, as far as we are concerned, it merely continues in existence the condition that has always operated up to the present. It is wrong, of course, to assume that that position would have continued in any case.  That is not so.  It is rather a peculiar fact that the Irish Free State operated Imperial Preference much more impartially, as between members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, than any others of the member States.  In the case of a number of the States which are members of the Commonwealth no preference was conferred on Commonwealth goods, as such, except where special trade agreements involving such preference had been concluded between any one State and some other State. <Col N="454" /> When the question of the extension of general preferential tariff treatment was discussed at the Imperial Conference, it was decided almost unanimously not to adopt a resolution in favour of such general extension.  In other words, the States there represented took the line that the only preferential treatment that should be extended was that which they were required to give in consequence of specific commitments entered into in the form of trade treaties.  The position now is that we have secured with Canada a treaty which is, roughly speaking, based on the most-favoured-nation clause.  It secures for the produce of the Irish Free State in that country the same tariff treatment as is conferred upon the produce of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  It is true that the industrialists of this country, competing in the Canadian market with the industrialists of Great Britain, possess certain disadvantages, but in the past they have been able to compete fairly successfully there, and there is no reason to anticipate that they will not be able to do so in the future.  In fact, as against these disadvantages, there are certain offsetting advantages.  The Seanad must consider the extent to which, if at all, this agreement is likely to cut across the policy which might be considered the most suitable policy for this State to adopt.  Heretofore, it has been the policy of the Government of the Free State to base these treaties upon the most-favoured-nation clause, but Senators who have been studying the trend of international affairs will have realised that that clause has been going out of use entirely and, in fact, has come to mean very little more than a phrase in a treaty with no practical significance.</P>
    <P>The tendency throughout the world is in favour of direct bargaining, treaties as between two countries, and it is not unlikely that the Irish Free State will find itself in the position in which, if it desires to have any trade with a number of these countries, it will have to enter into treaties of that nature.  We had to consider that matter in relation to this Canadian <Col N="455" /> Treaty.  We came to the conclusion that this is one we could enter into, although it is of the most-favoured-nation clause type, without danger that it would cut across future policy.  The volume of trade is, in any event, not very considerable nor is it ever likely to become very considerable because both Canada and the Free State are, of course, to a large extent engaged in the protection of articles of a similar kind.  In deciding to recommend the treaty for adoption, the Government are giving expression to their opinion that the operation of this treaty for five years will not, in fact, impede their effort to secure favourable trading conditions as between the Free State and other countries although we would be required by this treaty to confer upon Canadian produce the benefit of the lowest tariff which we give to any other country.  Having examined the list of articles which Canada is engaged in exporting and which they could conceivably find a sale for in this market, we think that the treaty will not interfere seriously with our efforts to secure better trading conditions with other countries.  The produce which we are likely to buy in quantities from other countries are not those which Canada is in a position to supply, whereas the goods that we have been taking from Canada are goods that during the period of five years we are likely to require.  If they were not procured in that country then they would have to be procured elsewhere. I submit the agreement for the approval of the House.</P>

      <P>I think it would be difficult to estimate the value of this agreement without adverting to the circumstances under which it was negotiated.  To my mind no more momentous expedition ever left the shores of any country than that which went to Ottawa last July since Jason and his Argonauts of the well-known legend set out in search of the Golden Fleece.  Every Government service in this country was plundered for talent.  Government Departments were left politically and administratively headless that Ottawa might be served.  The ship which sailed from <Col N="456" /> Belfast Lough in July had an argosy of Ministerial and administrative talent unsurpassed in the history of the Free State.  There were aboard three Ministers, including the Vice-President of the Executive Council, fifteen civil servants together with a sage and dignified member of this House who went, I suppose, as a sort of matronly chaperon.  We were told on unimpeachable Press authority that on the voyage neither the Vice-President nor Senator Johnson nor any of the party indulged in leap-frog exercise on deck or joined in the Charleston, or participated in any of the diversions organised for the entertainment of passengers.  Instead, they formed committees of their own, and spent their time studying blue books in anticipation of a triumph over the other delegates at Ottawa.  We read with sympathy of Mr. O'Kelly's placing a wreath on the tomb of the Unknown Soldier, of his being entertained by the Governor General, of him and his colleagues ridding themselves of their prejudice in regard to headgear and placing orders with an Ottawa trader for silky top-hats to the detriment of our local hatters.  When we read these things our hopes were rosy.</P>
      <P>We knew that Mr. O'Kelly had poured green, white and yellow ridicule on members of the last Government who attended Imperial Conferences.  I recall the caustic speech made by Mr. O'Kelly just twelve months ago, in which he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We have no pride in being associated with the work of the present Minister for External Affairs.  The aim of those responsible for the report as clearly demonstrated by the Minister is to nail and copper-fasten us for ever to the British Empire and its King. We owe no allegiance to the British Empire and we give none.  What interests have we in common with Australia, Canada, New Zealand or South Africa?  Economically some of them are our greatest competitors in the produce market.  It would probably be better for us economically to be disconnected from them, and to be as far apart from them as possible.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="457" /> Mr. O'Kelly then went on to criticise the message of loyalty which is sent at the beginning of every Imperial Conference.  He described it as &ldquo;hogwash,&rdquo; and said it was an indignity for this ancient nation to be associated with rubbish of the kind.  &ldquo;Is there any greater lie the Minister could tell,&rdquo; said Mr. O'Kelly, &ldquo;than that we are inspired by feelings of love and affection in this regard&mdash;love and affection for what?  Is it love and affection for the Black and Tans?  On matters of this kind, we, on this side, do not intend to speak with our tongues in our cheeks.  We intend to be honest and straight.  We have no idea of allowing ourselves to be associated with that work which is the very antithesis of the work we should be doing for Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Having recalled these caustic words, we, the opponents of Mr. O'Kelly, felt that he would not &ldquo;pervert&rdquo; unless the cause of country was to be served handsomely.  When we found the caustic Mr. O'Kelly of a year before sending loyal messages to the King we felt that the Jason of Fianna Fáil had secured the Golden Fleece.</P>
    <P>The text of the message sent to King George by Mr. O'Kelly and the delegates was in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Representatives of the Government of the British Commonwealth, assembled in conference at Ottawa, at their first meeting and as their first official act, desire to present their respectful duty to the King and to thank him for the gracious message which has just been read by his Excellency the Governor-General. They join in thanksgiving for your Majesty's continued health and earnestly hope your Majesty and her Majesty the Queen may long be spared to strengthen the feelings of love and devotion shared by all the peoples of the British Commonwealth of Nations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the message despatched at the beginning of the Conference.  At the end of the Conference, the following address was unanimously voted, all the delegates standing, including, of course, Mr. O'Kelly and his colleagues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The representatives of the Government of the British Commonwealth <Col N="458" /> who have been assembled in conference at Ottawa during the past few weeks desire at the conclusion of the Conference again to present their respectful duty. They pray that Divine Providence may continue to give your Majesty and her Majesty the Queen health and strength to preside over the destinies of all the Nations of the Commonwealth and they renew the assurance of devotion and affection of your peoples.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hope that Senator Quirke is present so that he may hear what Mr. O'Kelly did, as representing him, at Ottawa. I would suggest to him that he should have these loyal messages recited as the opening and closing prayers at all Fianna Fáil Cumainn in Tipperary. As I have mentioned, Mr. O'Kelly was entertained by the Governor-General of Canada, when, I have no doubt, he and his colleagues&mdash;the Minister for Industry and Commerce can contradict me&mdash;drank the health of His Majesty the King.  They attended at the trooping of the colours and indulged in every form of imperialistic revelry at Ottawa.  I know it is denied that they so far forgot their history as to play &ldquo;bridge.&rdquo;  The name might have brought unpleasant recollections. They may have stooped to &ldquo;poker.&rdquo;  But if one is to judge by results the game most favoured by them was &ldquo;beggar-my-neighbour.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What was the price received by our delegates for their conversion to Imperialism?  The agreement recited by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, by which this country is enabled to send in its goods to Canada on the same terms and in competition with goods from Great Britain&mdash;that is the sum total of the Ottawa expedition. I might say that Ottawa was in labour and brought forth a very lean and emaciated mouse.  To obtain this agreement with a country with which, according to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, we do very little business, we spent a sum which would have built a terrace of workmen's dwellings, and we had the Vice-President of the Executive Council and his colleagues capering to imperialistic tunes for six weeks.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="459" /> I notice that the agreement was signed by Mr. Seán T. O'Kelly &ldquo;on behalf of His Majesty's Government in the Irish Free State.&rdquo;  Mr. O'Kelly, the fiery apostle of Republicanism, has written himself down the tamest of Monarchists.  And all for what?  For an agreement which I venture to say will not produce in increased trade from Canada as much money as was spent in sending out the delegation. To obtain a trade agreement which would be ten thousand times more valuable to this country it would not have been necessary to cut any of these imperialistic capers.  We had only to leave alone a perfectly innocuous declaration in the Treaty.  But they refused to do this.  They insisted on removing the Oath and precipitating a quarrel with England over what they regard themselves as an empty formula. The result is that to-day we have no trade agreement with our nearest and best customer and our products and manufactures going into the British market are heavily taxed.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the mentality which strains at the gnat of the Oath in the Treaty, and swallows without a grimace the humped camels of loyal messages to the King and the double-barrelled Oaths of Allegiance which the Executive Council permitted our Gaelic Governor-General to take the other day.  Neither can I understand how any presumably sane body of Irishmen should have deliberately brought about the state of affairs that exists in this country to-day and endeavour to make the people believe that it is in their best interests to discard the market that Denmark, the Argentine and all the countries in the world are doing their best to cultivate and foster.  People of other countries who see us sending an expensive delegation across the Atlantic to bring home such a miserable agreement as that which has been read here to-day and at the same time ostentatiously discarding the best market in the world which is at our door must come to the conclusion that politically we are only fit for a children's home.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I have endeavoured to study the report of the Imperial <Col N="460" /> Economic Conference which has been circulated to members of the Oireachtas. I find myself in many respects in a similar position to what I was in yesterday in regard to the Customs (No. 4) Bill: that, while I can make out a great deal of it, I find it extremely difficult to know exactly in what respect we are affected by this agreement taken as a whole.  I imagine that there are very few, if any, members of this House who disagree with Senator MacLoughlin in his statement that if we could have had a properly worked out trade agreement with Great Britain it would have been of more value than any other possible agreement.  I do not propose to spend the time of the House in labouring what, to my mind, is a perfectly obvious statement which is incontrovertible&mdash;one that I think everyone feels is true&mdash;that it is a pity no such agreement has been made.  The only comment I will make is that I hope some such agreement can still be made and that no time will be lost in an endeavour to make it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in explaining this Canadian agreement, said that in order to understand the value of it, we must have reference to the agreement made between Great Britain and Canada, and that, of course, is quite correct.  I think that in order to understand the whole position, we want to have reference to all the agreements that have been made and without reference further to the question of any agreement with Great Britain. What is worrying me in this Canadian agreement is that, with the exception of South Africa, there is apparently no agreement of any kind with any of the other Dominions and I am afraid that in certain respects we may find that this country is being definitely injured as a result of the Conference in Ottawa, apart altogether from the question in relation to Great Britain.  The Canadian agreement, to my mind, was in itself perfectly satisfactory and exactly as much as one could have expected or wished for in relation to Canada.  It provides that any preference which Canada may give to Great Britain, she will also give to this country.  That, in fact, means that <Col N="461" /> any industries here which may possibly in future be able to trade with Canada will be able to trade on equal terms with Great Britain, who, I think, in most cases&mdash;there may be some exceptions&mdash;is our principal competitor.</P>
    <P>I should be very glad if the Minister would tell us when replying as to why a similar simple agreement was not made&mdash;assuming that it was not made and that it is not going to be made; if it is going to be made later, my criticism is not applicable &mdash; with New Zealand, Australia and other Dominions.  I mention these two because, while I do not suppose the volume of trade is very big, there are industries here which do a not negligible trade with these two Dominions.  In this connection, I am rather puzzled by the slight difference in wording that occurs in the agreement between the different Dominions and Great Britain.  Some of the agreements state definitely that the Dominion in question, say, Australia, will give a preference to British goods, according to certain schedules, over foreign goods.  I take it that goods from the Irish Free State, at any rate for the present, are not foreign goods and that, while we may not necessarily get that preference, the agreement of itself does not mean that Australia is going to remove any existing preferences we have and would not, in any sense, be a barrier to our making an agreement with Australia. In the case of New Zealand, however, we find that there is a special preference given to goods of the United Kingdom and it does not clearly say over foreign goods.  I am not at all certain, in the strict reading of it, that it means that there will have to be given to the goods of the United Kingdom a preference over all goods. It may be that there is a general understanding that, even though the words &ldquo;over foreign goods&rdquo; are not specifically stated, there is still a possibility of our making an agreement later with, say, New Zealand or Australia which would give us, at any rate, the same position as Great Britain.</P>
    <P>I have not been able to find out as yet how far this agreement at Ottawa <Col N="462" /> may injure us but I should be glad to know if the Minister is in a position to answer the question I put to the Minister for Finance two or three weeks ago as to our present position in regard to preference in India, Australia, New Zealand, in particular, and the other Dominions, and, also, as to whether we still get a preference in what are known as the Crown Colonies, which, I think, technically include Malta and a number of smaller places. I know that, at any rate, in the case of linen, a trade is being done with these places and there is quite a considerable trade with India&mdash;perhaps not considerable taking the country as a whole, but considerable for the one or two firms engaged in the trade&mdash; and it would be a very serious thing indeed if the preferences were to be removed.  If he is not in a position to make that statement, I would urge him to try and get inquiries made as soon as convenient&mdash;I know the difficulties with regard to distance&mdash;and make a public statement on the matter, because there is a considerable amount of uneasiness.  The Minister will appreciate that Irish manufacturers are extremely reluctant to send goods so far away as India if by any chance the preference was not accorded and there is a danger of the goods being returned or sold without profit.</P>
    <P>Another case which has come to my notice in which this Ottawa agreement is definitely injuring an important Irish industry is the case of Irish whiskey.  Senator Jameson is unavoidably away but he gave me the facts and asked me to mention them.  If you refer to the agreement between the United Kingdom and New Zealand, you will find that part of the agreement, in addition to certain preferences, provides that the sur-tax placed on certain goods by New Zealand is not to be applied so far as United Kingdom goods are concerned.  I understand that quite a considerable trade in Irish whiskey has been done in New Zealand and that, as a result of this agreement, the surtax has been removed in relation to the United Kingdom whiskey, but other whiskey has to bear the sur-tax, and there is grave danger of the Irish trade being <Col N="463" /> entirely lost in that case.  If that kind of thing is at all likely to be extended as a result of Ottawa, I am afraid that it would totally counteract any possible benefits we may gain from the one agreement with Canada.</P>
    <P>It seems to me a matter, apart, as I said before, from the general question of Great Britain, dealt with by Senator MacLoughlin, of the greatest regret that it was not possible to make a similar simple agreement with each of the other larger Dominions, at any rate, to provide that any preferences they give to Britain, they would also give to us.  If you read through this agreement, you will see that, in many respects, it would not apply to this country at all, but there are a number of small articles which would be of some benefit to manufacturers and traders here, and, if we are going to extend our trade, it certainly is a handicap if we are going actually to be handicapped in the British Dominions as against Great Britain. There are, of course, questions of sentiment and other things which arise, but, in the one or two trades that I know, it is still easier, or it was, until lately, to do trade with the British Dominions than with foreign countries for various reasons, and it would be a serious thing if, as a result of Ottawa, we are actually to lose this trade.  I hope that the Minister, in his reply, will be able to deal with these specific matters I refer to and give some kind of assurance which will remove the doubts and uneasiness which I know exist.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. I have always been a supporter of Empire free trade, and I think this is a move in the right direction.  I do not agree with Senator MacLoughlin in his statement that the money expended in sending a delegation to Ottawa was wasted.  I think it was all to the good, and we would be much better off if we could send out the whole Fianna Fáil Party and several other people to Ottawa.  I think the money would be well spent in that case.  Senator MacLoughlin has poked fun at the delegation for wearing top hats and for acting according to the usual forms, <Col N="464" /> but I think that Senator MacLoughlin and the House should applaud our delegation for their correct attitude at Ottawa.  It is not, however, with these things that I am concerned.  I do not mind how the delegation carried on. What I am concerned with and what the country is concerned with is the result of the Conference.  We had great hopes of this Conference.  We had been looking forward to it for twelve months, since the previous Imperial Conference.</P>
      <P>What are the results?  We have got certainly a trade agreement with Canada, but a trade agreement which is of a very negligible character. Canada is an agricultural country like ourselves, and requires very little of the goods we have to export.  We certainly import a considerable amount of goods from Canada, but our whole export trade with Canada is only one half of one per cent. of our total export trade and, even if we double that trade, which would be a great achievement, it would still amount to only about £300,000.  The main object of the Conference was to make agreements and to get preferences for our exports.  The only country in which it would be of any material advantage to this country to have a preference is Great Britain, and there has been no move made to have a trade agreement with Britain.  Great Britain is the only member of the British Commonwealth of Nations which requires any of our exports and, even if we could get them into other countries, they would not be worth half as much as they would be worth in Great Britain.  That fact was clearly shown the other day in the statement of the Minister for Agriculture in the lower House when, in reply to a question, he stated that in the month of September we exported 161 cattle to Belgium, and that these 161 cattle lost £562.  That clearly shows that, even with the present tariff that England has put on our cattle, we would still be as well off in sending them there as in sending them to any other country.  Furthermore, Belgium or any other country will only take a very limited quantity of our cattle and agricultural produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="465" /> The Minister for Industry and Commerce said in the Dáil:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The effort of the British Government to force them to accept their view by economic pressure already had defeated itself.  From this on they could contemplate a continuous improvement and the necessity for an agreement with Great Britain was daily becoming less urgent.  They had already passed the worst.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>My experience of the country is the very opposite.  I think the country was never in a worse state and I should like to know, and the House, I am sure, would like to know, on what ground the Minister based that statement. I cannot see, unless it is that the situation has been eased by the fact that, in a short time, we will have very little to export, how it can be said that we have passed the worst. On that ground, the situation may be eased but on no other can I see that it has.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I wish to make in connection with this agreement is that while we gave most-favoured nation treatment to Canada, by which Canada gets the benefit of the least tariff on any goods coming into this country, Canada has not reciprocated but gives us only whatever preference they give to Britain. There is a considerable trade done, or there was a few years ago, in butter between New Zealand, Australia and Canada and there was a trade agreement made, by which timber was sent from Canada to these countries and a preference given in respect of butter in the Canadian market.  Had we got most-favoured nation treatment from Canada, we would have that particular preference for our butter.  As we are working on a depreciated currency, as regards Canada, the chance of importing, say, timber from Canada and sending back butter under the same terms as the other Dominions have, or had, by special agreement, we would have had something of value, whereas we have nothing of value except whatever our industrial enterprise as against Britain can get us.  That is the specific point I want to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to harass the House <Col N="466" /> on the question of the loss of the British market.  We all know what is the loss of the British market, and I admit it is a matter of very great importance.  Supposing no agreement is made with Britain and supposing we never pay the £5,000,000 a year, I contend we are going to lose more annually in this country than the £5,000,000. Although we may win and retain the money it will be, in my opinion, in the nature of a Pyrrhic victory, because I calculate that the loss per annum on live stock, taking the various grades from suckling calves to bullocks and heifers, will be a great deal more than £5,000,000.  At the very lowest calculation it will be £8,000,000.  I am basing that on a calculation of £2 a head. There are at least a million calves reared each year in this country. To-day they are selling at 15/- a head as against £3 before this trouble started.  The same applies to every grade of stock from yearlings up to two and three years old.  In every branch there is the same depreciation. Even if you succeed in retaining the £5,000,000 now, you are going to lose more than that amount in another way as long as you continue to rear live stock.  I hope this matter will be settled, and the sooner it is the better for all of us.  We will be all satisfied and we will have a better opportunity of making a living.</P>

      <P>Senator MacLoughlin suggests various forms of prayer for the Fianna Fáil Clubs in Tipperary. I would like to remind the Senator that for a considerable time the Fianna Fáil Clubs in Tipperary have finished their meetings invariably with either the &ldquo;Soldier's Song&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Legion of the Rearguard.&rdquo;  It was a crime to sing the latter song when the late administration was in power, but since the last election the Fianna Fáil Clubs down there have been singing it in the wide open spaces.  If the Fianna Fáil Clubs in Tipperary should ever decide to finish their meetings with prayer, I dare say they will go somewhere else to be supplied with a suitable prayer rather than to Senator MacLoughlin.</P>

The members of the Executive Council are more accustomed to working, since they took over office, than to playing leap frog, as Senator MacLoughlin suggests.

      <P>I am frankly puzzled by the wording employed in what I may call these formal and solemn documents.  Generally, one does not pay much attention to a difference in wording in comparable conditions; but in this case there is an inner significance which the Minister will, perhaps, explain to the House.  I notice that when we are making an agreement with Canada we are His Majesty's Government in the Irish Free State and Canada is described as His Majesty's Government also.  I notice when we come to the Union of South Africa we cease to be His Majesty's Government and so does South Africa; we each become merely the Governments of the respective countries.  I cannot think that that is accidental.  I think there is an inner significance which the Minister might like to explain.</P>
      <P>I notice also that when the Government of the Union of South Africa makes an agreement with Great Britain it becomes His Majesty's Government of the Union of South Africa.  I think those who look at the matter a little more deeply will be able to read a certain political and national significance into those differences. Perhaps Senator Johnson who, I think we all regret, has become so very silent of late, might enlighten us&mdash;give us the benefit of his great experience in these matters.</P>

      <Col N="468" /> I join with Senator MacLoughlin in a feeling of humiliation that our representatives should speak with such entirely different voices in and out of office; but, on the other hand, I welcome that change and I hope that it can be continued.  Now that our Ministers have made personal contact with the Governments of the Dominions, I hope that they will continue to behave in that same spirit and that the attitude of dignity that it represents will be a headline, not only abroad, but at home.</P>

      <P>With regard to the observations of Senator Sir John Keane, I think I would have to ask Mr. Havenga the reason why this change of form has been adopted.  He probably knows more about it than the other signatory to the same document, Mr. Seán T. O'Kelly.  I considered it rather cheap for Senator MacLoughlin to speak as he did to-day.  I could not but ask myself what would have been the tone of his speech had the Ministers of the Free State refused to conform to the usages of Imperial Conferences.  Had there been no delegation, I am quite sure Senator MacLoughlin and his colleagues would have been very emphatic as to the immense damage that had been done to the country by not sending a delegation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>They decided, as Ministers of the Irish Free State, acting within the terms of the Constitution, to attend the Conference. No doubt the greatest hope they had&mdash; I am speaking quite without knowledge of their inner minds, but with some knowledge of human nature&mdash;was that they would be able to come to an agreement with Great Britain at that Conference.  I wonder whether the chances of coming to such an agreement would have been increased or lessened had those Ministers refused to conform to the usages of previous Conferences? If they had refused in that manner, what would have been the attitude of the critics?  I could have <Col N="469" /> understood Senator MacLoughlin's speech coming from, let us say, Miss Mary MacSwiney; but I fail to appreciate the wisdom of Senator MacLoughlin making that kind of criticism of Ministers of State for the action they took in Ottawa.</P>
      <P>If an agreement had been arrived at with Great Britain, no doubt even conformity to the usages of such Conferences would have been applauded, but no agreement was arrived at.  Whose fault was it?  Right from the beginning, very early in the course of the proceedings of that Conference, a declaration was made that the British Government would not enter into an agreement with the Irish Free State, because the Irish Free State had in another matter entirely, as they said, broken an agreement unilaterally. Whatever value there may have been in that argument or statement in July or August of this year, there is no value in it now.  That moral argument has been discarded because Great Britain has unilaterally broken its agreement in set terms with the United States.</P>

All I am saying is that on this question of an agreement with Great Britain not having been completed, it is quite germane and appropriate to refer to the position of Britain in regard to other agreements. The reason why an agreement was not entered into and could not have been entered into in Ottawa was because the responsible British Minister said they would not enter into an agreement with a country which had already unilaterally broken another agreement.  That moral argument has been discarded and now one may hope that, on equal terms from the British point of view, the two countries can <Col N="470" /> again begin negotiating, each having followed the same course.</P>

      <P>They have decided in set terms that the agreement entered into with the United States will no longer be maintained and they have arrived at that decision irrespective of what the United States may do in the matter.  One might be tempted to discuss other agreements that might have been entered into by the Irish Free State, but the motion deals with the trade agreement between the Irish Free State and the Dominion of Canada.  I am somewhat troubled by the language of Article I and I would like the Minister to give some attention to it because it seems to me to carry with it a great deal more than was intended by either Canada or the Free State.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Goods, the produce or manufacture of Canada, imported into the Irish Free State, shall not be subject to other or higher duties than those paid on similar goods, the produce or manufacture of any other country.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>One could quite understand it if it were confined to higher duties than those paid on similar goods of any other country, but if you read it this way&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Goods, the produce or manufacture of Canada ... shall not be subject to other ... duties than those paid on similar goods, the produce or manufacture of any other country.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;it would seem to me that unless there is a prior understanding and a formal agreement as to what it means, it will preclude any variation of duties, any differing duties on goods from Germany or Finland, say, unless the duties on Canadian goods.  It seems to be confining the duties that may be imposed on goods from any other country to the duties which are imposed on Canadian goods, neither higher nor lower; at least, they must not be lower&mdash;they must be identical. I do not think that is intended.  I look upon it as a very ambiguous and difficult Article to construe, and I suggest <Col N="471" /> it would be well to confer and have a note issued, before ratification, as to exactly what it means.</P>
    <P>I think that the Seanad ought to agree that this agreement be ratified for what it is worth.  It may be worth a great deal or it may be worth very little but, quite apart from the trade agreement, I can say that so far as I could observe, the value of the delegation to Ottawa was, and will be, very great indeed if the political and social contacts made and the very good impression created upon the Canadian people of responsibility are any guide. However Ministers when they were in Opposition may have looked upon contacts and delegations of this kind, they will probably realise that it is a good thing, from the point of view of their own experience and the benefit of the country, that there should be frequent contact with statesmen of other countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that Senator Johnson's laboured apology for the delegation to Ottawa will impress anybody.  It should, however, be pointed out that he is trying to confuse the issue, as has been done before, by comparing the dispute between the United States and Great Britain, which has reference to a War debt, with the dispute between the Free State and Great Britain, which is of a totally different nature.  That attempt by Senator Johnson will not deceive anybody.  It was tried before. Considering the very small amount of our trade with Canada, this agreement might be described in a phrase in common use in the country&mdash;it is &ldquo;like a chip in porridge,&rdquo; neither here nor there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A motion for the ratification of the agreement with South Africa will be introduced in due <Col N="472" /> course.  I understand that the South African Parliament will not assemble until early next year.  Consequently, ratification, on their side, cannot take place earlier than next year, whereas the Canadian Parliament has already ratified the agreement with the Free State.  I do not know whether or not I am expected to climb to the heights of dignity attained by Senator MacLoughlin, and to deal with this agreement with the same degree of relevancy that he did.  I am afraid that I must at once disclaim any intention of attempting such a feat.  I sat with a pencil and a piece of paper in my hand during the course of the Senator's remarks with the intention of writing down, to aid my memory, any point of importance made by him. The sheet of paper was quite blank when the Senator had finished.  I then tried to consider his speech as a whole with a view to discovering the main idea behind it.  Up to the present, the only conclusion I have been able to come to is that Senator MacLoughlin was trying, in some way, to demonstrate that the views of the Fianna Fáil Party, or certain members of it, had undergone modification since the change from Opposition to Government. To some extent that is probably correct, but I should like to point out, for the benefit of Senator MacLoughlin and his friends, that the change is not entirely one-sided.  Some time ago, I expressed to a colleague of mine the view that we would have to take serious note of the possibility of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party deciding to go one better than Fianna Fáil in relation to a number of matters.  Apparently, my anticipations in that respect have been borne out.  One can understand the new-found interest of Cumann na nGaedheal in unemployment.  One can understand the breaking of their long silence about the state of the unemployed and the vigour with which they are now demanding that action to alleviate these conditions should be taken.  That is, I suppose, a natural change with the change in their position.  I must admit that I was rather startled myself when the leader of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party tabled a motion for the cancellation of <Col N="473" /> the payment of land annuities.  That, I felt, was going a bit far.  They were adopting the Fianna Fáil policy, not quite understanding it, with a degree of vigour and whole-heartedness I had not looked for.  Now that that Party are advocating the de-rating of agricultural land, I think they have definitely swallowed the anchor altogether. Senator MacLoughlin quotes with relish a speech made by the present Vice-President in relation to the usual declaration&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Those who have been quite a long time trying to delude the people of this country as to the status achieved by the Treaty and the status obtained as a result of the progress made since the Treaty will, perhaps, bear in mind the advisability of bringing before the people quite frequently the messages the Senator refers to, for the purpose of letting them know exactly what that status is. The fact is that messages of that kind have always been sent on behalf of conferences of States of the British Commonwealth, and if the present Government is taking action as a <Col N="474" /> Government of a State in the Commonwealth, it cannot, obviously, dissociate itself from this practice, and has no intention of doing so.</P>

      <P>If circumstances should necessitate&mdash;and it is quite likely that in the very near future circumstances will not merely necessitate but justify&mdash; the dissociation of the Free State from the British Commonwealth, the necessity&mdash;be it painful or otherwise&mdash; for these messages will have been removed.</P>
      <P>The Free State's membership of the British Commonwealth is not founded on any other basis than the basis of expediency.  Canada, Australia and New Zealand have ties with Great Britain which do not operate here. They have common racial origin, common language, common traditions, common culture and, apart altogether from economic considerations, the association existing between these countries and Great Britain will, no doubt, always be close and friendly. The only justification for the continuation of the association of the Free State with the British Commonwealth is that substantial benefits are conferred upon our people by that association.  If, as at present, no such benefits are, in fact, experienced, then the necessity for maintaining the association is removed.  We have not decided to take action to remove it. That is a matter for decision not by the Executive Council or by the present Dáil or Seanad but by the people.  But I am quite certain that the people will say that unless there is in the future a prospect of substantial advantage&mdash; substantial economic advantage&mdash;from the continuation of the association, the sooner we terminate it the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The view expressed by Senator MacLoughlin, that by ignoring the plainly-expressed wish of the people and retaining in the Constitution the declaration described as an oath; that by surrendering what we believe to be our just and provable rights and the moneys formerly paid to Great Britain we could secure certain trade advantages <Col N="475" /> from Great Britain, is typical of Cumann na nGaedheal arguments.  It is, no doubt, true that by surrendering our rights we would be able to get an amelioration of the present position. But we do not propose to try.  If our trade with Great Britain is of any value to Great Britain, Great Britain will, presumably, try to keep it.  Nobody needs to have it demonstrated that trade must always be on the basis of reciprocity.  If the British people are not prepared to buy the produce of this country, then we cannot buy the produce of their country.  It is not a matter of willingness one way or the other.  The only way we can pay for the goods we import is by exporting our own produce in return.  If it becomes impracticable for us to export our produce to Great Britain, then we shall have to cease importing produce from Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The possibility of finding an alternative market for our produce is, of course, engaging the attention of the Executive Council.  As I said in the Dáil, we shall soon come to the point when we shall have to decide whether or not to enter into definite agreements operating for a fixed term of years with certain other States by which, in return for concessions from them, we will undertake to give them advantages in this market in respect of goods the supply of which we formerly got from Great Britain.  In that connection I should like to correct some misunderstandings.  Senator Counihan said that we lost £500 in exporting cattle to Belgium in September. Why did he stop there?  That is only half the story.  There was no export of cattle to Belgium before September.  In that month, the Department of Agriculture started to ship them there.  In the first month, they, undoubtedly, lost £500.  In the second month, they made a profit of £12.  That is not very much, but a profit was made without any bounty being paid on the cattle.  In the third month, the trade became so attractive that private interests came in, and cattle are being still exported there by private individuals who are making a substantial profit out of them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>One other point I just want to make in that connection, and that is that while it is undoubtedly correct that it is not possible for us to get in any other country the market for the cattle that we had heretofore in Great Britain, there are possibilities of opening up a trade with other countries that have never hitherto been explored, opportunities that are only now being explored and the potentialities of which are only now realised.  The fact that these alternative avenues are there and that they are being opened will be a decided advantage to this country.  In connection with the situation between ourselves and Great Britain at the Ottawa Conference, I should like to say that the announcement of the British Government to impose certain duties on Saorstát produce was made after the delegation had left this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That delegation was quite prepared to conclude a basis of treaty between the two countries if the conditions for such a treaty were present, but it was while the ship was on the Atlantic that the delegation heard the first news of the action that had been taken by the British Government in imposing these duties on our produce.  I should like to point out here that that action was entirely unprecedented. There is no historical example of any country utilising the tariff weapon in <Col N="477" /> a dispute with another country.  The British created a precedent in imposing that tariff.  In doing so, they introduced into the British Commonwealth and into the practice of the British Government a new factor and a factor which is going to have considerable reactions upon the relations between Great Britain and ourselves in the future and, indeed, upon the whole future of the British Commonwealth and the various nations in Europe.  It was a big step to take and it was taken without due consideration. It is being maintained out of a feeling or out of a false sense of what is strength and firmness.  The effects of it are as serious for Great Britain as for us.  These facts should be borne in mind.  I know that certain Senators, certain members of the public and certain members of the other House like to whine occasionally. That is so.  We cannot stop it.  We all know the story of the schoolboy who in return for a bar of chocolate or a marble is prepared to take the bandage off his sore finger.  People like to show their sores, particularly when there is a certain temptation in doing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMacLoughlin" hpid="Mr. MacLoughlin Mr. MacLoughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacLoughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Are there sores, then?  I thought the Minister denied there were any.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the people to bear in mind that whining and showing their sores is not likely to help this or any other country.  We are told now that there is good reason for the whining.  We are told that owing to the loss of the unexampled prosperity of last year there is good reason for whining.  When we look back at the halcyon days of 1931, when everybody was working, when all industries were going ahead full speed, when everybody was working, when all industries were going ahead full speed, when the farmers were so prosperous that they were spending money on horse racing, dog racing and other entertainments and nobody had any grievances, there surely is good reason for whining!  That was the position and the whole country was so delighted with it and the whole country was so carried away with it that when they got an opportunity in February last they put the Government then in office into opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="478" /> Of course there are matters here which are capable of improvement, and even when we have had ten years of Fianna Fáil Government there will still be trouble in the country and things will have to be rectified.  We do not expect to be able to reach the goal of perfection no matter how long we will be in office.  Some people put our term of office at 50 years.  But I want the people to consider how the conditions existing here now are due to causes much more serious than the present dispute.  It is not possible to repair in six months the damage done in 100 years by the British Government. We know that Fianna Fáil has a fairly high opinion of itself, but the opinion we have of ourselves never quite reached the height that some members of the Opposition appear to have of us.  They expected more in a few months from us than they did in ten years themselves.  We have done much to repair the damage done in the past but there is still a long distance to be travelled.  If the members of the various sections and the various classes in the country, instead of stopping upon the roadside for a whine would put a hand to the job and help to get the country going, they would be doing a lot more useful work than they are doing at present.</P>
    <P>I should like now to deal with some of the points that arise, and with the specific relations of this with other treaties.  On the significance to be attached to the date of the treaty with Canada and South Africa I leave Senator Sir John Keane to exercise his imagination.  We did not succeed in definitely concluding agreements with New Zealand, Australia and India, because of certain difficulties that existed, the principal of which was that the delegation from this country at Ottawa had no specific instructions from their Government as to the form of the treaty which might be concluded between these countries and the Irish Free State.  It will be noticed that apart from the agreements with the United Kingdom there have been inter-Commonwealth agreements made.  With each of these countries certain documents were exchanged. These documents were examined. <Col N="479" /> Certain documents were passed in the case of Australia and New Zealand. Letters were exchanged in which each side announced its intention to maintain the <i>status quo</i> until a trade agreement was concluded.  Negotiations with the Government of this country are still passing in the case of India, and an agreed memorandum concerning the steps to be taken was prepared and sent to India.  In the case of India also steps for the conclusion of an agreement are being made.  In that connection, I should like to say that a greater length of time has passed since the exchange of these documents and the conclusion of the agreements than I had anticipated.</P>
    <P>We are at present giving each of these countries the full benefit of our Commonwealth rate in respect of all classes of goods.  At some time in the near future it will be necessary for us to change all our Finance Acts and to give only to each country the specific preferences which we have agreed to give under our treaties.  Consequently, the continuation of the preferential rates of duty which are at present being given to Australia, New Zealand, India and other countries will not operate unless agreements requiring us to give these rates are concluded.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the position with regard to the colonies.  We have not been notified of any alteration in the agreements of the Free State with any of the colonies with one or two minor exceptions where agreements of a specific character between certain colonies and dominions were entered into.  As far as we have been informed it is the policy of the Colonial Office in London that any tariff preferences that are to be given are given generally to all members of the Commonwealth and not to any individual member. What I have said concerning the negotiations and agreements with New Zealand more or less covers the points concerning the export of whiskey to that country.  It may be, and I am accepting it as accurate, that there is more or less a considerable export of Irish whiskey to New Zealand which is not shown in the trade returns.  I am presuming that the trade returns <Col N="480" /> cannot be relied upon, because Irish whiskey sent to New Zealand may appear on our returns as whiskey sent to Great Britain and in the British returns as whiskey exported to New Zealand.  We had a certain discussion in that connection with the New Zealand delegation at the Ottawa Conference.  It is hoped to conclude an agreement with that country in respect of all classes of goods with which we are concerned.</P>
    <P>As regards the sale of butter in Canada, butter is a seasonal production in this country.  We produce butter for export at the same time as the Canadians.  The period of the year when they want butter is the period when we have no butter to give them, and consequently there is no special advantage to be secured for us in respect of exports of butter to Canada.  I do not think Senator Johnson need be concerned about the wording of Article I.  It is the phraseology used in all these treaties, and the Senator will note that that applies also to Article II.</P>

They definitely provide that when there is an inquiry as to retail prices, the Commission shall also go into the question of the cost of the commodity to the trader.  There is considerable importance in that point, because I had a number of letters from traders who <Col N="484" /> felt that they might be penalised under the Act for something which in no sense would be their fault.  Under this amendment they cannot be specifically attacked.  The Commission will also inquire into the prices they are obliged to pay.  It is a very definite safeguard for traders.</P>

      <P>I second.  This amendment is a complete revision of practically the whole of this sub-section.  It is difficult to follow it fully but as far as I can find out it is a very definite improvement on the sub-section previously suggested.  It gets over two difficulties, to one of which I have just referred.  That is the difficulty in regard to the Commission being obliged to send orders to people who are in no way responsible for the prices being too high.  The other difficulty amounted to an absurdity in the Bill, that the Commission had to send notice to every single person. This amendment provides for a general notice and it is much more satisfactory as far as I can see.</P>

      <Col N="487" /> Section 24.  To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(3)  Every report made by the Commission under the immediately preceding sub-section shall be laid by the Minister before each House of the Oireachtas unless the Minister is of opinion that it is not desirable in the public interest so to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I second.  This also deals with the point which I raised on the last occasion.  I am quite satisfied with the provision made by the Minister. He pointed out, if I remember aright, that there might be occasions on which it would not be in the public interest to lay these reports on the Table, but generally he recognised that it should be done.  I recognise that there may be rare occasions on which, perhaps, they should not be laid on the Table.  In this the Minister accepts the principle that the report should be laid on the Table of each House unless he is of opinion that it is not desirable in the public interest to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like that some thought should be devoted to this amendment.  It is true that it accepts the principle that the report shall be laid on the Table of the House but it imports a new principle inasmuch as it says that the Minister shall have discretion as to whether the report shall be laid on the Table.  I am not sure whether the evil which Senator Douglas has feared might arise would be lessened in any way under this new proposal, to put into legislation a provision which says that the report shall be laid on the Table of the House and gives the Minister discretion whether he shall do so or not.  I think that is undesirable and I would wish either that it should not be referred to at all or that it should be definitely provided that the report shall be laid on the Table.  I think there is some danger in creating that kind of precedent in our legislation&mdash;to say that the Minister shall have a discretion whether he shall lay a report on the Table which the Seanad and Dáil desire should be laid on the Table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was good enough to show me the draft of the amendment beforehand and I had <Col N="488" /> given consideration to that very point. My difficulty is that I cannot see any other way out of it.  I do not at all agree with Senator Johnson that the Bill would be better without this provision.  Under the amendment the report must be laid on the Table unless the Minister considers that it is not desirable in the public interest to do so, whereas in the Bill as it stands there is no provision for laying the report on the Table.  If the Minister refuses to lay the report he can be asked for, and he will no doubt give, his reasons for doing so.  If he does not lay the report on the Table he is responsible.  I could find no other way for meeting this point and I had to admit that there might be reports which dealt with particular manufacturers or a specific trade and that really it would not be fair to the traders concerned to lay all the details which the report might give before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Johnson that it is a good principle that the report should be laid on the Table of the House.  I also agree with him that there is a second principle involved under this amendment, that the Minister shall have discretion as to whether he shall lay a report on the Table of the House or not.  I think that is a new principle to introduce in legislation, and I, for one, would prefer that the matter should be left as it is rather than that an amendment should be introduced in this form.  I certainly think that it is not desirable to insert these words &ldquo;unless the Minister is of opinion that it is not desirable in the public interest to do so.&rdquo;  Much though I respect the Minister, I would not like to leave the question as to whether a report should be laid on the Table of the House to the opinion of a Minister.  It is wrong in principle and I think it is new in principle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out, in support of the amendment, that the discretion which it gives to the Minister is a discretion on an absolutely definite point.  Now we have, perhaps wrongly, sometimes given the Minister a general discretion. This is a discretion which is only to <Col N="489" /> be used on a particular occasion or on a particular question.  If you are to give him discretion at all, you should give him a discretion such as this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out that this is not a new principle. The fact is that the report may be published automatically but there is certainly no statutory obligation to publish the report.  What I said on the Committee Stage was that the report would be published unless the nature of the report was such that it should not be published.  One can imagine a report of such a nature that it would concern only one firm but would give a lot of information that would be injurious to that firm to other people.  It would not be fair in such circumstances to publish the report. Consequently, there should be that element of discretion.  If the amendment is left out the Minister may still publish the report at his discretion.  I have no objection to the insertion of the amendment because that is the manner in which I propose to act in any case.</P>

      <P>New section.  Before Section 28 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>28.  Whenever a price (retail) order in relation to a particular commodity is in force and an application in the prescribed form and containing the prescribed particulars is made to the Minister by a person carrying on in the area to which such order relates the business of selling retail such commodity to amend such order by <Col N="490" /> increasing the maximum price specified in such order on the ground that the wholesale price of such commodity has increased since the making of such order, the Minister shall, unless he revokes or amends, in accordance with such application, such order, forthwith request the Commission to make an investigation into such application and the Commission shall as soon as may be make such investigation and report to the Minister the result thereof.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I second.  This, I take it, is a new section put forward by the Minister to meet an amendment which I had down on the Committee Stage. My attention has been drawn to the words in this amendment, line 9, &ldquo;in accordance with such application.&rdquo;  It is not of very much importance but it looks as though these words were unnecessary, because the Minister's action might not be exactly in accordance with the application. It might not, in fact, be an application at all.  It might merely be a document setting out the facts.  I cannot see that the words serve any purpose.  I leave the matter entirely to the Minister, but I think it would do no harm to leave out the words, and if inserted they might possibly do harm.  Otherwise the amendment meets the point which I raised that where a price order is in operation, the people affected by that order should have an opportunity of making application to have the order amended or revoked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment gives the Minister power to revoke a prices order once made.  He can do that on his own initiative at any time.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the question. There is no question as to what is intended by the amendment.  The intention is that an individual may apply to have a price order amended which has been made.  If you read the amendment you will find that where the wholesale price is changed an application may be made to the Minister to amend the order by increasing the maximum price specified in the order.  It goes on to say &ldquo;the Minister shall unless he revokes or amends in accordance with such application.&rdquo;  It might not be in accordance with such application.  This is a purely technical point but I think that the words do not seem to be necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment 11:&mdash;</P>
      <P>New section.  Before Section 29, and in Part IV, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>29.&mdash;(1)  Where a person sells a scheduled commodity the price of which exceeds two shillings and sixpence or a number of different scheduled commodities the prices of which when added together exceed five shillings, he shall, if so required by the purchaser, issue to the purchaser at the time of sale a written statement of the weight, measure or number of the commodities sold, the price per <Col N="492" /> unit of weight, measure or number, as the case may be, and the sum charged for the said commodity or commodities.</P>
    <P>(2)  If any person acts in contravention of this section he shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding two pounds for each such offence.</P>
    <P>This proposal was discussed on the Committee Stage but without the words, &ldquo;if so required by the purchaser.&rdquo; I argued then that in this section, which deals with individual complaints, or with prices which are not subject to price order, there could be no way of proving to the Commission or to the Controller, as between the shopkeeper and the purchaser&mdash; it would be one person's word against another&mdash;without documentary evidence of some kind.  I argued that it was necessary that there should be some documentary evidence.  My proposal was that the purchase of every article over a certain value should be accompanied by a docket containing particulars of how the charge was made up.  In view of the line the discussion took last week, and more in accordance with my own views as originally formulated, I have inserted in the amendment the words, &ldquo;if so required by the purchaser.&rdquo; That means that if a purchaser goes into a shop and purchases articles for which he believes he is being overcharged, if he demands of the seller that the price should be stated in the docket, which is the normal custom in most shops, the obligation to issue such docket would lie upon the seller.  That is all that is contained in the amendment. Apart from criticism of any details in drafting, I think it is essential to the working of this part of the Bill that the purchaser of a commodity, in respect of which a person believes he has been overcharged, should have the right to demand a sale docket from the shopkeeper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I objected to an amendment of this kind on a previous occasion.  I still object to it in the form in which it is introduced, because I think it is not practical.  I have no <Col N="493" /> objection to an obligation on the trader that he should give a receipt which will set out such reasonable details as are necessary to specify the article purchased.  But when you go into the provision that if the purchase amounts to more than 2/6 a shopkeeper must set out on the invoice &ldquo;a written statement of the weight, measure or number of the commodities sold, the price per unit of weight, measure or number, as the case may be, and the sum charged ...&rdquo; you could not get a staff to do that in the case of small articles.  If a trader tried to give such details, the price of some small things might be in decimals of a penny. With the best intentions in the world you could not get that done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>How is it done now? The Senator said last week: &ldquo;I cannot say, of course, that every trade is the same, but certainly, as far as I know of my own knowledge, there is a specific instruction in every case, no matter how small the purchase is, that where the customer asks for a docket he is to get it.&rdquo;  What is on the docket?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>The price which is charged, with a reasonable description of the purchase, but not the detailed description provided for in the amendment. I do not object to the obligation, when there is a request, of giving a receipt with a reasonable description. What &ldquo;reasonable description&rdquo; means would have to be decided afterwards. The Senator wants something which could not be done in many cases.  Take the sale of a packet of pins which might be included in a purchase amounting to 2/- The words &ldquo;one packet of pins&rdquo; would be good enough there.  If you had to give the number of pins, it has to be remembered that the number would vary in different packets, and also the unit of weight or measure, as the case may be, and the sum charged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting an extreme case to show that if you were to specify for details you could not get the ordinary assistants to deal with it if worded as it is in the amendment. It must be a reasonable description to enable the value to be shown.  To that <Col N="494" /> I have no objection.  It is going to be extremely difficult to set out the exact details of every commodity.  It might be easy to do it if it applied to articles of the same kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood Senator Johnson to say, when moving the amendment, that he was prepared to modify the drafting so as to meet the case indicated by Senator Douglas.  I can see myself taking not an extreme case but an average case.  There are certain foods made up in packets and I imagine it would be impossible for the ordinary shopkeeper to set out the price per unit of weight.  The weight might be 1lb. or a little over 1lb.  If the foods came from France they would probably be under 1lb. or be a fraction of a pound.  There would be no really simple fraction so that it would be impossible to meet the requirement of the amendment, as drafted.  I agree with the principle of the amendment if it can be brought within reasonable bounds.  Senator Johnson is not wedded to the wording of the amendment and perhaps the Minister would consider it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave consideration to the amendment.  I may say, straight away, that I have considerable sympathy with the idea behind it.  I have in fact prepared an amendment of the kind to facilitate the working of the Bill.  The wording would need revision.  I took the trouble of getting an alternative draft prepared that I think would meet the objections and be acceptable to Senator Johnson, if he is prepared to substitute it for the one on the Paper.  It reads:</P>
      <P>Section 30.  To insert before the section a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>30.&mdash;(1)  Where a person who carries on a business by way of trade or gain sells in the course or as part of such business a scheduled commodity the price of which exceeds two shillings and sixpence, or so sells to one purchaser a number of different scheduled commodities, the prices of which when added together exceed five shillings, such person shall, if so required by the purchaser at the time of sale, then and there deliver to the purchaser a statement in <Col N="495" /> writing setting out in respect of such commodity, or each such commodity, as the case may be, the following particulars, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a description.</P>
    <P>(b)  if the sale is by weight or measure, the net weight or measure, as the case may be,</P>
    <P>(c)  if the sale is by number, the number,</P>
    <P>(d)  the sum charged.</P>
    <P>(2)  If any person fails, neglects, or refuses to comply with this section, such person shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding two pounds.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the insertion of that amendment imposes any hardship on the shopkeeper.  I do not think any shopkeeper would refuse to give a receipt if a customer demands it.  The only case in which it might cause certain inconvenience is in relation to a shop where articles of a small value are sold to many customers.  I imagine that Messrs.  Woolworth would find it objectionable if they had to give receipts.  Where it is provided that the article must be over 2/6 in value, or that the sum total of the articles sold is over 5/&mdash;and I suppose anyone who buys goods to the value of 5/- in Woolworth's and asks for a receipt could be given it without much inconvenience &mdash; it would facilitate matters, if the person who said he had been charged an exorbitant price, brought that evidence before the Commission.  Ultimately if the person's statement was declared to be false or misleading that person became liable for the offence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest before we pass the Report Stage that a complicated amendment like this should be circulated.  There is other business to come before the House which we could dispose of in the meantime.  On the <Col N="496" /> reading of the amendment it strikes me that it is not essential to Senator Johnson's point and will create difficulty. For the purpose of the Bill there is not going to be serious trouble about an article value for 2/6 or 2/- but, if you want to cover the total number and the value 5/- serious difficulty is immediately created.  The Minister mentioned Messrs.  Woolworth's. I do not go there often, I have been there and I believe you cannot get articles to the value of 5/- from one assistant.  You have to go from counter to counter before the total purchase amounts to 5/-.  The law will be broken if the total purchase is 5/-.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>In an establishment where there are department one of the difficulties frequently found is that of getting a receipt where different assistants deal with different sales. The fact that you must give a receipt for articles amounting to 5/- in value may lead to a number of technical breaches where people were genuinely anxious to carry out the law.  I think the purpose would be served by making the amount for articles purchased 2/- or 1/-.  If there is an obligation to give a statement for a number of articles purchased from one assistant, any trader can give a general instruction that if a receipt is asked for, for a purchase amounting to 2/-, it must be given and also the details.  That can easily be done.  But if it has to be given where a customer spends in different departments a total amounting to 5/- something that is impossible of accomplishment is being asked.  It is not an uncommon thing for a customer to ask for a receipt in one department and to bring that receipt to another department while not bothering about smaller articles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion when a discussion took place on this amendment the Minister was out attending a division in the other House.  It was thought that it would be very invidious to allow people, after a decision was given in a case, and after they had known that the price charged was too high, to come forward and make complaints and to get repayment of portion of the money. The idea was to preclude any person who had made any purchase before the date of the ruling of the Controller. Looking at paragraph (ii) we read &ldquo;if the investigated complaint relates to a sale, or offering for sale, retail or wholesale, and another complaint is made in relation to a sale or offering for sale whether retail or wholesale by such seller on a date previous to the date to which the investigated complaint relates the Controller shall take no proceedings ....&rdquo;  The statement I made on the last occasion was that no person, after the Controller had given his decision, should be entitled to make a fresh complaint in respect of any purchase which took place before the decision was given.  The meaning was this: Of course a person who has bought before the decision was given and had no intention of making his complaint, if he finds the decision given was that the article for which he paid 1/6 should have been sold at 1/- might take advantage of the decision to come back to the seller and make a complaint.  I do not press this very hard, but as the Minister was not here on that occasion I want to bring to his notice what was in the minds of Senators, namely, that the crucial data was the date of the award.  The purchase was the date to which the investigated complaint relates, and the date to which the investigated complaint relates would be the date on which the article was alleged to be bought at an excessive price.  I think <Col N="501" /> what the Seanad intended was to prevent any person making a complaint in relation to any sale by some seller in respect of a transaction which took place before the award of the Controller, so as to prevent any person from making a wrong use of the award.  The reason I have gone so fully into the matter is that the Minister was not here when the subject was debated and when I think Senator Jameson very fairly put his reasons.  I am not pressing it, as I said, very hard, but I am bringing it before the notice of the Minister.</P>

No publication is made, no intimation is given to the public that such a complaint was made or that such an award has taken place. I would like to make a slight drafting amendment in the amendment.  That is, in paragraph (ii) which reads, &ldquo;if the investigated complaint relates to a sale or offering for sale, retail or wholesale, and another complaint is made in relation to a sale or offering for sale, whether retail or wholesale.&rdquo; Of course the investigated complaint must relate to a sale &ldquo;retail or wholesale&rdquo; and these words ought to be deleted.  That will improve the drafting.  It is a purely drafting amendment.</P>

    <P>Sections 1 to 6 inclusive, agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 7.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="506" /> (1)  The customs duty imposed by Section 11 of the Finance Act, 1928 (No. 11 of 1928), as amended by subsequent enactments shall be charged, levied, and paid on the following articles imported into Saorstát Eireann after the passing of this Act at the respective rates hereinafter mentioned in lieu of the rates mentioned in the said Section 11 or any such amending enactment as aforesaid, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  on all parts of motor cars which are, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, engine assemblies as defined by regulations made by the Revenue Commissioners, transmission assemblies as similarly defined, or propelling gear assemblies as similarly defined &mdash;at the rate of an amount equal to fifteen per cent., of the value of the article;</P>
    <P>(b)  on all parts of motor cars which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, are either radiators, lamps, or starting motors and are imported separately&mdash;at the rate of an amount equal to fifteen per cent. of the value of the article;</P>
    <P>(c)  on all parts of motor cars which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, are metal doors or metal body shells or assembled metal parts of such doors or shells and have not been painted, upholstered, or fitted with glass or wood, and are suitable only for incorporation in the body of a motor car designed, constructed, and intended for the carriage (otherwise than for reward) of not more than six persons exclusive of the driver&mdash; at the rate of an amount equal to forty per cent. of the value of the article.</P>
    <P>(2)  The customs duty imposed by the said Section 11 of the Finance Act, 1928, as amended by subsequent enactments shall not be charged or levied on any of the following articles imported into Saorstát Eireann after the passing of this Act, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  on any component parts or <Col N="507" /> accessories of motor car chassis which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, are not assembled otherwise than by welding, soldering, or other like process;</P>
    <P>(b)  on any component parts or accessories (other than doors and complete body shells) of motor car bodies which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, are not assembled and are suitable only for incorporation in or use as an accessory of the body of a motor car, designed, constructed, and intended for the carriage (otherwise than for reward) of not more than six persons exclusive of the driver.</P>
    <P>(3)  Whenever the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, is satisfied that any articles chargeable with duty at a rate fixed by this section are required to be imported by a manufacturer for use in a process of manufacture in Saorstát Eireann, the Revenue Commissioners may by licence authorise such manufacturer, subject to compliance with such conditions as they may think fit to impose, to import such articles without payment of the said duty either, as the Revenue Commissioners shall think proper, without limit as to time or quantity or either of them, or within a specified time or in a specified quantity.</P>
    <P>(4)  In this section the expression &ldquo;motor car&rdquo; has the same meaning as it has in Part II of the Finance Act, 1928 (No. 11 of 1928), and the expression &ldquo;motor car body&rdquo; has the same meaning as it has in Section 14 of the Finance (Customs Duties) (No. 2) Act, 1932 (No. 11 of 1932).</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 7, sub-section (3).  To delete the sub-section and to substitute therefor a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3) The Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, may <Col N="508" /> by order exempt from the duty imposed by this section articles of any specified class or description in respect of which he is satisfied that it is inexpedient that such duty should be charged thereon.</P>
    <P>This recommendation, which is down in my name, is to amend sub-section (3) of Section 7, but I want to speak on the section as it relates to it.  I am not satisfied, from some conversations which I have had, that there will not be difficulty in the exact interpretation of the wording of sub-section (1).  For instance, I think that it is quite possible that you will find very often that quite a small portion of wood is part of a metal body.  It is quite a negligible quantity but I am informed that there is that small quantity and that you will almost certainly have a difficulty there.  I said yesterday that the Minister, if he wants to get in chassis here, should let them in free. The object of this recommendation is, to some extent, a try-on with the Minister.  That is, having read the Bill carefully, and having considered this recommendation to be a much better provision, I thought I would suggest to the Minister that it might be applied here as I believe it might be far better than a licence provision. Assuming, as I think will be the case, that all the different manufacturers are able to send over their parts and get them assembled here, there will be two or three which will have some wood and you will almost certainly have difficulty in distinguishing as to which particular firm is to obtain a licence.  I think I understood the Minister to say that where a licence could be avoided he would prefer it, because even if licences are absolutely impartial and fair still they will always create some delay and a certain amount of suspicion.  As a great deal of the motor parts are going to be let in free, the only object for this licensing provision, that I can see, is to remedy defects.  I understood the Minister to say that the object of sub-section (3) was to remedy such defects, and if there is any other reason for the sub-section I would be glad to know it. It is with the object of remedying possible defects that I am making this <Col N="509" /> suggestion.  I am not going to press the House to a division in a matter of this kind and I am merely putting it forward because I think it would be preferable to a licence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>This recommendation, I think, does not apply to the licence at all.  It does not impose a duty, but remits either in whole or in part a duty which existed for a number of years. Frankly, the licence provision is there to enable us to deal with any minor unforeseen difficulties that may arise. In that connection, it is obviously a matter in which discretion must be exercised.  It may be that in a certain type of motor car the shell in its simplest from might contain some element of wood.  Obviously, we would have to consider whether that piece of wood is something essential to the shell or whether it could be used for building the shell here.  In the former case, it would have to be admitted free of duty, and that would come in under the clause, and in the second case, it would be necessary to impose the duty to ensure that only the minimum amount of wood would come in.  The intention is to watch the difficulties according as we come up against them and then to come in with a proposal at a later stage deleting the licence provision and making permanent arrangements to deal with such articles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not convinced by what the Minister has said, but I am prepared to withdraw the recommendation. I do not believe myself that ultimately it will be your experience that you will get the margin you want when you have to pay on the engines and other parts.  I think the margin is not going to be sufficient.  I think the Minister will admit that you cannot get the parts in at a cheaper price than the outsider is willing to sell them at.  In this case, one manufacturer demonstrated pretty clearly to me that he could not sell the parts knocked down any cheaper than the complete bodies and car put together, for the simple reason that they are put together by mass production in a chain on the Continent, and to take each part <Col N="510" /> separately cost him approximately the same amount of money as it cost him to include it in his whole equipment. I do not say that this applies everywhere. It does not apply, I think, in the case of a Rolls-Royce, but it does apply to the cheaper makes of cars. The fact that certain portions are still dutiable will not leave enough margin, in my opinion.  I can assure the Minister that the charges which he made on a previous occasion, to the effect that the trade were not trying, are not correct.  I think that if there is a profit to be made, they will try their best.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know if the Minister has anything to say regarding representations which, I understand, were made to him by manufacturers of motor parts.  Sub-section (2) of Section 7 provided for the free admission of the component parts or accessories of motor cars which have not been assembled.  Up to the present, there has been a tax, of course, on these and it has been represented to me, and I understand it has been also so represented to the Minister, that the removal of the tax in this case will throw out of employment a fairly considerable number of mechanics at present engaged by certain manufacturing firms in the manufacture of these articles.  I cannot say how many would be thrown out of employment, but from 150 to 200 has been mentioned to me as the number in Dublin.  I have not been able to check that, however.  It is stated that, by admitting these free, you will destroy their manufacture altogether here and destroy a craft that was increasing and developing, and that the immediate effect, at all events, will be to create unemployment in this particular trade.  Strange to say, it is alleged in any case, that the motor trade is in opposition to the removal of this tax on the parts.  That statement has been made here to me to-day by a person who seems to be connected with the trade.  It is stated that if time is given, at least between now and the Report Stage, evidence will be available to prove that and to show that it is a very serious consideration. I think that the motor <Col N="511" /> trade has been very harshly treated and I should be very slow to oppose anything that would be a measure of relief to them.  The Minister has had some statement made to him, I understand, and I presume that he has made some inquiries into the matter and that he will be in a position to inform the House as to how things stand.  If there is ground for action, it could be taken on the Report Stage and I should like to ask the Minister now if he has definite information on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>If there are parts made here, then I think they ought to be protected.  I can quite understand that the motor trade would be opposed to this remission of the duty on parts because if a man can get, and get cheaply, a part he will probably be content to put that on to his car, whereas if the part is dear, and if it is made dearer by reason of an import duty, he will naturally be inclined to scrap the old machine and buy a new one.  I can quite understand the motor trade being against this, but I do not think the public generally will be against it.  In relation to the one point that has been put forward, if there is any part of a motor car made here I think its manufacture ought to be encouraged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I met representatives of the motor trade.  They announced that they were opposed to the removal of the duty.  I want, however, to say this for them, that ten years ago they came to the then Minister for Industry and Commerce and announced that they would be ruined if the duty was put on.  They strongly opposed at that time the imposition of a duty, but last week they came and opposed equally strongly its removal.  The case they made for it was that motorists might do their own repairs; that they would order parts, say, from manufacturers <Col N="512" /> across the channel, import them here and do their own repairs, whereas if the import duty applied they would not go to the trouble of clearing the parts through the customs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is not quite correct in that.  I was not present, of course, at the conference, but I think the representation made to the Minister was, not that motorists would order the parts from manufacturers at the other side, but rather that they could buy them from traders at the other side.  It is quite a different point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That they would get the parts from traders at the other side free of duty and do their own repairs.  Frankly, I must say that I was not the least bit impressed by that argument.  I think there are very few motorists who would be inclined to do that, seeing that there is no advantage in price in respect of standard parts. In any event, I think the majority of motorists, when their cars go out of order, will run them into a garage and tell the proprietor to put them right. It is only very seldom indeed that they would undertake to do the repairs themselves.  I think they will find that the possibility of increased trade, following a reduction in the price of parts, will off-set any advantage of that kind. It is not at all unlikely that the lower cost of repairs will induce people who have cars lying up, or waiting to be overhauled, to put them into commission again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point raised by Senator O'Farrell is a more serious one.  There are certain firms in town doing, to some extent at all events, work in the manufacture of parts.  The employment given is, I think, much larger than the actual number named would suggest.  It would be impossible to say what the actual number is because these firms do repair work of all kinds. Their principal work relates to the grinding of cylinders and valves and jobs of that kind.  They make parts for obsolete types of cars.  I think that is the principal work they are engaged on.  They make parts for cars which, so to speak, are no longer on the market.  The firms that made them are not now in existence.  I am <Col N="513" /> not convinced that the remission of the duty is going to make any serious difference to those firms.  We are bringing them into consultation with the Department so that the matter can be examined from every aspect.  To my mind the arguments already put up to us were so tenuous that we would not be justified in not taking the action contemplated here.  In fact, one of the firms overstated the case.  It said that it had been in existence for 25 years: that it had been making these parts during that period and making them quite successfully.  It forgot that for 15 of the 25 years there was no duty in operation.  This proposal is really reverting to the <i>status quo.</i>  It ought to be of considerable advantage, and should encourage people to get their parts from concerns here rather than to import them.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that some parts required in the building of a motor car can be manufactured in the country. We hope to get a number of them manufactured here at the end of a period.  I think the first step in that direction must be to break the habit of importing the chassis as a unit and getting it assembled here&mdash;getting a substantial part of the assembly done here.  After a period, when that has become the established practice, we can examine the position and get the simple parts&mdash;all types of parts&mdash; manufactured in the country.  What we are doing here is, we are giving a concession that unassembled parts will be completely free of duty, and that the more difficult assemblings will be subject to a lower rate of duty than heretofore.  In connection with firms doing these partially manufactured parts, it should be pointed out that it is only in the case of completely unassembled parts that the duty ceases to operate.  The majority of parts which would be imported would be assemblings of one kind or another and they would be subject to the full rate of duty.  It is only the raw steel, shaped or moulded into one particular form, without any addition, that would be free of duty.  Even the addition of a screw would make it an assembly, and would make it therefore liable to the full rate of duty.</P>
    <P>There is this position to be considered, <Col N="514" /> that a person ordering a part likes to be in a position to be able to send it back to the place where he got it if it does not suit.  That is one of the main reasons why people get parts, say, from a firm here.  In that case the parts have to be cleared at the customs by the importing firm. If the part is sent back there is the fact that a customs duty operates at the other side, so that the difficulty with the customs would be just as serious under present circumstances even though on duty applied.  That is why I feel there will be no loss to the repairing shops or garages in the country.  We hope we will be able to induce some firms to utilise their machinery on the assembly work that we are contemplating.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDowdall" hpid="Mr. Dowdall Mr. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to look more closely into this because it is a matter of very great importance to an industry in this country.  Messrs. Ford assemble their cars, and particularly their tractors, in Cork.  They get very large quantities of certain parts made by the Macroom Engineering Company.  They also make parts for obsolete cars.  They are continuously making parts in immense quantities for these cars.  If persons have, under the shelter of a tariff and on the assurance that the tariff would remain in force, invested their capital in plant and in the employment of men, then I think this is a matter that deserves very close consideration.  This matter was only mentioned to me this afternoon.  I would commend this recommendation to the Minister for his consideration.  Perhaps he might consider it on the Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>There was that impression. Does it mean that some firms will get the body shells in free?  So far as the licensing provision is concerned I want to be quite clear that this is only going to be used by the Minister <Col N="515" /> in carrying out the section where some small technical defect has arisen. Otherwise, if firms get the suspicion that another firm may be allowed to have an engine in free, then they will not take the risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be no licensing of an engine assembled or body shells or any of the articles specifically mentioned that are subject to duty.  As regards this licensing provision, I frankly confess that I cannot see how it is intended to be used. It is merely inserted there in the event of some difficulty arising which was not foreseen.  I would prefer that it was not there.  Its presence there is going to mean that I will have people coming to me trying to induce me to give them licences for parts in respect of which we had already determined that no concession should be given.  The difficulty of explaining it arises from the fact that it is there to meet the possibility of some unforeseen difficulty and of work in progress being held up because of that fact.  If the difficulty were foreseen, if we knew what it was likely to be, we would have provided for it specifically in the Bill.  I hope that we will be able to delete the licensing provision at the earliest opportunity, as soon as we have had experience of the operation of the section.  When we have had a month or six weeks' experience then we will know more definitely than we do now the difficulties which have to be met.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is most inadvisable that there should be publication of the licences issued to individual firms.  There are two types of licences.  There are the licences that are issued in accordance with the powers conferred by the Finance Acts of this year.  Then there are general licences.  They are licences for particular classes of commodities subject to duty, of things that are not being made here and that are required by manufacturers in the process of manufacture. They are generally issued in the form of an instruction to the Revenue Commissioners to admit certain <Col N="516" /> classes of goods when consigned to any manufacturer in the Saorstát. Sometimes there might be a quantitative restriction as well, but generally there is not.  Then there are licences issued under the emergency duties and under perhaps one of the Budget duties to individual firms to import limited consignments of specified goods to meet special circumstances.  Someone, for example, may be building a factory here and desires to import machinery which can only be got from Great Britain, patented machinery of one kind or another supplied by some British firm.  That person would get a licence to import specified items of machinery.  In the case of such licences it is most undesirable that publication should take place, because it would mean giving to the public a very large amount of information concerning the business of an individual firm.  The only other cases in which licences are given are to meet special cases of hardship where contracts for the supply of goods had been entered into before the imposition of the duty, where the goods were lying in a ship at the North Wall or had, in fact, been unloaded on the quay, but not cleared of duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In one or two cases, mainly in relation to the emergency duty, licences were issued, but very rarely in relation to the Budget duties, except in the circumstances actually provided for in the licensing provisions of the Bill, such as the provision relating to structural steel or building stone. There a permit may be given for the importation, free of duty, where the steel or stone was required for a building, the erection of which was commenced before the duty was imposed.  These are the only circumstances in which licences are issued. In respect of them, and apart from the considerable difficulty involved, it would be, in most cases, very undesirable to publish.  In so far as general licences in respect to certain commodities are issued, that is commodities required by manufacturers in the course of manufacture, the practice is and has always been observed that where successful application for such licence is made every manufacturer in the country interested or likely to be <Col N="517" /> interested in the thing is circularised to the effect that such a facility is available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the House should be in any way satisfied with the statement of the Minister. First of all, he narrows it down to what has been done, but we have to have regard to what the law empowers to be done, and, right through all these schedules, the law empowers a very large measure of unrestricted licence. That is a very dangerous power to give to any Government.  Do not let us be satisfied with the assurance that nothing has yet been done that is undesirable or that nothing will be done by this Government that is undesirable. Let us look to the broad principles that govern a matter of this kind in which a Government can undoubtedly give preference or in which pressure can be brought on the Government which they cannot resist, for particular reasons which need not be detailed here, but which may favour individuals who are powerful at the expense of those who have not that power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is really a very serious principle involved here.  It is ridiculous to say that the Government can be trusted and can be given a blank cheque without any regard to the implications or dangers involved.  We have naturally to provide certain checks which must be imposed by Parliament on the Executive, and I think this is eminently a case in which Parliament should be vigilant and the only effective vigilance is the publication of the licences given to individuals.  General licences, of which everybody can take advantage, I do not so much mind, but the Minister referred specifically to the dangers of publishing particulars of a licence given to a firm to import special machinery.  I do not see any danger. The details of the machinery need not be set out.  These are not the things that are dangerous&mdash;it is where a firm who claims this special use for certain general commodities and other firms could possibly put up the same claim. Favour can be shown to one firm over another, perhaps innocently.  There is great danger and I hope that Parliament will not be satisfied with the <Col N="518" /> rather plausible explanation of the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to explain that, in relation to the Budget duties, we have no power, except in one or two particular cases, to issue licences unless the article is not procurable in the Saorstát in the quantity required or is required by a manufacturer in the process of manufacture.  There is no power, in relation to the majority of the duties, to give any licence for the importation of the goods for sale to firms who propose to sell them to others.  We must be able to stand over these facts &mdash;that the article is essential to the process of manufacture and that, for some reason, it is not procurable in the Saorstát, either not procurable at all or not procurable in the quantities required.  In relation to the Emergency Duties, there is, of course, a complete discretion.  Licences can be issued on any condition at all but, in the case of these duties, certain general principles were laid down and licences are issued in accordance with these principles or refused if they do not conform to them.  Even in the case of the Emergency Duties, I think it would be desirable that we should, after experience of their operation, transform the general duty into the specific duty which we would be in a position to determine from our experience and get rid of our licensing power.</P>

      <P>I move recommendation No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete in lines 50 and 51 the words &ldquo;of full standard size.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the matter I raised yesterday. I was pressed by the Cathaoirleach to put in the recommendation at the last moment although, in this case, I had said that I would be able this morning to find out the facts pretty accurately. I have made inquiries in relation to this and I find that the Bill, as introduced, did not include these words, but that a Deputy in the Dáil was approached by a firm who process and develop nine millimetre films.  They were afraid that, under this section, they would lose their trade.  Personally, I do not think there was any danger of their losing their trade under the section because I cannot see the ordinary person, who will take a film in the street with nine millimetre film in a small camera, going to the trouble of satisfying the Revenue Commissioners as to the nationality and ordinary residence of the people who happen to walk into his film when he <Col N="520" /> is taking it.  I do not think that was really very serious.  But the reason why I object to limiting this to standard size was not in relation to nine millimetre film at all, but in relation to 16 millimetre film.  If you are going to have, as was attempted here recently and may, I think, quite likely be attempted again, an amateur film society&mdash;they are practically certain to use 16 millimetre film&mdash;if the object of this is to encourage a possible film industry here, we certainly must encourage the amateurs, because it is out of them that, in all probability, a film industry will grow.</P>
    <P>So far as I can find out, and I think I can say positively, 16 millimetre films are not processed here at present. There is some talk that one firm may process them in the near future, but that firm will not process anything but their own product which is sold for amateurs and sold, negative and positive together, at a price of 25/-. Any amateur production society will not want a negative which can only be turned into a positive for 25/- per 100 feet.  It will want a negative from the successful portions of which a number of positives can afterwards be printed, and that negative can be bought for 10/- or 12/-.  The difficulty at the present time is that it is almost impossible for people who wish to form a society of this kind&mdash;there is a handicap on the ordinary amateur which is not so serious&mdash;to get film.  They must buy from one firm who supply only the negative which will be turned into a positive at a fixed price which includes the processing.  That may be done here, but it is not yet being done here.</P>
    <P>My effort to delete these words &ldquo;of full standard size,&rdquo; was made somewhat hastily yesterday because I was asked to put down the recommendation by the Cathaoirleach.  I recognise that I do not want to affect the possible sale, though I do not think there is anything serious in it, of nine millimetre film here.  What is really required is not the form of words I suggest, but these words with the addition of the words &ldquo;or 16 millimetres.&rdquo;  As it stands now, the benefits of this section will be lost so far as an amateur film production <Col N="521" /> society is concerned.  The Minister for Finance was not here yesterday but, as Senators know, an effort was made by a number of people a little over a year ago, and a fairly successful film was produced, but the cost was 25/- per 100 feet, and taking a small theatre like the Peacock, as they did, the loss was too heavy to allow them to venture again.  They could have obtained film at 10/-, which could easily have been done, and they would have had no expense on the portion of film that is wasted in production of a film and they could have got two or three positives which could have been shown in different parts at the same price.  If this is really meant seriously, I would urge that 16 millimetre film should be included.  I do not know how the Minister views this, but if he is at all favourably inclined, I am prepared to put the recommendation down for Report Stage, because I do not want simply to move the deletion of these words, because I recognise that it is quite conceivable that, if anyone had to go to the trouble of certifying the nationality and residence of persons in their private films&mdash;they might be frightened and it would be better to leave the nine millimetre film alone.  It is very small and would not be used except for small private purposes.</P>

How anybody could give a certificate or know what a national was, as the Act stands, I do not know.

      <P>Third column.  After the word &ldquo;blankets&rdquo; to add the words &ldquo;or rugs.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister explained to us <Col N="525" /> yesterday the extreme difficulty of arriving at a definition of a blanket. When the Finance Bill was before the House the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance said he was quite willing to agree that the meaning of the English language had changed since the present Government came into office, because a blanket which might not be regarded as a cotton blanket before had now come to be regarded as a cotton blanket.  He assured the House, however, that his Government was in no respect responsible.  We are in the difficulty that blankets come under three possible headings and in this Bill the Government have tried to exempt cotton blankets under the three headings. The cotton blanket sold in large quantities in this country is a coloured article, sometimes with a border, and it is used mostly by the poor people as a blanket.  I think the Government made a real blunder when they refused to accept my recommendation in relation to this particular type of blanket.</P>
    <P>Blankets of this description are manufactured in foreign countries and, as far as this winter's supply is concerned, the 45 per cent. duty has been paid; the people have had to pay an increased price, all because of some person's blunder when the present Minister was in Ottawa.  These blankets are coloured and they often have a border.  They are genuinely used as blankets, but the manufacturers on the Continent describe them as sheets.  There is always a difficulty with the invoices, because the blankets are sent in as cotton sheets although here they are not recognised as such.  There is a blunder in this particular provision.  In the Finance Act there is the reference &ldquo;and also rugs other than rugs intended to be used as floor coverings.&rdquo; In order to make the thing less difficult, I think the words &ldquo;or rugs&rdquo; should be added to the word &ldquo;blankets.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am inclined to agree with the Parliamentary Secretary as regards the change in the meaning of words in the English language.  I have satisfied myself that cotton blankets <Col N="526" /> are not liable to duty as blankets.  I did not anticipate that the Revenue Commissioners were going to hold that a cotton blanket was a sheet.  Something like that, apparently, did happen and that is why this recommendation has been considered necessary.  A rug that is not intended for use as a floor covering would come under the heading of a blanket.  I think there is little difficulty likely to arise under the section.  The term &ldquo;blanket&rdquo; will be held to include &ldquo;rug.&rdquo;  I have no objection to the recommendation, but I do not think it necessary.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a matter in connection with which I would like the Minister to get into touch with the Revenue Commissioners. I endeavoured on the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill to exempt all quilts which are not manufactured here.  On the Report <Col N="527" /> Stage I drew attention to the quilts used by the very poor and I got Alhambra and Honeycomb quilts exempted.  Since then I have been doing my very best in the way of writing to manufacturers and visiting the Revenue Commissioners with the object of giving whatever assistance I could.  Six months ago some of the manufacturers slightly changed the names and called certain quilts Grecian Alhambra quilts.  The Grecian quilts would be dutiable, but the Grecian Alhambra quilts would not.  We have persuaded the manufacturers to call them Alhambra quilts.  There are no Irish manufacturers.  It will solve the whole difficulty if the Minister agrees to exempt unfilled quilts of any description.  The trade in high-priced quilts is a very small one, because the wealthier people buy bed-spreads or eiderdowns.  The Minister should find out whether it would not be easier for the Revenue Commissioners to include all unfilled quilts in the exempted list.</P>

      <NameTxt>The McGillycuddy of the Reeks</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was speaking on this Bill last night I was endeavouring to explain to the House that in five counties in the West of Ireland, according to recent statistics, there was an area of 2,400 acres put into cultivation for the production of wheat out of an approximate area of five million acres, as compared with 26,000 acres out of an approximate 11 million acres elsewhere throughout the country, where the land is a great deal better.  That amounts to this, that the bounties are <Col N="529" /> going to be distributed amongst the owners of the richer, ploughable lands, roughly about 1¼ millions of people. The admitted injustice which accompanies the distribution of the agricultural grants at the present moment will thereby be very considerably intensified.</P>
      <P>When the Minister brought forward this Bill I think what was in his mind was a very honest endeavour to adjust the conflict between the individual and national standpoint as regards grass and tillage.  In my opinion, however, it is not really in the individual or the national interest to submit a scheme which will benefit just over half of the agricultural population, the people who live on the richer lands, at the expense of half a million of people who live on the poorer lands. To my mind, the expense will be borne entirely by the poorer elements, those people who are not likely to produce considerable quantities of millable wheat and who experience, at the moment, a difficulty in procuring a market for their produce.</P>
      <P>I always thought the late Government lacked vision in the matter of curing the unemployment problem.</P>
      <P>I am in favour of a remunerative subsidy which will put our people to work, as I said at the beginning of the debate.  I think the idea of increasing tillage, if it can be soundly and wisely done, is an excellent one.  But if, at the same time, you adopt a political policy which is deliberately and admittedly calculated to do away with our overseas markets, the Government have made an economic tillage policy practically impossible.  More tillage requires more farmyard manure.  It requires not only more artificials but the best of all aids to tillage, farmyard manure.  That presupposes more stock and more stock requires that there should be a market for the surplus additional to the present surplus. As a result of the present policy, that market is vanishing very rapidly and I am afraid will soon disappear altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the question of manure, I should like to refer to some of the reports published at different times by the Department in their technical <Col N="530" /> journal.  They state very clearly that farmyard manure has been produced in progressively increasing quantities in relation to the area tilled.  That is the opinion of experts.  It is the basic point of any tillage scheme which is undertaken.  Three and a half million cattle, exclusive of the stores and fattening beasts which we are carrying now, are barely sufficient to manure the tillage we have got, not to speak of the top dressing of grass land. That will have to go by the board, or shall we have to use artificials as best we can?  If we are to make any employment scheme of this kind a real success, we must almost double the number of stock.  I think that the only chance for success of this scheme is to seek closer relations with the overseas market, rather than antagonise them, as we have done.</P>
    <P>I should like to return for a moment to what I was saying yesterday.  That had to do with the question of additional population and the potential consumption of our own products. After the debate last night, Senator Johnson very kindly corrected the figure I gave, which was 60,000 tons for an additional million.  So as to leave myself on the safe side, I doubled the original figure on which I reckoned and gave the margin to the promoters of the Bill.  The actual ascertained figure, Senator Johnson tells us, is 69 lbs., so that an extra million would consume 30,000 tons of live-stock products.  We are at present feeding our population and, over and above that, we are exporting 130,000 tons of live-stock products in the shape of meat.  We import 26,000 tons and even then we have a surplus of 104,000 tons. Add another 2,000,000 to the population and you have still a large surplus. If you till more, you have a larger surplus still and you must get rid of it in some way.  That is entirely exclusive of the 8,000 tons of fish which we eat and export at the present moment.  All these figures are taken straight from the Statistical Abstract for last year and wherever there was a margin in favour of the Ministry, I have given it and wherever the figures in favour of my argument were doubtful, I have taken the whole figure down <Col N="531" /> to the last &ldquo;one&rdquo; or the last &ldquo;nought.&rdquo;  If you apply pounds, shillings and pence to these figures, you get the following result: We have been promised a saving of £9½ million. We are losing, by getting rid of the present market, about £19½ million. Deduct our imports of £2½ million and the total loss is £17½ million&mdash;that is, instead of doubling our stock and getting from £38 million to £40 million. I think it is a terrible responsibility knowingly&mdash;when I say &ldquo;knowingly,&rdquo; I mean with the figures of the Statistical Abstract before us, which the farmer has not got&mdash;to put before the people a wrong course like this from which&mdash;if it is not a success&mdash;it will be extremely difficult to recover.  To come here and say that you have already induced these unfortunate people to engage to grow 65,000 acres of wheat is a very serious thing.</P>
    <P>Again, the Minister mentioned that people are now eating meat who never ate it before.  Why?  Because it is being hawked around.  Take a 40 lb. wether; it was being hawked around at 4d per lb.  People have lately got so completely sick of it that they will not buy it at all.  At 4d per lb., the wether is sold at 13/4.  Last August, the price would have been from 32/- to 35/-.  That is the explanation of the people eating more meat.  Touching on what Senator MacEllin told the House about a fortnight ago, that Britain will never be able to do without our cattle, I should like to mention a letter which I received from a big North of England farmer recently.  He said: &ldquo;A short time ago I stocked 80 heifers in the spring.  I am doubling the number this year.  A good many of my neighbours are doing much the same and we will soon be independent of you fellows over there.&rdquo;  There are probably other people in other parts doing the same and if we let this movement grow there will certainly be a greatly reduced demand for our stock and no demand for the additional surplus which I maintain very definitely any tillage scheme will demand.  A lot of difficulties are being suggested.  I do not pay a lot of attention to them. The farmer is a tradesman and a <Col N="532" /> highly skilled one at that.  He knows all about the weather and he knows how to handle labour.  Provided he has the land, he will overcome most of those difficulties but he will not, throughout this country year in and year out, be able to produce a uniform quality of wheat approaching in any way what can be imported from Canada.  It will be good enough. Further, without the use of machinery he will not be able to get as good a return for his efforts as he gets at present, and if a high figure of rationalisation is introduced much of the value of the tillage scheme as a means of giving employment will automatically disappear.</P>
    <P>I had forgotten one point about the wheat scheme.  That is the question of failures.  Senator Comyn said that if a wheat crop fails, you can always set another crop.  But it takes about £9 in cash to set and put into the sack an acre of wheat, allowing for the various incidentals but not allowing for rent or rates.  If it fails, it is going to cost you £4 8s. 0d. more That is a rather important point. Again, you cannot set that fresh crop if it is spring wheat that is in question and very little autumn wheat can be set here except in very dry parts.  To sum up, the expansion rather than the restriction of our overseas market for livestock is essential to any increase of tillage.  Lacking the advantages of an overseas market, employment in the growing of wheat will be of a seasonal nature only and will be of little advantage to unemployed workers. The conditions which obtain in the Saorstát make the cultivation of barley and oats, as well as wheat, desirable and efforts in this direction will in consequence provide more constant employment to a larger number of workers.  The distribution of the proposed bounty on wheat will operate to the advantage of the richer counties and will at the same time lower the standard of living in the poorer ones. It is desirable to restrict the purchase of maize from countries of origin which make no appreciable purchases from the Saorstát in return, rather than whole wheat, which can be purchased from countries with which there is a trade agreement.  The Bill appears <Col N="533" /> to visualise an army of inspectors but I hope that most of the work will be carried out by the young man whom the Department keeps to sharpen up the &ldquo;bad&rdquo; farmers and who nearly got a pike in his chest when he went to tell Senator Wilson to cut his thistles.</P>
    <P>Now, sir, nations have become great by reason of their trade rather than their isolation.  Will the problematical saving of a problematical £9,500,000 compensate for our loss of trade with Empire customers and the resulting credits which we must lay up abroad in order to provide for the imports of those raw materials which not only any progress in industry but ordinary existence will continue to require?  If we are to subsidise a tillage scheme I suggest that we concentrate on barley and oats, both of which can be more easily grown than wheat.</P>
    <P Just="Center">[<i>The Cathaoirleach resumed the Chair.</i>]</P>
    <P>I have been, I think, sympathetic and not destructive, and for a moment I want to be constructive as regards the scheme.  I suggest that in Committee of the House we might consider what amendments to insert in order to correct any faults in the measure.  The bounties are a mere bagatelle in these days.  In the first case the bounties should be expended so as to make the Bill just to the whole country and oats and barley should be included as well as wheat.  Then there must be housing grants.  The farmers must have some place in which they can put their corn. There are lots of farms where they have got nothing whatever and there are hundreds of farmers who will be growing this wheat and they will be clamouring for implements.  At present they have not got any implements to grow either wheat, oats or barley.  In order to make the scheme a success it is essential that the House should feel that it is on the right lines.</P>
    <P>If the Government want the people to help them, they must help us, and the way they can best help us is by making some attempt to restore the British markets for the sale of our surplus produce.  If the Government fail to do that, the tillage scheme as a means of employment and as a means of producing wealth will be of no use <Col N="534" /> whatever and will only lead to disaster. I am afraid I have kept the House for too long a period.  I trust the Minister and the House will realise that I have not spoken as I have on this Bill from any partisan motives whatever and that I have looked at it from the purely national point of view with a view to increasing the wealth of the country and to increasing employment in the country.  I only wish to point out the imperfections in the scheme.  The scheme has to be properly remodelled and if it is it might be considerably improved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianORourke" hpid="Mr. O'Rourke Mr. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The principles underlying the Bill have my hearty support if the meaning of the Government by this Bill is to increase the tillage of wheat grown in the Saorstát.  So far as that point goes the Bill has my hearty support.  But I think the Government are going the wrong way about it.  I do not say that we cannot grow wheat in this country.  We grew 600,000 acres of wheat in the fifties. Ireland had then to feed herself.  There was no possibility of getting wheat from Canada and Australia then.  At that time we had only two million of cattle in the country as against four million to-day.  As fast as cheap wheat from abroad came into the country the farmer turned to the production of the cattle and livestock generally.  The mere growing of wheat is no substitute at all for the livestock industry.  The livestock industry is the main thing for this country but the Government has injured that industry very much and all we can hope for is that the industry and the market for the industry will be soon restored to us and that the industry will be put in the position it was a year ago.  If it is not, tillage, instead of increasing, will drop.  We were told by Senator Connolly that the embargo on our livestock trade was a blessing in disguise.  He said it was a blessing in disguise to do away with the livestock trade.  The blessing has been very well disguised indeed&mdash;so much so that none of the people have been able to see this blessing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to go on to a scheme of wheat growing we will have to change our breeds of wheat.  I have experience of kiln-drying and milling Irish wheat <Col N="535" /> for the past forty years.  In September, 1931 it would have been impossible to save wheat in this country and very little of the wheat grown that year was millable.  This past year the weather was good and the quality of the wheat grown was very good.  That was because the year was a very dry one and not what we have so often in this country&mdash;a dropping summer.  Most of the wheat grown this year was fit for milling.</P>
    <P>In my opinion it is a terrible risk for the Government to urge the farmers to grow large quantities of wheat this coming year.  The Minister was bragging last night that 30,000 acres extra of wheat would be grown this year.  That is a mere bagatelle.  If it happened that 300,000 or 400,000 acres of wheat were grown the Minister would find that in a year like 1931 three-fourths of it would be unfit for milling.  Under present conditions it would be impossible to save the wheat if a large acreage were planted under it.  There is no provision made for the farmers to store it.  If the wheat is grown and if it is millable wheat 23/- or 24/- per barrel compares favourably with the prices that other farm produce is fetching at the moment.  But what is going to happen the farmer when we have a very wet season?  The wheat cannot be saved.  In fact, it will be pure dung.  Wheat is more liable to injury in a loft or stack than other grain.  Barley and oats are much hardier crops than wheat.  In circumstances where it would be quite possible to save oats and barley wheat will get musty and it will be little use as a food.  Under this Bill no provision is being made to meet the case of the farmer who has 25 acres under wheat. How is he to get it kiln-dried and properly stored?  If provision is not made for doing these things the wheat will not be worth £3 a ton.  I warn the Minister that he is taking a tremendous risk in urging farmers to grow wheat.  If things turn out as I fear they will, these farmers will have a great deal against the Minister.  Of course I quite admit that with an acreage of over 60,000 under wheat there will not be so very much risk, <Col N="536" /> but if the thing is to go on from year to year and if the tillage is increased in the way the Minister says, the risk to the farmer will be very great indeed in a bad year.</P>
    <P>As to the breed of seed for wheat-growing, I know that we were recommended by the Department to grow Queen Wilhelmina wheat imported from England and Scotland and such varieties.  All these are excellent varieties for England, but Senators must remember that the wheat that would suit the dry districts in Great Britain, areas such as Norfolk and the eastern counties of England, are not suitable even for other parts of that country.  Our Department of Agriculture here has not done much in the way of producing a suitable type of seed wheat for this country.  They have perfected a type of oats and barley, but they have made no improvement as regards good seed wheat. What we want in this country is a breed of wheat that will ripen three or four weeks earlier than wheat ripens at present.  At the other side of the Irish Sea the Government inspectors have produced a type of wheat that will grow and be a success as far north as Dundee.</P>
    <P>I know they produce a splendid crop of wheat in Dundee.  But that class of wheat would not pay here and it would not be a success.  That is because along the east side of England and Scotland you have a much drier climate than we have here.  Now if you take Lancashire it will be noticed that very little wheat is grown there.  They grow oats and barley in Lancashire but they do not grow wheat because the climate is too wet.  It is only on the eastern and dry side of England and Scotland that wheat can be grown with success.  Now the whole of this country is a very much more wet country than the West of England.  Yet we are growing here a breed of wheat that is only suitable for the East of England.  It will take about five years experimenting to get the breed of wheat that will suit this country.  I know that England, Canada and Australia had been working for years to get breeds of wheat suitable to their different localities.</P>
    <P>It is a remarkable fact if you go into <Col N="537" /> the Corn Exchanges in Liverpool and elsewhere, you will find 60 or 70 different varieties of wheat.  The reason is that all these varieties from all these other countries have had to be produced in order to suit the particular climate in each of these countries. Fifteen or 20 years ago Canada had much difficulty in securing a suitable breed of seed when she wanted to increase her wheat belt towards the North Pole.  The difficulty was that repeatedly the Government found that early frost injured the crop then grown but their Department of Agriculture produced a breed of wheat that could be sown in April and taken out in August.</P>
    <P>The same thing happened in Australia. In the early days there they could not grow wheat in parts of the country at all.  It was found that the land was too dry.  They tried seed wheat from India, Egypt and elsewhere and these breeds were a failure.  After experiments and research work by their Department of Agriculture they succeeded in producing a certain breed of wheat and the Australian wheat is to-day the best wheat in the world.  That is a singular thing that perhaps the larger proportion of wheat now in the market is Australian wheat and that is grown in a country that people once believed could not grow wheat at all. It is possible that if we had a proper variety here we could grow wheat with success.  But at present we have not a variety suitable to the climate.  That is not the fault of the Department of Agriculture.  It will take some years to get a suitable breed of wheat for this country.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot about how wheat is to increase tillage, but people must remember that there are other things that must be looked to.  What is to become of the rotation of our crops? If you grow an acre of wheat that must be followed in the rotation by turnips, mangolds, potatoes and perhaps another grain crop.  If the rotation of our crops is not kept up what is to happen our pigs, fowl and young cattle?  If the market for these is not restored there will be no necessity for producing them and there will be no possibility of growing wheat.  The <Col N="538" /> wheat problem hangs on the livestock problem, and unless the market for our livestock is restored there is no hope for the people out of the growing of wheat or growing of anything in this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister fought shy on the point of millable wheat.  I hope before the Bill leaves this House that we will be able to bring in a section and have a definition as to what millable wheat is.  It will not do to leave the definition of millable wheat to the miller, the agricultural instructor or the Government inspectors.  It is not fair to leave the farmers without a certain definition as to what millable wheat is.  The farmer should know what he is to produce as millable wheat.  That should be in the Bill and he should get the benefit of it.</P>
    <P>This Bill is really two Bills in one. In the first place there is the mixing of the maize and then you have the growing of wheat.  I may tell the Seanad that the maize millers had a meeting on this question of the mixing of maize with home-grown cereals. There were 75 millers present and 74 of these voted against the proposal to mix the maize with cereals.  I do not claim that the 74 were right but all of them were in the position of knowing what their customers the farmers wanted.  They had considered what would suit the farmers.  They put up an alternative scheme to the Minister. We thought that scheme would meet this matter much better than mixing the maize with home-grown cereals. Under the Bill it is proposed to mix ten per cent.  of cereals with the maize. A proportion of ten per cent. mixture would not be very injurious and many people would scarcely know whether it is there or not but when later on it would be increased to 20, 30 or 40 per cent. it will be injurious to the farmers and the millers.</P>
    <P>The alternative suggestion put up by the millers was a tax of £1 per ton on imported maize.  This would reduce the imports of maize and help to give the farmer a market for his cereals. We are all agreed that it would be desirable to reduce our imports of maize and get a better price for the home-grown corn.  But we have the <Col N="539" /> position to-day that black oats is selling at 7/6 a barrel so it does not look as if the mixing of the maize is a very serious help in the way of putting up the price of the oats.  Now the suggestion of the millers was that £1 per ton of a tax should be put on the maize imports and that the moneys resulting from that would be used to pay the farmers a bounty on home-grown grain.  That alternative scheme would achieve the same object in a less roundabout way.  I think the farmers would much prefer that scheme.  As a matter of fact the effect of the Bill is that there is already a tax on maize and the farmer is not getting the pure maize.  He has to pay the tax and he is not getting any of the benefits.  The effect of the Bill, as far as I can see, is that counties like Leitrim that do not grow grain, will have to pay a tax so as to give a bounty to farmers in Leix.  The Government might as well put a tax of 1/- a cwt. on the Leitrim farmers and give that as a subsidy to the farmers of Laoighis and the grain-growing counties.</P>
    <P>Grain grown in Leix and Offaly will have to be transported across the country to places like Sligo and Leitrim and the farmers there will have to pay an extra price for it.  I am quite satisfied that the farmers of Leitrim would prefer to get pure maize meal, pay £1 per ton tax on it, and have done with it.  If you give a 2/6 bounty on oats, it would not mean that everybody in the country would get that 2/6.  It would only be paid on what would be exported but the fact of increasing the export value of oats would increase its value all round.  Instead of being sold at 7/6 per barrel it might be sold at 10/-.  You would increase the price to the farmer at very little cost to anybody&mdash;to the Government, the taxpayer or the farmer using maize meal.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech in the Dáil referred to some proposition which the millers put up as misleading. I am very sorry he made use of that word.  The millers take great exception to it, particularly these few millers from a district in the south of <Col N="540" /> Ireland, where black oats only is grown.  They ground up maize and black oats and the result was not very pleasing.  The mixture looked rather injurious, but the millers showed what the effects of the mixture of black oats and maize would be.  I do not think there was anything misleading in that. I do not think that millers generally use black oats in mixing.  They principally use barley and white oats and they had no intention of misleading the Minister.  I hope the Minister will withdraw or qualify his remarks in some way, because these millers in the south of Ireland feel very sore about it.</P>
    <P>This is a very important Bill and a good many amendments, so far as I know, will be introduced which, I hope, will improve the Bill without taking away any of its good points.  It has good points&mdash;points in regard to the restriction of flour imports and the control of flour milling.  I am entirely in agreement with that and I think that it will work out to the advantage of the community in general.  The Minister will want to make some arrangements by which millers, if there is a very bad, wet back-end, will take wheat from the farmers inside four or five days after it is harvested.  If not, it will be merely feeding stuff.  The millers have not any system of kiln drying, but they have all big stocks of wheat from Manitoba and Australia which has a very low moisture content. If that is mixed with the Irish wheat, the Irish wheat will not be affected. The Minister will want to make some arrangement of that kind, because otherwise a lot of wheat will be lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBagwell" hpid="Mr. Bagwell Mr. Bagwell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bagwell</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as my personal view is concerned, I see more that is objectionable in this Bill and less to commend it than I saw in the case of almost any measure since I have been here.  The objective of the Bill, as we see from the Preamble, is to grow more wheat, oats and barley, especially wheat, to import less of these commodities, to keep the money in the country, and to give more employment. That sounds splendid on paper but when you come to examine it in practice I believe the whole thing is unsound.  Why do I say it is unsound? First of all, I think that it <Col N="541" /> is extremely questionable whether the Bill will attain the objective aimed at in any great measure.  If it is attained, I think it is more than likely that the country will lose far more than it has to gain by it.  As regards the methods, which are more or less admittedly inevitable&mdash;if you embark on this policy you are bound to have these methods&mdash;they are most objectionable, expensive and to a certain extent, demoralising.  Let us review them and see whether this assertion is reasonable.</P>
      <P>You have got control and regulation by the Government of wheat milling. You have got subsidies on wheat milled in Irish mills.  You have got all sorts of regulations.  You have got registration of all concerns from the producer to the distributor.  You have got bounties on home-grown wheat, restriction on sale of maize and compulsory mixing into feeding stuffs of home-grown grain, restrictions on imports of wheat and maize and, finally, you have the Government going into all this business themselves. Obviously this whole thing is artificial because it has got to be done by legislation.  It is true that there is no compulsion to grow wheat.  That is one thing the Bill does not contain which might commend it to those of us who oppose it.  There is no compulsion to grow wheat or to increase tillage but there is quite considerable compulsion in other directions.</P>
      <P>As regards the expense of the Bill, all these bounties and subsidies cost money.  The administration costs will be very considerable.  Hosts of officials will have to be appointed to carry out the scheme of the Bill which is on a very big scale.  As regards the Government itself engaging in milling, the Minister says that he hopes that will not be necessary.  So do I, but I dislike the idea of our authorising him to do so.  I have a profound distrust of Governments as manufacturers or traders.  They have got the taxpayers' money to start and run these things and, if everything goes wrong, to square things up.  They have no bankruptcy court to face and no personal responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The way in which the Bill seems to <Col N="542" /> me to be demoralising is this.  You have got this Government control over the highly technical business of milling. You have got interference with farming and certain processes of farming, which is one of the most complicated industries in the world.  The result of that is that all concerned will look more and more to the Government to help them, protect them and favour them at the cost of everybody else. If that is not demoralising, I do not know what is.  A further feature in which it is demoralising is that this measure tends to divert attention from the real national economic disaster&mdash; this has already been mentioned by other speakers but it cannot be stated too often&mdash;this knock-out blow of a 40 per cent. tariff against our livestock exported to what is practically our only market, Great Britain.  We have also the loss of goodwill of our only customer, and the active dislike and contempt which has been incurred there for a deliberately defaulting country.</P>
    <P>It has been stated by Ministers&mdash;if not here, elsewhere&mdash;that the cattle trade was dead anyhow.  We know that it is in a bad way but nobody can say that it would be so bad were it not for this 40 per cent. tariff which is simply a knock-out blow.  I am all in favour of increased tillage if it could be brought about by proper commercial methods but I am not in favour of it in substitution for the cattle trade that is supposed to be dead.  I do not believe the cattle trade is dead; it is only in a very bad way. If the cattle trade were dead as has been stated by Ministers in this House in another debate, who killed it? The present Government more than anybody else.  They are the sponsors of this Bill.  I say the fact that the Government has brought the country to this frightfully serious state is one reason why we should look very seriously at a Bill of this kind.  It seems to me, <i>prima facie</i>, to be a reason for doubting whether the Government are the best advisers or the best judges of what to do in this situation, and whether it is really in the national interests to get out of livestock as much as possible and into tillage and, of all crops, into wheat.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="543" /> Wheat is perhaps the most overproduced world crop of to-day.  We are asked to relinquish the form of farming for which the country is eminently suited by soil, climate and proximity to markets, a form of farming which has been built up by long experience and which does not require Government control, bounties, subsidies, hosts of new officials, the registration of everybody concerned or the restriction of anything.  All these things we are going to have under this Bill.  They are very expensive and very demoralising.  As regards the question of wheat growing, I do not know as much about wheat or farming generally as a great many members of the House, but I am not entirely incompetent to speak on the subject. It will be agreed that the best-class farmer is he who tills all that is necessary for feeding his own stock.  Wheat has been grown on my farm, quite good millable wheat, but I do not propose to enter into that kind of argument, because I think it is perfectly futile.  I think that by taking individual cases and individual experiences in this or that part of the country, you can prove or disprove almost anything and it all leads nowhere.</P>
    <P>This is a really big question of general application, affecting thousands of farmers all over the country, and, in some degree, everyone else.  What you want to consider is the collective opinion of the people and what is the general practice and you cannot be far out.  I do not believe the whole community are fools in this matter.  It is not reasonable to suppose they are. The attitude which the agricultural community take towards wheat may be illustrated very briefly by simply stating the fact that not 2 per cent. of tillage in the Saorstát is under wheat.  It is fair to presume, therefore, that most people do not consider it a paying crop.  Some do, but their conditions may be exceptional.  Taken as a whole, it is not considered a paying crop.  Wheat prices have been higher in this country than the guaranteed price proposed under this <Col N="544" /> bounty system and yet that did not attract a very big number of people into the growing of wheat.  You can make any industry or crop pay by subsidies and bounties, but it has all got to be paid for by the people of the country, the taxpayers and others.</P>
    <P>The cattle trade, the natural trade of the country, is not dead; it is only deadly sick.  Like all primary products, prices are down in this period of world depression but they will increase again some day.  The cattle trade will revive in the general revival, and I think it would be a terrible thing if a Bill of this kind were used to divert the attention of large numbers of people in this country from the trade which has been their principal source of revenue up to the present and if it were to prevent them from availing themselves of better times when better times come. It would be most unfortunate if they were to turn their attention to other pursuits to which the country is not well suited.  The people of Great Britain will eat more fresh meat again when better times come and it would be a great pity if the people of this country were not able to supply that demand.  It is a cardinal principle in business to consider your natural advantages and to ask people to work in a direction in which there are natural disadvantages is the greatest folly.  Apart from that, this system of subsidies and bounties has this grave objection.  The very idea of a subsidy, a guaranteed price, suggests something for nothing.  That is tremendously mischievous.  It is likely to cause people to think that because they can get something more than the ordinary commercial price, a price brought about by something more than ordinary commerce, they should engage in some pursuit which otherwise they would not have entered.  It cannot be denied that the price of wheat is more likely to fall than the price of any other commodity.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
    <P>Debate accordingly adjourned.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 7 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Thursday, 15th December, 1932.</P>
