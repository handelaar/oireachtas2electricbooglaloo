    <Title>Public Business. - Dublin and Blessington Steam Tramway (Abandonment) Bill, 1932.&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Connolly) Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Connolly)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is in charge of this Bill, is at present engaged in the other House and will not be able to attend.  The Bill, which I am sure all Senators have read, deals with the Dublin and Blessington Steam Tramway.  The position with regard to that company is: there was £97,070 capital subscribed.  Of this, £40,000, having interest at 5 per cent., was guaranteed by certain baronies in County Dublin and County Wicklow.  The remainder of the shares were not guaranteed and they are valueless.  Certain baronies in County Dublin and County Wicklow which put up this money were recouped by the State half the sums paid by them in respect of guaranteed dividend to a <Col N="1087" /> sum not exceeding 2 per cent., which meant a State charge of £800.  Owing to the uneconomic nature of the tramway undertaking, the charge to the State amounted to £800 a year and that has had to be paid for many years.</P>
      <P>The State liability only continues so long as the tramway company is maintained in working order and the loss for the past three years has worked out at £7,000 per annum.  Most people will agree, I think, that the tramway service there is no longer the necessity that it was.  Owing to the development of bus traffic and other transport facilities in that area, there is not the need for the tramway service that was present when the undertaking was established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal now is that the four thousand shares which were issued at £10 each should be taken over at an agreed price.  Following certain negotiations, the price for the guaranteed shares was fixed at £5 10s.  This will mean the raising of a loan of £22,000.  The amount will be raised from the Commissioners of Public Works for a period of 20 years, 5¾ per cent. interest for redemption. The contribution from the Local Taxation Account, which amounts to £1,900 per annum, and which is a charge on this account, would undoubtedly be increased considerably if the line were continued.  The proposal is that this amount will be continued as a contribution to the sum necessary for the wiping out of the liability in connection with the guaranteed shares, and other consequential liabilities of the concern.  The Government contribution of £800 will cease on the closing of the line.  County Wicklow will continue to make its present contribution, but the contribution will meet the instalments due by the guaranteeing areas in that county, so that they will have to pay nothing in excess of what they are at present paying.  The position with regard to Dublin will be that from the closing of the line the contributions, starting at £465 in the first year, will gradually diminish until in the eighth year £72 5s. Od. will have to be paid.  The <Col N="1088" /> contribution from the Local Taxation Account will decrease until in the twentieth year the amount paid will be £1,163 5s. Od., after which no further payment will be made.  A committee of management is being set up which will continue to administer the affairs of the concern until all the liability is liquidated.  Under one of the sections of the Bill, it is proposed to compensate the servants of the company under the provisions of the Railways Act of 1924, and the liability in this respect will be met by rate.  The assets will be put on the market and disposed of, I suppose, as scrap.  The amount realised from sale of the assets will go in the proportion of two-thirds to Dublin and one-third to County Wicklow.  I think it will be generally agreed that it is desirable that this steam tramway undertaking should be wound up.  The State is taking the best means available to liquidate the assets, but it must take responsibility to deal with the employees as equitably as possible under the Railways Act, and generally to get the whole position cleared and the line removed.  If there are any questions to be put I shall bring them before the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an extraordinarily complicated Bill.  I had, what I was going to describe as the misfortune, to advise the two counties when it became necessary for them to take over this concern and work it themselves&mdash;to their own loss, as it was bound to be.  I know, therefore, how very complicated the accounts and the circumstances of this concern were. This is necessarily a most complicated Bill.  I wish the Minister responsible were here, because it is hardly fair to ask the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, who is acting for him, some of the questions which I would like to put to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephConnolly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I explain that I raised the question with the Minister as regards the taking of the remaining stages of this Bill to-day.  You, a Chathaoirligh, and other members of the House know how little disposed I am to the taking of the remaining stages of any Bill in this way.  I saw <Col N="1089" /> the Minister just before I came in and he is quite agreeable to have this motion to take the remaining stages to-day withdrawn so that Senator Brown, if he wishes, can bring forward any amendments he thinks desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SamuelBrownKC" hpid="Mr. Brown Mr. Brown">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear that statement from the Minister.  I do not know whether it will be necessary to insert any amendments, but there are sections which I am unable to understand&mdash;particularly Section 12 and part of Section 11, which deal with a new difficulty which has arisen by reason of the fact that portion of the guaranteeing area of the County of Dublin has now become part of the City of Dublin under the Greater Dublin Act.  Under those circumstances, the contribution which would quite easily have been made by County Dublin, if part of County Dublin had not become part of the City, has now to be worked out on some equitable basis under which the contribution from the city in respect of the areas it has got from the county will be properly dealt with.  The provisions of Sections 11 and 13 are not quite consistent.  Under Section 11, which deals with the compensation to be paid to employees who lose their positions, the contribution of the City of Dublin in respect of the area they have taken in from the county is to be a charge on the whole city area, whereas under Section 12 the contribution&mdash;which will be much the larger one, because it is out of this sum the money will have to come to pay off shareholders and to pay remaining debts&mdash;is to come off the area which has been taken into the city from the county, but it is to be raised by municipal rate.  The difficulty that occurred to me&mdash;it may not be a real difficulty, but I should like to look into it carefully&mdash;is whether you can have a municipal rate, which is a general rate over the whole city, applotted in such a way that an extra portion of it, reserved to this particular use, can be put on the added area.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1090" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there will be any other opportunity in this House to say what I think ought to be said.  The Bill is now in a form which the House cannot amend at this stage, and it will go to the Dáil, and one may assume that the Dáil will not agree to the amendments made by the Seanad and it will then, presumably, come back to the Seanad.  It seems to me that, at this stage, some notice ought to be taken of events that have occurred across the water, particularly since the Bill was before this House.  Speeches that have been made by responsible people, giving indication of the minds of responsible people in Britain as regards the position of this Free State, require some action or, at least, some expression of views from this House and from the Dáil.  The discussion in the British House of Commons, and, particularly, the speech of Mr. Lloyd George, who was Premier at the time of the passing of the Treaty, and statements made in the public Press by responsible constitutional authorities, show that there has been practically no change of attitude from that which was taken up by them before the Treaty.  I refer particularly to the speech of Mr. Lloyd George, and it seems to me that, notwithstanding the developments in constitutional relations from the 1926 and 1930 Imperial Conferences, and the declarations made on these occasions and the subsequent passing of the Statute of Westminster, there is not indicated any change in the mental attitude of responsible British politicians as to the relations between the two countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears to be still the view of those responsible authorities that this country is now enjoying an extension of self-government, conceded by the British Parliament.  I cannot think that that is the view of this Parliament. It certainly was not the attitude of the Ministers of the late Government, and it would appear to me, in view of the fact, which I think <Col N="1091" /> is undeniable, that the sentiments expressed by Mr. Lloyd George received the heartiest support from the House of Commons, that the position of this country in relation to Britain, and in relation to the British Dominions, has to be re-asserted by this Parliament, and that the right and proper and appropriate way of re-asserting that position would be for this House, when the opportunity arises after the Bill has been discussed in the Dáil, very definitely to adopt the position that is stated in the Bill as it came to this House from the Dáil.  I do not think I shall go into detail with regard to the statements made in the British House.  They are on record in the reports of the House of Commons debates of 17th June, and it is quite clear that the attitude of mind is that something has been granted in the way of self-government to this country by the British Parliament, and that nothing can be enacted by this Parliament which the British Government may think detrimental to British interests. These statements were not made in so many words, but that was the effect of Mr. Lloyd George's speech, which was so heartily applauded by members of Parliament, by Ministers and by the Press subsequently.</P>
    <P>Then there have appeared certain other speeches by responsible politicians in Britain, and a letter from a responsible constitutional authority, Professor Berriedale Keith, which again seem to me to call for some notice.  While I do not think it desirable that Ministers here should take formal notice of letters which appear in the Press, even from so responsible a legal authority as Professor Berriedale Keith, that should not debar one such as myself from taking notice of such a contribution, which undoubtedly expresses views very commonly held by authorities across the water and by some people in this country.  The assertion is made, for instance, in a letter to the &ldquo;Morning Post&rdquo; of Friday last, that &ldquo;in Irish constitutional law, which alone is relevant, the legislature&rdquo;&mdash;that is, the Irish Free <Col N="1092" /> State legislature&mdash;&ldquo;is not a sovereign body in the same sense as is the British Parliament&rdquo;; that it is given definite powers by the Constituent Act of 1922 enacted by the Constituent Assembly, and that the courts arc bound to interpret its legislation in the light of the powers accorded them. There is one point that I think should be noted in that regard, and it is, that the constituent assembly, which comprised, I think, 126 members, never recorded more than 50 votes in favour of the Constitution or the Constitution Act.  The Second Reading of the Constitution Bill was accorded 47 votes in its favour, and the highest recorded vote in favour of any section of the Bill was 50.  Now it is suggested by so high a constitutional authority, that the Oireachtas, the Dáil and Seanad, of 1932, or any subsequent year, a Dáil consisting of 153 members, fully representative, has not the same authority as that assembly of 1922, and that, for all time, this Parliament is limited by the decisions of that assembly, which was known as the Constituent Assembly, or as the Provisional Parliament. This is not the place to decide such a question, but when that thought prevails in the minds of legal authorities, it appears to me that these who conducted the Government of this country for ten years, and made such claims in regard to the powers of this Parliament, ought to be heard in refutation of any such argument.</P>
    <P>Then, a further statement is made, which, I think, clearly misrepresents the position of the President and the Government in regard to this Bill, and in regard to the powers claimed for this Parliament.  The President's argument is said to run that the power to amend the Constitution and the Constitution Act is unlimited because the power of the Canadian Parliament is unlimited.  That is not the position, as I understand it, that is taken by the President or the Government here at all.  Even under the constitutional developments which have been formulated in the Statute of Westminster, the position is clearly, that, so far as the Canadian Parliament is concerned, they of their own initiative, and of their own free will, accepted a limitation <Col N="1093" /> of their powers in regard to the alteration or amendment of the British North America Act.  That is a matter of Canadian governmental policy and not a constitutional limitation imposed upon Canada by the British Parliament. The position of this State, and of South Africa, and the other Dominions, formulated by the Statute of Westminster, as I understand it is, clearly&mdash;I mention South Africa in particular, because it is definitely formulated in their own Constitution Act &mdash;that there is freedom and no restriction whatever on the legal powers of Parliament, and that if, as a matter of governmental or Parliamentary policy, it is decided to do a certain thing, to wit, to repeal the Oath clause of the Constitution, there is no limitation on these powers.  If the Canadian Parliament desire to change their policy, there is really, I am quite certain, no Canadian Minister who would hesitate to affirm that the powers are there, as soon as it became Canadian policy to make the change. As it is Irish policy to make the change, there is no limitation on the powers of this Parliament to make the change.  It appears to me that in view of the position that has developed, in view of the attitude taken across the water, in view of all the assertions made in past years, and, particularly, in the past six years, by Ministers representing this State as to the authority of this Parliament, there is only one way of re-affirming our position that there is no limitation on the powers of this Parliament in any matter affecting the concern of the State and that is, when the opportunity comes, for this Seanad to re-assert it by passing the Bill in the form in which it reached this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at all sure that the statement made by Senator Johnson will be helpful to this State in its present constitutional strivings. In any case, so far as the section in this House for which I can speak is concerned, we do not propose to enter into any arguments in the matter at this stage.  We propose to reserve any comments upon the Bill itself, or any such developments as those to which <Col N="1094" /> Senator Johnson alluded, to the stage when and if the Bill should return to the Seanad from the Dáil with the intimation that the Dáil declines to accept the amendments.</P>

      <P>Not at all.  I shall be very glad indeed if Ministers are wise enough to advise the other House to accept the Bill as it leaves this House. If that should take place, I cannot see that there is any further comment coming from this House that would serve any useful purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators and Deputies opposing this Bill have been laying the foundations of their arguments merely on the question of arbitration and negotiations.  I have always opposed both, because I do not believe any good would be got from either. However, there have been some negotiations and arbitration, and that ought to satisfy the minds of those people who found their arguments on that alone.  I suppose it will not, because they have made up their minds to continue in the same position.  We know that arbitration of some sort has been accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>These things come up more or less in a general way, and the two questions are brought here with the same arguments.  Whatever they may be, there has been a great deal of abuse by English politicians, by Ministers and by the English Press. They have fastened their attacks mainly upon the President, because he did not agree with them in every way. We had newspapers in England, &ldquo;The Times,&rdquo;&ldquo;The Observer,&rdquo;&ldquo;The Sunday Times&rdquo; pouring out abuse, mainly upon the President.  Their object seems to be by personal attacks to try as far as they can to get the people of this country to throw out the Fianna Fáil Government and the President. They stated openly that that was their great object.  That seems to be the main idea of English Ministers and newspapers.  They stated that the President was unyielding, impracticable, and so on, and while making these statements, they at the same time praised Mr. Thomas and Lord Hailsham for their unyielding attitude. General statements were made by these newspapers, and by members of Parliament, and attacks were made on the action of the Ministry and the Dáil. Mr. Thomas has made a good many statements.  Mr. Lloyd George said &ldquo;I am all out for good-will towards Ireland; that is why we signed the Treaty.&rdquo;  If that was the only reason he signed the Treaty I wonder what reason there was for sending over the &ldquo;Black and Tans.&rdquo;  What was the object of the shootings in 1916?  Every act shows hatred of this country, and hypocrisy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1096" /> We are accused of breaking treaties. That seems to be the principal attack made upon us.  I suppose in doing so the complaint is about the Oath, because it is the only thing mentioned in the Treaty.  There is no question about the annuities in the Treaty.  We are attacked, and Mr. Thomas says that he does not want to have anything to do with questions of law.  He says that he has to deal only with the question of honour.  The question of honour, the question of law and the question of treaties are all brought up against us.  I do not remember any case where this country has ever broken a treaty with England.  I know hundreds of cases where England has broken faith with this country.  Everybody knows that.  Mr. Thomas said the Treaty was not a matter of law or status, but a matter of honour.  In Ireland we have had a great deal to say to British treaties.  Our ancestors regarded the Saxon word as the symbol of treachery.  Mr. Thomas said that business was impossible.  If business is impossible with people who break an oath I do not know where the British would be, because every treaty they ever made was broken.  When the American colonies were engaged in much the same dispute as we are with the British, a treaty was made, and no sooner was it made than Lord North, who was then Prime Minister in England, said it was only a temporary agreement, and that he intended to regain by their strength what they had lost by their weakness.</P>
    <P>I might go a great deal further and recall the Home Rule Act, in which certainly both law and honour were broken by the British.  Our minds travel back over a series of such broken treaties. As some of the actors are still amongst us, I will recall one broken treaty. The Home Rule Act, the result of half a century of discussion in and out of Parliament, was the culmination of constitutional effort by the Irish people.  In 1912, 1913 and 1914 it passed three times through the House of Commons and was finally signed by the King.  It was described at the time as the great healing measure between the two nations.  It was an all-Ireland Act; Ulster was included, and Mr. <Col N="1097" /> Redmond appealed to the people to help him in the war in commemoration of Ireland's freedom.  Nearly 100,000 persons enlisted for the war and something like 40,000 were killed.  They went to the war with the name of Home Rule on their lips and their blood was shed in vain.  The Act was held up in obedience to Lord Carson, backed by Lord Roberts and the leaders of the British Army and Navy.  It was then sought to divide Ireland.  A compromise was made with Mr. Redmond and the Irish leaders. It was drawn up and signed by Mr. Lloyd George and backed as a public offer in Parliament by Lord Asquith and all the Ministers.  Mr. Redmond trusted them, risked his reputation, and got the consent of the people. The pledge was broken publicly in the House of Commons, the Home Rule Act was withdrawn and thrown into the dust-bin of broken treaties.  Mr. Redmond and his followers left the House of Commons, and the next year were dismissed from public life at the General Election for trusting British Ministers.</P>
    <P>Quoting Edmund Burke in his speech at Westminster on Fox's India Bill, Mr. Lecky said:</P>
    <P>(1) I am prepared to prove three propositions.  From the Himalayas to Cape Comorin&mdash;that is, from the north to the south of India&mdash;there was not a single Prince, Potentate or State, great or small, who had come in contact with the English who had not been sold; I say &ldquo;sold,&rdquo; though sometimes they have not been able to deliver according to their bargain.</P>
    <P>(2) Not a single treaty they had made that they had not broken.</P>
    <P>(3) Not a single Prince that had ever put any trust in them who is not utterly ruined; and that none are in any degree secure and flourishing, but in the exact proportion to their settled distrust, and irreconcilable enmity to our nation.</P>
    <P>Burke then recapitulates the various persons and treaties referred to.  The Governor-General, excusing himself, admitted</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1098" /> he had not been very delicate with regard to public faith; he had made an estimate of the sums which would have been lost or never acquired if the rigid ideas of public faith had been observed.</P>
    <P>That was enough.  His instructions were: &ldquo;Govern fairly but send more money.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Hastings said then that when he had no money to send, he took it from anybody who had.</P>
    <P>We come on then to quite recent times.  I remember the time when the British went to Egypt and promised that they were going to move out of it as soon as the people were quieted. Within the next twenty years they made sixteen public promises both to the Egyptian and the Powers in Europe that they would evacuate Egypt.  But they did not do it; nor have they done it up to this day and they have made many promises since then.</P>
    <P>During the war they made a treaty with the Arabs and got their help by a promise of an Arab Empire extending over Syria and Mesopotamia, and at the very time that they made that treaty they got into connection with the French to divide up between the two of them the very countries which they had promised to the Arabs and for the promise of which they had got the Arab help during the war.</P>
    <P>Mr. Thomas tells us that this is a matter of honour&mdash;he does not want to have anything to do with the law.  He is aware that he has not the law on his side.  I think that everybody in this Seanad knows that the Lane Pictures are in honour due to Ireland and that it is only by a very small technicality&mdash;the lack of a witness to one of the signatures&mdash;that the British Government has been enabled to hold on to these pictures.  That is a question of honour.  Everybody in England and here admits that it is a matter of honour and that the pictures ought to belong to Ireland, but the Prime Minister and the various Ministers in England have refused to hand over the pictures or have refused to introduce an Act of Parliament to hand them <Col N="1099" /> over.  I do not know why people should talk to us of lack of honour when we have these glaring incidents before us extending over a whole series of years. While speakers on the other side have been attacking us all this time, their real object has been to get the Ministry here turned out of office. First they directed all their energies against the Labour members and tried by every means to turn them.  But the Labour members were honest men and did not desert their country and stood by it, and when they found that they could not do anything there they thought that the Seanad would be the point of attack, and all the newspapers in England and the different people interested have been suggesting that if only the Seanad threw out this Bill, everything would go nicely and pleasantly. All the time, while things are in an uncertain state, these attacks have been going on.  There have been attempts to frighten the people in this country.  The farmers are told that their cattle will be taxed, and tradespeople are told that they will be taxed too.  One thing is certain.  If we do not defend our own interests we will go to the wall.  Those who are frightened by threats and bogey-man statements like that are bound to be ruined and I think the enemies of the Irish people are only being strengthened and bolstered by all these attacks.</P>

In that bland, nice <Col N="1100" /> way of his, when he likes, he has thrown out the suggestion to-day&mdash;as usual, a pioneer in political warfare&mdash; that it would be well for the Executive to reconsider their position and leave the Bill as the majority of the Seanad has left it.  Colonel Moore's mind has gone back&mdash;my mind has a penchant for going back also&mdash;but I remember some of these pioneers, Senator Milroy amongst the number, speaking to the young men of Ireland in that old hackneyed phrase that &ldquo;the day is not far distant when the green flag shall wave over College Green and we shall be a nation once again.&rdquo;  I heard Senator Milroy, somewhere in the Midlands of England, saying that, speaking on behalf of the Irish race at home and abroad, he and they would never rest satisfied until all British allegiance had been barished out of Ireland as St. Patrick banished the snakes.

      <P>I move amendment 1:</P>
      <P>Section 12, sub-section (1).  After the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; in line 7 to insert in brackets the words &ldquo;(other than a person who manufactures farm butter).&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the amendment is quite clear and is to exclude the manufacturers of farm butter from the liability to pay a levy on the butter made by them.  It is very difficult to distinguish the dividing line between farm butter and factory butter.  Farm butter becomes factory butter when sold either to a factory or to a butter trader, and as the great bulk of butter manufactured on the farms is sold to butter traders, it is quite obvious that the levy on farm butter will have to be paid through the butter factory or through the butter trader.  There will be practically no loss to the revenue. This section, which gives the Minister power to serve a notice on the manufacturers of farm butter, is not mandatory; it is optional, and I think the effect on the manufacturers of farm butter of putting this section into force should be very carefully considered. The manufacturers of farm butter have their difficulties as well as the farmers who supply the creameries. It would, I think, be very bad policy for the Government to antagonise the farmers who are making butter.  I do not know what attitude the Minister will adopt towards this amendment, but I have been asked by several people who are engaged in the manufacture of farm butter to protest against the hardship and inconvenience they will be subjected to if they have to pay a levy on the butter produced.  They are quite satisfied to be left as they are and to take the market price of the day.  They fear that the Minister, by his regulations, may compel them to keep accounts and to furnish returns of the quantity of butter made by them, the people to whom they sold it and whether the levy was paid or not.  I observe by a subsequent section that the levy paid on farm butter sold to a factory or butter trader may be refunded, but that is a very roundabout way of dealing with the matter.  The Minister will have to be satisfied in connection with that provision, and the <Col N="1103" /> section does not state the method by which the factories are to prove to him that the farmers have already paid. Under all the circumstances, it would be more desirable that the farmers making their own butter should be excluded. The levy on their butter will be paid by the butter trader, and only a very small portion of their butter will be sold retail by them.</P>

      <P>Section 12 docs, it is true, give us power to serve notice on any farmer who manufactures farm butter and make his subject to the levy.  It also deals with other people with whom we are not concerned in this amendment &mdash;such as unregistered butter factories and those who sell butter on commission. We have no intention of compelling farmers in general to pay this levy.  The butter inspectors we have are very fully occupied and have quite a good deal of work to do in connection with the Dairy Produce Act.  The most we could expect from the staff we have would be to look after the creameries, the factories and a certain number of unregistered buyers.  We have no intention of going down to the farmer.  There is, however, the possibility that a large farmer having 50 or 60 cows&mdash;I do not think it could happen in a case smaller than that&mdash; who is at present supplying a creamery or selling his butter to a wholesale merchant for a factory, if he thought that by manufacturing the butter himself and selling it he would get a benefit of 4d. without having to contribute the 2d. levy, would be tempted to go into the business on his own.  In that case we considered that it would be unfair to the factory or the creamery concerned, as the case might be.  We are not anxious to injure any existing business whether it is that of a creamery, a factory or a wholesale buyer.  We would like to be in a position to protect such people in their business and to prevent that big farmer from leaving them in order to get benefits which we did not mean he <Col N="1104" /> should get under this Bill.  I can hardly see at the present time any case where it would apply.  I would, however, be very anxious to have this power in this Bill so that I could apply it if necessary.  I would like to disabuse the minds of Senators who have spoken, or any other Senator who may think, like Senator Linehan, that there is any danger in this.  I think there is no danger whatever that farmers will be victimised under this, but, as I say, I would like very much to have the power to apply it in the case of a very large farmer where he might appear to us to be taking an undue advantage of this Bill.  I would ask Senator Linehan to accept that assurance and to withdraw his amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Linehan's suggestion brought to my mind a rather interesting point.  He suggested, in advancing his argument for the amendment, that farmers would much prefer not to have heard about any bounty Bill at all than to have the Bill under present circumstances.  I would like to point out that the price of butter would be certainly 4d. a pound less than if they had to pay the levy, that the farmer would be getting 2d. per pound less than he would be getting at the present time, and surely it is hardly practical to think that farmers would prefer to compete in a market other than the controlled market we have here to-day.  Consequently, even though there was a levy on the farmers&mdash;and this is apart altogether from the amendment&mdash;they are still gaining, as a result of this Bill, 2d. per pound more than the world's market price.  I think, consequently, that there would be no hardship at all on the farmer who is producing butter at the present time.  He has a net advantage of 2d. a pound at the very least, and I think the amendment, so far as I can judge it, from a personal point of view, would tend to complicate matters, and I do not think it advisable that it should be gone on with.</P>

It would be very hard to convince them, considering the prices they have been getting&mdash;8d, and 9d. a pound&mdash;for the past two or three months, that they have got an increase in the price of their butter in consequence of the introduction of this Bill.  However, I recognise that the Minister had to do something to help the butter industry, whether carried on by the creameries, the factories or the farmers, and if the Minister thinks that the power he is given in this section is necessary to enable him to carry out the plan of the Bill, I would be very reluctant to put in an amendment that would do away with it.  He has mentioned that it is only in the case of a very large farmer that he intends to put this section into operation, and I would ask whether he would have any objection to stating the size of the holding or of the dairy or of the herd of cows to which the section would apply.</P>

      <P>Whatever is to be guaranteed, I would like to have it in black and white, so that it would not be possible to go outside it.  I would ask the Minister also to state what proportion of the butter sold retail by a large farmer would be regarded as bringing him within the operation of the Bill, because, in practice, only a very small proportion of the farmers' butter is sold retail.  The bulk of it would be sold either to butter factories or to butter traders, and, if that is so, it will have to pay the levy when it gets into their hands.  I cannot understand what is meant by &ldquo;butter factories manufacturing butter&rdquo; because they only purchase butter that is already manufactured by farmers.  Butter factories as a rule do nothing but blend or re-work the butter, and Senators will observe that, by a section which has already been passed, persons who only blend or re-work butter are not regarded as manufacturers.  The main point, however, that I desire to ask is whether the Minister would have any objection to placing in the Bill, the <Col N="1106" /> size of the farm or dairy or the proportion of the butter sold that he would consider as enabling him to bring farmers under the Bill?</P>

      <P>I have a considerable amount of sympathy for the class of farmer that Senator Linehan has in mind in bringing forward this amendment, but I am influenced by what the Minister has said and I think it is safer not to restrict his powers.  As I said in speaking on the Second Reading of this Bill, I am certain that practically immediately, after twelve months of complete working of this Bill, considerable modifications will have been shown to be necessary and those modifications will then be made. With regard to the point that Senator Linehan makes as to the size of a farm and the number of cows, that would be relatively an easy matter, if it stood alone, but what I have in mind is the position of the farmer in some districts who buys butter from his neighbours and who really becomes a trader of a certain class and who evades the levy.  I would not have any objection to that if I were assured that he was competent and had the equipment necessary to turn out a good marketable article, and not to produce an article which would lower the tone of that class of butter altogether. I think, on the whole, although I have sympathy with those whom Senator Linehan has in mind. that it is safer, at all events for the present, to leave it to the discretion of the Minister, who, I feel quite sure, will not exercise the powers unless it is really necessary.</P>

      <P>I think that the Minister's attitude in regard to this amendment is a perfectly, reasonable one, and I am sorry to have to disagree with Senator Linehan and Senator Miss Browne.  If there is anyone who is going to reap very definite advantages out of this measure before us, it is the farmer who manufactures his butter on the home farm and makes a sale of it.  No man at all is going to make as much out of this legislation, as that farmer.  While I can understand, in a way, Senator Linehan's fears&mdash;they are, in a way, <Col N="1107" /> rather relevant&mdash;what the farmer is really perturbed about is the price he is actually getting, but what he must have regard to is the price he would have been getting but for this legislation. We can ask what price he would have been getting were it not for this legislation.  If the farmer manufacturing butter on his home farm gets greater advantage out of this than the creameries or the ordinary factories or anyone else, I think the Minister goes a long way towards meeting the case put forward when he definitely gives an assurance that there will be no levy imposed on the ordinary farmer, except in very specific instances, which should be easily understandable by us.  We are preaching an extension of the co-operative movement, and if there are backsliders, who see an advantage in slipping away from their commitments to co-operative undertakings, I think the House should legislate and set aside such an amendment as this, which, in its way, gives them a perfect option without any penalty of getting away from their commitments. I hope the House will have nothing to do with the amendment.</P>

      <P>The case made by the Minister against this amendment is that he does not wish the suppliers of creameries to take advantage of the Bill and to become makers of butter in future.  He says that, if the amendment is inserted in the Bill, that may happen, that the farmer now supplying a creamery will be induced to keep his milk at home and make butter and will get the benefit without paying anything.  If such a case will happen, that particular butter, the very instant it is sold, will come within the Minister's net because it will be levied from the factory or from what is called the blended butter.  That particular class of butter will be caught and I do not see anything wrong in any man in these days taking advantage of every opportunity to better his condition, and I would not be against any man withdrawing from any commitments he has made, provided&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If this particular farmer has milk to sell, and if he thinks it better to make it into butter, why should the Government interfere with him?  Why not let him take advantage of the chance he will get in the home market we hear so much about?  There is nothing objectionable in this amendment.  The butter will not escape the net if it is sold on the market and I think the farmer is entitled to conduct his business in whatever manner he likes, irrespective of what the Minister may say.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Wilson may be quite right in other things but one thing he is not right in is with regard to what the farmer should do when supplying creameries.  The creamery method was adopted because it was more efficient and because it was possible for creameries to extract more butter fat from a gallon of milk than any other system, and, consequently, from the national point of view, it is much more efficient for farmers to adopt the creamery method than to depend on their own separators.  It takes over three gallons of milk for a pound of butter with an ordinary cream separator, and you will get a pound of butter from a little over two gallons of milk in a creamery.  Look at the saving there from a national point of view.  Is it right, then, to allow a farmer, who gets the advantage of the Bill, to withdraw supplies from the creameries?  The national loss will be very serious and I do not think it should be allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator MacEllin says that the loss will be greater because the farmer does not extract the butter fat.  Do we not know that when the farmer uses the skim milk produced on his land, it is fed to calves and they live, whereas, if he takes the creamery skim milk, and feeds it to calves, they die, or, at least, they have a lingering existence, and that is no national loss, <Col N="1109" /> but a national gain?  That is no argument at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Kathleen Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely disagree with what Senator MacEllin says as to the amount of butter which can be extracted.  As a practical and scientific butter maker, I do not see how he can make out that a creamery can get a pound of butter out of two gallons of milk, and that the farmers can only get a pound of butter out of three gallons of milk.  That is a most extraordinary statement.  An efficient home butter maker can get just as much butter out of so many gallons of milk as any creamery can get, and also can get just as good butter.  I am not arguing against the co-operative or creamery system, but I think that the statement made by Senator MacEllin is most extraordinary.  It is absolutely wrong.  The great advantage, to my mind, of the creameries is the making of butter of uniform quality.  But you cannot convert the whole country into a country of creameries.  You must always have a large number of farmers who will make their own butter at home.  I wish to contradict that most extraordinary statement that an efficient home farmer cannot get as much butter out of so many gallons of milk as the creamery can.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>This little discussion throws light upon what I have often suggested myself: that it is quite wrong to speak of agriculture or even of dairying as a single industry.  It is quite obvious from the discussion here to-day that even as regards butter-making there are two separate and distinct industries, and that you cannot speak of it in the terms of a single industry.  I should like to suggest to Senator Linehan that, if the Bill is desirable at all, his amendment is quite undesirable because it would cut at the very heart of the Bill.  Senator Linehan will realise that ten farmers to-day may become one farmer tomorrow by forming themselves into a limited liability company, at very little expense, and that one corporate person would be exempted from the operation of the Bill if the ingenuity of the farmers, say in the Mallow district or in a district of West Cork, or of East <Col N="1110" /> Cork were to be exercised in the direction of forming themselves into a corporate entity.</P>
      <P>Senator Wilson, who is supposed to be a supporter of this Bill, puts forward an argument that is entirely foreign to the very idea of State development of or assistance to the dairying industry, when he says that every farmer should be allowed to do what he likes with his own business, without any interference. That is a view wholly opposed to the idea of this Bill and opposed to the idea of State protection for the dairying industry.</P>

      <P>There was a little confusion evidently as to what we mean by &ldquo;manufactured butter&rdquo; as regards the different classes of butter brought into the factory.  If butter manufactured from milk or cream comes into the factuly in the form of butter it is defined to be manufactured butter.  But if it comes into the factory and merely undergoes the process of blending or re-working, we do not say that it is &ldquo;manufactured&rdquo; in this Bill.  I was asked what is the size of the farm that we had in view&mdash;whether it was a farm carrying 30 cows or 35 cows or 40 cows. We have not defined in our own minds what the size of the farm would be. We are going on the basis of what the farmer had been doing previously, and if we thought that he was taking an undue or unfair advantage of the Bill we should probably serve notice on him and have him levied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with some of the views. that Senator Wilson has expressed here.  Unfortunately we have to use a little compulsion.  Senator O'Hanlon said that if men who were members of a co-operative society were to leave the creameries and make butter of their own it would be very unfair.  It would be very unfair to allow such a thing to happen.  Unfortunately we have not in this country that high spirit of co-operation which we should have.  If we had there would be no danger of farmers leaving the co-operative creameries whether they gave them a lower price or otherwise.  Unfortunately not having got that spirit yet we have to use a little compulsion <Col N="1111" /> to make the farmers stick to their particular co-operative creameries.  Senator Wilson must see that unless the levy is paid there will be no bounty to be paid on the export of butter.  If we do not make provision for getting a large number of producers into the net and make them pay the levy, the bounty will go down on the export and consequently the price of butter internally will go down also, and the Bill would not be as effective as it otherwise might be.</P>
    <P>I think that there is something inconsistent in what Senator Miss Browne and Senator Wilson have said as regards the amount of butter that may be made from a given quantity of milk in the creamery and in the farmer's home.  If, as Senator Miss Browne suggests, the home-made butter takes as much milk from the cream as the creamery made butter, then the milk which would be left from the home-made butter would be no better for calves than the milk left from the creamery-made butter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is better, then it takes less cream from the milk.  I do not agree either that it is impossible to rear calves in the creamery districts. The best proof to the contrary is that they have been reared, and if they have been reared it is possible to rear them.</P>
      <P>There is also the danger that Senator Johnson has drawn attention to if this amendment were accepted&mdash;the danger that what might be called the corporate farmer would take milk or butter from his neighbours and would act more or less as an agent for other people.  Possibly we may get at such a man under other sections, but it would be much more difficult to get him under the other sections if this amendment were accepted.</P>

There may be some fault in the construction of the amendment for the purpose of giving effect to the intention which the Minister has expressed, and he has indicated to me a certain revised form which as I read it is likely to be satisfactory.

      <P>I spoke to the Minister in reference to this amendment, and he accepts it. It simply gives him power to deal with any fund to the credit of the miscellaneous accounts at any time, rather than that he should be compelled to wait until the end of the year.  There may be reactions in the working of this Act when it becomes an Act which will make that advisable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this amendment, as Senators will see on reading it, would be that we should not be required to wait until 31st March in order to dispose of the Miscellaneous Fund.  As I explained on the Second Reading of the Bill, the Miscellaneous Fund is an unknown quantity.  We can give a very good forecast of what the Creamery Butter Account or the Factory Butter Account will be, but we cannot forecast the miscellaneous butter account, because it is going to come from a class of people that we do not know of very well at the present time.  They are the unregistered buyers, and so on, whom we must get in as soon as the Bill is passed.  There is not a great export of this form of butter, so that at the end of the year we expect there will be a certain amount available for other purposes. I agree with Senator Dowdall that there is no necessity why we should wait until the end of the year.  If there should be a fair amount of <Col N="1116" /> money by the 1st of August or 1st of September, there is no reason why part of that money should not be transferred to another fund in order to improve the price of butter, if possible. I think the wording of the amendment is all right except that &ldquo;where&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;when&rdquo; about to advise legally would be more correct.  Senator Dowdall and myself are not lawyers, but I am sure the Senator would not have any objection to changing the word to &ldquo;where.&rdquo;  Otherwise the amendment would be all right.  The Minister has no power to dispose of the fund on his own initiative.  He makes a proposal for the disposal of the surplus on the fund and he must lay it before the Dáil.  It is not laid, like other papers, on the Table, where, if no notice is taken of it for 21 days everything is all right.  In this case he must draw the attention of the Dáil to it, and actually get its approval, so that if the Minister were inclined to apply this money to any purpose that to the Dáil did not appear to be correct he would not be allowed to do so. There is an indication there that it must be applied to the improvement of dairying.  Suggestions were made that we might apply part of it to the improvement of home-made butter on the farm.  The suggestion was also made that we might apply part of it to the factory pool, because by raising the export price of factory butter we would in effect be raising the price of farm butter that goes to the factory which is the surplus the farmer would have to sell.  If we could raise the price of the surplus butter that the farmer sold we would also raise the price of butter sold to customers, whether to retailers or direct.  If there is a possibility of improving the price of farm butter by that method there is no reason why we should not do it in August or September rather than wait until April.  I think the amendment handed in by Senator Dowdall is a wise one and should be accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a point that may be of some importance in the reading of the sub-sections of Section 42.  Sub-section (1) provides that certain moneys may be applied in accordance with regulations which may be made by the Minister for the purpose of promoting the dairying industry. The industry may be promoted in numerous ways which the Minister has hinted at.  If provided in that way under the Act this House would have something to say to the matter.  Under the section the regulations which are to define how the money shall be used for the purpose of developing the dairying industry are only to be laid before the Dáil &ldquo;the provisions of this Act relating to the laying of orders and regulations before Houses of the Oireachtas shall not apply to any regulation made under this section.&rdquo; What in effect will be a legislative act will be left entirely to the Dáil and this House will have nothing to do with it.  I think that is a matter which requires some little reconsideration. If it were intended to deal with the disposal of, or the raising of money it might be accepted but, inasmuch as the regulations which the Minister has to lay before the Dáil, in order to get the approval of the Dáil, may, in fact, concern the regulation of the industry and be more than the mere spending of money, I think this House ought to have some say, and that it should not be confined to the authority of the Dáil alone.  I think that should be given some consideration before the Report Stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals with the disposal of the surplus on the miscellaneous butter account, meaning farm butter sold either directly by the farmer or his servants, or after sale to the factory.  I think it is reasonable if there is any surplus in the fund after meeting liabilities that it should be applied to the improvement of dairying amongst the makers of farm butter.  The Minister mentioned that if the price of factory butter were increased by the addition of the bounty it would have the effect of increasing the price of farm butter. That is so.  If the Minister takes any steps to promote a scheme for encouraging dairying, I think it should be confined to the people who subscribed to this fund.  Very large sums of money are being expended in training boys and girls in dairying.  We have a dairying school in Cork and the University&mdash;a very costly institution&mdash;at which creamery managers are trained. The object of my amendment is to confine the surplus to some scheme that would be to the advantage of dairying amongst makers of farm butter.  I think that is a reasonable <Col N="1119" /> request and I hope the House will accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no intention of doing any such thing.  I had queried the matter because I did not know what the Senator wanted me to do. We had no intention of devoting any of the fund to the creamery pool, although people in the creamery industry said they were just as much entitled to part of the miscellaneous fund as the factory pool, because they held that if we raise the price of factory butter we raise the price of home consumed farm butter.  I am not much impressed by that.  There was no intention of applying any of the money to the creamery pool.  The only intention was either to improve what is strictly known as farm butter produced on the farm, and sold to the consumer as such without going <Col N="1120" /> through the factory, or improving the price of factory butter by putting some money in the factory pool.  I would like if the Senator withdrew the amendment and perhaps we would see if something could be done about it by the Report Stage.</P>
